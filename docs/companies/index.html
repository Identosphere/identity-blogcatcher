 “South Wales police have confirmed that they will not be using facial recognition technology during the South Wales derby this weekend, which will see a showdown between Cardiff City and Swansea City.” 



  



<p>Police in South Wales have backed away from the use of biometric surveillance security ahead of a major soccer event, suggesting that pushback from civil rights advocates and some football fans may have succeeded in attempting to chill police enthusiasm for facial recognition.</p>



<p>The South Wales Police had first publicly <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/south-wales-police-facial-recognition-soccer-stadium-train-station-404275/">implemented facial recognition-based surveillance</a> in 2017, ahead of an important soccer event in Cardiff. At the time, the police appeared to have been on the lookout for soccer hooligans, with 70,000 visitors expected to arrive at the stadium on the day of the match. From there, the police proceeded to a more general deployment of the biometric technology, applying facial recognition tech <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/south-wales-police-nec-facial-recognition-tech-407111/">to vehicle-mounted camera feeds</a>.</p>



<p>The law enforcement agency would go on to face <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/uk-police-face-legal-challenges-facial-recognition-506153/">a legal challenge</a> over its use of facial recognition, brought by a Cardiff resident who believed he has been unlawfully surveilled using the technology. The case was backed by Liberty, a civil rights group; and an initial victory for the police was <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/court-of-appeals-south-wales-police-use-of-automatic-facial-recognition-908121/">overturned by an appeals court</a> in 2020 which ruled that police had not been transparent enough in their use of biometric surveillance and watch lists, and that they had not taken adequate measures to prevent demographic bias in the technology’s implementation. That ruling followed <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-cardiff-soccer-fans-protest-face-based-stadium-surveillance-011309/">protests against the police’ use of the technology</a> by Cardiff City football club fans ahead of a game in the beginning of the year.</p>



<p>Now, the South Wales police have confirmed that they will not be using facial recognition technology during the South Wales derby this weekend, which will see a showdown between Cardiff City and Swansea City. A report from <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/south-wales-police-scrap-facial-21833516">WalesOnline </a>offered no reason given for the police decision.</p>



<p>While privacy advocates will likely cheer the development, it’s far from a clear indication of permanent plans to discontinue the use of facial recognition on the part of the South Wales Police. The aforementioned appeals court ruling did not assert outright that the police force must be prohibited from using the technology; and in responding to the ruling at the time, South Wales Police Chief Constable Matt Jukes called that ruling “a welcome and important step” in the development of biometric surveillance practices, adding that he was confident that it was “a judgment that we can work with.”</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/academic-study-south-wales-police-facial-recognition-512032/">an independent study</a> from Cardiff University’s Police Science Institute in 2018 concluded that the facial recognition technology could be an effective aide to more traditional methods of identifying criminal suspects, emphasizing that both approaches must be used together.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.suprema-id.com/en/">Suprema ID</a> has officially unveiled its newest biometric device, venturing into the territory of FAP 60 fingerprint capture.</p>



<p>Dubbed the ‘RealScan S60’, the device is slim and lightweight, and is designed for fingerprint enrollment. It sports IP65 dust and water resistance, a USB-C connector, and embedded AI-driven presentation attack detection.</p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, the device is compliant with the FBI FAP 60 specification. This is the category pertaining to the largest scan area covered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Appendix F PIV specifications, meaning that it supports a capture dimension of 3.2 by 3.0 inches, and can scan one to four prints.</p>



<p>Suprema ID says the RealScan S60 can capture single flat fingerprints, single roll scans, dual flats, and 10 prints. What’s more, it’s also available in the form of a module that can be integrated into another piece of hardware.</p>



<p>That having been said, in announcing the new solution, Suprema ID CEO Bogun Park highlighted the form factor of the device.</p>



<p>“The new RealScan S60 is designed to provide a great portability, convenience and high-quality fingerprint image capture in a compact and lightweight FAP 60 device,” he said. “At Suprema ID, our commitment is focused to ensure consistent performance, reliability and usability over dynamic environments. We are confident that the RealScan-S60 will meet clients’ need for a compact and lightweight FBI certified FAP 60 scanner.”</p>



<p>The RealScan S60 offers the latest illustration of Suprema’s focus on delivering a compact form factor; this also appears to have been an important goal in its development of the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-suprema-id-gets-fap-30-certification-for-new-fingerprint-scanner-609046/">BioMini Slim 3</a> optical fingerprint scanner, which was integrated into <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/suprema-ids-latest-ultra-thin-scanner-enhances-security-on-chameleon-devices-031208/">Laxton Group’s Chameleon devices</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>Suprema unveiled its new offering at this year’s Connect:ID conference, which ran from October 5 to 6 in Washington, DC.</p>

 From early ID management systems to the birth of Blockchain, learn how Shyft Network is building the most secure future for trust and identity. <p>Identity has been a contentious point for humanity ever since we evolved societies. How are we sure that someone is who they say they are? Before the modern age, there were several ways ancient civilizations did identity verification. Unfortunately, the scope and viability of those methods went out the window during the information age — and even more so during the dawn of the internet, as human interaction started to become replaced by digital connection. The internet’s identity and trust problems weren’t much of an issue when it first saw use. Most people would use phone lines to dial into bulletin board systems. Phone lines were linked to addresses, which were tied to people living in the house. If someone had enough patience, they could locate who was dialing into their BBS. However, the internet has evolved since then, to put it lightly, and its identity problems have kept pace with&nbsp;it.</p> The Story of Trust&nbsp;Online <p>As more casual users started to take advantage of the internet with Web1.0, individual data would have to be batched out. As the rise of personal experience websites came onto the scene, the back end needed to know which user data it should show to the person sitting at the screen. Developers solved this by constructing credential systems. Usernames and passwords would be stored on databases (sometimes encrypted) and were handy enough to be carried across ecosystems. Unfortunately, when you have a centralized database of usernames and passwords, the attack vectors for obtaining access to them are trivial. In the early days of login authentication, many young users tested their skills attempting to break into these Web1.0 databases, and many succeeded.</p><p>These early, clunky user-password authentication efforts evolved into ID management systems run by large corporations with the rise of Web2.0. Now, users can log in with a single click, using the API to share their login verification with whatever website requests it. This approach made it easier for developers to onboard users since it had much less friction than forcing them to sign up for a new account. Users today have several dozen accounts already on sites they might only use once. The obvious drawback of this system is that you can be banned or restricted if you go against the data holders. As an added bonus, these companies routinely sell the data they collect from users to third parties for all sorts of purposes, usually without the user being aware of it. While we’d like to think these massive corporations are secure, the sheer amount of data leaks coming from businesses like Facebook shows that this is a vain&nbsp;hope.</p> The Evolution of Blockchain Trust <p>In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin intending to develop a trustless ecosystem for financial transactions. In essence, the Bitcoin blockchain is a conversation between two parties. The recipient asks, “Do you have the BTC I requested?” and the sender replies with a yes or a no, backed up by the blockchain’s record of their currently accessible funds. Bitcoin has its own problems, but the principle of a trustless network is sound, as has been evidenced by the widespread adoption of the world’s first cryptocurrency. Shyft Network seeks to take what Bitcoin developed and evolve it to the next level. But how do we intend to do&nbsp;that?</p> Shyft Into High&nbsp;Gear <p>A blockchain can bring about tangible change in the world. Shyft Network is doing so by providing users and third parties with a single decentralized method of verifying credentials. The Shyft ecosystem involves several stakeholders, each with their part to&nbsp;play.</p><p>Ø The Data Owners and Data Holders: Data owners are individuals or organizations that credentials refer to. They may or may not be trusted entities, but they can interact with Trust Anchors (Data Holders) to verify their identity or the validity of the data. In fact, any data can be contextualized via attestations and&nbsp;TAs.</p><p>Ø Trust Anchors (Attestors): These are trusted entities that collect data from issuers and holders. They verify the identities of these individuals or organizations and hold the data off-chain. If the data owner would like to pass that data to a third party, they wouldn’t need to pay a fee for transferring that validated data. However, third-parties, such as aggregators could potentially pay for that data before the data-owner’s consent.</p><p>Ø Data Consumers: These entities provide pre-approved app services which utilize trusted data. They’re responsible for requesting data from holders, reviewing attestations, and determining whether that data is&nbsp;usable.</p><p>Ø Validators (Nodes): Nodes perform much of the same work as on other blockchains — they validate the transactions and add them to the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Ø Consent Framework: Today’s users have become used to companies hiding privacy data inside their setting’s menus. Shyft Network operates on a strict opt-in system that allows users to control who gets their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Ø Proof of Individual: How do you know that the sender probably has what they’re offering? With the Shyft Network, it’s a simple matter of verifying the blockchain address. With all data pertaining to an individual linked to this address, it’s impossible to spoof identities.</p> Reliability and Dependability <p>The Shyft Network aims to provide a method for users to share data with the companies they see fit. As an opt-in system, the data holder can deal with each request for their data individually. However, the Shyft Network offers more than just a method of verifying users. Some of the most current use cases have demonstrated the flexibility of the platform.</p><p>Ø Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule Compliance: The FATF recently issued crypto-specific guidance recommending jurisdictions to require Virtual Asset Service Providers (or VASPs), (such as cryptocurrency exchanges) to provide sender and recipient data on request. Yet, at current, there exists no way to comply with the FATF guidance. By partnering with some of the world’s most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges, like Binance and Tether, the Shyft Network has helped design and implement a solution to this&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Ø Compliant Decentralized Finance: De-Fi has had regulators up in arms, trying to lock down much of the innovation within the space. Large liquidity providers, for example, cannot interact with the De-Fi space because of a lack of clarity from regulators’ perspectives. Shyft Network is a decentralized solution that considers these outdated or obsolete perspectives that regulators may have and combines it with a way for liquidity providers to verify themselves in a way that complies with the regulations.</p><p>Ø Government Digital Identity: Identity fraud is a real danger, but with a trustless verification system like Shyft, a seamless, single verification is all that any citizen or organization within a country needs. Through Shyft, governments have a platform to create Know-Your-Customer (KYC) systems that are seamless to interact with and provide easy verification for all users. With this seamless verification comes security, interoperability, and transparency. Data collected would be readily available to regulators and auditors within the confines of privacy&nbsp;rules.</p><p>All of these use cases only scratch the surface of what Shyft is capable of, especially as we roll out open-sourcing of <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, our latest and great DeFi compliance framework and smart-contract platform for VASPs to enable travel rule compliance. While we already have an idea of what can be done with our growing infrastructure, we’re excited to see how the evolution of the blockchain will bring about new and innovative approaches to personal verification within cyberspace. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

<p>Identity verification and authentication company Onfido has announced that it has been honored at the 2021 CyberSecurity Breakthrough Awards for its work in fraud prevention and remote identity verification.</p>



  



<p>The company won the “Fraud Prevention Innovation of the Year” award in recognition for its work in utilizing artificial intelligence and biometrics for remote verification to help authenticate individuals looking to gain access to various digital services.</p>



<p>The Cybersecurity Breakthrough Awards were established to honor and recognize excellence, innovation, and hard work in a variety of information security categories including cloud security, threat detection, risk management, fraud prevention, mobile security, and email security.</p>



<p>The importance of remote authentication has been highlighted in recent years, particularly in the last several months due in part to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a dramatic rise in online traffic and a proportionate growth in cybercrimes, with identity fraud at the forefront.</p>



<p>“Identity fraud accounted for $43 billion in 2020 as COVID caused businesses to accelerate their digital transformation plans, creating more opportunities for fraudsters,” said Albert Roux, Vice President of Product Management for Fraud at Onfido. “We’re excited to see that our AI-based approach to fraud prevention has been recognized as a key tool in the fight against fraud, ensuring businesses can continue to deliver trust and security at scale without compromising on user experience.”</p>



<p>The announcement of this latest award comes on the heels of Onfido finding itself once again on CB Insight’s annual <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-cb-insights-fintech-250-list-fourth-straight-year-710072/">Fintech 250 list</a>, its fourth straight year for that particular honor.</p>



<p>In addition to these citations, just last month online <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-provides-remote-onboarding-expanding-bux-investment-platform-090301/">investment platform BUX </a>announced that it would be growing an existing relationship with Onfido by integrating the company’s selfie-based onboarding technology, providing a user-friendly onboarding tool which should allow it to scale more quickly in the future.</p>

The company will use the money to modify its <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/loginid-promotes-fido-authentication-with-release-new-sdks-062904/">authentication APIs and SDKs</a> for use with the Algorand blockchain platform.</p>



  



<p>The Algorand platform is an open blockchain ecosystem that is designed for the general public. Its creators are hoping to make the blockchain more accessible, and to make it easier for people to take advantage of the transaction guarantees that are possible with the technology.</p>



<p>With that in mind, Algorand is backing LoginID in an effort to provide users with a simpler, one-touch authentication process. The solution would allow people to verify their identities with the biometric sensors available on their smartphone, thereby providing all parties with greater assurances about those involved with a transaction. The technology could be used to confirm a transaction, and to generate secure digital signatures that are linked to a biometric.</p>



<p>Once LoginID’s research is completed, developers would be able to integrate the finished APIs and SDKs into their own customer-facing apps. End users, meanwhile, would not need to install any plugins to enjoy a passwordless (and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido2-certified-loginid-announces-several-new-partnerships-071402/">FIDO-certified</a>) authentication process.</p>



<p>Algorand CEO Sean Lee noted that there are more than 4 billion devices in circulation that support the FIDO protocol, creating a potentially massive user base for the LoginID solution. The Algorand blockchain currently has 13 million accounts and processes upwards of 1 million transactions on a daily basis.</p>



<p>“LoginID will help lower friction, and make blockchain technology easier to interact when developers integrate our solution,” said LoginID Co-Founder and CRO&nbsp;Jim Brown. “We have recently seen attacks on standard forms of authentication such as SMS. Our solution will give Algorand developers the tools to create frictionless, secure interactions for their customers.”</p>



<p>Algorand and LoginID did not disclose the size of the final grant. The money will supplement the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/loginid-raises-6-million-in-seed-funding-703151/">$6 million that LoginID raised in seed funding</a>, and the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/loginid-gets-investment-backing-visa-76202102/">Visa investment</a> that was intended to support the development of an authentication solution for the payments industry.</p>

				 <p>A distributed ledger is a database that has copies distributed across a network of servers (nodes), all of which are updated simultaneously. A network like this is the foundation of decentralized identity, a way of generating robust trust and collaboration free of the security risks of centralized databases. We call the companies and organizations that support an Indicio Network node on a server that is under their control “Node Operators.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently we caught up with Paul Ashley, CTO and Co-CEO of Anonyome Labs, a current Node Operator of Indicio, to discuss their current projects, some goals for the future, and where they think decentralized identity is heading.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Tell us about Anonyome: how did it start, where did it start, and who makes up your team?</p>
<p>The goal of Anonyome Labs is to shift the control of personal information back to normal users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything we do is recorded, collected, mined, profiled, stored, targeted and sold. The balance of power has shifted to the cabal of tech giants and data miners who overtly or covertly monitor and control what is seen, clicked, and cared about. At Anonyome Labs we build the tools that shift control of personal and private information from the big data miners back to the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anonyome Labs was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Woodside California, with teams in Salt Lake City, Utah and Gold Coast, Australia. Anonyome Labs has about 70 employees –&nbsp; the teams have deep enterprise and consumer expertise across identity, cyber security, authentication, authorization, privacy and cryptography – with hundreds of granted patents. </p>
<p>What are some of the products/services (Self Sovereign Identity or not) that you currently offer? Who are your target customers? What sets you apart from the competition?</p>
<p>Anonyome Labs created the Sudo Platform to provide enterprise software developers with capabilities to add persona (Sudo) based identity, privacy and cyber safety features to their applications. The Sudo Platform provides to these enterprise software developers mobile and web SDKs, sample apps, documentation and UI Kits to accelerate their application development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the capabilities of the Sudo Platform is attached to a persona. This includes masked email and masked credit cards, private telephony, private and compartmentalized browsing (with ad/tracker blocker and site reputation), VPN, password management, decentralized identity and more.</p>
<p>In addition, Anonyome Labs created the MySudo mobile application to put the same identity, privacy, and cyber security capabilities into the hands of normal users for their interactions with the online and offline world.&nbsp; Each user is able to create a number of personas (Sudos) and with each of them have access to various Sudo Platform capabilities.</p>
<p>What Self Sovereign Identity /Decentralized Identity products/services are on your roadmap?</p>
<p>A key offering of the Sudo Platform is Decentralized Identity based services.&nbsp; This includes both client (Edge Agent) and server (Cloud Agent) offerings.&nbsp; This allows the enterprise to become a Decentralized Identity Verifiable Credential Issuer and/or Validator. And it allows the enterprise’s users to take part in a decentralized identity ecosystem – by giving them a mobile wallet/agent to manage decentralized identities, connections and verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>What motivated your work in Decentralized Identity? Why did you become a node operator? What appeals to you in this field?</p>
<p>We believe that Decentralized Identity is the most important innovation in identity to help normal users have control over their personal information as they interact with the online world.&nbsp; Given Anonyome’s focus on privacy and cyber safety,&nbsp; it was a natural extension to our Sudo Platform to add Decentralized Identity services. Anonyome Labs became a founding steward of the Indicio decentralized identity network in anticipation of using that network for our customer’s enterprise applications.</p>
<p>Where do you see the future of Self Sovereign Identity/Decentralized Identity?</p>
<p>It is our belief that decentralized identity will become the core foundational technology of future privacy and cyber safety capabilities.&nbsp; Over time we will transition from the current privacy invasive technologies, to new systems founded on decentralized identity.</p>

<p>This is a guest post by Wladimir Alvarez, Senior Sales Director – Latin America, <a href="https://campaigns.hidglobal.com/bankingtransformation">HID Global</a></p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-hid-ebook-details-biometric-banking-benefits-710122/"></a> 



<p>The Latin American financial services market is one of dynamism and danger. The region boasts a population of 650 million, and its largest economies – Brazil and Mexico – boast GDPs well over a trillion dollars each. McKinsey has identified Latin America as the<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/lessons-from-leaders-in-latin-americas-retail-banking-market"> global growth leader</a> in banking, and that trend was accelerated after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted the creation of<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-covid-19-silver-lining-in-latin-america-millions-of-new-bank-accounts-11624541884"> tens of millions of new online bank accounts</a>.</p>



<p>But that growth and excitement also carries with it the threat of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has been estimated that as much as 20 percent of new accounts created in the region are fraudulent, and the world’s highest Card-Not-Present fraud rates are found in Mexico and Brazil. Summarizing findings by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Organization of American States, Fortune Business Insights reports that out of 32 countries that were assessed, half “do not have adequate response capacity in times of fraud incidence,” and “more broadly, rapid digitization across the region is spurring growing demand for advanced fraud detection solutions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s clear then that in a booming financial services market, those financial services providers that take the threat of fraud seriously and find ways to address it are likely to outperform the rest, especially as customers become increasingly aware of the risks of fraud and seek out trustworthy institutions with which to do business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already, consumers are starting to show a more robust understanding of the need for post-password and PIN security mechanisms, with a recent<a href="https://www.experian.com/decision-analytics/global-fraud-report"> Experian report</a> indicating that a strong majority (74 percent) prefer biometric authentication as a security method.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there are readily available biometric security solutions that can cover every touchpoint of the customer banking journey – not just online banking through a web portal or mobile app, but at the bank branch and the ATM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As detailed in HID Global’s eBook, <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/sites/default/files/resource_files/eat-better-banking-experiences-strong-authentication-face-biometrics-eb-en.pdf">Better Banking Experiences Start With Strong Authentication and Face Biometrics</a>, sophisticated biometric technologies, such as face and fingerprints, can be used to verify customers through every channel – frictionlessly and seamlessly. Choosing the right biometric solutions can dramatically improve the customer experience while heightening security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biometrics multi-factor authentication (MFA) – including contactless face recognition and one-touch fingerprint authorization – offer a win-win for Latin American banks and their customers as the region’s financial services sector continues to progress through explosive growth and digital transformation.</p>

<p>European Parliament is pushing to ban several kinds of AI systems that could have a negative impact on the public. The organization expressed particular concerns about private facial recognition databases, and about the public surveillance systems used by law enforcement.</p>



  



<p>With that in mind, Parliament has <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20210930IPR13925/use-of-artificial-intelligence-by-the-police-meps-oppose-mass-surveillance">passed a new resolution</a> that calls for strong legal safeguards for the use of AI systems. Most notably, the resolution states that decision-making should never be fully entrusted to an AI system, and that a human operator should always be responsible for making the final choice. The resolution then goes on to argue that people should have access to some kind of restitution if they have been wronged.</p>



<p>According to Parliament, such measures are necessary to prevent discrimination, and to minimize the impact of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-nist-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-algorithms-122401/">biased algorithms</a>. That’s especially true in law enforcement and border operations, where biased facial recognition algorithms can lead to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/false-arrest-highlights-issues-racial-bias-facial-recognition-062507/">false arrests</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-uk-home-office-deployed-face-recognition-platform-known-racial-biases-101107/">other adverse outcomes</a> for people in marginalized communities. Parliament also advocates for a basic right to privacy, and opposes mass surveillance systems that track people’s movements.</p>



<p>In that regard, the resolution would severely limit the scope of the surveillance state. Parliament is hoping to bar any company looking to create its own private facial recognition database, and to end the police use of automated facial recognition systems in public spaces. However, Parliament acknowledged that facial recognition can help with certain kinds of investigations, and would still allow the police to use it to monitor a criminal suspect.</p>



<p>The private ban would apply to companies like Clearview AI, which has a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-quietly-sells-face-recognition-tech-law-enforcement-agencies-012008/">database of more than 3 billion images</a>. The police, meanwhile, would not be allowed to use any <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/council-europe-asks-countries-prohibit-face-based-profiling-technology-012904/">profiling algorithms</a> that try to predict criminal behavior based on past observations, or to deploy any <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/report-huawei-megvii-designed-facial-recognition-system-target-uighur-minorities-121110/">social scoring systems</a> that try to assign trustworthiness ratings to people with different types of personalities.</p>



<p>Parliament passed the resolution with a 377-member majority, with 248 members opposed, and 62 abstaining from the vote. The legislative body also came out against the use of remote identity verification tools like biometric e-gates at international borders, and encouraged the European Commission to take legal action against states that do not adhere to AI regulations.</p>



<p>The European Commission has been <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/eu-once-again-considers-facial-recognition-ban-070301/">considering a facial recognition ban</a> for the past several years, and published a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/european-commission-drafts-restrictions-on-ai-biometrics/">draft of a new AI bill in April</a>. Parliament has already stated that that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/european-parliament-asks-european-commission-draft-clearer-ai-laws-092301/">draft is not strict enough</a>, and has now doubled down on that stance with this latest resolution. The&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/european-watchdogs-push-stricter-facial-recognition-ban-062103/">European Data Protection Board</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/european-data-protection-supervisor-calls-full-facial-recognition-ban-042705/">European Data Protection Supervisor</a> have similarly called for stronger facial recognition regulations.</p>

<p>Behavioral biometrics expert BioCatch has announced the launch of a new account opening solution to help protect people from financial fraud.</p>



  



<p>Age Analysis is designed particularly for elderly users, who can be among the most targeted age groups by cybercriminals who see them as particularly vulnerable due to a perceived lower average level of digital and online experience, accumulated life savings, and loneliness or isolation.</p>



<p>Age Analysis works by<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biocatch-explains-how-spot-fraudsters-before-they-commit-crime-041907/"> using behavioral biometrics</a> to monitor the user’s activity, and uses the data it collects to determine their behavioral age, which it then compares against their actual declared age.</p>



<p>BioCatch’s Age Analysis solution looks to protect customers against identity fraud threats that focus on account origination for credit cards. According to the <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/identity-theft-credit-card-fraud-statistics/">Federal Trade Commission</a>, in 2020, an estimated 1.4 million reports of identity theft cost consumers a total of almost $3.3 billion in the United States alone.</p>



<p>“We developed Age Analysis with enhancing customer protection and user experience as our guiding principles,” said BioCatch COO, Gadi Mazor. “At BioCatch, we work closely with our clients to develop the most forward-thinking behavioral solutions to solve the ever-evolving challenges in combating fraud. Age Analysis empowers financial institutions with the behavioral verification protections most needed to address the growing threat of application fraud.”</p>



<p>This announcement comes at a time when, due to the ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, instances of cybercrimes — and fraud in general —have been rising dramatically along with a rapid rise in online traffic.</p>



<p>As a response to this growing problem, BioCatch has repeatedly espoused the<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biocatch-pushes-behavioral-biometrics-mobile-banking-channels-012804/"> benefits of behavioral biometrics</a> in protecting consumers, as opposed to the traditional PIN/password modality which is seen by many as outdated and a point of attack for many fraudsters.</p>



<p>In recognition of its continued growth, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biocatch-named-inc-5000-list-fastest-growing-us-companies-081901/">BioCatch was named</a> to the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest growing companies in the U.S. this past August.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Every week there seems to be mention of a new Trust Framework. People are now trying to monetize them.</p>
<p>But to understand trust frameworks, let’s first understand what constitutes trust. We must define concepts such as levels of assurances and what defines technical vs human trust?</p>
<p>Once this is better understood, the conversation about where a particular organization fits into a digital identity ecosystem is simpler. And note, in user-centric digital identity (or SSI), organizations no longer need to be at the centre of the universe.</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 Levels of Assurance (LOA): an introduction to LOAs as they relate to Digital Identity and why they’re an important part of the recipe in achieving digital trust. Tim and Darrell give us some practical examples of LOAs. 
 The Concept of Trust: how do we define trust at a high-level and how do we differentiate between technical and human trust? How can we build trust with credential issuers but also with credential holders? 
 The World of Trust Frameworks: what are trust frameworks and what are different types of frameworks being deployed in both the public and private sectors? How are organizations trying to monetize trust frameworks? What’s going right, and what’s going wrong with the way trust frameworks are being implemented? 
 The Importance of Open Source for Trust Creation: why is open source important for achieving digital sovereignty? Is open source the only way to improve transparency, flexibility and accountability?

<p>The&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;recently did a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/state-of-privacy-laws-in-us/">deep dive</a>&nbsp;into the United States’ lack of a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">national data privacy law</a>&nbsp;and why it matters, and we want to drill down on some key points here.</p>



<p>The article describes the&nbsp;four basic areas&nbsp;of users’ data privacy that should be protected as a&nbsp;minimum, and calls these areas the “floor” of any future national privacy law onto which other protections could be built over time. It shows you the direction in which privacy advocates are heading.</p>



 Four basic areas make up the privacy law “floor”: 



<p></p>



  Data collection and sharing rights&nbsp;– This is the user’s fundamental right to clearly see what&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a> companies collect, share and sell about them; their right to ask a company to delete any personal data they don’t want them to have; and their right to demand a company stop sharing their personal data.&nbsp;  Opt-in consent&nbsp;– This is where a company, not the user, does the heavy lifting on privacy, by asking the user whether they may collect, share or sell their data to third parties. Opting out takes the user a lot of time and effort; opting in puts that effort on the company. But opt-in isn’t easy to implement, which is why global opt-out functions like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22252935/global-privacy-control-personal-data-tracking-ccpa-cpra-gdpr-duckduckgo">Global Privacy Control</a>&nbsp;are a popular stopgap, even&nbsp;<a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/californias-attorney-general-backs-call-for-global-privacy-control-adoption-with-fresh-enforcement-letters-to-companies/">seeming acceptable</a>&nbsp;under the&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act</a>. The GPC and other tools like it allow opt out at the browser or device level, not the site level.&nbsp;  Data minimization&nbsp;– This protection would pare back the data a company can collect to only the basics required for them to deliver their product or service.&nbsp;  Non-discrimination and no data-use discrimination&nbsp;– The final plank in the basic data privacy “floor” would protect users from being discriminated against for exercising their right to privacy. This means users couldn’t be charged more for opting out (or not opting in) and couldn’t be offered incentives such as discounts and coupons for opting in, for example. This requirement would also prevent companies from discriminating against users based on personal characteristics, such as religion, race or gender.&nbsp;  



 In addition to this four-plank “floor”, the privacy experts interviewed for the&nbsp;NYT&nbsp;article would like to see:&nbsp; 



<p></p>



  a more comprehensive&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>&nbsp;notification law, to standardize who gets notified and some common standards for doing so  a private right of action or the right of a person to sue a company that violates their privacy  strong, well-funded enforcement agencies and resources&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.ics.ie/news/what-is-privacy-by-design-a-default">privacy by default&nbsp;</a>so apps come with the strictest built-in privacy without the user having to do anything unless they want to opt-in to certain settings.  



<p>Anonyome Labs agrees with the four-plank data privacy law “floor” and the regulatory extras proposed by the privacy community in this article. We also recognize that a national privacy law and a uniform approach to these requirements may still be a long way off, which is why we created our consumer privacy app&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and the privacy and cybersecurity capabilities in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;that help enterprises rapidly develop and deploy branded privacy and cybersecurity solutions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bio-key.com/">BIO-key</a> is hitting another stop on the October convention circuit. The company put in an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-brings-biometric-hardware-software-connectid-100106/">appearance at Connect:ID</a> on October 5-6, and has now moved on to the National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO).</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nascio.org/conferences-events/2021-annual-conference/">2021 NASCIO Conference</a> got started this week, running from October 10-13 in Seattle. The event gives state-level security officials a chance to see some of the latest cybersecurity products, and to learn about the urgent threats that public organizations face in the current digital environment. Guests can also network with private developers and other public officials to find solutions that will help prevent <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/forgerock-breaches-involving-passwords-shot-up-450-percent-061401/">data breaches</a> and fend off cyberattacks.</p>



<p>BIO-key itself is a Corporate Member of NASCIO, and is attending as a bronze sponsor of the 2021 event. The NASCIO was set up to promote best practices for information management and cybersecurity in the government sector, and has listed identity and access management and risk management as some of its top priorities for the year. In that regard, BIO-key is showcasing its extensive portfolio of identity solutions, which includes its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-announces-official-launch-portalguard-idaas-113008/">PortalGuard Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) platform</a>. PortalGuard offers support for 16 different authentication factors, and can enable <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-extends-portalguard-coverage-with-new-sso-concierge-062306/">Single Sign-On</a> and multi-factor authentication utilities.</p>



<p>“Cybersecurity and IAM challenges are widespread across state agencies, which are historically under-staffed and often lacking in cybersecurity expertise and technical support,” said BIO-key Product VP Kimberly Johnson. “We look forward to connecting with state CIOs and their teams to share best practices and discuss flexible and affordable solutions to their unique challenges.”</p>



<p>According to BIO-key, state agencies should be especially worried about ransomware, phishing attacks, and compromised business email accounts. The company also brought PortalGuard to the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-brings-portalguard-national-association-counties-conference-070808/">National Association of Counties Conference</a> in Maryland back in July.</p>

  <p>Hi, I’m edunham, and I’m an infra person. Our buzzwords include DevOps, Cloud Operations, and Site Reliability Engineering, though if you ask any two of us about the difference between those terms, you’ll get at least three answers. Whatever name it’s wearing, doing ops well requires not only the “how” of changing systems, but also the “why” of making the right changes. Although I’ve always loved helping spread the information that my colleagues need in order to build the systems that work best for them, I’ve chickened out of taking the leap into pure advocacy many times, before finally diving into it here at Okta!</p>

<p></p>

<p>I got my start in open source and the tech industry as a student software developer and sysadmin at the <a href="https://osuosl.org/">OSU Open Source Lab</a>. The OSL gives students hands-on expertise with skills essential to those careers, and there weren’t enough of us to satisfy all the companies who wanted to hire us as interns! To help address this problem, I created the first iteration of our <a href="http://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org/">DevOps Bootcamp</a> training program. I was amazed by how good it felt to take information I was lucky enough to have special access to and share it with others who found it useful. When looking at where to steer my career after university, I considered building on my growing resume of talks to pursue evangelism roles, but it wasn’t time yet. I wanted to go out and apply my skills at scale, rather than just talking about them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As ops for the Rust and Servo teams at <a href="https://research.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, I was again able to play the positive-sum game of sharing the most interesting and useful insights I learned from my unique access to fantastic engineers. But as the sysadmin and speaker roads diverged in that forest of mercurial trees, I stuck with the ops route.</p>

<p>Missing the conference circuit as growing responsibilities meant less time for talks, I started working on a transition toward advocacy in early 2020. Faced with a choice between making the switch then or building on my ops skills for a while longer, the engineer in me won out. Switching fields, into a field that was frantically reinventing itself at the time, was just too many simultaneous changes to roll out to prod without any staging environment  or CI available.</p>

<p>Okta’s developer advocacy team is in the right place at the right time for me. I get to use <a href="https://edunham.net/pages/talks.html">my background</a> to help useful information flow out of the company to our community, as well as bringing the community’s observations and insights back to contribute to internal decision-making. Our product has made my life better as an engineer whenever I’ve worked with it, increasing my knowledge about how to do security well.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I’ve been working remotely since 2018, and I put the time that I would otherwise spend commuting into gardening and an assortment of maker projects, which I sometimes mention on <a href="https://edunham.net/">my blog</a>. I’m a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical responder with my local fire department, and I play tuba and sousaphone poorly but enthusiastically on the now-rare occasions when we can get enough people together to make some music.</p>

<p>Millennials và Gen Z đã luôn là đối tượng khách hàng trung tâm mà Fintech xoay quanh để phát triển. Song, đặt tại bối cảnh của Việt Nam, hai thế hệ này mang vai trò mạnh mẽ hơn cả, đòi hỏi các Fintech startup và cả các doanh nghiệp tài chính truyền thống liên tục thích nghi để đáp ứng các nhu cầu của họ. Bài viết này để cập đến tầm quan trọng của gen Z &amp; Millennials đối với Fintech tại Việt Nam, lối suy nghĩ về tài chính của họ, cũng như đưa ra các chiến lược cho doanh nghiệp xây dựng lòng trung thành từ hai nhóm khách hàng này.</p>



 GenZ và Millennials trong bối cảnh Việt Nam 



<p>Gen Z và Millennials lần lượt là các thế hệ sinh trong khoảng năm 1997 đến 2012 (gen Z) và 1981 đến 1996 (Millennials)[1]. Với độ tuổi từ 9-40 (năm 2021), họ sẽ sớm chiếm phần lớn lực lượng lao động, mang trong mình sự khác biệt đột phá nhờ sinh ra và lớn lên trong thời đại số hóa. Nhờ chất lượng và năng suất lao động vượt trội, cũng như điều kiện kinh tế thuận lợi, gen Z và Millennials cũng được dự đoán sẽ có mức thu nhập cao hơn và trở thành những người tiêu dùng cực kỳ tiềm năng.</p>



<p>Việt Nam, với nhiều tiềm năng về thị trường và nguồn lực, đang trong đà phát triển Fintech mạnh mẽ, thu hút 36% vốn đầu tư của khu vực Đông Nam Á năm 2019, chỉ sau Singapore, theo báo cáo của PWC[2]. Song, Việt Nam vẫn là một đất nước phụ thuộc nhiều vào tiền mặt và có nhiều người chưa có tài khoản ngân hàng (69%, theo Merchant Machine UK, 2021[3]), nên vẫn còn nhiều thị trường cho Fintech khai phá. Với bối cảnh thị trường đó, giới trẻ tại Việt Nam mang vai trò định hình mạnh mẽ hơn cả cho thị trường dịch vụ tài chính, so với các thị trường fintech đang dần bão hòa tại các nước đang phát triển.</p>



 Những thế hệ có lối đi riêng trong hành trình tìm kiếm tự do tài chính 



<p>Dù có nhiều sự khác biệt nhất định giữa gen Z và Millennials, họ vẫn có nhiều điểm tương đồng nhất định mà doanh nghiệp có Gen Z và Millennials tại Việt Nam là một thế hệ đặc biệt. Họ chứng kiến một Việt Nam “chuyển mình” nhanh chóng, từ thời kỳ bao cấp đến công cuộc Đổi Mới và nền kinh tế năng động, với tăng trưởng GDP hằng năm lên đến 7%. Và ở hiện tại, họ đang chứng kiến những sự biến động của Việt Nam trước đại dịch. Những chuyển biến đó ít nhiều ảnh hưởng đến tâm lý của Gen Z và Millennials.</p>







<p>Lớn lên trong một Việt Nam đầy biến động, Gen Z và Millennials có động lực tìm cho mình sự an toàn về mặt tài chính. Nhờ có mạng internet, họ được tiếp cận nguồn thông tin phong phú, và mở ra đa dạng hơn những cách kiếm thêm thu nhập bên cạnh những công việc “9 to 5” – những công việc truyền thống 9 giờ một ngày vốn quen thuộc với các thế hệ trước. Ngoài ra, đây cũng là thế hệ quan tâm nhiều hơn về đầu tư như cổ phiếu, bất động sản, tiền ảo (cryptocurrency),… tạo cơ hội cho Fintech bùng nổ.</p>



<p>Sự thay đổi quá nhanh chóng trong bối cảnh kinh tế xã hội cũng góp phần làm tăng lên khoảng cách thế hệ giữa Gen Z, Millennials và các thế hệ trước. Các phương thức kiếm thu nhập mới của họ thường liên quan đến không gian internet và rất khó để ghi lại theo các phương thức truyền thống. Đây cũng là một rào cản lớn khi hai thế hệ này muốn tham gia các dịch vụ tài chính truyền thống để đầu tư cho những nhu cầu của mình.</p>



<p>Chân dung khách hàng của các doanh nghiệp đã trở nên rất khác. Tư duy truyền thống đã không còn áp dụng được cho Gen Z và Millennials.</p>



 Cách nào để Fintech xây dựng niềm tin và lòng trung thành trong một thế giới đầy biến động 



<p>Cũng vì là thế hệ sống trong thời đại của thông tin mà gen Z và Millennials cũng là các khách hàng khó giữ chân. Theo Kasasa, 83% Millennials thừa nhận họ sẵn sàng đổi dịch vụ ngân hàng hiện tại để đổi lại các lợi ích cung cấp bởi các ngân hàng khác[4]. Là thế hệ sinh ra trong thời đại công nghệ, với khoảng thời gian tập trung ngày càng ngắn, gen Z và Millennials ngày càng trông đợi sự tiện lợi và dễ dàng trong các hoạt động hằng ngày, bao gồm cả hoạt động tài chính, vốn vẫn có nhiều thủ tục nhiêu khê.</p>



<p>Từ gamification (game hóa) đến liên tục tạo nhiều chương trình ưu đãi hấp dẫn, mỗi doanh nghiệp có một chiến lược riêng để giữ chân khách hàng gen Z &amp; Millennials. Những xu hướng nhìn chung có thể thấy như sau:</p>



 Trải nghiệm liền mạch, dễ dàng 



<p>Liên tục cải tiến UI/UX là một điều kiện cần của dịch vụ tài chính thời đại số. Khách hàng Gen Z và Millennials cần những dịch vụ tài chính an toàn, tiện lợi để phục vụ cho nhu cầu của họ. <a href="https://credify.one/vi/nen-tang-servicex/">serviceX </a>giúp kết nối các sản phẩm tài chính đến khách hàng khi họ thanh toán cho các dịch vụ đời sống, với thao tác đăng nhập dễ dàng thông qua Open ID Connect.</p>







 Tạo giá trị bền vững 



<p>Ngoài những mối quan tâm về các “hot trend” (xu hướng), gen Z và Millennials còn quan tâm sâu sắc đến việc tạo giá trị bền vững cho cộng đồng. Vì thế, để tạo sự gắn kết với khách hàng trẻ, các doanh nghiệp dịch vụ tài chính cần quan tâm đến những vấn đề như: tài chính toàn diện, giảm nghèo đói và bất bình đẳng, công bằng xã hội,…</p>



 Tận dụng dữ liệu lớn (big data) 



<p>Khi các hoạt động hằng ngày của gen Z và Millennials diễn ra nhiều hơn trên không gian mạng, doanh nghiệp cần có những cách tiếp cận mới để hiểu khách hàng của mình. Thành công trong việc hiểu được hồ sơ kỹ thuật số (digital identity) và tận dụng những insight từ dữ liệu lớn sẽ giúp doanh nghiệp có cái nhìn sâu sắc hơn về khách hàng của mình, từ đó dễ dàng có chiến lược chinh phục khách hàng hiệu quả.</p>



 Minh bạch trong quản lý 



<p>Theo khảo sát của Salesforce, chỉ 55% Millennials và 44% Gen Z cảm thấy thoải mái với cách các công ty đang sử dụng thông tin của họ[5], phần nào phản ánh sự thiếu tin tưởng của họ với các công ty, đặc biệt là các công ty Fintech với nhiều dữ liệu nhạy cảm như số tài khoản ngân hàng, thông tin giao dịch,… Thực trạng này đòi hỏi các công ty Fintech cần minh bạch hơn trong việc lưu trữ và quản lý thông tin của người dùng, cũng như tăng cường các biện pháp bảo mật thông tin.&nbsp;</p>



 Đa dạng hóa các sản phẩm dịch vụ 



<p>Các startup Fintech nổi bật với nhiều giải pháp đột phá, nhưng đồng thời bị giới hạn trong số lượng sản phẩm có thể cung cấp cho người dùng. Ngược lại, các tổ chức tài chính truyền thống có đa dạng sản phẩm nhưng lại thiếu tính đột phá để thu hút các khách hàng gen Z và Millennials. serviceX có thể giúp cả hai nhóm doanh nghiệp này kết nối với hệ sinh thái đối tác của Credify, giúp họ tiết kiệm nguồn lực và tập trung vào việc phát triển sản phẩm, đồng thời có thể sáng tạo các giải pháp mới dựa trên hồ sơ của khách hàng trên các nền tảng khác nhau.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fingerprints.com/">Fingerprint Cards</a> is celebrating another win in the PC space, announcing that one of its fingerprint sensor solutions has been integrated into the Honor MagicBook V14.</p>



<p>The fingerprint sensor is embedded in the notebook’s power button, enabling biometric authentication of a registered user at the moment the user turns on the device. In promoting its new notebook, Honor emphasized the fingerprint sensor’s speed, saying it could enable device unlock in 0.7 seconds.</p>



<p>For FPC, the integration represents the latest important win for the company in a key area of focus. While Fingerprint Cards made its name in the mobile biometrics space and remains a leading provider of fingerprint sensors for smartphone devices, in recent years the company has sought to expand its reach into new areas including PCs as well as biometric payment cards.</p>



<p>Commenting in a statement, Fingerprints VP Ted Hansson said the Honor integration “demonstrates the positive trend in demand for biometric authentication in consumer and enterprise PCs,” and indicated that the FPC team expects this trend to continue.</p>



<p>“Microsoft’s recent decision to allow all their users to completely remove the password from their accounts, in favor of using biometric authentication and authenticator apps, will most likely further accelerate this trend,” he said. “Fingerprints is poised for continued growth in this segment, providing the perfect way to add convenient and secure authentication to PCs.”</p>



<p>FPC also saw its fingerprint biometrics technology integrated into <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-dell-laptops-feature-fpc-biometric-tech-78202103/">Dell’s Latitude 5000 and Latitude 7000 laptops earlier this year.</a> As for Honor, the Chinese brand has worked with Fingerprints before, having integrated the latter’s sensors into mobile devices including 2019’s <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fpc-places-low-cost-sensor-honor-huawei-phones-0819-2/">Honor 20 Lite</a>.</p>



<p>In announcing the Honor MagicBook V14 integration, FPC predicted that the share of PCs with fingerprint sensors “is expected to increase significantly from today’s relatively low levels,” adding that Fingerprints has seen design wins with three of the world’s top five PC makers. On that note, FPC’s team expect to announce more PC integrations “in the near future”, the announcement concluded.</p>

<p>Biometric technologies have gone mainstream over the past decade, and much of the credit must be attributed to the financial services sector. Banks were among the first major consumer-facing organizations to embrace biometric login on mobile devices as smartphones began to implement fingerprint sensors, and many financial services organizations have proceeded to enable face-based customer login.</p>



<p>But too many have stopped there. Biometric technologies offer a range of important benefits beyond mobile login, and have continued to advance to better fight fraud and serve customers. And yet most financial services organizations have let their innovation efforts lag, resulting in plateaued customer service and a vulnerability to advancing fraud that grows more risky with each day.</p>



<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/sites/default/files/resource_files/eat-better-banking-experiences-strong-authentication-face-biometrics-eb-en.pdf">HID Global has published a new eBook</a> detailing how today’s biometric technologies can help financial services organizations to revamp innovation and deliver enhanced customer service and robust security. Focusing on fingerprint recognition and face-based authentication, the eBook details how these technologies can enable better banking experiences at every customer touchpoint, from mobile banking to remote onboarding to the bank branch itself and the ATM.</p>



 



 <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/sites/default/files/resource_files/eat-better-banking-experiences-strong-authentication-face-biometrics-eb-en.pdf">Download HID Global’s eBook:</a> 



 “<a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/sites/default/files/resource_files/eat-better-banking-experiences-strong-authentication-face-biometrics-eb-en.pdf">Better Banking Experiences Start With Strong Authentication and Face Biometric</a>“ 



 



<p>For example, in the account opening process, new customers can prove who they are by remotely uploading a selfie and a picture of an ID through a mobile app. At the bank branch, they can identified upon entry using facial recognition, enabling personalized service the moment they walk through the door. Fingerprint scanning, meanwhile, can be used to establish a fast and secure biometric signature for sensitive transactions.</p>



<p>In addition to laying out the broad benefits of banking biometrics, the eBook details the particular advantages of HID Global’s sophisticated multispectral imaging technology, which enables the capture of biometrics based not only on the surface level, but on subdermal features of a subject’s face and fingers. This technology offers particularly powerful security <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/hid-global-gets-another-perfect-score-in-iso-anti-spoofing-testing/">against spoofing attacks</a> in which fake biometric credentials are used in an attempt to fool an authentication system – a critically important matter in today’s threat landscape. Be sure to <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/sites/default/files/resource_files/eat-better-banking-experiences-strong-authentication-face-biometrics-eb-en.pdf">delve into HID’s eBook</a> to understand why, and for the bigger picture of how biometrics can enable better banking experiences.</p>

 GiD Report#181 — The future will be self sovereign <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-180-the-facebook-problem-b253ccbca5aa">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  Understanding the Sovereignty Stack  The problem with&nbsp;Tether  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. Understanding the Sovereignty Stack <p>The elegance of Bitcoin is that it was the right idea at the right time. A confluence of pre-existing technologies, the concept of a decentralized ledger pushed all the right buttons in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. From big bank bailouts to quantitative easing, here was a bottom up solution that reframed how we thought about value — value that was innately digital in the spirit of the internet.</p><p>Just as the World Wide Web empowered people to connect and share knowledge and information, the rise of Bitcoin taught us that we could have direct ownership over our valuable assets and payments — no middle man or central operator necessary.</p><p>Twelve years after Satoshi’s white paper, Bitcoin and crypto at large are at a crossroads. With a market value north of $2 trillion, crypto is impossible to ignore — with much of the participation coming from grassroots retail investors. That’s the thing about crypto. Everyone gets a seat at the table. You don’t need to be an accredited investor. You don’t need to wait for an IPO — after all the insiders already benefited from the initial upside. All you need is a non-custodial wallet that you control. (And, of course, with opportunity and access comes responsibility and&nbsp;risk.)</p><p>But with maturation comes a new set of expectations. Regulators and the powers that be are paying attention.</p><p>It would be easy to argue that much of Coinbase’s success in the American market is due to the fact that they’ve always taken compliance seriously — stuff like proper KYC and AML protocols (Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering).</p><p>Just as the WWW made IP addresses humanistic with domain names, our blockchain public/private keys will ultimately be tied to an identity — our names. For the burgeoning DeFi space, that will be a likely next step. For crypto to grow up, we need to establish identity and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>But that’s also where the elegance of Bitcoin, the internet, and the decentralized movement comes back into&nbsp;play.</p><p>Just as you own and control the BTC in your noncustodial wallet, so should you control your identity and the data behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>We should have ownership over identity, our communications, and our money. That’s the Sovereignty Stack.</p><p>To learn more about the self-sovereign future, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyGggZ2pT1I">check out this recent METACO interview with GlobaliD co-founder and CEO Greg&nbsp;Kidd</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="http://global.id/">/gregkidd</a>:</p><blockquote>There’s an expression in philosophy called a bundle of sticks. And our identity is really that — that bundle of sticks. It can even include things like: I own a bicycle that I really identify with. And so it’s all those attributes that persist over time. If you can’t prove them, and if you can’t control them, then you’re really not in control of your identity. If you have to ask someone else for permission to prove or establish your own identity, once again, you’re not really in control of your identity.</blockquote><blockquote>So when we talk about digital identity and self sovereignty, we’re talking about a form of identity that you can control. That also should be a form that’s interoperable. It shouldn’t live within one app. You want to be able to take those credentials to any other platform. We’re not anti-company or anti-government, but any company or government that’s willing to recognize those credentials should be able to identify you, authenticate you, and then authorize you to do the things you want to&nbsp;do.</blockquote><p>The full interview:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyGggZ2pT1I">The Sovereignty Stack: Re-thinking Digital Identity for Web3.0 w/ Greg KIDD [METACO TALKS&nbsp;#23]</a>   Relevant:   <a href="https://www.axios.com/takeaways-facebook-whistleblower-hearing-9f2cddf5-5f8d-4944-87cd-b488bfa3aec1.html">What you need to know from the Facebook whistleblower hearing</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/">/j</a> — <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-will-become-currency-in-brazil-soon-according-to-federal-deputy-aureo-ribeiro/">Bitcoin Will Become Currency in Brazil Soon, According to Federal Deputy Aureo Ribeiro — Bitcoin&nbsp;News</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/">/j</a> — <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/10/06/the-richest-under-30-in-the-world-all-thanks-to-crypto/">Meet The World’s Richest 29-Year-Old: How Sam Bankman-Fried Made A Record Fortune In The Crypto&nbsp;Frenzy</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/city-police-investigate-privacy-breaches-involving-portpass-vaccination-proof-app">City police investigate privacy breaches involving PORTpass vaccination proof&nbsp;app</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/roblox-to-add-opt-in-age-verification-for-players-and-developers/">Roblox to add opt-in age verification for players and developers — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/05/web-3-is-where-the-young-people-are/">Web 3 Is Where the Young People&nbsp;Are</a>   2. The problem with&nbsp;Tether <p>If we ever needed an example why regulations might be a good idea, we wouldn’t have to look further than&nbsp;Tether.</p><p>From Bloomberg’s Zeke Faux’s investigative report:</p><blockquote>After I returned to the U.S., I obtained a document showing a detailed account of Tether Holdings’ reserves. It said they include billions of dollars of short-term loans to large Chinese companies — something money-market funds avoid. And that was before one of the country’s largest property developers, China Evergrande Group, started to collapse. I also learned that Tether had lent billions of dollars more to other crypto companies, with Bitcoin as collateral. One of them is Celsius Network Ltd., a giant quasi-bank for cryptocurrency investors, its founder Alex Mashinsky told me. He said he pays an interest rate of 5% to 6% on $1 billion in loans from Tether. Tether has denied holding any Evergrande debt, but Hoegner, Tether’s lawyer, declined to say whether Tether had other Chinese commercial paper. He said the vast majority of its commercial paper has high grades from credit ratings firms, and that its secured loans are low-risk, because borrowers have to put up Bitcoin that’s worth more than what they borrow. “All Tether tokens are fully backed,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>It’s also worth <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-07/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-looking-for-tether-s-money">checking out Matt Levine’s&nbsp;take</a>.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-07/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-looking-for-tether-s-money">Looking for Tether’s&nbsp;Money</a>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/stablecoins-face-same-safeguards-traditional-payments-2021-10-06/">Stablecoins to face same safeguards as traditional payments</a>   3.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Oliver Carr, cybersecurity evangelist and strategist will discuss the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4902/1">Maximizing the Value of Security</a> on Wednesday, November 10 from 12:00 pm to 12:20 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Oliver some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your keynote: “From Burden to Benefit - How Aligning on Business Purpose and Objectives Is Critical to Maximize the Value of Security”? 
<p>I've spent the last years working very closely in the digital transformation of many large organizations, and a topic that keeps on coming up is that the security function is seen as a necessary evil at best,&nbsp;and a total hindrance at worst. The question is, what does security actually provide to the business? And does the business understand the value that security tools, security processes and security methodologies can bring? What we will look at in this session is how to align what security can bring to the table, but also to understand what the understanding of the other players in the game&nbsp;is, so that the security as a function and the security as a unit within the organizations can move forward and show how they can provide a benefit to the business and therefore move from just being a necessary cost factor to actually providing business benefit. &nbsp;</p>
 How can companies manage the competing demands of minimizing the risk of security breaches and maximizing the opportunities of agile, digital transformations? 
<p>Both security and digital transformation want the same thing at the end of the day. They want to make sure that the business is successful and that it can develop better than the competition. The ways of doing this are different, though, and especially the approach towards risk is different between security, who tend to try to minimize risk and digital transformation, who willingly take risks in order to move ahead of the competition. Bringing those two views together and understanding the necessity of being risk aware. And to decide in a specific case whether it is better to be on the side of caution or whether it is the time to be bold, to move forward is something that only works if there is an open dialog of understanding between those functions. And that is what companies need to achieve going forward if they want to be successful.</p>
 How can aligning on business purposes and objectives help to maximize the value of security? 
<p>Security is very often seen as that cost factor, as that necessary evil. If we want to show the benefit that security can bring, it needs to be brought in terms of what the company actually produces, what the organization produces in the way of products or services. Only by aligning that,&nbsp;can the amount of effort and the amount of money that we need to put into security to achieve that risk appetite that the company is willing to take,&nbsp;really acceptable, not just to the security organization, but to the company overall,&nbsp;and thereby accepting security as part of the solution and not as part of the problem. &nbsp;</p>
 What do you see as the biggest challenge for Security to becoming recognized as a value-adding function? 
<p>Security,&nbsp;in many cases,&nbsp;has been seen as this absolute&nbsp;-&nbsp;what one of my colleagues calls the&nbsp;“Ministry of No”. You're either secure or you are insecure. It is always this question of you're either with us or you are against us. The way we need to move forward,&nbsp;is to accept that between those two extremes, there is a middle ground. It's not an either - or. It's actually an also - and. And if we can move in that area together with the people who within our organizations who are driving that digital transformation, who are driving product innovation and identifying where that common ground is, and to stride down that road together, then we can be successful. And that, to me, is the biggest challenge that we are facing today towards making security a business benefit rather than just a business burden.</p>

<p>At IDnow our employees are family, and to us, this means ensuring they should feel safe, productive, inspired, and energised in their work life. This of course, has become a lot more important during the global corona pandemic since processes became digitalised and engaging in the digital world has become the new normal. At IDnow, we understand the need for a seamless online experience, and so it has become our number one priority to create the best working models for all employees.</p>
<p>Since IDnow introduced the initial remote working policy in early 2020, the benefits have by far outweighed any criticisms: “Some of the IDnow employees were sceptic in the beginning”, told Jacqueline Arlt, Recruitment Business Partner at IDnow. “But after a few months the first colleagues started asking if they can keep working remotely, even after the pandemic. They told us about the benefits they experience and the great work-life balance.” she adds. As working from home became the new normality and employees began seeing the advantages, IDnow introduced a long-term remote policy and offered employees in administrative roles the possibility to choose remote or partially remote working models.</p>
<p>Employees can now decide how and where they are working from, as we believe effective work is not based on the hours they spend at a desk. “We strongly believe that the future of working will be more and more diverse and international and as a global and digital company, offering a flexible way of working without a location-boundary will be the future” says Jacqueline Arlt.</p>
<p>IDnow offers three ways of working for their employees, and everyone who’s role allows it can choose which one suits them best. Employees can decide if and how often they come to the office. Besides from 100% office based, fully and partially home office possibilities, IDnow also offers the possibility to go on a “workcation”. Imagine you travel to see your family in a different country and would like to stay a little longer than your vacation days allow. This is one of the many possibilities with a “workcation”. This way, IDnow offers our employees the best solution to make them feel comfortable, be creative and motivated and have the best possible work-life integration.</p>
<p>You may ask, why is this so important to IDnow? Because we believe that the future is human, and that even the most digital product and company is based on the motivation and happiness of each employee. People are happier and deliver better results in a comfortable and familiar environment. “It’s one of the most important things for us, to make sure every employee at IDnow has the opportunity to maintain a happy and healthy lifestyle, a good work-life-balance and the opportunity to find inspiration in the things they love.” says Jacqueline Arlt.</p>
 Hear what some of our employees have to say about their workcation experience: 
<p>“With the workcation option, I was able to spend 2 months with my family in Italy after the Covid-restrictions got eased.” says Francesca Palmeri, Head of Controlling at IDnow.</p>
<p>“I live in Estonia with my family and work fully remote at IDnow – that offers a great work life balance for me – especially since I’m a dad for a couple of months now. I have a great connection with my team, and we work together very productively.” Pedro Gallardo, Director Product Management.</p>

 T-REX Protocol Recognized as ERC3643 
<p>Last month, the Ethereum community officially recognized the T-REX suite of smart contracts as ERC3643 – the new official standard for permissioned tokens.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in October 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Last month, the Ethereum community officially recognised the T-REX suite of smart contracts as&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-an-official-standard-for-permissioned-tokens/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_aXnqyJ5mETACN5-6fTfzCHbSvrqN6AFaUfBWXVXCEIpiiW7lElMCcpo50_3sb6ViF-wUu">ERC3643 – the new official standard for permissioned tokens</a>. Here’s a quick rundown of its main functions.</p>
<p>ERC3643 functionality:</p>
<p>Controllable&nbsp;– as the assets are guaranteed by digital identity, the issuer can<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokens-recovery/"> recover tokens</a> as long as the investor can prove who they say they are.</p>
<p>Versatile&nbsp;– ERC3643 tokens can represent a multitude of assets including, but not limited to, securities, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fiat currencies, commodities and&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/how-fractionalization-of-nfts-enables-co-ownership/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_aXnqyJ5mETACN5-6fTfzCHbSvrqN6AFaUfBWXVXCEIpiiW7lElMCcpo50_3sb6ViF-wUu">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Interoperable&nbsp;– the standard is also compatible with the well known ERC20 standard and is compatible with any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain, sidechain or Layer 2 solution, such as Polygon.</p>
<p>Secure&nbsp;– the standard has also been audited and confirmed as secure by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, the ERC3643 provides actors with everything they need to issue assets compliantly utilising decentralized technologies.

<p>Last week we completed our submission to the UK Government’s consultation on its proposed new Digital Markets Unit. It was an interesting exercise.</p> What is competition policy&nbsp;for? <p>Competition policy is the area where the belief system called free market economics gets its purest expression. Under this belief system, there is an invisible, mystical, magical entity called ‘the invisible hand’ of market forces (e.g. innovation and competition) whereby, if left perfectly free from any ‘interference’ from ordinary mortals (such as policy makers and regulators), always, without fail, automatically produces the best of all possible&nbsp;worlds.</p><p>In such a world, the main job of a competition regulator is to intervene if and when there is a ‘market failure’: where for one reason or another, the invisible hand is being stopped from working its magic wonders. Because markets are seen as places where money is exchanged for goods and services, the main test for market failure is the existence of monopolies where, by restricting innovation and competition, monopolists get away with charging excessive prices.</p><p>But because companies like Facebook and Google offer their services for ‘free’ — making their money via the different currency of personal data they haven’t been classed as monopolies. So for decades, they have been left free to do pretty much whatever they&nbsp;liked.</p> Wrestling with&nbsp;reality <p>To its credit, a few years back, the Competition and Markets Authority looked at reality, rather than operating on the assumption that fairy stories are facts. Its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competition-and-markets-authoritys-digital-markets-strategy/the-cmas-digital-markets-strategy-february-2021-refresh">final report</a>, published in early 2021, opened the door to a new approach to regulating ‘digital markets’.</p><p>The report recognised that rather than relying solely on ‘ex post’ interventions (e.g. after a market failure has been proved to exist) regulators should be able to intervene ‘ex ante’ (e.g. before problems occur, with policy goals in mind); and that rather than tackling each isolated abuse separately, one by one, they should be able to “address a wide range of concerns holistically”.</p><p>Specifically, they identified five key issues which need to be addressed:</p>  Network effects and economies of scale — where a platform’s power increases with the number of people using the platform, making it effectively invincible.  Unequal access to user data — “digital platforms collect vast quantities of unique user data, which gives them a significant competitive advantage when providing data-driven services”.  Consumer decision making and the power of defaults — where platforms’ control over default settings effectively gives them control over what choices consumers are presented with; which may be used to “influence the platform’s ability to collect users’&nbsp;data”.  Lack of transparency around complex decision-making algorithms.  The importance of ecosystems — where large collections of integrated, complementary products and services are designed in a way that favours the firm’s own services.   What we&nbsp;said <p>The Government’s consultation was on the scope and powers of the resulting new ‘Digital Markets Unit’. Most of our response was devoted to questioning the Government’s apparent assumption that by definition, all ‘innovation’ and all ‘competition’ is a good thing. It’s just not so. For example, fraudsters constantly innovate in very clever ways to con people out of their money more effectively. Improved competition in the market for the modern slave trade is a bad thing, not a good&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Our particular focus was innovation and competition around the issue of ‘unequal access to user data’. Here, we pointed out, there are two possible types of innovation and competition. The first is innovation and competition around who is most efficient and effective at hoovering up individuals’ personal data and monetising it to line the pockets of their shareholders. The second is innovation and competition around who is most efficient and effective in enabling individuals to access and use their own data for their purposes.</p><p>In other words, the issue is not ‘innovation’ and ‘competition’ in the abstract, but what sort of innovation and competition the Digital Markets Unit chooses to ‘holistically’ address. One of the core suggestions we made therefore is that the DMU should be required to develop a set of criteria — open to public debate and scrutiny — that defines whether any particular innovation is desirable and therefore to be encouraged, or&nbsp;not.</p><p>Unfortunately, the way the UK Government’s questions were framed in this consultation give the impression that the only market it really has in mind is that of more efficient, effective data monetisation and exploitation. Operating on this assumption would take us back to where we were before the CMA wrote its&nbsp;report.</p><p>We did our best to explain why this would be a terrible idea; why empowering individuals with their own data is the only sensible, fair and economically efficient way forward. This issue lies at the heart of everything the Government does in this space, including the shape and content of its new National Data Strategy. It has yet to be resolved. And it’s not going to go&nbsp;away.</p> Joining the&nbsp;dots <p>This is all the more important given the proliferation of other consultations and initiatives currently under way, all of which raise the same core question. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Data: A New Deal consultation to reform data protection regulations  National Data&nbsp;Strategy  Single Login for Government  National Identity and Attributes Trust Framework  Open Finance  Pensions Dashboard programme  Modernisation of Lasting Power of&nbsp;Attorney  NHS consultation on data&nbsp;sharing  Scottish Attribute Provider&nbsp;Service  <p>Is there anyone in Government joining the dots between these different initiatives? If not, is there any chance of the UK ever developing a coherent, positive strategy for personal&nbsp;data?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-right-sort-of-competition-e505eaadc662">The Right Sort of Competition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Protecting user data from <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">identity fraud</a> has become challenging for businesses in this dynamic environment shaped by privacy and security concerns.</p><p>While centralized and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">federated identity</a> management systems may seem like a good idea in terms of user access and convenience, it is also fraught with issues such as security threats, siloed data, poor user control, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>A possible solution to these problems is <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>, a revolutionary identity framework that empowers users to determine where their data is stored, how it is used, and with whom it is shared. A popular way to implement SSI is through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>, two W3C standards that create a common layer for user authentication and verification.</p><p>A DID is a unique identifier built on the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and it is linked to a DID document, that in turn, contains information about an entity. A VC, on the other hand, is a cryptographically verifiable and machine-readable credential of an entity such as the date of birth, government ID, vaccination records, employment details,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Now comes the big question — how are VCs tied to an entity’s identity in any application?</p> VC Issuance and Verification <p>To understand the relationship between <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">VCs</a> and DIDs, let’s talk briefly about the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk">issuance and verification process</a>.</p><p>There are three parties involved in VC issuance and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Issuer — the entity issuing the VC. For example, the Motor Vehicle department issuing a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/protecting-your-drivers-license-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-25d22aeac05b">driver&nbsp;license</a>  Holder — the owner of the VC. For example, the individual who owns the&nbsp;license  Verifier — the entity verifying the authenticity of the VC. For example, a police authority who wants to issue a speeding&nbsp;ticket.  <p>Together, these three entities form what’s called a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a>, and this is a key requirement for implementing SSI. The trust aspect among these entities is handled by <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">public-key cryptography,</a> a pair of private and public keys that always work together.</p><p>The process begins when an issuer creates a VC about the holder and digitally signs it with its private key. The holder, on receiving this VC, uses the issuer’s public key to decrypt the information, and store it in his or her <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital&nbsp;wallet</a>.</p><p>When the holder wants to share this VC with a verifier, he or she creates a verifiable presentation that contains one or more VCs such as date of birth, driver’s license, address, etc, and signs it with his or her private&nbsp;key.</p><p>The verifier decrypts the VC with the holder’s public key to access the information and authenticates that it came from the right source by using the issuer’s public&nbsp;key.</p> Role of Decentralized Identifiers <p>A DID is a unique identifier that is linked to a DID document through a DID&nbsp;method.</p><p>Essentially, the DID method resolves the DID and helps to locate the associated DID document. You can imagine it to be something similar to what a URL would do to locate the web server containing information.</p><p>This DID method is implementation-specific and varies according to the network or distributed ledger where it is implemented. The DID document, on the other hand, contains information about the entities involved in JSON&nbsp;format.</p> Link Between VCs and&nbsp;DIDs <p>To answer the question of how <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">VCs</a> are linked to identity across applications, we must understand how VCs are linked to&nbsp;DIDs.</p><p>Earlier, we said that the DID document contains information about the entities, and this includes information about their public keys and the cryptographic algorithm used. This information is then used for verifying the identity of the entities.</p><p>Here’s a sample DID document.</p> {   “@context”: [      “https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",      “https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"    ]  “id”: “did:example:123456789abcdefghi”,  “authentication”: [{      // used to authenticate as did:…fghi      “id”: “did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1”,      “type”: “Ed25519VerificationKey2020”,      “controller”: “did:example:123456789abcdefghi”,      “publicKeyMultibase”: “zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV”   }]  } <p>In other words, DIDs contain information that can verify the authenticity of a&nbsp;VC.</p> Workflow of DIDs and&nbsp;VCs <p>To further elaborate, let’s look at how VCs and DIDs come together from an implementation standpoint.</p> Step 1 — Creating a&nbsp;DID <p>The first step is to create a DID using a specific DID method. The issuer can decide to create a new DID for each VC or use the same DID for all VCs issued to a&nbsp;holder.</p> Step 2 — Adding Information to the DID&nbsp;Document <p>The cryptographic keys of the DID are updated in the DID document.</p><p>Next, the issuer has to collect and/or verify the identity of the holder as required. The exact process of this step would depend on the type of credential. For example, VCs for proving that the holder is more than 21 years requires less stringent verification than issuing a driver’s&nbsp;license.</p><p>The issuer takes this responsibility of verification and accordingly issues a VC to the&nbsp;holder.</p> Step 3 — Signing the&nbsp;VC <p>The VC issued by the issuer contains the DID of both the issuer and the holder and it is digitally signed with the issuer’s DID. After the signing process, the issuer sends the VC to the&nbsp;holder</p> Step 4 — Revoking a&nbsp;VC <p>At a later point, the issuer can choose to revoke the VCs issued, especially if they are no longer related to the holder. While many implementations don’t support <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-vc-revocation-846e47ce3e90">VC Revocation</a>, Affinidi’s <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk">tech stack</a> has simple methods to revoke&nbsp;VCs.</p> Step 5 — Verifying the&nbsp;VC <p>The holder creates a verifiable presentation consisting of one or more VCs and shares it with a verifier.</p><p>The verifier has to resolve the DID documents from the DID of the issuer and the holder present in the VC. Using the DID method, the verifier can check if the VCs sent by the holder are authentic.</p><p>The verifier also uses the DID methods to check for revocation of the&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>If found authentic, the verifier can offer its services to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>From the above workflow, it’s clear that VCs are bound with DID, which in turn, reveal the identity of an entity. Since these are interoperable and are not tied to a centralized authority, VCs have many <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use-cases</a> across different spheres.</p><p>Thus, this is how VCs and identity are linked together across applications.</p><p>For more such content, read through our <a href="http://academy.affinidi.com/">blog posts</a>, join our <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">mailing list</a>, and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.</p><p>The information materials contained in this article are for general information and educational purposes only.

 Towards compound growth in Ocean ecosystem  Punchline <p>OceanDAO is a grants DAO where anyone can propose a project, and each OCEAN holder can vote “yes” or “no” for a&nbsp;project.</p><p>It’s great for the Ocean ecosystem if OCEAN holders thoughtfully vote “yes” and “no” on OceanDAO proposals, to curate towards projects with the best chance of growing the Ocean ecosystem (“thoughtful” voting).</p><p>Voting “no” across all projects with the hope that the burn will drive OCEAN price is simply irrational. It’s too small of a burn to make a dent for the near term, and it hurts the ability to grow value in the longer&nbsp;term.</p><p>If you care about the value of your OCEAN, then please vote, thoughtfully.</p> 1. Introduction <p>This article provides background to better understand the “punchline” presented above. Ocean is designed to mirror Amazon’s successful dynamics. The keys are decentralized funding, curation, and a focus on compound growth (vs dividends).</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Sections 2–4 describe Amazon. Sections 2 &amp; 3 describes the Amazon flywheel. Section 4 describes how Amazon focuses revenue on growth rather than shareholder dividends. From this, it’s been able to grow like crazy and create longstanding shareholder value.  Sections 5–8 draw a parallel to Ocean. Sections 5 &amp; 6 describes how Ocean’s token design is modeled after the Amazon flywheel. Section 7 describes how Ocean design focuses on growth to create longstanding value. Section 8 describes how OceanDAO voting plays a big&nbsp;role.   2. The Amazon&nbsp;Flywheel <p>Over 25 years, Amazon has grown from a struggling online bookstore to a globally pervasive company with a trillion dollar market&nbsp;cap.</p><p>Its flywheel was key to success: if Amazon selection grows, then customer experience can’t help but improve; then sales can’t help but grow; then the number of sellers can’t help but grow; then selection can’t help but grow. And the loop continues.</p>The Amazon loop. Source: Amazon.com 3. Amazon Flywheel Components <p>Two key components in this flywheel are (1) its decentralized workers and (2) its resource allocation algorithm.</p>  Amazon has (1) a sea of two-pizza teams, each running fairly independently, each with its own profit &amp; loss. It’s the “workers” block in the image&nbsp;below.  Each team is (2) funded by Amazon HQ according to a resource-allocation algorithm — the “curation” block in the image below. The more ROI a team delivers, the more funding they get. When getting going, they get a bit of time to start — typically months — to start delivering ROI. If they can’t deliver, the project gets shut down and team disbanded.  Amazon’s flywheel, including curation of $ (top left), role of workers (middle), and role of dividends (bottom&nbsp;right) 4. Amazon Growth vs Dividends <p>The revenue for these teams comes as a cut of&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Amazon takes a cut from the sales and aggressively plows it into growth. (“curate” box in the image). It explicitly does not put much into shareholder dividends (“lower-bound-shareholder rewards” in image). This is because money into growth gives benefits that compound over time, whereas dividends are a one-time&nbsp;payoff.</p><p>For example, if Amazon spends R&amp;D money to reduce its logistics costs by 2%, then it can keep reaping those savings for years to come. In contrast, Amazon did a dividend or a stock buyback, it would be a one-time benefit to shareholders and then the money is&nbsp;gone.</p><p>The best way to grow shareholder value is to grow revenue. It would only be rational for Amazon to give dividends if it couldn’t efficiently allocate its capital to growth (ROI &gt; 1). When you see Amazon start to dole out lots of dividends, it means growth has&nbsp;slowed.</p><p>Interestingly, many companies religiously aim to give dividends every year. IBM is famous for it. Unsurprisingly, their growth is tepid, and has been for&nbsp;decades.</p> 5. The Ocean Sustainability Loop <p>Amazon shows how well flywheels can work, including with decentralized workers and an algorithm to allocate resources. This gives Amazon an interesting <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/tokenize-the-enterprise-23d51bafb536">path to decentralization</a>. More usefully to for us: we can use this flywheel as a model for decentralized business models. We call it the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Web3 Sustainability Loop</a>. We use it as the beating heart of Ocean’s token&nbsp;design.</p><p>If Ocean data selection grows, then data buyer experience can’t help but improve; then data sales can’t help but grow; then the number of data sellers can’t help but grow; then data selection can’t help but grow. And the loop continues.</p> 6. Ocean Sustainability Loop Components <p>Two key components in Ocean’s loop are (1) its decentralized workers and (2) its resource allocation algorithm.</p>  Ocean has (1) a sea of OceanDAO-funded teams, each running fairly independently, each with its own profit &amp; loss. It’s the “workers” block in the image&nbsp;below.  Each team is (2) funded by OceanDAO according to its resource-allocation algorithm: voting. This is the “curation” block in the image below. The more ROI a team delivers, the more funding they can expect over time. When getting going, they get a bit of time to start — to start delivering ROI. If they can’t deliver, the team should not expect to receive further&nbsp;grants.  Ocean Sustainability Loop is an instance of Web3 Sustainability Loop&nbsp;pattern<p>Ocean is an ecosystem. There are way more teams than just OPF core team working to build and grow the Ocean ecosystem. Here are examples of work funded by OceanDAO.</p>  Ocean documentation. These have matured greatly in the last half year, thanks to Akshay. Work includes: search, ocean.py API, Provider API, Aquarius API, and (currently) documentation for&nbsp;V4.  Deep Gaia-X engagement. OPF core team has been engaged with Gaia-X a long time. However this engagement has become broader and stronger thanks to work by grant recipients (deltaDAO).  Vote with datatoken pools. This was accomplished by a grant (Tim Daubenshuetz).  Moderation of TG, Discord, and other channels. This is done by the Ocean Ambassadors grants recipients.  Learn about Ocean. The Ocean Academy team created tons of awesome material to onboard people about Ocean. It’s become so good, that doing Ocean Academy is a pre-requisite for people to become Ocean Ambassadors.  Learn about OceanDAO grants. The Ocean Pearl team has created a gorgeous frontend (oceanpearl.io) to browse, search and filter OceanDAO grants recipients. The scope is increasing to support other OceanDAO flows such as&nbsp;voting.   7. Ocean Growth vs&nbsp;Burning <p>The revenue for OceanDAO teams comes from OPF treasury, 51% rewards, and (with traction) Network&nbsp;Revenue.</p><p>Ocean is designed to aggressively plows Network Revenue into growth. (“curate” box in the image). It explicitly puts just 5% — a low amount — into burning (bottom left image). This is because money into growth gives benefits that compound over time, whereas burning is a one-time&nbsp;payoff.</p><p>For example, if OceanDAO grants R&amp;D money to a new app that adds 100,000 participants to Ocean ecosystem, those people will stick around for years to come, assuming they’re getting value from the app. Network Revenue would flow to the Ocean community accordingly.</p><p>In contrast, in a burn situation, it a one-time benefit to OCEAN holders and then the money is&nbsp;gone.</p><p>Burning actually happens in two places: (a) 5% of Network Rewards, as described, and (b) any OceanDAO funds not allocated in a given funding cycle, i.e. not enough projects with a sufficient “yes” vote to use up the funds available.</p><p>The best way to grow OCEAN value is to grow Network Revenue. It would only be rational for OceanDAO to burn its funds it couldn’t efficiently allocate its capital to growth (ROI &gt;&nbsp;1).</p><p>We’ve actually built TokenSPICE simulations that validate this (at least with the model assumptions). In scenario A, we ran at 95% of Network Revenue to OceanDAO, and 5% to burning. In scenario B, the opposite. The results: in 10 years, predicted market cap was about 10x higher for scenario A. Focus on growth creates the most value for OCEAN holders, because it compounds. Burning is a one-time&nbsp;payoff.</p> 8. OceanDAO Voting &amp; Ocean&nbsp;Growth <p>Let’s drill in on voting in OceanDAO.</p><p>What’s rational: voting “yes” for projects that you think have a good chance to help grow Ocean (expect ROI &gt; 1 over&nbsp;time).</p><p>What’s rational: voting “no” for projects that you think don’t have a good chance (ROI &lt;1 and will never get&nbsp;better)</p><p>What’s less rational: voting “no” on all projects because you think burning will help drive the price of Ocean. This less rational because the amount burned is so low that it won’t dent the price of OCEAN. Even more importantly, it means the ecosystem isn’t getting funded — precisely where the growth needs to&nbsp;be!</p><p>Put another way, ask yourself: can I expect more returns to OCEAN from this project in the next 6–18 months, versus burning? If yes, then vote yes. If no, then no. Burning is the lower-bound measuring stick for assessing value&nbsp;add.</p> 9. Conclusion <p>This article reviewed the Amazon flywheel and how Ocean’s token dynamics mirror them. It highlighted that value creation comes from funding for growth, which gives compound rewards over time. Contrast this to burning which is only a one-time payoff (and is money taken from&nbsp;growth).</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">On Voting In OceanDAO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 By <a href="https://beincrypto.com/author/gloria-wu/">Gloria Wu&nbsp;, Chief of Ecosystem Partnerships at&nbsp;Ontology</a> <p>The internet is currently in a liminal phase. It is sitting on the precipice of changes that will shake up human life in ways that we could have only imagined ten years ago. Web3 is the internet’s third iteration. It is seeing the digital sphere become more open-source.</p><p>A transparent community of developers is building this new web. It means it is trustless — participants can interact without intermediaries harvesting their data. Finally, it means it is permissionless — that anyone can participate without the need for a governing body.</p><p>Under the correct guiding principles, Web 3.0 can offer an internet that is more decentralized, open, and secure. To make this a reality, individuals as opposed to corporations and privacy as opposed to profits must have sovereignty in Web&nbsp;3.0.</p> Looking back to move&nbsp;forward <p>Web 2.0 was defined by innovations such as smartphone technology, social media, and cloud computing. In tandem with these developments, data processing and collection quickly grew legs. It became a source for capital gains and marketing success with little regulation in place on data harvesting and its&nbsp;uses.</p><p>Policymakers have begun to police this through laws such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-rules/mifid-ii-and-mifir">MiFID ii</a> in Europe. In addition to updated <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/22/tech-industry-urges-congress-to-slow-down-new-antitrust-bills.html">antitrust laws</a> aimed at increasing consumer protection in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>Ultimately, however, the underlying problem is that data is a valuable commodity. However, data protection is not something that chimes with the interests of big corporations.</p> The privacy&nbsp;failure <p>As well as facilitating an internet economy that thrives through data harvesting, Web 2.0 has failed to protect consumers’ privacy. This is because most data is stored on centralized platforms such as computer files and databases.</p><p>This makes data extremely vulnerable to losses, alterations, and hacks. Last year saw more than <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/top-5-data-breaches-in-history/">37 billion</a> records exposed due to just under 4000 data breaches in the&nbsp;U.S.</p><p>It’s not just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/business/facebook-whatsapp-privacy-fine.html">Big Tech</a> giants, like Watsapp and Amazon, that are in hot water when it comes to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/">security</a>. National health services such as the Health Service Executive (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58413448">HSE</a>) in Ireland, as well as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-57404917">schools</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57447404">restaurants</a> around the world, have all been implicated in significant data breaches this year. Therefore, showing how centralized systems can no longer provide users with the data protection they&nbsp;need.</p><p>Centralized bodies are often required to exchange data with different companies to function. For instance, when a bank must seek information from a loan provider on a customer’s repayment history.</p><p>Moving this data creates a new copy. With that copy, an opportunity arises for loss or incorrect data to be replicated or&nbsp;altered.</p><p>Web3 is perfectly placed to remedy the existing failures of these centralized systems. In addition, it can place privacy at the forefront of all technological developments.</p><p>Using a decentralized data storage system can ensure that each entity involved in data exchange has access to a real-time, shared view of the data when permission is granted by the person in control. Therefore, reducing the risk of malpractice.</p> Web3 and decentralized identities <p>Another essential part of the decentralization of Web3 will be the creation of secure digital identities.</p><p>The current model of online identity verification on the web is old and fraught with vulnerabilities. To do almost anything interactive, we have to supply valuable personal information. This comes with little oversight into how it is shared and protected.</p><p>Decentralized identity solutions already exist in the form of applications built on blockchain. These allow users to maintain autonomous control over their private data. They can then decide if and when to share it by granting access through private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>In the next phase of internet development and communication, decentralized metaverses, spaces where virtual worlds (such as games and forums) and the real world collide, are also becoming a reality. Different games will be linked up to each other, as well as to other virtual arenas like online shops or virtual <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-blockchain-cryptocurrency-events-2020/">events</a> platforms.</p><p>To ensure the seamless integration of these worlds, users have to be able to move between different parts of the metaverse with a consistent identity. All while ensuring their data and privacy is respected.</p><p>Decentralized identity solutions can allow users to create one decentralized username and password. This then allows them to access multiple different platforms securely. Therefore, making them a perfect solution in an integrated decentralized metaverse world.</p> Priorities in&nbsp;Web3 <p>Every blockchain or layer two network must wrestle with tradeoffs such as speed or block size. A given developer’s goals influences these decisions.</p><p>As such, priorities for the ecosystem will have to be set when developing a blockchain for Web3. Open, trustless, decentralized networks that value privacy and security should be prioritized. The principle of interoperability is part of this too. Creating one blockchain to facilitate all users’ needs goes against the decentralized principles that underlie blockchain technology.</p><p>There will be many blockchains and layer two protocols coexisting and providing different services. The task is to ensure that they can communicate seamlessly with one another. Thus, creating a safe and secure Web3 that places users’ needs ahead of those of corporations.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

				  Build your business and customer base fast by simplifying ledger writes with Indicio’s easy-to-use toolkit. Scale products and services in minutes  
			  
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE — October 08, 2021 — Indicio, the world’s leading provider of decentralized identity development and hosting solutions, today announced the public availability of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indy_network_transaction_wizard/">I</a><a href="https://indicio.tech/indy_network_transaction_wizard/">ndicio Transaction Endorser Wizard</a>, the newest offering&nbsp; in the company’s&nbsp; range of products for building enterprise-grade Trusted Data Ecosystems. The Indicio Transaction Endorser Wizard takes the guesswork out of putting together the right components for a ledger write which means you can get your customers to go live with their products and services&nbsp; in minutes and not hours or&nbsp; days.</p>
<p>Writing to any Hyperledger Indy-based network can be time consuming and complicated.&nbsp; As more companies turn to trusted data ecosystems and verifiable credential technologies to share information in a secure, privacy-preserving way, IT organizations have to take on the challenge of writing to the ledger for their own products and services—as well as endorsing writes for their customers.</p>
<p>These processes, which involve creating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and schema combination for Hyperledger Indy networks require a high level of technical skill and coordination. The Indicio Transaction Endorser Wizard solves this problem by making writing to the ledger simpler, quicker, and easier to scale. This helps you get to market quicker, expand your market, and grow your business as an endorser for your customers.</p>
<p>“Writing transactions and orchestrating multiple writes from multiple parties is a new core business activity,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “For decentralized identity to scale, for companies to get to market, we need to make these&nbsp; processes as frictionless as possible. For products and services involving multiple customers that all want to issue verifiable credentials this can mean hundreds of ledger writes to a network. The Transaction Endorser Wizard makes this possible&nbsp; in minutes instead of&nbsp; hours for even the most knowledgeable teams. This is an essential tool for scaling decentralized identity solutions for everyone.”</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/fisher">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>In today’s business environment, companies have three major challenges – making a profit, finding great people, and staying ahead of the competition. That’s quite enough, but they also have major operational challenges with IT, cyber security, and compliance. For example, IBM Security Services reports that it’s not unusual for clients to have more than 15 different cloud providers – and probably more they don’t know about. How do business and IT leaders deal with that when they don’t even know how many clouds there are, or what data resides on those multiple clouds? They can appoint new people into new privacy and security positions to cope but is that enough? Given the cyber threats the business now faces, it most likely is not.</p>
 Hail to the chief security officer 
<p>Most recently, the number of companies falling victim to ransomware attacks has seen a steep increase. The fear that ransomware and other forms of cyber-attack will have a serious impact on the US economy led to President Biden’s Executive Order on radically improving cyber security within Federal Agencies. This seriously upped the game for those vendors that wish to supply into the Federal Sector, and the rigorous standards they will now have to meet.</p>
<p>The Executive Order is far reaching and will have an impact on the private sector where the cyber threat is no less acute. The order states: “The trust we place in our digital infrastructure should be proportional to how trustworthy and transparent that infrastructure is, and to the consequences we will incur if that trust is misplaced.”&nbsp;This almost perfectly describes the situation that many private companies now find themselves in when looking for partners to improve their own security posture against the worsening threat landscape – trust is all important as is the ability to provide modern scalable security platforms that are compatible with legacy platforms.</p>
 What IT buyers are looking for now, and why 
<p>Buyers are looking for an integrated approach to data security, privacy and governance – and looking for trusted partners to provide such solutions. The major challenge is that IT infrastructures for many organizations are of necessity more complex as they seek to make progress on digital transformation with clouds, infrastructure as code, third party and customer identity management etc. – and this has made a consistent approach to security and governance harder. Too often, incompatible legacy solutions are preventing a fully joined up holistic approach to security and governance and creating pain points across the enterprise. With modality now the order of the day for larger enterprises clients want to see vendors and service providers who understand the customer’s pain points and how they are trying to address it, reaching further into relationships that scale and mature.</p>
 Finding the data and then protecting it is not easy 
<p>Understanding data is central to innovation, efficiency and productivity and therefore its protection is paramount. To make use of data, teams must know where it is. Data on customer behaviour is hugely valuable to defining new services and products but it’s also sensitive and needs protecting. Thales, a global digital identity and security company, advises that encryption is a good solution, but it too must be managed, be best in breed so that it 100% protects data but does not stand in the way of access to those that need it. Encrypted data is useless to hackers, but it is also no good to users if they cannot decrypt what they need with zero latency.</p>
<p>There is of course no silver bullet when it comes to protecting data and applications but for any security infrastructure to succeed following an internationally recognised framework such as NIST is advisable. It helps with purchase decisions, deployment and operation to follow accepted and recognised patterns and will also help with meeting compliance demands. The best IT services providers and integrators will be able to ensure that any security project or data protection platform follows recognised and suitable frameworks that also fit the culture, operations and market obligations of the client.</p>
<p>Clients do not want to rip out legacy technologies to conform to an individual platform – so solutions must have as many integrations as possible – a “perfectly baked cake” that covers the full spectrum of integrations that plays nicely with other applications in the stack. Of course, writing this is simple, doing it is much harder and few organizations these days can achieve security solutions suitably hardened and stressed tested against compliance standards and known vulnerabilities without expert help that understands business.</p>
 Poor security costs more than dollars 
<p>The cost of inadequate or badly configured IT security is not just measured in lost production or through ransomware payments but also in loss of reputation and brand damage after a breach. And, since the emergence of consumer privacy regulations such as the EU GDPR, organizations have had to ensure that they protect PII or be subject to fines. This comes at the same time as enterprises are introducing more consumer focused digital services putting further emphasis on protecting customer data. If that is not secured any new digital relationship with customers (CIAM) will not work – the trust will not be there. In those less regulated markets where Privacy Regulation are less severe this may matter less in dollar terms but a reputation for good security and looking after customer data will do brands no harm at all in any market.</p>
<p>Increasingly businesses should see spend on cybersecurity not as cost but as an investment – in the company, its people and its future. Further, in the joined up interconnected supply chains we are accustomed to – companies increasingly wish to do business with other companies that proactively think about security – and can be seen to tangible taking steps to be as secure as possible.</p>
<p>It is about reputation with customers and partners in supply chain. It is about competitive positioning. For example, legacy financial institutions need to compete with more agile cloud native FinTechs who may have a more baked in security layer. To compete they will demand a security and privacy fabric entwined with their clouds and, importantly, legacy infrastructures – and they will look to trusted IT partners to provide this.</p>

<p>Ocean Protocol smart contracts and Ocean Market are now running on Energy Web Foundation’s dedicated network</p><p>As part of Ocean’s<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce"> multi-chain strategy</a>, we have deployed Ocean’s technology to <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain">Energy Web Chain</a> (EWC), the dedicated network for <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web </a>(EW). This collaboration marks a major milestone in the energy vertical of the Ocean data ecosystem.</p><p>Energy Web is the leading decentralized energy ecosystem, trusted by influential energy companies including GE, Tepco and national operators the world over. The Energy Web consortium has more than 100 organizations. EW technology enables any energy asset owned by any customer to participate in any energy&nbsp;market.</p><p>The Energy Web Chain (EWC) “is a public, enterprise-grade blockchain platform designed for the energy sector’s regulatory, operational, and market needs. Launched in mid-2019, it has become the industry’s leading choice as the foundational digital infrastructure on which to build and run blockchain-based decentralized applications (dApps)”&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">link</a>].</p><p>The teams of Ocean and Energy Web have been quietly collaborating since 2017, when both projects were at inception stages. Ocean has contributed to EW’s annual Event Horizon conference, for example with this 2019 talk “Energy Data and Access Management” [<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/TrentMcConaghy/energy-data-access-management-with-ocean-protocol">slides</a>][<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC50EARadwo&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a>]. Moreover, both Energy Web and Ocean have long-standing collaborations in the Kusama / Polkadot ecosystems. Ocean and Energy Web have grown up together.</p><p>EWC is EVM-compatible, which allows it to run Ethereum smart contracts and use Ethereum-style ERC20 tokens. It’s currently a <a href="https://twitter.com/energywebx/status/1051832833579266049?lang=en">Proof-of-Authority</a> chain with a modern consensus algorithm built on <a href="https://www.parity.io/technologies/substrate/">Parity Substrate</a> technology. This allows it to have low gas fees and low latency compared to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p>The <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:96856f1abC947322AcAeC3f3eBAb01Ef29B7E605">first dataset published in&nbsp;EWT</a>.<p>With Ocean deployed to EWC, this&nbsp;means:</p>  Users of<a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com"> Ocean Market</a> can publish, swap, stake, and consume data assets in&nbsp;EWC.  Data marketplace builders and other dApp developers can use Ocean libraries (ocean.js, ocean.py) and frontend components (<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market">market</a>) with&nbsp;EWC.  Token holders can move their<a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x967da4048cd07ab37855c090aaf366e4ce1b9f48"> OCEAN on Ethereum mainnet</a> to OCEAN on EWC, and back using<a href="http://binance.com"> </a>the <a href="https://bridge.energyweb.org">Energy Web Token Bridge</a> or the <a href="https://bridge.carbonswap.exchange/bridge">CarbonSwap OmniBridge</a>.  <p>Ocean components supported in EWC include: Ocean smart contracts, Ocean Market, Provider (for data services), Aquarius (metadata cache), and Ocean Subgraph (The Graph queries). For more details, visit our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#energy-web-chain">Supported Networks</a>&nbsp;page.</p> Cross-chain Mental&nbsp;Model <p>Ocean is now deployed to five production networks: Ethereum mainnet, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-polygon-network-8abad19cbf47">Polygon mainnet (Matic)</a>, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-binance-smart-chain-6bfe715a492c">Binance Smart Chain (BSC)</a>, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-moonriver-d4f3e26fbc5">Moonriver</a>, and (new) Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>An <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> user can click on the network preference in the top right, and toggle which chains they would like to see the assets for. EWC is now in this list and selected by default for all new&nbsp;users.</p>Default selected networks now include Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.<p>In each of these networks, tokens on the network have real value associated, so there need to be token bridges across networks. For EWC this&nbsp;is:</p>  <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN</a> on Ethereum mainnet gets bridged across as OCEAN on&nbsp;EWC.  ETH for gas fees on Ethereum mainnet corresponds to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moonriver">EWT</a> for gas fees on&nbsp;EWC.  EWT is the native token on Moonriver used for gas&nbsp;fees.<p>For dApp developers, as with other networks, in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js">ocean.js</a> the Energy Web Chain chainId is passed to the ConfigHelper to get all required endpoints for initializing Ocean, while in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py">ocean.py</a> the respective RPC URL needs to be set as the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/parameters.md">network config parameter</a>.</p> Resources on Ocean *&nbsp;EWC   <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#energy-web-chain">Docs: Ocean-related tokens and services in&nbsp;EWC</a>  <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/tokens/0x593122AAE80A6Fc3183b2AC0c4ab3336dEbeE528">OCEAN contract in EWC blockchain explorer</a>  <a href="https://bridge.energyweb.org">Energy Web Token&nbsp;Bridge</a>  <a href="https://bridge.carbonswap.exchange/bridge">CarbonSwap OmniBridge</a>   Announcement Statements <blockquote>With the decentralization of energy assets, energy market participants need your data to operate the markets.

<p>Settembre 2021: InfoCert riconosciuta come Leader a livello mondiale nel mercato dell’eSignature nell’IDC MarketScape: Worldwide eSignature Software 2021 Vendor Assessment (doc #US46742320, September 2021).</p>



<p>Nello studio, che ha preso in considerazione 15 tra i più importanti fornitori di soluzioni di firma elettronica a livello mondiale, in virtù delle proprie capacità e strategie connesse alla propria offerta, InfoCert si posiziona nella “Leaders category”.</p>



<p>Lo studio di IDC esamina vari fornitori di software di firma elettronica in tutto il mondo. Le soluzioni di firma elettronica sono un elemento importante per migliorare sia l’efficienza che l’esperienza dei flussi di lavoro incentrati sui contenuti tra imprese e tra imprese e consumatori.</p>



<p>In un momento storico in cui un numero crescente di documenti “nasce digitale” e le Organizzazioni continuano a digitalizzare i flussi di lavoro incentrati sui contenuti, la firma elettronica ha permesso a questi flussi di lavoro di rimanere digitali e apportare benefici, tra cui la riduzione dei tempi e dei costi delle transazioni, una maggiore sicurezza e una migliore user experience per dipendenti, fornitori, partner e clienti.</p>



<blockquote><p>Il contributo della tecnologia della firma elettronica alla continuità aziendale è diventato lampante durante la pandemia COVID-19. Le carenze sono risultate evidenti nelle Organizzazioni prive di processi aziendali completamente digitalizzati e i lavoratori in remoto hanno dovuto cercare metodi alternativi per portare avanti il lavoro.</p>Holly Muscolino – Research vice president, Content Strategies and the Future of Work</blockquote>



 InfoCert e la sua soluzione di eSignature: GoSign

<p>Cheating in esports is a pressing issue as it poses a threat to all involved stakeholders. From players to developers, tournament hosts, and sponsors, if a tournament is damaged by the presence of cheaters, the fallout is never good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially with esports being such a fast paced and modern environment, negative news spreads like wildfire and just one incident could have lasting repercussions, sometimes even to a point of no return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why it’s vital to detect and prevent online gaming fraud and one of the best ways to do this is through the use of AI-powered identity verification systems. But what exactly does this mean and how does it all work? Let’s break it all down step by step.&nbsp;</p>
 What is AI-Powered Identity Verification? 
<p>AI-powered Identity verification is a system that combines the best of human instinct and technology with modern machine learning technology to verify the identity of users. It allows for a streamlined user experience and, with tools like IDnow’s Autoident, it can be as simple as a user uploading images of their ID documents and following on screen prompts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest advantages of using an AI-powered system are the speed and accuracy of results. It both eliminates time consuming manual inputs, as well as the risk of human error. Overall, it is a both quick and secure method to verify users identification and can be used as both a cheater prevention and age verification tool.&nbsp;</p>
 How could AI-Powered Identity Verification be used for esports? 
<p>There are many ways that an online identification system could be used in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/esports/">esports</a>. It could come as a solution to a key problem of ‘ghost accounts’ – these are new accounts created and used by cheaters when they have been caught and banned on other accounts, allowing them to cheat in a game all over again. This is one of the biggest issues, as there’s currently no real way to stop users from making new accounts and it’s especially problematic in free-to-play games, where there’s no cost to making a new account.</p>
<p>By using an AI-powered identity verification tool, accounts could only be created if they are tied to unique users, which would require official documents and proof of identity, making it much more difficult to make and obtain ghost accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would also come as a deterrent to cheating and other illicit activities in the first place, as players would be held accountable for their accounts and wouldn’t be able to play the game again if they were banned. As the tools require ID verification, it would also aid in preventing fraud and under-age gaming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, it also provides an extra layer of security, as these verification tools can also be used as a multi-factor authentication system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best news is that these AI-powered identity verification systems already exist and successfully function in other markets. Let’s take a look at one example, IDnow.&nbsp;</p>
 How IDnow’s Autoident can solve esports’ cheating problem 
<p>IDnow’s Autoident can be the perfect solution to the outlined problems. It’s an AI-powered identity verification tool that makes it quick and painless for users and is thus a perfect fit for the fast paced esports world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verification can be as simple as downloading an ID verification app, then scanning an ID document and taking a selfie to confirm identity. This is then automatically verified through AI and users can expect results within minutes, all while following simple on screen instructions. Even if there is an issue, IDnow specialists are always available and still able to deliver speedy results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform also boasts great scalability and potential for global deployment as it’s able to identify people anywhere, anytime. In fact, right now there is potential to cover 7 Billion customers from 195 different countries and considering how much of a global phenomenon gaming and esports is, this will be vital for large scale, triple A titles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best of all, IDnow boasts impressive proof of work, having already employed products with over 250 customers, including leading international companies like Lottoland, Bank of Scotland, and Western Union during their seven years in business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this means that IDnow’s Autoident not only fills the gaps in esports current anti-cheater systems, but also has a reliable and experienced team that can provably deliver an exceptional product and service.</p>

 Who This Quick-Start Guide Is For 

<p>This tutorial is intended to show AWS DevOps and Identity Security administrator teams how to securely access Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. Anyone with an interest in Identity Security best practices can learn from this guide, but it assumes at least some knowledge of:</p>
 
   Kubernetes (k8s),  k8s API Server, k8s RBAC Authorization, and k8s role binding 
   AWS Console, EKS, AWS CloudShell 
   Terminal on a end-user workstation (e.g. macOS, Windows, Linux) 
 

 What You’ll Need to Get Started 

<p>The prerequisites to complete this tutorial are:</p>
 
   The tutorial assumes that you’re already using Okta as your identity and authorization solution. However, if you don’t have an existing Okta tenant, you can <a href="https://www.okta.com/free-trial/">create a new one here</a> and follow along.
     
       One or more Okta administrative user(s) 
       One or more Okta test user(s) 
       Okta administrator rights 
     
   
   Workstation(s) running a supported version of macOS, Windows, or Linux
     
       Installation permissions 
       SSH terminal application 
       HTTPS web browser (recommended) 
     
   
 

 What is Okta? 

<p>Okta, Inc. is an identity and access management company, providing cloud software that helps companies manage and secure user authentication into applications, and for developers to build identity controls into applications, websites, web services, and devices. You get scalable authentication built right into your application without the development overhead, security risks, and maintenance that come from building it yourself.</p>

 What is Kubernetes? 

<p>Kubernetes, also known by the abbreviation k8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. See  <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">https://kubernetes.io/</a>.</p>

 What is AWS EKS? 

<p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed container service to run and scale Kubernetes applications in the cloud or on-premises. See  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">https://aws.amazon.com/eks/</a>.</p>

<p>To deploy k8s clusters on your own infrastructure, you can use EKS Anywhere. See  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/">https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/</a></p>

 Okta + EKS: How Do They Work Together? 

<p>Let’s take an EKS cluster deployed in AWS. We’ll perform the following steps:</p>

 
   add Okta as an OIDC provider to the EKS cluster 
   configure the k8s API server so it prompts the user for Authentication (AuthN) 
   configure RBAC Authorization (AuthZ), mapping Okta groups with given k8s roles 
   leverage an OIDC plugin that 1) prompts the user for AuthN in the web browser and 2) retrieves the <a>JSON Web Token  (JWT)</a> <code>id_token</code> from Okta and passes it to our <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl (Kubernetes command-line tool)</a> commands 
 

<p>Ready? Let’s get started!</p>

 Configuration 

<p>Let’s first deploy a brand new EKS cluster. We’ll do it manually from the AWS Console.</p>

<p>Note: We recommend configuring <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/okta-idp.html">access to the AWS Console using Okta SSO+MFA</a>.</p>

 Create a New Cluster Service Role 

 
   Go to  <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?#/roles">https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?#/roles</a>  &gt; Create role 
 

<p></p>

 
   Select trusted entity = AWS service, and click on the EKS service 
 

<p></p>

 
   Click on use case = EKS - Cluster, then Next: Permission. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Verify that AmazonEKSClusterPolicy is included in the attached permissions policies. Click on Next: Tags. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Click on Next: Review. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Enter EKSCluster as Role name. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Once your role is created, go back to the list of roles and open EKSCluster to double-check it’s properly configured: 
 

<p></p>

 Create a New EKS Cluster 

<p>Let’s create a brand new EKS cluster.</p>

 
   Go to EKS 
 

<p></p>

 
   Click on Clusters &gt; Add cluster &gt; Create. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Enter a name: eks-cluster. Select the Cluster Service Role created in the previous section EKSCluster. Then click on Next. 
 

<p></p>

 
   On the next Networking screen, keep the default options and click on Next: 
 

<p></p>

 
   On the Logging screen, keep the default options and click on Next: 
 

<p></p>

 
   On the Review and create screen, click on Create: 
 

<p></p>

<p>Your EKS cluster will take a couple of minutes to start. In the meantime, let’s do the configuration on the Okta side. Then we’ll come back to the AWS Console to configure Okta as the OIDC provider for the EKS cluster.</p>

 Configure Your Okta Org 

<p>In the Okta admin console, we’ll create a group of users that we’ll assign to a OIDC client, and we’ll configure the AuthZ Server to inject the list of groups into the <code>id_token</code>.</p>

 
   Go to your Okta admin console 
   Let’s create a group. Go to the sidebar menu and select Directory &gt; Groups &gt; Add Group. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Then enter eks-admins in the Name field, and in the Description field enter Admins who can administer the EKS cluster: 
 

<p></p>

 
   Click Save. Then assign yourself to this group. From the Group screen, go to the People tab and click on Assign people: 
 

<p></p>

 
   Search for your user and click on the +: 
 

<p></p>

<p>You should see that your user is now assigned to the eks-admins group:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now we’ll create a new OIDC client. We’ll leverage the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcodepkce/main/#grant-type-flow">AuthCode + PKCE grant type</a> since the terminal to access EKS clusters will be running on the laptops of DevOps team members, and like any native app, it can’t host any secrets.</p>

 
   While still in your Okta admin console, go to the sidebar menu and select Applications &gt; Applications. On the Applications screen select Create App Integration: 
 

<p></p>

 
   Select Sign-in method OIDC - OpenID Connect, Application type Native Application, then click Next: 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Enter the following settings:</p>

     
       App integration name: EKS 
       Grant type: Authorization Code only 
       Set the Sign-in redirect URIs to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000</a>  (Eventually, we’ll run the kubectl commands from our laptop.) 
       For Controlled access select Allow everyone in your organization to access 
     
   
 

<p></p>

 
   Then Save. 
   In the General tab, be sure to select Use PKCE. Then copy the Client ID, we’ll need it later: 
 

<p></p>

 
   Now let’s create an Authorization Server. Go to the sidebar menu, select Security &gt; API. Then go to Authorization Servers tab and select Add Authorization Server. 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Enter the following settings:</p>

     
       Name: EKS 
       Audience:  <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000</a> 
     
   
   
    <p>Click on Save.</p>
   
 

<p></p>

 
   On the next screen, copy the Issuer URL from the Settings tab. We’ll need it later: 
 

<p></p>

<p>Now let’s add a custom claim “groups” in the <code>id_token</code> that Okta will generate, to list the groups of the connected user.</p>

 
   Go to the Claims tab and select Add Claim. 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Use the following settings to add the groups claim in the <code>id_token</code>:</p>

     
       Name: groups 
       Include in token type: ID Token - Always 
       Value type: Groups. 
       Filter: Starts with eks- (This means we’ll only list the connected user’s groups whose names start with “eks-“) 
       Include in: Any scope 
     
   
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Now let’s create an access policy on this AuthZ Server to drive when the AuthZ Server should mint the <code>id_token</code>.</p>

     
       Go to the Access Policies tab and select Add Policy 
     
   
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Enter the following Policy settings:</p>

     
       Policy name: EKS 
       Description: EKS 
       Assign to: The following clients 
       Clients: EKS (Look for the OIDC client you created earlier.) 
     
   
 

<p></p>

 
   Once you Create Policy, add a rule. Click on Add Rule: 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Enter the following Rule settings:</p>

     
       Rule Name: AuthCode + PKCE 
       Grant type is: Authorization Code 
       User is: Any user assigned the app 
       Scopes requested: Any scopes 
     
   
   
    <p>Then click on Create Rule.</p>
   
 

<p></p>

<p>You should see this view:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now let’s run a test to see what our <code>id_token</code> will look like when the Okta AuthZ Server mints it.</p>

 
   Go to the Token Preview tab and enter the following Request Properties:
     
       OAuth/OIDC client: EKS 
       Grant type: Authorization Code 
       User: your user 
       Under Scopes, enter openid, email, profile, offline_access 
     
   
   
    <p>Then click on Token Preview. On the right side of the screen, you’ll  see a preview of your <code>id_token</code>. So far it has all the claims we’re looking for, including:</p>

     
       “email”: typically matches your Okta username 
       “groups”: contains an array of groups the user is a member of, including “eks-admins” 
     
   
 

<p></p>

<p>The configuration on the Okta side is complete.</p>

 Add Okta as an OIDC Provider on Your EKS Cluster 

<p>Now let’s get back to the AWS Console:</p>

 
   Open the eks-cluster view. Go to the Configuration tab, then select Authentication, and click on Associate Identity Provider. 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Enter the following parameters:</p>

     
       Name: Okta 
       Issuer URL: This is the URL you copied earlier from your Okta AuthZ Server. 
       Client ID: This is the value you copied earlier from your Okta OIDC client. 
       Username claim: email 
       Groups claim: groups 
     
   
   
    <p>Then Save.</p>
   
 

<p></p>

<p>Note: Your EKS cluster configuration may take 5-10 minutes to update after you add the OIDC provider.</p>

<p>Now let’s update the <code>kubeconfig</code> of the EKS cluster so the API server prompts for authentication whenever there’s an inbound kubectl request. We’ll also add an RBAC control stating that a user part of the eks-admins Okta group will have the k8s ClusterRole cluster-admin.</p>

<p>To update the EKS <code>kubeconfig</code> we’ll use AWS CloudShell. It’s particularly convenient to make quick updates if you <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/okta-idp.html">access the AWS Console with Okta SSO</a>  and assume a given role, as we did earlier in this tutorial:</p>

<p></p>

 
   Go to AWS CloudShell using the search field in the AWS Console. 
 

<p></p>

<p>You should land on this view:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s install <code>kubectl</code> (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/">source</a>):</p>

 
   Download the latest release: 
 

   <code>curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
</code>   

 
   Download the kubectl checksum file 
 

   <code>curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"
</code>   

 
   Validate the kubectl binary against the checksum file 
 

   <code>echo "$(&lt;kubectl.sha256) kubectl" | sha256sum --check
</code>   

<p>If valid, the output should be:</p>

<p></p>

 
   Install <code>kubectl</code> 
 

   <code>sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
</code>   

 
   Test to ensure that we installed an up-to-date version. 
 

   <code>kubectl version --client
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Now, let’s retrieve the list of EKS clusters in the specified region (us-west-1): 
 

   <code>aws eks --region us-west-1 list-clusters
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Add a new context for the eks-cluster in the <code>kubeconfig</code> file: 
 

   <code>aws eks --region us-west-1 update-kubeconfig --name eks-cluster
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Let’s see what our <code>kubeconfig</code> file looks like. 
 

   <code>kubectl config view
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Let’s double-check the current context: 
 

   <code>kubectl config current-context
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Install nano (text editor) 
 

   <code>sudo yum install -y nano
</code>   

 
   
    <p>Create a cluster role binding:</p>

     
       Create a new yaml file 
     
   
 

   <code>nano oidc-cluster-admin-by-group.yaml
</code>   

 
   Paste the following content: 
 

   <code>kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
    name: oidc-cluster-admin
roleRef:
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRole
    name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: Group
    name: eks-admins
</code>   
 
   enter  CTRL-O  to save the file 
   then  CTRL-X  to close the file 
   Create the cluster role binding from the yaml file 
 

   <code>kubectl create -f oidc-cluster-admin-by-group.yaml
</code>   

 
   Apply the cluster role binding: 
 

   <code>kubectl apply -f oidc-cluster-admin-by-group.yaml
</code>   

 
   Edit the local kubeconfig file and add the OIDC config 
 

   <code>nano $HOME/.kube/config
</code>   

 
   Insert the part in red below: 
 

<p></p>

<p>Below is the text to include:</p>
   <code>- name: oidc      
    user:
    exec:
        apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1
        args:
        - oidc-login
        - get-token
        - --oidc-issuer-url=https://nico.okta.com/oauth2/auscierlvzfBoWkKC2p7
        - --oidc-client-id=0oacieu408ExEjXwu2p7
        - --oidc-extra-scope=email
        - --oidc-extra-scope=offline_access
        - --oidc-extra-scope=profile
        - --oidc-extra-scope=openid
        - --oidc-extra-scope=groups
        command: kubectl
</code>   

<p>This basically specifies the config of the OIDC provider. Note: Replace the <code>oidc-issuer-url</code> and <code>oidc-client-id</code> with Issuer URL and Client ID we copied earlier.</p>

<p>Once you’re done editing the file:</p>

 
   enter  CTRL-O  to save the file. 
   then enter  CTRL-X  to close the file. 
 

<p>At this point the EKS cluster is properly configured to use Okta as an OIDC provider.</p>

<p>From CloudShell, we can retrieve the list of pods in our cluster with our current assumed role.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Let’s now look into how we can run a similar command from the terminal on our local machine.</p>

<p>There are two things we need to configure:</p>

 
   
    <p>Export the <code>kubeconfig</code> file and import it to your laptop.</p>
   
   
    <p>Configure a kubectl OIDC plugin to prompt the user for AuthN and request an <code>id_token</code>. We’ll use <a href="https://github.com/int128/kubelogin">kubelogin</a>.</p>
   
 

<p>From your CloudShell, enter the command:</p>

   <code>echo $HOME
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>The path to our kubeconfig file is <code>/home/cloudshell-user/.kube/config</code>, as shown above.</p>

 
   Let’s download that file. Click on Actions at the top right of CloudShell, then click on Download file. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Paste the path to your <code>kubeconfig</code> file and click on Download. 
 

<p></p>

<p>You should now have a copy of the config file in your Downloads folder.</p>

 
   
    <p>Install kubectl on your local machine. (See the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/">instructions to install kubectl on macOS</a>).</p>
   
   
    <p>Double-check that kubectl is properly installed.</p>
   
 

   <code>kubectl version --client
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>On your Mac, replace the existing kubeconfig file with the one you downloaded from CloudShell:</p>

     
       Open your Finder on your Mac, then CMD-SHIFT-G. 
       Enter ~/.kube/config then click Go. 
     
   
 

<p></p>

 
   Rename any existing config files as a backup and add the one from CloudShell: 
 

<p></p>

 
   Open a terminal on your laptop and run: 
 

   <code>kubectl config get-contexts
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   If you don’t see a “*” in front of the desired context, run: 
 

   <code>kubectl config use-context arn:aws:eks:us-west-1:013353681016:cluster/eks-cluster
</code>   

<p>You may want to adjust the context name in the above command based on the context name in your own config file.</p>

<p>You may want to adjust the context name in the above command based on the context name in your own config file.</p>

<p>You may want to adjust the context name in the above command based on the context name in your own config file.</p>

 
   Double-check that the current context is properly set. 
 

   <code>kubectl config get-contexts
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Install <a href="https://github.com/int128/kubelogin">kubelogin</a>  (the OIDC helper for kubectl). Run this for mac/Linux: 
 

   <code>brew install int128/kubelogin/kubelogin
</code>   

 
   Now let’s try to test the first part of the AuthN flow. Run the following command. (Be sure to replace the <code>oidc-issuer-url</code> and <code>oidc-client-id</code> with your own values.): 
 

   <code>kubectl oidc-login setup --oidc-issuer-url=https://nico.okta.com/oauth2/auscierlvzfBoWkKC2p7 --oidc-client-id=0oacieu408ExEjXwu2p7
</code>   

<p>You should be prompted to authenticate in your web browser against your Okta org.</p>

<p></p>

 
   After authenticating, you should be redirected to localhost:8000 in your web browser, with an OK response. 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>You can close this tab.</p>
   
   
    <p>Check your terminal. You should see a confirmation that you’ve received an <code>id_token</code> from Okta:</p>
   
 

<p></p>

 
   We’re ready to make a final test. Run: 
 

   <code>kubectl --user=oidc get pods --all-namespaces
</code>   

<p>If you’re not already Okta-authenticated you’ll be prompted for AuthN. You should be able to see your list of pods:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully configured Okta as an OIDC provider to access your EKS cluster! 🎉</p>

 Some Extra Checks 

<p>Let’s double-check that our RBAC controls are working as expected. Currently we’re a member of the eks-admins Okta group in the Universal Directory.</p>

 
   Let’s remove ourselves from the eks-admins group in the Okta admin console. 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Then, let’s delete the cached <code>id_token</code> on our laptop.</p>

     
       In your terminal, run: 
     
   
 

   <code>cd ~/.kube/cache/oidc-login
</code>   

 
   List files in your cache folder. 
 

   <code>ls
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   That first file contains the <code>id_token</code> Okta minted. Let’s delete it. 
 

   <code>rm 8ead66f63afa81d7300257989c391d035f386b80758a2847c99d37ecdd5610e0
</code>   

 
   Double-check that your cache folder is empty. 
 

   <code>ls
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Ok, now let’s try again to retrieve the list of pods. 
 

   <code>kubectl --user=oidc get pods --all-namespaces
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>As expected, we’re not authorized. Since we’re no longer a member of the eks-admins Okta group, the group is no longer injected in the <code>id_token</code>, and the Kubernetes API Server no longer applies the cluster-admin role.</p>

 
   Once again, let’s delete the cached <code>id_token</code> in the <code>~/.kube/cache/oidc-login</code> folder. 
   Let’s add ourselves again to the eks-admins Okta group. 
 

<p>We should now be able to access the list of pods as before:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Pretty cool right? 😎</p>

 Automation for Your AWS EKS Workflow 

<p>All the manual steps in this tutorial can be automated:</p>

 
   AWS exposes <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">REST APIs</a> and a <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws/latest">Terraform Provider</a>. 
   Okta exposes <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/postman-collections/">REST APIs</a> and a <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">Terraform Provider</a> 
 

 Learn More About Identity Security 

<p>You successfully configured Okta as a third party OIDC provider on your EKS cluster, and applied RBAC to enforce least privilege without the need to configure AWS IAM roles. This allows you to have a very generic AuthN/AuthZ framework, for all your Kubernetes (k8s) clusters, regardless of where they run (public cloud, private cloud, or on-prem).</p>

 DM Note #6 — Building the Spatial Justice&nbsp;Mission <p>This is the sixth in a series of<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/"> DM notes</a>, in which we write about insights from our work on the ground, following internal learning sessions called DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</p><p>As some of you might know, Dark Matter Labs emerged from the interest of revealing and transforming the forces dictating our built environment. The Spatial Justice mission formalises this intention that still drives us: understanding institutional innovation, systemic challenges, and social justice through built form and lived spaces. In partnership with communities and governments around the world, we aim at developing the open systems for tech enabled, democratic and sustainable urban&nbsp;futures.</p> Why Spatial&nbsp;Justice? <p>Spatial justice is not a new term. It references an established body of academic work and activism that frames social justice not just as concerned with distribution of wealth and power amongst individuals or groups, but one that shaped and driven by the geography and place in which it takes place. How we organise and experience space can lock in injustice and ecological degradation, or can accelerate equity and agency, a good economic recovery and support climate transition.</p><p>One of the first steps in understanding this area of work is to delineate a set series of scales of spatial justice: from the discreet materials that make up our buildings, through to scales that are in themselves complex systems, like cities or bio-regions.</p><p>Over the past few years and across many initiatives and geographies, we have been working on building a mission around spatial justice that recognizes that the intimate spaces of our homes and the community spaces of our neighbourhoods have become the minimum viable units for systemic&nbsp;change.</p><p>The second step is to focus heavily on the invisible layers of design that shape those physical scales; centring heavily on contemporary bureaucracy, financial incentives, and governance structures (eg. planning policy, urban use licenses, property laws, etc.) — and investigating these as active sites for creating spatial&nbsp;justice.</p> Focus areas: <p>Out of this framing we have landed on four focus areas of work, and seek projects, initiatives, and willing partners for advancing this:</p><p>Socializing the value of&nbsp;land</p>  Equity in access and affordability  Civic ownership &amp; governance  Linking land value to civic and social infrastructure  Linking land value to civic outcomes (eg. air&nbsp;quality)  <p>Locally-led Just Climate Transition</p>  Building community capacity, collective ownership and resilience  Developing models that support additional long-term investment  Changing the dynamics of finance and local&nbsp;places  <p>Material circulatory and self sovereignty</p>  Beyond human asset ownership and extraction  Indigenous law and legal sovereignty of materials  National material passports and performance registry  <p>(performance based) Contract innovation</p>  Focus on performance rather than&nbsp;objects  Live energy use intensity contracts   Projects <p>Supporting greater equality and transitioning our urban economies beyond carbon will require unprecedented levels of intervention and investment, and in turn, a new model of democratic and collective ownership and management. The following projects, being developed across North America and Europe each explore various possibilities on how to rethink our relationship to the land and how we use&nbsp;it.</p> Smart Covenant / Smart&nbsp;Commons Real estate value impact of New York’s&nbsp;Highline<p>Public investment in shared infrastructure results in disproportionate private profit through land value uplift. This problem which underpins our current model of urban development, fuelling land speculation and creating unequal and unsustainable neighbourhoods. We need to find ways to redesign our land&nbsp;economy.</p><p>In collaboration with <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/">EIT Climate-KIC</a> and <a href="http://spatialtech.info/">Centre for Spatial Technologies</a>, Dark Matter Labs are developing a platform that brings together smart contracts, property value data and distributed ledgers to more fairly distribute this public value, by creating a mechanism to invest in building more sustainable communities.</p><p>Since the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">publication of Smart Commons on Medium</a>, we built on the feedback we received to better understand the technical and cultural barriers in the realization of that vision. We then further adapted these proposals to other areas we are working on to further develop them, such as micro-contracting for the retrofit of buildings.</p><p>Partners: EIT Climate-KIC and Centre for Spatial Technologies</p> Open Whole Community Retrofit Ecosystem <p>To meet our current climate targets almost every home and neighbourhood in the UK will need to be retrofitted to reduce energy and resource demand, reduce flood risk, urban heat island effects and manage and reduce associated liabilities. This is also a massive opportunity to create better and healthier homes and neighbourhoods as well as a whole new sector of the&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Previous approaches to retrofit have failed dismally. This is often because government has assumed that the best way forward is to create subsidies for individual measures for individual households.</p><p>Furthermore the UK remains a deeply unequal and highly centralized society and current proposals around ‘levelling up’ remain poorly articulated, governed and resourced. More than ten years of austerity have significantly damaged local capacity and resilience.</p><p>This project seeks to use new investment logic (transformation capital), to create positive change and support the tangible and intangible assets in our communities (community capital) by using new forms of contracting and better understanding of spillover value flows (civic value) and changing the dynamics between financial institutions and local places. Rather than an atomized approach, we are exploring how locally accountable climate transition organisations can support collective change, and how this might be replicated.</p><p>Transformation Capital is the deployment of capital to fundamentally change dynamics of the (real-economy) system, setting it on an environmentally and socially sustainable footing, as well enabling the continued multiplication of capital in the long run. This will go way beyond small shifts being currently assumed through ESG investment paradigm.</p><p>When this is aligned with places and communities in a way that, rather extracting their value, generates compound, multiplying value (for both private and public actors) and invests in the networks of trust, deliberation and agency at local level alongside climate transition projects themselves, this marrying of transformation capital and community capital can establish a new model for systemic, non-extractive investment logic.</p><p>Partners: Working with Thirty Percy, Lankelly Chase, EIT-Climate KIC, TransCap Initiative, and Civic Square, the project is currently engaging residents on a street in Birmingham, to help the residents envision potential street-scale propositions, such as street retrofit, and rewiring and integrating their value&nbsp;flows.</p> Healthy, Clean Cities EU&nbsp;CINCO <p><a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/press-releases/eit-climate-kic-and-partners-collaborate-with-laudes-foundation-to-advance-madrid-and-milan-sustainable-urban-approach-across-europe-2/">Healthy, Clean Cities EU CINCO</a> is a two-year initiative, supported by Laudes Foundation, which focusses on accelerating efforts to minimise embodied carbon in new buildings, supporting circular practices and increasing uptake of bio-based materials. Acting in the cities of Madrid and Milan as the two initial testbeds, Dark Matter Labs is working with a consortium of European design partners, coordinated by EIT Climate-KIC, alongside implementation partners who include: City of Madrid, Commune di Milano, AMAT, Redo, Distrito Castellana Norte, Arup, Politecnico di Milano and itdUPM. The testbeds are two of Europe’s largest urban regeneration projects: Madrid Nuevo Norte and Milan’s L’Innesto.</p><p>The consortium is working closely with local partners to identify and develop innovations which could support greenhouse gas neutrality of a development over its full lifecycle, considering opportunities throughout the value chain, including: policy and regulation; financing; citizen engagement; digital tools and data; and materials and processes. Dark Matter Labs is specifically focussing on the areas of policy and regulation, contractual innovation and digital and data infrastructure.</p><p>Partners: Design partners — EIT Climate-KIC, Bankers Without Boundaries, Democratic Society and Material Economics + Implementation partners — City of Madrid, Commune di Milano, AMAT, Redo, Distrito Castellana Norte, Arup, Politecnico di Milano and&nbsp;itdUPM</p> Material Registry / Performance-Based Contracting Mapping the life cycle impacts of an electric hire&nbsp;bicycle<p>Material Registry is a concept for an open registry of embodied impact data and in-use performance data for buildings and their constituent components, that could enable performance-based contracting and regulation in the built environment. If implemented it would enable better decisions on building retrofit, material circularity and minimizing environmental impacts.</p><p>The registry would provide open access to standardized and reliable data on embodied carbon, materials, processes and labour; component condition, location and performance such as air quality, temperature and humidity.</p><p>In collaboration with the Centre for Spatial Technologies, Dark Matter Labs has been developing an animation to illustrate the lifecycle of a self-sovereign window that describes the matter, processes and the embodied impacts it contains as well as the possible futures it could become part&nbsp;of.</p><p>Self-sovereign objects are are self-executing and self-owning; capable of determining their own lifecycle to maximise material utility and performance whilst minimizing negative environmental impacts. Augmented by sensing capabilities and the ability to autonomously execute smart contracts, material objects could continuously monitor their own performance and contract for their maintenance, repair or recycling.</p><p>Partners: Centre for Spatial Technologies, EIT Climate-KIC</p> Community Wealth / Perpetual Affordability <p>In Canada close to 79% of wealth is invested in real estate both directly through home ownership but also through our investments, pension plans and education funds for our children. There is a similar situation in many other countries.</p><p>This leads to our economy, our money and political systems being locked into unsustainable policies and paradigms of ever increasing land values (and the attendant housing affordability crises) and new construction (and the challenges around material use set out above as well as possibly social&nbsp;costs).</p><p>Community Wealth focuses on systematic change in the ways we view wealth and its purpose by transitioning away from a dichotomy of private and public property ownership towards portfolios of community assets, jointly owned and governed. We believe this would better allow us to address the affordability gap that is breaking apart our social fabric, as well as create solutions for climate&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>One of the pathways towards this long-term horizon goal is through creation of a parallel housing market that would focus on the ‘missing middle’ of the Canadian residential real estate market. By aggregating capital at a national level through a fund and deploying it locally to participatory districts, first-time home buyers as well as existing home owners would be able to transition towards a new model of “perpetual stewardship”.</p><p>We are focusing on specific components of the long-term horizon and prototyping the following connected proposals:</p>  “Free House” where smart perpetual bond meets self-sovereign house meets stewardship contract;  “Community wealth portfolio” which consists of: affordable homes (via Free House and other models); Renewable energy; Shared Transportation; Local small businesses (via retail real estate); Natural assets; and Co-sharing working space (via office real&nbsp;estate);  “Smart Perpetual Bond” — long-term instrument for capitalizing the community wealth portfolio;  “Participatory District” — a new type of intermediary that holds all above-land assets; jointly owned and governed by: residents, community foundations, community groups (social enterprises, not for profits working to meet community needs) and government;  “Smart Community Trust” — asset holder of all land in perpetuity.  <p>Partners: United Properties Resource Corporation, CMHC, Watershed Partners, Third Space Planning and Generation Squeeze</p> Key Questions, Lessons and Challenges Moving&nbsp;Forward   Getting to the right mission framing: Spatial Justice encompasses a very broad range of topics. What are we missing or overstepping the line with the framing to better organise internally around the key platform components that we want to build for the just climate transition of the built environment? How do our projects interact?  Understanding real estate as a system: How do we understand ‘real estate’ as a system for spatial justice? How can we address materials (build quality, lifespan, carbon, maintenance), supply chain (labour rights, skill level, regenerative), ownership (power, legal setup, governance), finance (liquidity, value) and data (behaviour, technology, openness) in that&nbsp;system?  Lack of quality information on materials: Currently, we lack of good quality information on buildings. We lack open, verified data on: Supply chain (Materials; Processes; Carbon; Labour practices..), Performance of components (Air tightness; Thermal insulation; Condition; Reuse potential…) and Performance of spaces (Indoor air quality; Temperature; Humidity; Light…). What are the best ways to change&nbsp;that?  Various horizons are important: At least 3 horizons are key to the mission’ advancement; Horizon 1 teaches the sequencing in the pathway, Horizon 2 constructs a macro solution within existing system, and Horizon 3 illustrates the possibility of the mission and creates an alternative system. We needed to advance on all three horizons simultaneously in order to move towards a possibility of the solution.  Moving towards longer term mission-wide funding: Carefully crafting partnerships and prototypes takes time and resources; we needed to strike a balance between allocating our capacity and ensuring that we are eventually getting paid for the work we are developing, or better developing mission-wide funding&nbsp;support.  Building financial models can be fun and visionary: Building a financial model is extremely important and fun; it forces us to look carefully at numbers, decide what connections and correlations made sense, and establish where are the gaps. Once that work is completed, we could replicate the model to other prototypes in other initiatives across our portfolio.  Recognizing the tensions behind the numbers: Much of this work hypothesises that monetizing intangible co-benefits — such as the value of heritage, wellbeing, access to nature, and so on — will drive different investment flows and result in better outcomes. Most current investment decisions are justified through quantitative analysis and therefore developing better systems for this is of significant benefit. But there are dangers in this approach: Even an evidence-based process of quantification is compromised with assumptions and can be corrupted and opaque. The numbers should support open, transparent and democratic conversations about values and trade offs — for example, do we want to give more weight to heritage or nature? There are some values which are beyond quantification e.g. The spiritual value of a tree. Furthermore financialization should be complemented by Effective and genuine participation, better regulation and reformed political systems for&nbsp;example.  Addressing uneven power dynamics between capital and community: One common thread was about here seems to be unequal power dynamics between finance and the places where some of the projects operate, and how local actors with what feels like enormous scale systems. Existing systems create certain rules and paradigms that have to shift to make it more equitable. How can we ensure that the terms of engagement be fairer (security, returns, scale,&nbsp;etc.).  Imagining land trusts beyond discounted capital: Land trusts are a powerful tool that have shown immense potential, however they generally work on the basis that somebody has to write off some or all of the price of the land at the outset. In other words, it requires discounted capital to operationalize itself, which can limit in part the scaling of the model. What we are trying to achieve in some of the emergent models we are working on is to trying to acknowledge the current value, and then create a deviation from it, in a way that can work as a more universal mechanism. How can we build that not in opposition but with or in support of the existing land trust movement around the&nbsp;world?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Alexei Balaganski, Lead Analyst and Chief Technology Officer at KuppingerCole will discuss the Human Factor in Cybersecurity on Wednesday, November 10 from 11:00 am to 13:00 pm in the first track at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Alexei some questions about the track.</p>
   
 What exactly is the human factor in cybersecurity after all? 
<p>Well, here we are starting with the right questions. Yeah, cybersecurity, in general, is a field where everything depends on the right definition because more often than not, we hear people talking about things which they call a certain title or name or definition or buzzword. But they talk about totally different things, right? Whether it's cloud or Zero Trust or even blockchain. It may mean different things. And the same applies to the "human factor". I would say, first of all, it's more than one thing with regard to cybersecurity. Perhaps I would try to identify at least three.</p>
<p>The most obvious one is, to err is human, everyone makes mistakes, and especially it applies to users of information technology. So it's the normal business people, not the experts. They are doing their job, they're trying to do it as securely as possible, of course, but they just have no idea how to do it properly, how to deal with all the technology. So they make mistakes. And sometimes this can lead to a massive data breach or a compliance violation. Not very often, but it can. Of course, there is a lot of bad actors out there who try to exploit this. We have a multitude of different attack vectors. The most obvious ones are social engineering, where you just get an email, which looks normal, it might even come from your CEO and you click a link and you get a malware download and you have a ransomware attack. Or it might lead to a discussion with a person that pretends to be CEO and you end up wiring all your corporate money to a hacker's account. There is a lot of possibilities to exploit. And everything depends on this human factor.</p>
<p>However, this is not the only thing we have to worry about. One other major problem is the so-called skills gap in cybersecurity. Here we are talking about experts, actual security analysts, technicians, or people who are supposed to protect those, quote-unquote, innocent businesspeople. But you just don't have enough of them. And even those who are employed, are always overworked. They have too many things to deal with, but too little time. So, yes, that's skills gap. It's been, it's existed for a decade at least, and it's only growing. And there is no simple solution on how to address it.</p>
<p>And finally, last but not least, there are people in the company who make executive decisions. These are usually not the technical people. But again, might be your CEO or some other person who decides, OK, we should spend some money and deploy a new security solution. Or perhaps we shouldn't. Or we want to switch to a totally different business platform. Maybe it's Salesforce, maybe something else. But every new business platform comes with a set of new security risks. And if those executive people make those decisions without consulting with proper security specialists like us, for example, at KuppingerCole, this might lead to massive security and compliance problems afterward as well.</p>
<p>So I would say these are three major human factor problems we have to deal with.</p>
 In thinking about the human factor in cybersecurity as you described it right now, we also have to talk about the insider threat. What strategies and probably technologies can help organizations reducing the risk from such threats? 
<p>Again, when we talk about the insider threat, we have to think about multiple different kinds of it. The most obvious one is yes, the most common one is just negligence. People make mistakes. They click the wrong button, they delete a database. Or they click a wrong link and they end up firing off a ransomware attack. Theoretically, any employee can do that. They don't have to be an expert. They don't have to have special access rights, anything can happen. How do you deal with those? Well, it's everything you do, everything you plan and deploy and operate with regards to cybersecurity that has to somehow address all those challenges.</p>
<p>The other kind of insider threat is those disgruntled and privileged employees. Maybe they just want more money. Maybe they want to work for a different company and got to steal your trade secrets. Maybe they are colluding with a hacker and they might be even being blackmailed and forced to deploy malware just to let those hackers start their attack on your company. Again, this is very difficult to deal with because more often than not, you just cannot identify what is the difference between, quote-unquote, normal people acting normally. And again, those, the same people acting maliciously. Perhaps one of the most common ways to at least detect those attacks would be something behavior-based. But you have to observe how your workers act normally, how they work, how they do their daily jobs, and then identify when something uncommon happens, an anomaly. Unfortunately, most of the tools you can get for this purpose are pretty basic in terms of yes, they can identify that something unnatural is happening, but they will struggle to explain why exactly it is unnatural. What exactly is this anomaly about and why you should kind of put all other things aside and investigate it. Solutions that can explain it, I would say they belong to the quote-unquote, next-generation security analytic solutions.</p>
 If I understand you correctly, nowadays, when we no longer recognize the classical divide between inside and outside, we should not distinguish so much the threats from inside from those from outside, is that right? 
<p>Absolutely, not just should not, you cannot anymore, because well, first of all, for many companies, there is no inside anymore. And we are now still working from home for such a long time and will probably continue doing so. So if I am talking to you now from my own home, am I inside the company or not? And of course, a firewall would never detect me doing something malicious because there is no firewall at my home. And even if there was one, it's not connected to our corporate security. So absolutely, there is no more any difference between inside and outside. You have to treat every action, every activity, every potential threat, regardless of where it's coming from.</p>
 Is this where Zero Trust as a concept or strategy comes into play? 
<p>Exactly, Zero Trust, I would say, is a theoretical concept which attempts to address all of those challenges at once. Basically, Zero Trust is the philosophy, it's the idea of how you should completely redesign your corporate network and your corporate security architecture to make sure that you can deal with any of those, quote-unquote, insider threats, whether they happen inside the company or somewhere outside. For example, at home.</p>
<p>So yes, Zero Trust is exactly the solution, but unfortunately, Zero Trust is not a magic pill, not a panacea. It's not something that you can just buy, deploy and forget about. Zero Trust is a new way to operate your business if you will. And the tools are secondary.</p>
 Looking into the future: How do you think the threats will develop in the next three to five years? Will it become more serious or will the "good side" be able to develop faster than the "bad side"? 
<p>Well, I mean, here, in the field of security, we are always on the wrong side, if you will. We will never prevail because a hacker only needs one vulnerability to break your entire system, and you have to deal with all of them at the same time. If you only missed that one, oh, you lost already. So, unfortunately, I would not be optimistic. Cyber attacks will definitely grow in scope and number and power if you will. It's becoming even cheaper than ever now to stage a cyberattack. You can even get one as a service. You only need your credit card and maybe your blockchain or Bitcoin wallet to start with one. So in that regard, no, there is no light at the end of the tunnel, if you will. But there is some hope in the new technologies and in the new approaches to design in your corporate networks.</p>
<p>You've already mentioned Zero Trust. If there is a company that starts with Zero Trust, it doesn't have any legacy network at all. I would say it will be automatically protected from perhaps 95 percent of all the common cyberattacks. So it will never be completely secure, but it will make the job of their IT teams and security teams much, much easier. If you add strong authentication, for example, into the mix, just that alone is a major booster of cybersecurity. And of course, things like security automation. So if you have this combination of modern innovative security technologies, you will be much safer than before. You will not be safe, but at least you will be protected from a lot of drive-by attacks if you will, which are not specifically targeted at you but you will never be the collateral damage in such an attack.</p>
 Do I understand you correctly? Do you think that something like Autonomous Security, which makes security smarter, for example through machine learning, will help companies rule out the human factor in some future time? 
<p>Well, it's a difficult question because, again, we are talking about a thing which many people tend to misunderstand completely. Autonomous security does not equal automated security. Autonomous does not necessarily mean that it's operated by a robot or artificial intelligence. Yes, we know that AI is a huge buzzword nowadays. And we've observed a lot of interesting developments. But we know that even now in cybersecurity, nobody trusts AI to make security decisions. Simply because there is a lot at stake and a wrong decision can ruin your business completely, especially if it's something like manufacturing or high-speed financial trading. So people tend to mistrust AI.</p>
<p>And when we're talking about properly autonomous security, it's probably still managed by a team of security experts. But the team doesn't have to work for you. It might be just the managed service, a multi-tenant managed service even, so someone who's operating your security for you as a service from a remote location. But they are still kind of much closer to your infrastructure and your pain points and bottlenecks to quickly identify any attack. But again, there will still be a human, in the end, making a decision. But your goal is to make sure that that human is the best one, the smartest one, and the one supported by the best tools. So a robot will never replace a human in that regard. But they will help.</p>
 Do you think "never" is a word to be used in that context? 
<p>Well, I dread the times where robots will make all the decisions for us. I think they will be more like Skynet than benevolent...</p>

<p>Last week I wrapped up my first quarter here at NuID, which is also my first 90 days as <a href="https://nuid.io/about.html">COO</a> of the company since I started on July 1st.</p><p>Prior to July 1st it had been 20 years since the last time I formally “resigned” from one company and “joined” a completely different one. &nbsp;I have certainly started many new jobs, projects, roles, and relationships along the way, but this one has been a bit different. &nbsp;Reflecting on it now, the difference is that in the SAP/Ariba/Procurement technology world, my reputation—my identity—was always known even though the responsibility and team may change.</p><p>1998 was my first year as a professional consultant, and during an early performance feedback session my manager said to me something along the lines of, “you can only see into the future twice as far as you’ve come... &nbsp;you’ve only been on the job for 6 months; what do you want to be doing in a year?.” &nbsp;It stuck with me as a truth, I believe it was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbarron/">David Barron</a> that told me that.</p><p>Sometime between 2013 and 2016 I had come far enough in my career and had enough Gladwell-esque sampling under my belt that certain other truths about my values had become quite clear to me. I realized that the teams I had been building, and that had built me, held these common truths as well.</p><p>Things like trust and loyalty are important to me, and I say that because I feel physically uncomfortable if lost, not because they are abstract concepts I’ve merely decided to abide by; they are things that I just am, just feel. &nbsp;Things also like accountability, follow-through, challenging the status-quo.</p><p>Things like learning to not mistake kindness for weakness and developing the experience to teach it as a lesson if I’m mistaken for weak. &nbsp;Things like at the end of the day, I can only work with people that I genuinely like and enjoy, because I can’t be successful if I’m not having a lot of fun while doing it.</p><p>I’ve also shared many times in coaching sessions, and have illustrated in my career that “the best way to get your next job is to be great at the job you have,” not to always be looking for your next move. &nbsp;The process of how I got to the decision to leave SAP-Ariba—and my family of 2,000 of the most amazing people to be found in eProcurement—is one that I’ve been very thoughtful about.</p><p>Starting sometime around the holidays of last year, my mind emotionally started to wander about “what’s, really next?”. &nbsp;I was having instincts I trust begin telling me to think about the next 20 years of my career.</p><p>As I pondered that question over several months, a few things I was able to determine were that:</p>
 
 
<p>I felt the end of the first half of my career was coming</p>
 
 
<p>I was not going to leave SAP to do SAP, or Procurement software elsewhere</p>
 
 
<p>Application verticals are not where I want to be</p>
 
 
<p>Platforms, hyperscalers, low-code/no-code, P2P, and distributed Web3 technologies is where the tip of the spear is</p>
 
 
<p>Identity management is a big internet problem, it’s a separate and common problem across all of these enablers for the Web of the future. And THAT, I’m interested in most indeed!</p>
 
 
<p>I was feeling a draw towards what I was calling Identity Management at the time and began looking into Enterprise Identity SaaS providers</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
<p>Side note – it’s probably not coincidence that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-wolf-ismatsap/">Jason Wolf</a> resigned less than a month before I did to become Ping Identities Chief Revenue Officer.  Jason and I “grew up” together at Ariba and SAP after both graduating from Texas A&amp;M.  We spoke often, including about careers, but neither of us told the other where we were going, or asked.  I learned from Jason’s LinkedIn announcement, chuckled, and was not surprised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December and January, I had paid $1,700 to have a professional writer begin compiling some form of a resume for me. &nbsp;I truly did not have one for over 15 years; I needed only to rely on my identity and my reputation. &nbsp;Since I sensed a different kind of change was coming for me, I felt I needed serious resume help, and yet that resume was never used for the same reason I hadn't needed one in the 15 years prior.</p><p>In late March I was walking back from my mailbox while simultaneously texting with my aunt, Sarah. &nbsp;Sarah randomly told me of a company that she had invested in that I should look into called NuID (“(New Id)” she included, so I didn’t think it was pronounced “Noooooid”).</p><p>It made me stop walking, stand still, and google NuID. &nbsp;A few minutes later, still standing there with mail tucked under my arm, I replied “Well Sarah, personally I am looking to invest in and join a group in identity management specifically, or platforms in general. &nbsp;I like what NuID is doing, that is the type of group I want to join and lead to grow, good stuff right there!”</p><p>Within 48 hours I had spoken to my cousin and arranged for him to introduce me to Locke. &nbsp;My entire family made a weekend trip to Birmingham to visit family, and to meet with Locke for 6 hours straight on Saturday and again at brunch on Sunday. &nbsp;For the next two months, I, and NuID, did as much due-diligence as we could, and then I joined the team.</p><p>That we know, but I’ve been thinking about it in terms of Relationships, Identity, Credentials, Verification, and Reputation – a big Web2.0 problem, without a real solution prior to NuID for a while now so I want to play back that very natural, organic vetting and transacting that occurred between NuID and I with a bit more simplicity, and specificity, to ultimately help illuminate the mechanics of identity as they play out in the real world.</p>SAP ID #835427 
 
<p>I was an SAP employee from 2012 to 2021 and as such, I possessed a Verified Credential with SAP ID # 835427.</p>
 
 
<p>Over those years I developed a strong Reputation within the Ariba and SAP community and progressed through my career, which is easily verified on LinkedIn, or by talking to my team.</p>
 
 
<p>In late March I was walking back from the mailbox when I got a random text from my aunt Sarah that “she had a thought”.  Sarah had invested in a company called NuID that she thought I would be very interested in.</p>
 
 
<p>Sarah learned of NuID because she saw Locke Brown grow up, since Locke and her son went to junior-high and high school together she personally knew Locke.</p>
 
 
<p>Sarah isn’t a technologist, far from it actually, but she is a successful doctor and businesswoman.  So, it wasn’t a keen eye toward SSID, it was her son’s attestation of NuID’s Credentials, and her personal experience with Locke’s reputation that gave her confidence to invest.</p>
 
 
<p>Similarly, Sarah verifying Locke’s Credentials with me, gave me the attestation I needed begin digging into NuID, intensely.</p>
 
 
<p>Locke, as human nature is, essentially got attestations from my cousin and aunt that I am indeed, Jason Jablecki and that I have the Credentials necessary. So we met via a personal email introduction from my cousin.</p>
 
 
<p>As June 30th turned to July 1st, I turned in my SAP employee credential and was granted my NuID employee credential</p>
 
 
<p>You see… Identity is the fact of being who or what a person or thing is, and Authentication is how we know that the Identity is indeed, The Fact. &nbsp;Once we have authenticated the factual-identity of a person, place, thing, device, anything, and we trust its verified credentials, it can exchange digital assets or participate trustlessly in any peer-to-peer digital, and digitally enabled physical interaction.</p><p>After Authentication, it is really the composite of an identity’s qualification, achievement, personal quality, or aspect of a person's background that make up how we tend to think of identity, or reputation of a person day to day.</p><p>Credentials are elemental to Identity, and we know this instinctively as humans.</p> 
 
<p>Go shopping and present debit card as a credential that authorizes financial settlement for the exchange of assets.</p>
 
 
<p>Travel using CLEAR and your biometric credential authorizes an agent to escort you more quickly through TSA.</p>
 
 
<p>Our verifiable identities are elemental to our interactions, our transactions, our possession, therefore, authentication is elemental for identities.</p><p>So once again, let’s play my story out, this time through the self-sovereign identity layer of Web3.0, by using the backwards compatible Web2.0-bridging NuID Authentication Protocol.</p><blockquote>Safe harbor: this is an imaginary, futuristic scenario that did not take place, and even though all of it is possible with the NuID elements available today, none of the parties are real</blockquote> 
 
<p>I was a NuSAP employee through June of this year.  NuSAP had implemented the NuID Authentication Protocol element in Q1 and deleted all employee passwords, so my verified NuID was created at that time and SAP attested my Employment Credential to it.</p>
 
 
<p>During my time with NuSAP I developed a strong reputation, held many different positions, got certifications, and titles, all of which was attested as credentials to my Identity by NuSAP and other third parties.</p>
 
 
<p>In late March of this year I was walking back from the mailbox, simultaneously texting with my aunt, who told me of NuID, and that NuID is looking for a COO.</p>
 
 
<p>My aunt connected me to Locke Brown, with whom I shared relevant aspects of my Nu Identity, which now has quite a reputation given all of the “credentials” I’ve acquired.</p>
 
 
<p>NuSAP’s automated offboarding process ran on June 30th, removing my employee credential from my NuID, and NuID Inc. attested my Nu Employee Credential.</p>
 
 
<p>Thinking through identity process and applications of the NuID protocol is something I’ve been doing a lot of lately while we’re not working on the Kii launch, our Q2 consumer product release, and talking to enterprise and partner prospects. &nbsp;I’ll close this, my first NuID blog, by sharing a whiteboard that I did last week with the team, which is referred to as, the comic book:</p><p>Look out for more blogs, comics, and content from the NuID team and for exciting news to come as we execute on our roadmap toward a sovereign identity ecosystem.</p><p>—Jason</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the ninth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with SoloTürk, administrator of our <a>Turkish Community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew your attention to Ontology? <p>I discovered Ontology for the first time on CoinMarketCap in January, 2018. I liked the name Ontology, so I did some research.</p> 2. Why did you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I became a supporter as I saw very little activity in the Ontology Turkish group. So I asked if I could be a part-time supporter and help strengthen the group, and now I am a big supporter. My group is much more active, and we also have a Free Technical Analysis Signals&nbsp;group.</p> 3. What’s the key role of a Harbinger? What’s your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I want to strengthen the team and grow the community.</p> 4. Why is it important to you to be a part of the Ontology community? <p>I want to follow up on the latest news from Ontology and share the news and ideas within our Ontology community.</p> 5. How is the Ontology community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">The Harbinger program</a> is not available in other blockchains or other communities. I have not seen it or heard of anyone else doing a similar&nbsp;program.</p> 6. What do you use as your main channels for interacting with the Ontology community and why? Do you want to see&nbsp;more? <p>Twitter and Telegram for now, but maybe Instagram in the&nbsp;future.</p> 7. Can you share an unforgettable experience or something you learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone who wants to be a journalist? <p>My advice would be to stay active in the project. Supporting the project as much as you can, helping them to build the future, and sharing your knowledge with&nbsp;others.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Active, Quality, Technology.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology can expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less? What kinds of things do you see community members doing that you think have helped our community grow? <p>Hosting AMAs each week in other Telegram groups with other public chains, or by inviting them and mingling with them and organizing activities together.</p> 10. What do you see as key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help achieve&nbsp;them? <p>Now Ontology is 3 years old and I hope to see more collaborations with other companies or public chains, to let the world know how wonderful Ontology&nbsp;is.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

				  Decentralized identity solution developer and air transport technology provider nominated for Blockchain Services Award in the Tools &amp; Middleware category  
			  
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE — October 06, 2021 — <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the world’s leading provider of decentralized identity development and hosting solutions and <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a>, the leading provider of IT to the air transport industry, today announced they were finalists in the Blockchain Services Award: Tools &amp; Middleware category in the <a href="https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/enterprise-blockchain-awards/">Blockchain Research Institute</a>’s<a href="https://blockchainrevolutionglobal.com/the-eb-awards/">Enterprise Blockchain Awards</a> (EBAs). The partnership was recognized for their work on the <a href="https://www.sita.aero/resources/videos/happy-traveler-card/">Aruba Secure Health Card</a>, a successful pilot&nbsp; for sharing health information in a privacy-preserving way using distributed ledger technology that debuted earlier in the year with the assistance of the Aruba Health Department.</p>
<p>“Indicio is proud to be a finalist for this award, which recognizes the power of blockchain-based technology to create a world in which the ability to trust data is possible — thank you BRI and EBA,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “I also want to also thank our partner in this project,&nbsp; SITA, for its vision and leadership in the air travel industry, and for seeing how this technology can change the way we travel and deliver so many benefits to passengers in the future.”</p>
<p>A distributed blockchain-based ledger is at the foundation of Indicio and SITA’s project. It serves as an anchor for verifiable digital credentials that enable people to hold, share and prove important information in a way that preserves privacy and improves security.</p>
<p>“For the Aruba Secure Health Card, we wanted travelers to Aruba to share proof that they had tested negative for COVID as they visited hotels and restaurants on the island,” said Dahl. “Our goal was to have travelers share their status in a way that didn’t require sharing any personal identifying information with the businesses they visited—or require those businesses to record any personal information. We call this a Trusted Data Ecosystem. It’s where information can be shared and verified in a secure, privacy-preserving way and without the need for third parties to be involved in the flow, management, or storage of that information. Removing third parties is&nbsp; vital to both data privacy compliance and to implementing a Zero-Trust approach to security. Trusted Data Ecosystems are our solution to the problem of trust online.</p>
<p>New this year, the Blockchain Service Award category celebrates providers of blockchain technologies and services. It recognizes companies, government agencies, or nongovernmental entities delivering blockchain solutions to transform their clients’ operations, supply chains, or ecosystems. This category offers an opportunity to showcase the tangible and long-term change that blockchain service providers are working to support.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission could go harder on consumer privacy protection and cybersecurity with President Biden’s recent nomination of digital “privacy hawk” and law professor&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/alvaro-bedoya-ftc-biden/">Alvaro Bedoya</a>&nbsp;and House Democrats’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/09/democrats-tech-reconciliation/">proposal</a>&nbsp;to allocate $1 billion for a new privacy and data security bureau.</p>



<p>If confirmed, Bedoya will join Biden’s other pick, antitrust expert and now FTC chair,&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">Lina Khan</a>. Both are prominent critics of Big Tech data collection and surveillance and seen as a potentially&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/alvaro-bedoya-ftc-biden/">“formidable regulatory presence”</a>&nbsp;in reining in the tech industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As founding director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/privacy-technology-center/">Center on Privacy &amp; Technology</a>&nbsp;think tank at Georgetown University and former chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, Bedoya’s work is in major privacy tech issues including mobile location data, stalkerware and facial recognition.</p>



<p>Bedoya is known for his bipartisan approach to privacy as a human right. We look forward to seeing what comes next for data protection.</p>

<p>Forty-nine degrees Celsius outside. Suddenly, the climate crisis felt pretty real.</p><p>As I started writing this article back in June, sweltering in my home office, western North America was in the grip of a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heat-wave-dome-2021-seattle-portland-weather/">bizarre and unusual</a> heat wave. One town a few hours west of me <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/world/canada/bc-canada-heat-wave.html">broke the all-time Canadian record</a> at 49.6°C (121°F), and was <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/e2-80-98our-poor-little-town-of-lytton-is-gone-e2-80-99-village-at-center-of-canada-e2-80-99s-heatwave-devastated-by-e2-80-98catastrophic-e2-80-99-fires/ar-AALFvbd">incinerated in a wildfire</a> later that week.</p><p>The last decade has seen more than its share of wildfires up and down the west coast; some years I’ve forgotten what it was like to breathe clear air and see the stars. Meanwhile, Germany, Belgium, and the southwest US were drenched in <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/europe-flooding-record-rainfall-leaves-over-120-dead-in-western-europe-devastating-parts-of-germany/ar-AAMdTGY">catastrophic floodwaters</a>.</p><p>This isn’t normal.</p><p>I usually have to experience something myself in order to really appreciate it. It takes me from “of course I care, in an abstract way” to “holy cow, we’ve got to do something about this.” I expect a lot of us work that way.</p> So what can we do? <p>I’m not sure. But one thing I do know is that we have enough science to diagnose the problem and solve it. On the front end, we need to <a href="https://350.org/science/">stop releasing greenhouse gases</a> into the atmosphere; on the back end, we need to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130226-amazon-lungs-of-the-planet">stop damaging our planet’s lungs</a>. We can <a href="https://www.permaculturenews.org/2016/06/29/john-d-liu-interview-possible-rehabilitate-large-scale-damaged-ecosystems/">rapidly repair and even enhance</a> our planet’s capacity to support life with the tools we already have available. And if we do it right, we could even <a href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/farming-while-black/">rebalance inequity</a> and improve the <a href="https://www.csuchico.edu/regenerativeagriculture/blog/nutrient-density.shtml">quality of our food</a> in the process.</p><p>What we don’t know is how to coordinate our efforts — all 7.9 billion of us, and counting — to reach these goals. In a recent interview, thinker and futurist <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/a-problem-well-stated-is-half-solved">Daniel Schmachtenberger argues</a> that <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/about/">if we can</a> solve this problem, all the other problems will get solved automatically.</p> Energy, one piece of the pie <p>All the brightest and darkest things in our modern civilisation come from our capacity to harness the energies of the universe. And right now most of those energies come as fossil fuels — coal, petroleum, and natural gas. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector">Almost three quarters</a> of the greenhouse gases we emit come from energy production. That’s because <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-mix#energy-mix-what-sources-do-we-get-our-energy-from">82% of that energy</a> comes from fossil fuels. And we’re using <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-primary-energy">more and more energy each year</a>.</p>Of humanity's greenhouse gas emissions, 73% comes from energy consumption – electricity, heating, transportation, and industry. The energy we consume comes primarily from fossil fuels, while only 18% comes from renewables and nuclear power. (Note: because of rounding errors, the percentages in this graphic don't quite add up to 100%.)<p>This tells me two things: we need to learn how to use less energy, and the energy we do use must come from low-carbon sources. As far as we know, that means we need to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/electricity-mix#electricity-is-only-one-part-of-total-energy-decarbonizing-electricity-is-only-one-step-towards-a-low-carbon-energy-system">electrify</a> <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/can-electricity-decarbonize-the-energy-sector/">everything</a>.</p><p>But low-carbon electricity carries a new set of coordination problems.</p><p>First, most renewables are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve">not well-matched with demand</a>. Let’s take a look at solar electricity. When we start brewing our morning tea, the sun is still rising. Then there’s a sort of peak production — too much power in the grid — in the middle of the day when we’re off at work. In the evening, just when we’re cooking supper, the sun is already going to bed. It won’t do us any good to switch to renewable electricity if it’s not actually there when we need it.</p>A graph taken from a typical October day in a California power utility shows a steep rise in solar electricity generation from 08:00, which begins to fall at 15:00 and is virtually non-existent at 18:00. Combined with high demand in the morning and evening, this creates a 'duck curve'.<p>Second, power producers and distributors build their infrastructure to meet peak demand, not average demand. If we electrify everything, that would mean more drastic peaks, which would mean more power plants and fatter wires. And every tonne of concrete and steel, every kilometre of copper wire, every wind turbine, every hectare of solar panels, is the product of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse_gas_emissions_of_energy_sources">carbon-intensive manufacturing processes</a>.</p><p>Third, consumers are also becoming producers, and it’s happening quickly. <a href="https://www.energymagazine.com.au/energy-disruption-is-here-but-not-as-we-expected/">Over a fifth of Australian homes</a> have rooftop solar panels, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/07/17/mini-grids-are-ready-to-change-the-world-again/?sh=680624eca164">minigrids</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_solar_farm">community solar gardens</a> are on the rise. Distributed energy production is already here. That’s wonderful, but the grid is designed for one-way delivery of electricity generated by large plants whose output is easy to predict.</p><p>Our infrastructure <a href="http://www.mefco2.eu/news/decarbonization-digitalisation-decentralisation-energy-sector.php">isn’t prepared</a> to handle these challenges. It’s big and unwieldy. Teaching it to respond to these new demands would be like teaching a team of oxen to fly like a flock of starlings.</p><p>But starlings are exactly what we need. Many small energy producers and consumers, responding nimbly to each other, moment by moment. Analysts tell us that the most reasonable way to do this is to <a href="https://www.caf.com/en/knowledge/views/2019/11/the-3-ds-of-energy-decarbonization-digitization-and-decentralization/">decentralise and digitalise</a> the grid as we decarbonise.</p><p>Coordination is necessary, but it appears exceedingly difficult at the same time.</p><p>Given the risks we face, this is sobering.</p><p>Fortunately, there are people working on these challenges already. I’d like to introduce you to one such group of visionaries.</p> The Internet of Energy Network: teaching toasters to fly <p>In 2018, Dr Adam Bumpus, Alex Evans, and Sim Wilson came together with a desire to tackle the challenges of energy coordination. If they could figure this out, they knew they could help the world move toward a <a href="https://whatsyour2040.com/">brighter future</a>.</p><p>One of their first questions was, “what if we could build coordination capacities into the things that already exist?” I appreciate their choice to ground high ideals in reality. Instead of pushing the grid to change, they started at the bottom with individual devices in homes and businesses.</p><p>The trio called themselves RedGrid, assembling a team to help them imagine ways to get all these devices talking to each other. They asked what would happen if they were to connect together into ‘virtual microgrids’ and eventually into a global ‘software-defined grid’ giving intelligence to the existing physical grid. Production and storage devices, side by side with our air conditioners and fridges and ovens, making decisions together in response to changes in supply and demand. Just like a flock of starlings.</p><p>Mike Gamble, the company’s lead architect, describes this approach as “grassroots, bottom-up, organic.” Anyone who wants to join the flock is welcome.</p><p>As they built out this vision, they called it the <a href="https://www.ioen.tech/">Internet of Energy Network</a> (I’ll call it IOEN, pronounced “ion”, for short). Given what I learned about the inflexibility of the current energy grid, this approach makes a lot of sense. It won’t require everything to change at once, which means that it has a chance of actually working. Regardless of how many people and organisations end up getting involved, something meaningful can happen at every scale. As more layers are added, the benefits start compounding.</p><p>And it happens to mesh nicely with the greenest, least complicated carbon reduction technique: just use less energy.</p><p>Even without taking advantage of the IOEN, RedGrid has an app that <a href="https://redgrid.io/for-households/">talks to smart appliances</a> (and not-so-smart appliances using smart plugs). At its most basic, it helps people monitor their energy consumption; this alone has been <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12053-019-09777-z">shown to reduce people’s consumption patterns</a>.</p><p>It also allows people to schedule energy-hungry appliances, like their dishwasher, in the <a href="https://youtu.be/O-lv-3AeIms">middle of the day</a> when green energy is plentiful. This doesn’t reduce consumption by itself, but it can help them green the energy they do consume, or get better rates and even rebates by taking advantage of their energy company’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_response">demand response</a> incentives. This doesn’t just save people money and make them feel good; it also prevents more infrastructure from being built. Remember that power companies build to meet peak demand — if we can flatten the peaks, the grid can be leaner.</p><p>Their software can also use machine learning to help long-running machines, such as air conditioners and pool pumps, use less power without sacrificing comfort.</p><p>If everyone added this sort of smarts to their individual energy use, we’d likely see both consumption and peak demand start to drop across the world. It’d help — to an extent. But the RedGrid team thinks that the real reductions will happen when these devices can break through the four walls around them and start talking to their neighbours.</p><p>Devices in the IOEN will be able to emit signals for other devices to respond to. At noon the community solar farm could say “we’re flooded with energy right now; can anyone use it?” Hundreds of dishwashers and car chargers, waiting for just such a signal, would turn on in response. Or in the evening the utility could say “we’re getting stressed; could everyone go easy for a while?” and air conditioners, pool pumps, and <a href="https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/hot-water-vpp-mb1870/">water heaters</a> would scale back.</p><p>It gets more interesting when devices, and the people who own them, can talk directly to each other. Rather than overwhelming the community solar farm all at once, all those dishwashers could arrange to take turns. Or, if someone knows they’re going to be using a lot more electricity than usual — maybe they’re cooking for a big birthday party — they could let their neighbours know. People like being neighbourly, so they’re likely to make accommodations for that. Mike suggested that it could even spur a bit of friendly competition among virtual microgrids, an energy-saving drive: “You may have a group that is your sports team, and you are aiming to do better energy-wise against another team.”</p><p>And with the increase in local generation and storage — rooftop solar and electric car batteries — energy consumers could also be providers, selling their surplus to their neighbours. Local generation reduces the burden on infrastructure even further and makes everyone more resilient to power outages.</p><p>The IOEN is simply the communication layer that makes all this possible; the real magic happens in the applications built on top of it. RedGrid sees more opportunities on the horizon.</p>  Virtual microgrids can aggressively optimise their energy use, offer their combined optimisations as a package to energy companies, and distribute the rebates to members.  Physical microgrids such as Monash University’s <a href="https://www.monash.edu/net-zero-initiative">Net Zero</a> project (<a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/the-tech-firm-overhauling-energy-by-creating-mini-grids-driven-by-ai-20190627-p521xi">partnering</a> with RedGrid) can build smaller systems if they can rely on the IOEN to help smooth out demand peaks.  If grid operators and power producers choose to use aggregated, anonymised data from individuals and virtual microgrids, they can do an even better job of planning, building out, and maintaining their infrastructure.  As the network grows, third-party service providers can pop up, offering intelligence and insights to help everyone reduce their energy use even further.  Equipped with IOEN-based management software, new microgrid projects could receive investor money in exchange for a stake in revenues, accelerating the adoption of renewables.  <p>The Rocky Mountain Institute calls this <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/the-economics-of-demand-flexibility-how-flexiwatts-create-quantifiable-value-for-customers-and-the-grid-executive-summary/">demand flexibility</a>, predicting that it can <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/the-carbon-emissions-impact-of-demand-flexibility/">reduce energy-related emissions</a> by up to 40% as energy electrifies and decarbonises. But they see electricity pricing as the main coordination tool. RedGrid’s vision for the IOEN embraces pricing but goes beyond it, giving us a way to coordinate directly and explicitly with each other.</p> Why decentralisation? <p>Good question. Decentralised coordination is messy and awkward. If you’ve ever tried to organise a multi-family camping trip, you know what I’m talking about.</p><p>First of all, when we’re dependent on faraway, centralised infrastructure and all the stuff that connects us to it, we’re in a vulnerable position. This goes for both electricity generation and the digital tech needed to make it ‘smart’. What if the power plant, the <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/slack-outage-january-aws">machines in the data centre</a>, or any of the miles of wiring between them and our town, go offline (or even <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/10/ovh_strasbourg_fire/">burn down</a>)? Suddenly we’re stranded. With rooftop and community solar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Powerwall">home batteries</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing">edge computing</a>, we have the means to stay online, right in our home town.</p><p>Second, the further away the power source is from your plug, the <a href="http://insideenergy.org/2015/11/06/lost-in-transmission-how-much-electricity-disappears-between-a-power-plant-and-your-plug/">more energy is lost</a>. It’s not a huge deal, but local generation does come out a little bit ahead.</p><p>Lastly, the rising complexity of the modern grid, along with the decisions we need to make, will virtually demand it. Zillions of new internet-connected plugs, toasters, solar panels, and car chargers will be coming online, producing lots of data and expecting to be able to make split-second decisions based on current local conditions. This is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666792420300068">logistical</a> <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/tkosar/cse710_spring19/shi-iot16.pdf">challenge</a> for cloud computing, which (despite its fluffy name) happens in faraway data centres. It’s going to be hard for the cloud to keep up. (And I ought to point out that it has its own <a href="https://www.masonandhanger.com/blog/data-center-energy-consumption/">ecological problems</a> too).</p> Where Holochain comes in <p>This is the Holochain Blog, after all, so I ought to mention it. Why did RedGrid build the IOEN on Holochain? The way Mike explained to me, it’s because Holochain is built for decentralisation.</p><p>And I’m not talking about the sort of decentralisation you see in blockchain. It’s a marvellous feat of engineering with some compelling use cases, but <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">it’s still logically centralised</a>, according to Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin.</p><p>In practice, that means that your smart devices need to be connected to the global blockchain network all the time. This demands an always-on internet connection with zero downtime — which is fine if that’s what you have, but it’s problematic if you’re part of the world’s majority who live with patchy power and internet.</p><p>First-generation blockchains are also unfit for tiny smart devices, and they consume a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/satoshi-nakamoto-and-the-fate-of-our-planet-2/">massive amount of electricity for very little work</a> (although newer DLTs are addressing those problems). The solution shouldn’t contribute to the problem. Mike tells me that “we turned our backs on Ethereum years ago”.</p><p>Holochain was designed to <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#resilience-and-availability">tolerate</a> messy, unreliable connectivity. Far from being an anomaly, this may become increasingly common. During our local wildfire season, one fire <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/West-Kelowna/340081/Disaster-has-been-averted-for-now-Brenda-Creek-fire-skirts-past-BC-Hydro-transmission-lines#340081">nearly knocked out</a> power and internet for 60,000 people. This would not have been a problem for an IOEN-powered local grid.</p><p>Holochain’s creators <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/energy-as-a-currency-holochain-and-sustainable-energy/">built it for edge computing</a> in the extreme. Every device carries its own weight, according to its ability. It <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/">stores its own data</a>, makes its own decisions, connects directly to neighbouring devices, and helps <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/">support the health</a> of the local network. This lets the computing capacity scale linearly with the number of participants. And less powerful devices will soon be able to offload their work to a <a href="https://holo.host">decentralised cloud</a> if needed.</p><p>Mike and his colleagues also appreciated that Holochain already had a small but strong developer community. In preparation for an IOEN demo for their partner Monash University, Holochain developers from around the world <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/building-together-redgrids-internet-of-energy-mission-and-the-holochain-community/#strength-in-a-band-of-allies">rallied around RedGrid</a> to make it happen. After the demo, Mike <a href="https://youtu.be/BYcpuKBRIEs?t=2393">said</a>:</p><blockquote>“I should point out that what attracted me to Holochain was the support, not so much the tech. And it’s just in the last month that this has proven out, with Guillem and Connor [and Alfredo, Jesús, and Eduardo] helping us… You can see in GitHub and Discord their discussions with David Meister and Tom Gowan [Holochain core devs], to the point where a community dev actually found things and updated the core. It’s really pretty impressive. And Monash recognised that.”</blockquote><p>Adam agreed, <a href="https://youtu.be/BYcpuKBRIEs?t=2426">saying</a>,</p><blockquote>“And that was really cool, because you’re building together. For us as a company, we’ve had lots of good support from Art [Brock] and Eric Harris-Braun [Holochain co-founders] from the beginning, and obviously other people Mike mentioned... It makes us feel good—about the community, about the whole mission, and also there are other people out there who are not building on Holochain but believe in what we’re doing, the Holochain/RedGrid combination.”</blockquote> Where you come in <p>When we’re faced with the stark challenge of climate change, and the apparent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/28/blah-greta-thunberg-leaders-climate-crisis-co2-emissions">inaction</a> of the people who make decisions, it’s easy to fall into discouragement. Many of us are desperate to see change, but feel powerless to actually make the change happen. We would seize any opportunity to get our agency back, to help guide our world towards a happy future.</p><p>And we technologists have often found ourselves part of the problem rather than the solution. But projects like this remind me that there is a place for appropriate applications of technology, <a href="http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/">there is a role for people</a> who can design, program, build, tinker, and tweak. We can “create options for policy-makers”, in the words of Saul Griffith. And when they ignore those options, we can step around them and build tools for everyone — tools for <a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/a-compass-for-a-life-affirming-economy-328ab09e1a87">coordination</a>, tools to <a href="https://www.artbrock.com/2020/07/29/currencies-are-records-of-currents">make the invisible visible</a>. Tools to help us make sense of our world and take action together.</p>

<p>Ocean Protocol smart contracts and Ocean Market are on the leading EVM Kusama Parachain, to unlock the Web3 Data Economy for the Polkadot ecosystem</p><p>As part of Ocean’s<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce"> multi-chain strategy</a>, we have deployed Ocean’s technology to <a href="https://moonbeam.network/networks/moonriver/">Moonriver</a>.</p><p>Moonriver is the leading EVM-compatible chain in the Kusama / Polkadot ecosystem. This gives it excellent security and cross-chain interoperability that will continue to&nbsp;improve.</p><p>Moonriver is a parachain (sub-chain) that leverages Kusama relay chain (parent chain) security. It’s a sister to the upcoming Moonbeam chain, a parachain to Polkadot relay chain. Kusama targets rapid testing and long-tail applications, whereas Polkadot targets slower large-enterprise applications.</p><p>Moonriver went live on Aug 26, 2021. Its traction is already impressive: within three weeks, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/kusama-dapp-moonriver-records-1-million-transactions-in-just-3-weeks/">it hit </a>1 million transactions and 100K wallet addresses. A week and a half later, the <a href="https://blockscout.moonriver.moonbeam.network/">transactions had doubled to 2 million</a>. It has more than <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Moonriver">$200M staked in DeFi applications</a> and another <a href="https://moonriver.subscan.io/">$270M bonded in collator staking</a>, excellent for any network, let alone such a young&nbsp;one.</p><p>The Ocean core team and Moonriver / Moonbeam core team (<a href="https://twitter.com/purestakeco">PureStake</a>) have been <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1353677332704329733">collaborating since January 2021</a>. In April, the Ocean core team deployed Ocean backend components and Ocean Market frontend to Moonbase Alpha testnet, then <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1387044024574373889">shared that work</a> in the Moonbeam #Illuminate21 community event. The teams worked closely to iron out small kinks. The Ocean deployment to Moonriver is the first major technology milestone in this collaboration, and as part of the broader Ocean — Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>Ocean and Polkadot have grown up together. The creators of Ocean (and before that BigchainDB and ascribe) and creators of Kusama / Polkadot have been collaborating since 2014-era Ethereum days through the founding of Parity (née Ethcore) and Web3 Foundation, from security audits to go-to-market strategy, and always with an eye towards technology integration.</p><p>In 2017, Ocean founder Trent McConaghy presented “The Web3 Data Economy” vision at the inaugural Web3 Summit conference, hosted by Web3 Foundation [<a href="http://trent.st/content/20181022.2%20Web3%20Summit%20-%20McConaghy.pdf">slides</a>][<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKbVieQ_foo">video</a>][<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-data-economy-b6fd8ecac4c4">blog post</a>]. The Ocean Moonriver deployment makes this vision real in Web3 Foundation ecosystem.</p><p>Moonriver is fully Ethereum-compatible, which allows it to run Ethereum smart contracts and use Ethereum-style ERC20 tokens. It’s a Proof-of-Stake chain with a modern consensus algorithm built on <a href="https://www.parity.io/technologies/substrate/">Parity Substrate</a> technology. This allows it to have low gas fees and low latency compared to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p>The <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:Fdc8aDac3F2869855dF069ED3D3604BF630701aD">first dataset published in Moonriver</a>.<p>With Ocean deployed to Moonriver, this&nbsp;means:</p>  Users of<a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com"> Ocean Market</a> can publish, swap, stake, and consume data assets in Moonriver.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thanks for joining. Our guest today played a leading role editing a paper published by more than 150 identity experts. The paper is called GAIN: How Financial Institutions are taking a leadership role in the Digital Economy by establishing a Global Assured Identity Network. It was announced at the European Identity and Cloud Conference last 13th of September by Nat Sakimura, who is the Chairman of the OpenID Foundation, and Gottfried Leibbrandt, former CEO of Swift, and then was published by, among others, the Institute of International Finance.</p>
<p>Our guest today is Elizabeth Garber. She is a customer and product strategist who started her career in telecommunications and honed her craft in six different industries before joining one of the world’s largest retail banks. She is an expert in designing experiences and delivering transformational change based on a deep understanding of people. This interest has underpinned her graduate studies of the psychology of cross functional teams, as well as how customers define value in relation to the services they use.</p>
<p>In 2015, she was named one of the top three marketers under 30 by the UK Marketing Society, and was recognised by Energy UK and EY for her work building trust across the UK energy industry. In 2017, she won the Financial Times 30% club Women in Leadership Award.</p>
<p>Hello, Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Garber: Hello, thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure. Welcome to our show. And let’s talk about digital identity. And certainly, we always like to start hearing a little bit more about our guest, especially how was your journey into this world of digital identity. Please tell us a bit about yourself.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Sure. So my name is Elizabeth Garber. As you said, I’m a customer strategist, a product owner and service innovator. Now, I’m also a digital identity evangelist, I suppose. My passion is for understanding people, what drives their behaviour, how does any kind of service really add value in their lives. Then I help organisations to build services and communicate those benefits to real people. So these skills, I think, are critical in the digital identity space, because the solutions that we design really need to reflect the people who use them, how they move through their worlds, globally.</p>
<p>And not only that, but really great customer experience, designers, product owners, they’ll get to know what’s really on people’s mind that might prevent adoption of any one solution. And how different solutions kind of destroy value maybe in sometimes insidious ways, like a really convenient identity solution could come with some real trade-offs that are invisible to users at first. Maybe their data isn’t secure, maybe it’s sold off, maybe they’re giving it willingly, but they’re blind to some of the applications that will follow.</p>
<p>As someone who hasn’t been involved in identity for all that long, I can really relate to the users who don’t understand the difference between the offers that are currently on the market, and what might be there in future. So I’m here to get underneath how our identity solutions are going to create and potentially undermine benefits for real people. And then I want to promote the adoption of good ethical solutions.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. And what was your exact role in this project in this paper, GAIN?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: In the paper?</p>
<p>Oscar: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, as it turned out, a few other people thought that I could be useful. So one of the early co-authors Rod Boothby, who chairs the Open Digital Trust Initiative at the Institute of International Finance, reached out to me about his work. I was really floored when he took me through it and I knew that I wanted to get involved. It was really exciting. So, after I read through some of the documentation, I sent him some thoughts about the value to users, to banks, to relying parties.</p>
<p>And then within a few days, I was facilitating a virtual whiteboard session with a lot of the other co-authors all over the world, trying to help them kind of coalesce around who the paper was for, who is the audience, what are the messages that are going to resonate with that audience and then the structure of the paper. At that point, I wondered if someone might realise that I didn’t have a huge background in identity, maybe kick me out, but they are an inclusive group of people, and they really valued the approach. So ultimately, I played a pretty big role in pulling the paper that we published together.</p>
<p>I should say who else was involved. It was really an experiment in radical democracy as Don Thibeau of the OpenID Foundation likes to say. We brought more than 150 people together, experts in the space. I might mention some of their names in this interview, but it was a pro bono, no logos collaboration. But we did have the support of some major organisations in the space. The ones that participated and are now publishing and promoting the paper include the OpenID Foundation, the Institute of International Finance, the Open Identity Exchange, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, and the Cloud Signature Consortium.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Tell us a bit more about the…</p>
<p>Elizabeth: The paper itself?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, please.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: OK. Yeah, sure. So the paper invites financial institutions. It’s a call to action for financial institutions to join us in solving the biggest problem on the internet – a lack of trust, specifically a lack of trust due to the absence of verified identities. How do you know the person you’re dealing with is real? How do you know that they are who they claim to be? How do you know that your money will end up in the right hands? Fraud and cybercrime increases every year. Some estimates say it’s 5% of GDP, trillions of dollars. Criminals are thriving in anonymous digital spaces.</p>
<p>And at the same time, you and I and our friends are pervasively tracked. We enter our details into countless sites, service providers follow us around, they trade our information. Even our biometrics are seeping around into more and more places, our faces, our fingertips, more and more people or parties have access to really private, really personal information that could be used in any number of ways – steal our identities, for example. And that needs to stop.</p>
<p>The paper argues for the internet’s missing trust layer. That’s a phrase coined by one of the co-authors, Kim Cameron, who led identity at Microsoft for many years, and he wrote the Laws of Identity. Then this concept was really beautifully explained by Nat Sakimura, Chairman of the OpenID Foundation at the European Identity and Cloud Conference in September. In this new paradigm, highly trustworthy identity information is passed from a regulated or otherwise highly trusted institution to an organisation that needs it, with end user knowledge and consent every time.</p>
<p>So, if I’m buying another bottle of Malbec, I shouldn’t have to prove my age by uploading a driver’s license to another site or sharing a photo of my face. You don’t need my name, my face, my address. No one else needs a copy of my credentials or biometric information. You just need to know that I am the person I say I am and that I’m old enough. So my online wine retailer can send a message to my trusted identity information provider. I would choose my bank and they will use their app to authenticate me and say, “Hey, the International House of Malbec wants to know if you’re over 21, should I tell them?” And of course, it’s a yes, because I need to celebrate recording this podcast.</p>
<p>Oscar: Tell us a bit the solution itself because there are some solutions, which one way or another address the problem you described?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, so none of this is really new. People have called for this for years. One of my co-authors actually from INNOPAY, Douwe Lycklama, shared a YouTube video arguing for the same thing, and it was dated in 2007. Of course, it does exist in some places already, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Canada, Finland, in one form or another lots of jurisdictions around the world have a solution like this. And as another GAIN co-author Dave Birch, who also wrote Identity is the New Money, pointed out in Forbes last week – We’re starting to see evidence that these networks really facilitated the rollout of aid during the pandemic, and mitigated the risk of fraud.</p>
<p>In particular, another co-author from Vipps in Norway helped us to compare some early information coming out against the US, UK data. So no, none of its new but we do argue in the paper that now is the time to think about global interoperability of these networks.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and I think as the model of doing the solving these problems goes towards how the countries you have mentioned, most of them have created a system based on banks, others combined with all of the mobile operators, right, but those are like the main types. And the states, of course, the states, some of the states has also provided that. So these are the three types of identity provider, the one who provision these systems, this identification service, but obviously, it’s not – it’s not commercial big tech, no, that’s out of these group of entities who provide these systems.</p>
<p>And of course, you mentioned different countries. We talk about few countries that have sufficient solutions. But I think the next question would come, how to make it available for the rest of the world, how we ensure some type of global interoperability?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Absolutely, absolutely. So we think global interoperability is really important for a lot of different reasons. Three in particular spring, to my mind. The number one, end users want to live globally, maybe more importantly, most online companies are global or need to be global. They have suppliers and customers across borders. So the benefits increase dramatically when a trust network is global, rather than local – fewer contracts, fewer integrations, and the benefits extend throughout their supply chains all the way to the end users who benefit from simpler, more convenient services all across the internet.</p>
<p>Because my second point is, it’s an extension of that first one that those benefits actually extend to global society. A global network allows a specialist artisan in one part of the world to reach a global audience without relying on an intermediary. So Oscar, let’s say you have something to celebrate, and you’ve decided to buy yourself a handmade quilt from India, a Kantha. You will be able to find sellers that you can trust and they’ll be able to sell to you, charge you the price that someone in Finland expects to pay, and they will keep a greater percentage of it for themselves, potentially. So this is really going to unleash creativity and expand access to individuals and communities and sellers all around the world.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a practical benefit from promoting this vision of interoperability. And I believe it’s the key factor that will move the needle towards actually setting up this trust layer in places where it does not exist today. Major relying parties, and I’m talking now about big companies that operate worldwide with the heft to influence a global movement, they buy into this vision only when it has a global reach. They don’t want to integrate with a different provider in every jurisdiction on the planet. So with that in mind, financial service institutions around the world are far more likely to collaborate and catalyse this movement, if they see that the vision is expansive enough to meet the demand for global reach.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay, so definitely interoperability is something that we aim – not only the ones who are like me, I’m in Finland would like to have the same for the rest, but the ones who don’t have a sufficient identification system like those. But then something caught my attention is in the white paper. It says GAIN Digital Trust: How financial institutions are taking a leadership, et cetera, et cetera. So that means that the 100 persons who have been involved in this are targeting financial institutions. So why is targeting specifically financial institutions?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Great question. So the main body of the paper is targeting, it’s directed at the world’s large financial institutions. It’s a call to action for them to catalyse the creation of a globally interoperable network. To be really, really clear with everybody though, we don’t think the paper or the global assured identity network is only for banks or financial institutions. The network itself must be inclusive, and in some parts of the world energy companies, telecommunications providers etc., they may be better placed than banks to be trusted identity information providers.</p>
<p>However, we argue that financial institutions are really well positioned to spark this change, to bring it to life, and to benefit from it. And so that’s what the paper really gets into. It runs through the reasons why financial institutions are positioned to do it – a point we repeat a few times – because we’ve seen them do it before. They built the rails for global payments, for cards, for securities, etc. They built Swift, Mastercard, Visa.</p>
<p>There are three main strengths that they have that makes them the perfect catalyst. Number one is trust. It’s a bank’s core offer. I know some people might laugh at that, because you don’t always trust a bank to give you the best rates, or brilliant customer service every time, but you do trust them. You trust them to keep your money and your data safe. That’s why they exist. Some companies monetise your data. Banks, financial institutions are in the business of monetising your security and privacy. And they have been since the very first bank – the Medici bank in 1397. Banks are trusted.</p>
<p>Number two, the second point, is a build off the first. They are regulated. A lot of that trust is underpinned by regulation. They need to be worthy of our trust and meet certain standards so that other businesses do not – and there are governance frameworks to build upon as these new services are created.</p>
<p>The third point that makes them a great catalyst, the third strength, is how well they know their customers. Because of those first two things, banks invest significant amounts of money in making sure that they know their customers. You might hear me say Know Your Customer, or KYC, is the process – and it’s regulated – that they go through to validate your identity when you open an account. And they also build the technical infrastructure to know that it’s you each and every time someone tries to get into your account. They have built best-in-class tools to identify, authenticate you, while keep your account secure and your information private. And all that’s why banks are best placed to vouch for your identity and to use their authentication methods to confirm on behalf of others that it’s really you.</p>
<p>Oscar: What would make possible that there is such interoperability in more practical, more technical terms?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Good question. So we’re going to try to apply interoperability standards that many different types of systems can plug into. There will be direct participants, banks or other identity information providers who use the network to verify information for the companies who need to consume it. And, of course, there will need to be intermediaries and translation layers to ensure that a BankID Sweden customer can verify their identity with a seller in Mexico, for example. That BankID customer will continue to verify using BankID. But we will have created a way for BankID to communicate to relying parties all over the world, including Mexico.</p>
<p>We can also create servers that tap into self-sovereign identity networks. It’s important to know that we’re designing this system so that identity information passes from the provider, the identity information provider, directly to the relying party without passing through any centralised GAIN entity. That’s really important, at least as we understand it. That’s really important when we start to talk about interoperability from a legal standpoint.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, though, these direct connections are enabled by common API specifications. They’re based on OpenID standards, such as FAPI. With all that said, this field is evolving and technical proof-of-concepts are underway. So I definitely need to reserve the right to build upon my answer later on.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. It’s very convincing your point, your three points. And I can feel that, absolutely. And the banks have already proved that in some of the countries that we have mentioned that they are leaders in this identification.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Absolutely. Yep.</p>
<p>Oscar: And now my guess that among the 150 authors, there are some people who are directly involved in banks.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yes. Like I said, it was a no logo collaboration so I won’t be dropping the names of any specific names.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: But we did have the partnership of the Institute of International Finance, who is pulling together a proof of concept with the Open Digital Trust Initiative. And we do have banks involved in that.</p>
<p>Oscar: So why it is really good for banks from the bank’s point of view, why it’s good to join GAIN?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, so importantly, it’s not just that they can do this, it’s also that they will benefit from doing it. The first benefit that’s easiest to explain is simple, it’s revenue. Identity verification services will have as they do today, a small price attached. Transactions will result in a small amount of money flowing into the ecosystem. And a percentage will go to the identity information provider, in this case, the bank. That turns the assets that I was just talking about – what they’ve spent to build up KYC, authentication, security, all those infrastructures – that turns them from a major cost centre, into a profit centre.</p>
<p>Second, there will be massive efficiencies for banks, password resets, document signing, mortgage processing, etc. There will be more efficiency inside a bank. They will also see less fraud. In Norway, BankID saw fraud reduced from something like 1% to 0.00042% of transactions.</p>
<p>But the biggest benefits are strategic. New competitors are coming in between banks and their customers, are diminishing the role that banks play in providing access to capital markets. Providing identity information services to their customers, under their brand name, cements a really critical role for banks. They will provide their customers with access to the digital economy. And they will keep their customers safer, more secure in their privacy than they are today. And that’s a real value add for their customers. So strategically, banks really must do this, or they risk getting cut out of a lot of transactions.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, banks have to hear it. When I started reading more about this paper, and you have mentioned at the beginning also, that the Global LEI Foundation is also involved, it’s one of the main supporters of this initiative. So tell me how that relates to that. They are not the banks. Of course, they have some business with the banks. But please tell us what is the connection?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, I listened to <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/clare-rowley-gleif/" title="your podcast that you did with GLEIF, Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation">your podcast that you did with GLEIF, Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a>, while I was preparing to talk to you. And yeah, I think the connections are really strong. So they were a critical partner in pulling the paper together. They’re doing incredibly important work, and will absolutely be part of the next steps as we figure out how to realise a global assured identity network.</p>
<p>There are three types of identity questions that we all really have as we transact online. Who is this person? Can I trust them? Who is this company? Are they trustworthy? And then connecting the two. Is this person related to a company? What’s their role? Are they entitled to be doing this thing, signing this document logging into my account on the company’s behalf? If we start getting key information about the individual, that’s great, that adds a ton of value. GLEIF is answering that second question, who is the company? And once we can get to the third point of connecting the dots, that’s going to be really powerful. So yeah, GLEIF is a critical partner and will remain so throughout the rest of the journey.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, now the way you have explained also is pretty good. And we say that verify identity of a person, of a company or organisation and how to link these two in this. And that’s pretty critical. That’s something that has not been explored enough, I would say. So that’s, I’m really intrigued to hear how GAIN is addressing doubts about this because it’s essential these days.</p>
<p>So, Elizabeth, I’d like to hear more what comes next. So just a couple of weeks ago was the launch of the paper and I also saw some interest on the media. That’s excellent to hear. But what come next now for GAIN?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Well, we already have planning underway for GAIN technical proof of concept. And we’re looking for more people to get involved, more companies to participate. So we have big companies who need to de-duplicate their customers, companies that need to collect verified signatures, the number of use cases is seemingly endless. We’re also looking for partners, aggregators, or service providers who can help us – help bring these relying parties on board or technical service providers who can help us to envision and build services on top.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to be involved. So if you’re thinking about getting involved, it might mean that you’re interested in identity. So you’re listening to this podcast after all, that probably means that you’re only one or two steps away from one of the co-authors, so it’d be really easy for you to reach out to them. You can also reach out to me or the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12559000/">Global Assured Identity Network LinkedIn group</a> that we have. And if you’re really interested in the POC, we’ve got an email address for you, it would be <a href="mailto:digitaltrust@IIF.com">digitaltrust@IIF.com</a>. So even if none of that is true for you, there’s something you can do. You could call up your bank and tell them to offer this service</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Even as a user, you can ask your customer for the bank, you can ask the bank, have you heard of GAIN? Yeah, absolutely. And I guess – assume that you already have a big list of the most potential use cases right that some of these customers, companies, service provider that you are now inviting. They could fit into this use cases. Excellent. Elizabeth, finally, tell us – for all business leaders that are listening to us in this interview. So what would you say is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: So these ideas that we’ve been talking about are going to mark a step change in the digital economy. A third wave in identity as my colleague Rod Boothby pointed out on LinkedIn last week. First, it was all about companies providing IDs and passwords to employees to access work systems, and businesses gave customers IDs and passwords to access services on the internet. This third wave is all about us bringing our own trusted digital identity wherever we go. With a really inclusive approach and active global collaboration, this will open up our digital economy. It’s going to expand access, and make life so much simpler and safer online.</p>
<p>So for those who are listening, I would urge business leaders to figure out what role your business can and will play in a globally interoperable assured identity network. Are you an identity information provider? Can you be? Will you be a relying party who consumes these services so that you can verify that the signature on a contract is valid? Can you help us onboard relying parties or integrate these services?</p>
<p>On your agenda, I’d say write down, figure it out, figure out how you’re going to get involved and then get in touch. Again, join our Global Assured Identity Network on LinkedIn, or email <a href="mailto:digitaltrust@IIF.com">digitaltrust@IIF.com</a>. If you know that you want to join the POC.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. This might still be relatively new concept for companies who are not so exposed to this type of identity services. So yeah, it’s a good idea, as you said, to decide, think about what is going to be that new role of your company from the many choices you have mentioned.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, Elizabeth. It was super interesting to hear about this extraordinary effort that had been done by GAIN project, very recently launched. And as you said, now, the Proof-of-Concept are starting to keep going. Please let us know how people could get in touch with you if they like to follow this conversation with you.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, so you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethgarber/">LinkedIn</a> really easily. My name is Elizabeth Garber. Yeah, I think that’s the easiest way.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. LinkedIn is the easiest way. Thanks a lot Elizabeth. It was a pleasure talking with you and all the best.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p>

				  Ken Ebert nominated in Blockchain Leadership Award category for vision and leadership in developing interoperable blockchain-based Trusted Data Ecosystems  
			  
				
				
				 SEATTLE — October 05, 2021 — <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the world’s leading provider of decentralized identity and hosting solutions, today announced that company Chief Technology Officer Ken Ebert has been named as a finalist in the Blockchain Leadership Award category in&nbsp; the <a href="https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/enterprise-blockchain-awards/">Blockchain Research Institute</a>’s <a href="https://blockchainrevolutionglobal.com/the-eb-awards/">Enterprise Blockchain Awards</a> (EBAs). Ebert was recognized for his long-lasting vision for open-source identity technology anchored on a blockchain network to solve some of our most pressing online problems—verification, privacy, security, and user experience.<p></p>
<p>Ebert was one of the co-founders of Indicio.tech, and he has been pivotal in nurturing it from its launch at the start of the COVID pandemic to its position today as the global leader in developing decentralized identity infrastructure and software for building Trusted Data Ecosystems. He built a virtual team of highly-skilled developers that is diverse in gender and nationality, and he developed an intern and mentoring program to create the needed skills in new recruits as the company took on more and more customers’ projects.</p>
<p>With Ebert’s team-focused leadership, Indicio was able to successfully create and deploy a complete decentralized identity based data ecosystem, weaving together health agencies, global technology suppliers in the travel industry, and national governments. The company’s continuing success reflects on Ebert’s&nbsp; extraordinary ability to bring parties together and drive ideas and projects forward into workable technology that solves real-world problems. And, as a passionate advocate for interoperability in the open-source identity communities, Ebert isn’t just driving Indicio’s success, he’s helping to drive the adoption and evolution of blockchain technologies that promise transformative change and opportunity for everyone.</p>
<p>“Indicio’s success and its position as a global leader in the development of Trusted Data Ecosystems is a testimony to Ken’s seemingly boundless skill and wisdom. It’s not just his ability to analyze and clarify problems and guide our own team, it’s his tireless capacity to do so for all the companies who support the Indicio Network as well as our customers,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “That’s what makes him an outstanding leader. Part of that comes from character; part from experience; but a part of it is also a philosophy of ‘build now, build more, build better.’&nbsp; When you think about the problems we’re trying&nbsp; to solve, they’re huge. Ken is always the one to remind us—and our collaborators and customers—that we build solutions step by step. Let’s solve this bit first. And when you do this, and do it relentlessly, you’ll feel like you’re running and you can achieve anything.”</p>
<p>“I want to thank BRI for its dedication to helping enterprise leaders understand and implement blockchain within their industries. This is a technology that has&nbsp; enormous potential to rewrite the way we do so many things in business and society,” said Ebert. “It’s exciting to be the CTO of a company that is driving that transformation through the Indicio Network—a distributed blockchain for identity—and through designing solutions that give people the ability to prove identity and share data in a way that preserves their privacy, in&nbsp; a way that improves their security, and, above all, in a way that can be trusted. All this would be impossible without blockchain. I’m honored to be a finalist for this award;&nbsp; but I’m more excited by what we—Indicio, our clients, the identity community—can do for the world with this technology. That’s the excitement that greets me every day—and I want to share it with everyone.”</p>
<p>The Blockchain Leadership awards honor people who have shown exceptional leadership in a blockchain collaboration or implementation within an enterprise, an industry, a government, or a multi stakeholder organization. The nominees are those that have gone above and beyond the job description to spearhead blockchain initiatives within an enterprise or ecosystem.</p>

				 <p>A distributed ledger is a database that has copies distributed across a network of servers (nodes), all of which are updated simultaneously. A network like this is the foundation of decentralized identity, a way of generating robust trust and collaboration free of the security risks of centralized databases. We call the companies and organizations that support an Indicio Network node on a server that is under their control “Node Operators.”&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Recently we caught up with Karl Kneis, COO of IdRamp, and Eric Vinton, Chief Business Officer of IdRamp, one of the first companies to become an Indicio Node Operator, to discuss their current projects, some goals for the future, and where they think decentralized identity is heading.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Tell us about IdRamp: how did it start, where did it start, and who makes up your team?</p>
<p>IdRamp was born from years of frontline experience in enterprise identity management and service delivery. With IdRamp we wanted to reduce the pain and vulnerabilities that surround digital identity passwords, platform migration, operation, and service delivery.<br><br>The cost and resource requirements of managing and replacing identity platforms can be astronomical. Operation requires special skills and complex customization. Migrations can take years to complete and often fail. Service delivery can be slow and require premium resources. — Our experience found that adapting decentralized, Zero-Trust identity principles will reduce cost while increasing security and accelerating the speed of service delivery.<br><br>We founded IdRamp to help remove passwords, automate expensive tasks, reduce the need for advanced skills, and simplify the adoption of new solutions, all while improving overall security through decentralized Zero Trust. Instead of reinventing identity management platforms every few years with mammoth projects, organizations can use Idramp to enjoy continuous adoption of new services and solutions at the speed of business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized verifiable credentials can easily be adapted to any service or system for advanced Zero-Trust protection and password elimination. No coding or long term platform projects are required. People appreciate the improved privacy and simplified experience of passwordless ecosystems. Security authorities appreciate the reduced data liability and the stronger protection of Zero Trust credentials.</p>
<p>Our team’s deep experience working through generations of multinational digital identity projects gives IdRamp a unique perspective. We excel at solving complex problems with simple effective solutions that improve the bottom line.</p>
<p>What are some of the products/services (Self Sovereign Identity or not) that you currently offer? Who are your target customers? What sets you apart from the competition?</p>
<p>Our premier product is the IdRamp platform. It caters to the public sector, enterprise and SMB customers across all industries. It provides service orchestration with zero-trust decentralized identity, and password elimination.</p>
<p>While IdRamp is a zero-code solution we also provide robust APIs that can be used to extend&nbsp;</p>
<p>capabilities into any custom application or ecosystem experience. The APIs offer a limitless palette of design opportunities for application development.</p>
<p>We also provide a free digital identity wallet to securely share personal information, such as education certifications, health data, or employment credentials. The wallet provides multi-wallet stewardship capabilities that allow people to manage credentials for other people or things.This feature can be used to manage family credentials, or eldercare use cases, for example.</p>
<p>IdRamp is built on open standards for interoperability. It operates automatically across any standards-based digital identity network. While the IdRamp wallet offers robust capabilities, any standards based identity wallet can be used with the IdRamp suite of tools.</p>
<p>Recently, we co-developed a series of groundbreaking IdRamp-based apps with security software provider <a href="https://bak2.life/">Bak2.life</a>. These apps include:</p>
 
 Bouncer Zoom Event Attendee Security — extends Zoom meeting security with email 2FA or verifiable credentials for all participants. 
 Return to Life — provides a simple way for organizations to offer safe access to events and facilities based on verifiable health credentials, digital ticketing or custom credentials tailored to business needs.  
 Webcast Security Portal — provides end-to-end protection and access control for multiple webcast providers, including Zero-Trust, passwordless verifiable credentials. 
 
<p>What motivated your work in decentralized identity? Why did you become a node operator?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized identity reduces data liability, increases privacy, improves security, and human experience. It is a natural compliment to our suite of Zero-Trust passwordless solutions. Decentralized design has always been core to the Idramp strategy. Adapting new standards in decentralized identity helps our customers achieve the best possible protection across their ecosystems.</p>
<p>The problems and challenges of enterprise security have been getting worse and worse over the past decade—Zero Trust identity provides much needed relief. However, the next iteration of Zero Trust will require a decentralized network to remove the need for centralized databases that carry inherent risks and increased costs. Being a Node Operator helps IdRamp provide a more comprehensive Zero Trust service to our customers.</p>
<p>Where do you see the future of Self Sovereign Identity/Decentralized Identity?</p>
<p>The need for secure identity is a high priority because the cost of a mistake with personal data can be very expensive. Terms like “SSI” and “decentralized” will eventually fade into globally accepted standard terms for digital identity. As decentralized identity becomes the preferred security standard, new threats and attacks will be developed and new Zero Trust-solutions will be required. With Idramp, organizations can stay ahead of the rapidly changing digital identity security landscape and avoid expensive technical detours that slow business and leak revenue.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.enegragroup.com/">Enegra</a> was established in Malaysia in 2011, with a mission to enable mid-tier commodity miners in emerging markets to compete globally, Enegra achieves this through its world-class trading expertise, risk management, logistics, and governance – thereby delivering economic security among mid-tier mining communities whose lack of trading expertise often leaves them exploited on price.</p>
 Why Enegra tokenized its equity 
<p>Earlier 2019, Enegra’s management team explored asset tokenization, and team was fascinated by the concept and the advantages it brings to the company as an issuer, along the liquidity benefits to its investors. The following benefits meet exactly what Enegra sought to achieve for its new equity offering:</p>
 
 Improved liquidity 
 Automated compliance 
 Real-time cap table 
 Low administration and asset transfer costs 
 Control securities 
 Directly connect with investors 
 
 Compliantly tokenizing assets since 2019 
<p>Later in 2019, Enegra embarked on a search for a suitable tokenization platform to issue and manage its equity-backed security tokens on a public blockchain in a compliant manner, along with the necessary controls in place. Tokeny’s <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> caught Enegra’s attention for two main reasons:</p>
 
 First: it leverages the public blockchain while bringing compliance and control. It achieves this through a unique <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchain-finance-leveraging-decentralized-technology-for-capital-markets-infrastructure/">onchain compliance approach</a> by whitelisting of digital identity not the wallet for maximum security, e.g: when investors lose their wallets, issuers can recover the tokens for them. 
 Second: it provides the most advanced platform (120+ functions) with the best user experience in the market. 
 
<p>In September 2019, Enegra issued its equity-backed EGX security tokens via Tokeny’s T-REX Platform on Ethereum. From then on, Enegra has been managing its security tokens and investors through the same platform.</p>
 Improving the UX further: say goodbye to gas fees 
<p>Earlier this year, Tokeny enhanced its blockchain layer to start supporting Polygon, a scalable layer 2 solution, to provide a faster, cheaper and compliant infrastructure for its customers. In addition, <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-has-solved-the-problem-of-gas-fees/">the Gas Tank solution</a> was introduced to make the transaction fees free for platform users, eliminating infrastructure costs and troublesome processes.</p>
<p>To enhance the user experience of its security token holders, Enegra upgraded its services with Tokeny last month:</p>
 
 Migrated security tokens to Polygon&nbsp; 
 Implemented the Gas Tank solution 
 
<p>Enegra and its security token holders can now take advantage of fast, free and compliant transactions which ultimately improves liquidity and accessibility of the assets.&nbsp;</p>

The Facebook&nbsp;problem More like Facebook First, Photo: Maurizio&nbsp;Pesce<p>It hasn’t been the greatest month for Facebook. The WSJ published <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">a series of scathing exposees</a> highlighting the kinds of choices the company’s leadership regularly makes when faced with the option to expand profits versus “do the right thing.” (Which then doesn’t match their public proclamations of “doing better.”)</p><p>That in and of itself isn’t going to be much of a surprise to most people. The Facebook brand doesn’t have a ton of credibility these days. But seeing the nitty gritty details is still jarring — especially when <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline">we’re talking about children’s mental&nbsp;health</a>.</p><p>We now know who we owe these nitty gritty details, too — a company whistleblower known as “Sean.” Here actual name is Frances Haugen, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/03/technology/whistle-blower-facebook-frances-haugen.html">according to a New York Times&nbsp;report</a>.</p><p>In any case, Matt Levine has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-04/facebook-whistleblower-shows-a-shift-in-shareholder-values-away-from-profits">a straightforward breakdown of the situation</a>:</p><blockquote>Okay fine. Facebook is a for-profit company with obligations to its shareholders, and at various points it has a choice between doing pro-social things that are expensive or doing anti-social things that maximize its profits. Sometimes (she asserts, and I don’t particularly disagree) it chooses profit over public good. This is not a huge surprise, incentives being what they are, but it is good for policymakers and the public to know about the particular cases. It is good because, if we know about these choices, we can make informed decisions about regulation and enforcement. If Facebook sometimes chose to break the law to maximize profit, then regulators should punish it. If everything that Facebook does to maximize profits is legal, but some of it is horrible, then we should write new laws to make the horrible stuff illegal. If Facebook does things that are bad for the world then policymakers should try to make it stop. Basic&nbsp;stuff.</blockquote><p>That’s the inherent issue with a top-down platform that’s incentivized to maximize engagement and sharing in order to leverage its users’ data by serving them ads. Sometimes you need regulators to come in to whip them into&nbsp;shape.</p><p>Here comes the shameless plug. With Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram all down today, why not try <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-messaging-is-end-to-end-encrypted-by-default-9c5d5e7d199d">a bottom-up messenger that preserves your digital privacy and that is end-to-end encrypted by default</a>? (Shameless plug idea courtesy of GlobaliD Developer Support Engineer Paul&nbsp;Keen.)</p> 2. Facebook shelves Instagram Kids initiative <p>But sometimes, all you need is a bright enough light. After the WSJ<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-documents-instagram-teens-11632953840"> published Facebook’s internal documents about Instagram and teens</a>, the company has dutifully shelved the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/instagram-pause-kids-platform-scrutiny-4f42fa4f-4dcd-411f-b44a-33ef5f18436e.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Instagram announced Monday that it is pausing its plans to develop a version of its platform for children under&nbsp;13.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Facebook has received backlash since the Wall Street Journal published a report that showed the company knew its Instagram app is harmful to teenagers.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>By the numbers: The Journal revealed that Facebook was aware that, among teenage users, 13% of British users and 6% of American users traced the desire to kill themselves to Instagram.</blockquote><blockquote>What they’re saying: “While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we’ve decided to pause this project. This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today,” Mosseri&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>What’s next: The Senate is scheduled to hold a hearing on Thursday to address “Facebook’s research into the impact of its apps on young audiences, its actions to address threats to these users, and policy considerations to safeguard kids&nbsp;online.”</blockquote><p>Whistleblower Frances Haugen is also scheduled to testify before the Senate tomorrow.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-documents-instagram-teens-11632953840">Facebook’s Documents About Instagram and Teens, Published</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/instagram-pause-kids-platform-scrutiny-4f42fa4f-4dcd-411f-b44a-33ef5f18436e.html">Instagram pauses development of platform for&nbsp;kids</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-whistleblower-60-minutes-d2fba3d9-5fef-4aef-b2f8-6244e215b1ed.html">Facebook whistleblower’s “60 Minutes” interview puts face to bombshell allegations</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/03/technology/whistle-blower-facebook-frances-haugen.html">Whistle-Blower Says Facebook ‘Chooses Profits Over&nbsp;Safety’</a>  Via RD — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/26/ask-company-delete-personal-data/">Companies are hoarding personal data about you.

While the best-known NFTs tend to be art and collectibles, the fund will aim to support other use cases as well, like interactive experiences and fractional ownership, the according to the statement. Mintable, mintNFT and VSA Partners will also be involved, Ripple&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“While NFTs have opened the door for a tokenized future, actually navigating these concepts is a different ballgame for many,” said Monica Long, general manager of RippleX at Ripple. “By starting with marketplaces and creators, our fund seeks to take the guesswork out of NFT projects to unlock unexplored tokenization use cases on the XRP&nbsp;Ledger.”</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="http://global.id/coddsquad">/coddsquad</a> — <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-launches-250m-fund-for-nft-creators">Ripple launches $250M fund for NFT&nbsp;creators</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/ripple-starts-250-million-fund-to-woo-would-be-nft-creators?sref=T4JOT60j">Ripple Starts $250 Million Fund to Woo Would-Be NFT&nbsp;Creators</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/j">/j</a> — <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/119057/twitter-exec-reveals-test-footage-of-verification-tools-for-nft-profile-pictures">Twitter reveals beta test of verification tools for NFT profile&nbsp;pictures</a>   4.

         A Case Study of Norwegian Salmon for the Chinese Market 
<p>Master thesis by Andreas Høieggen Steensæth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also want to thank Stephan Nilsson, CEO and founder of UNISOT for introducing me to<br>
potential interview respondents, for expert advice and taking the time for nearly weekly<br>
follow-up meetings in which he was available for questioning and advice. Additionally, I<br>
would like to thank Torje Vingen Sunde, CFO of UNISOT, for also participating in these<br>
meetings, offering suggestions and giving feedback throughout the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a dynamic and highly globalized world supply chains are complex and demanding to manage, and it is difficult to achieve full transparency and traceability. In China, a nation with substantial history of food scandals, the outbreak of covid-19 has recently increased the attention toward food safety and traceability.</p>
<p>This thesis aims to identify supply chain and traceability challenges Norwegian seafood is faced with in the Chinese market, the potential instruments that can meet the challenges, and how blockchain technologies potentially can meet the challenges. In order to accomplish this, there has been conducted a literature research that has examined the seafood supply chain, the Chinese market, traceability and blockchain technologies. Furthermore, for the primary research, there has been conducted semi-structured interviews with five informants with expert knowledge of Norwegian seafood, the Chinese market, and/or blockchain technologies, and a supply chain map has been constructed.</p>
<p>The findings identified 14 challenges related to supply chain, traceability and political areas. In order to assess how blockchain can improve several of the challenges, the challenges “policies”, “participation”, and “tampering” were selected to illustrate how blockchain technology can contribute to solving these. It was concluded that the unique properties of blockchain technology has the potential to meet several of the challenges identified related to supply chain management and implementation of traceability.</p>

   An Update on Our Developer Offering 

<p>As many of you may know, Okta completed the acquisition of Auth0 in May of 2021. We’ve since been busy, working out how our products will work together to help developers provide the best experiences for their users. If you joined us for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLshTZo9V1-aHrVURzggebSWeltPQ4KCex">Developer Day</a>, you saw Okta and Auth0 showcase interesting projects happening at our companies and in our communities.</p>

<p>In the months since the Auth0 acquisition, one of the most important areas we’ve focused on is how to clarify and streamline our product offerings for developers. That work has led to some changes to Okta’s developer plans, announced in this post.</p>

 Changes to the Okta Developer Advanced Plan 

<p>First, we will no longer offer the Okta Developer Advanced paid plan for new signups.  Developers who want to get started with a pay-as-you-go experience should instead use <a href="https://auth0.com/pricing">Auth0’s plans</a>, which provide flexible options based on usage and features. Auth0’s offering also includes a generous free plan. Developers who are currently using the Okta Developer Advanced plan will continue to receive the same level of service and support they originally signed up for, without needing to change terms or migrate to Auth0. If you are a developer currently on the Okta Developer Advanced plan and you decide to upgrade or change your plan, you will need to work with an Okta sales representative to find the plan that best meets your needs.</p>

 Meet Okta Developer Edition 

<p>Second, the Developer Starter free plan, now known as Okta Developer Edition, will function as a playground where developers can explore and build their projects in a full-featured, pre-production Okta environment. Okta Developer Edition includes 100 monthly active users (MAUs) and is intended for all developers, whether you’re evaluating Okta’s products or creating something for the <a href="https://www.okta.com/okta-integration-network/">Okta Integration Network</a>. Okta Developer Edition will remain completely free. Developers who are already using the Developer Starter free plan with a 15k user limit will continue to enjoy their current allocation of free MAU until they reach the 15k limit, at which point they will need to upgrade to a paid plan.</p>

<p>We know plan changes can be disruptive, and it can be a challenge to understand potential impacts to your current and prospective projects. We believe that these changes will, in the end, clarify the differences between Okta and Auth0 developer offerings. Our goal is to give developers everything they need to explore the functionality the Okta environment provides while providing a clear path to Auth0 for developers who want a fully self-service experience.</p>

 Country Landscape Review <p>Authors: Raymond Onuoha (<a href="mailto:ronuoha@lbs.edu.ng">ronuoha@lbs.edu.ng</a>), Olayinka David-West (<a href="mailto:ydavid-west@lbs.edu.ng">ydavid-west@lbs.edu.ng</a>), Renée Hunter (<a href="mailto:rhunter@v4w.org">rhunter@v4w.org</a>)</p><p>We are starting a new research project — and we’d like you to join us on the journey. Over the course of 2021, Lagos Business School and Value for Women, in partnership with Caribou Digital, and with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, aim to understand the experiences of young women working or trading through digital platforms in Nigeria. We are particularly interested in uncovering whether and how such activities contribute to their economic empowerment, and the extent to which COVID-19 has impacted this. The study also builds on previous work on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-working-trading-renting-and-engaging-in-digital-marketplaces-b144ffcc1141">platform livelihoods</a> by both Caribou Digital and researchers at Qhala in Kenya. It is also part of wider ongoing research on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/how-can-we-make-platform-livelihoods-better-for-young-women-especially-during-and-after-covid-19-696b3974bf61">platforms livelihoods and women</a> that includes additional studies in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/researching-gender-and-platform-livelihoods-in-ghana-9359ec3f55b0">Ghana</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/women-and-platform-livelihoods-in-kenya-the-impact-of-covid-19-954d6b073997">Kenya</a>.</p> (Un)employment in Nigeria: A need to look beyond the formal&nbsp;sector <p>Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy, with over 200 million people, millions of whom are currently underutilized. Despite several government interventions to drive economic activity and consequently create (formal) jobs, Nigeria’s unemployment rate has continued to rapidly climb in the last decade. Although the data does depend on the exact definition of “unemployment rate,” unemployment rose from <a href="https://www.ng.undp.org/content/nigeria/en/home/library/human_development/undp-nigeria-annual-report-2016.html">3.5% in 2006 to 33% in 2020</a>; The country currently <a href="https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary.?queries[search]=unemployment">ranks</a> 164 out of 182 in global unemployment.</p><p>A closer look at the numbers shows that some groups — especially women — are harder hit than others in terms of obtaining employment. Overall, 23% of the labor force work only 20–39 hours per week, and 16% work less than 20 hours per week. Delving into different age ranges and genders provides an even more nuanced picture: youth (15–34 years) are faced with the highest unemployment (45%), and 35% of women are unemployed, with an additional 24% being underemployed (20–39 hours per week). The higher-than-average figures for these social groups indicate that the talents of especially young women are currently underutilized, making online opportunities all the more interesting and important for these&nbsp;groups.</p><p>Figure 1 presents a breakdown of the labor population.</p>Figure 1: Nigeria’s Labour Statistics, Q4 2020. Source: NBS The categories in this figure mean the following:<br>● Working age range: 15–64 years<br>● Labour force: members of the working age that are able and willing to work<br>● Fully employed: worked 40+ hours per week<br>● Underemployed: worked between 20–39 hours per&nbsp;week<p>Some of the barriers keeping (young) women out of employment include traditional gender roles and biases, lower literacy rates, and lower rates of access to mobile phones and internet connectivity. For example, 49% of men (compared to 34% of women) agree that a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl, and 74% of men (compared to 55% of women) agree that, when jobs are scarce, <a href="https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp">men should have more right to employment than women</a>. Gaps in educational attainment start long before university, with <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ADT.1524.LT.FE.ZS?locations=NG">literacy rates for young women </a>in Nigeria at 68%, compared to young men at 82% — 1.2 times as high. Access to <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GSMA-The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2020.pdf">information and learning opportunities</a> is hampered by gaps in mobile internet usage, which for women in Nigeria stand at 38%, in contrast to that for men at 54% — 1.4 times as&nbsp;high.</p><p>With the limited scope of the formal sector to employ people in general, individuals are looking elsewhere for their livelihoods. This is not new; in fact, 93% of working Nigerians are <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_626831.pdf">informally employed</a> (women more than men). The increasing number of digital platforms provides an attractive avenue for individuals to earn a livelihood outside the parameters of formal employment.</p> Online platforms: Potential to fill women’s livelihood gaps? <p>Nigeria’s digital economy has seen rapid growth in the last five years. As of 2019, there were an estimated 138 <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/07.2020_Nigeria-Digital-platform-landscape.pdf">digital platforms</a> active in the country (of which 80% are homegrown). Freelancing platforms are the most common (35), followed by marketplace platforms (32) and ride-hailing apps (21). These digital platforms act as virtual marketplaces that connect buyers and sellers of goods and services. Determining the number of individuals earning a livelihood through these platforms is difficult, due to challenges in definitions and data collection. Recent estimates range from as little as<a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/Policy-options-for-regulating-platform-work_Nov-2020-2.pdf"> 0.01% of the labor force</a> to almost <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/i2i-ADP-infographic-2018.pdf">three million individuals</a>. When individuals conducting business via social platforms (such as WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram) are included, estimates are even&nbsp;higher.</p><p>The key drivers of growth within the Nigerian platform ecosystem include a large, young, and entrepreneurial population, as well as an active ecosystem that incorporates digital start-ups (estimated up to <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/Documents/resources/courses/moc-course-at-harvard/pdf/student-projects/Lagos_ICT_2017.pdf">700</a>), incubators, and venture capital firms. This is particularly true in Lagos, which generates the most economic activity in the country — accounting for <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/Documents/resources/courses/moc-course-at-harvard/pdf/student-projects/Lagos_ICT_2017.pdf">25% of national GDP</a> and <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2021-nigeria">18%</a> of all <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2021/03/30/fct-lagos-3-other-states-gain-highest-internet-subscribers-in-2020/">Nigerian internet users</a>. While other urban areas are also seeing an uptick in the use of digital platforms, rural areas remain behind due to a digital divide underpinned by lack of internet access, affordability, and digital literacy and&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Nigerian women have been moving towards online livelihoods. A demand-side survey conducted between 2017 and 2018 shows that, among internet users, <a href="https://media.africaportal.org/documents/2019_After-Access_Africa-Comparative-report.pdf">women are 1.6 times more likely</a> than men to earn income via online means. In and of itself, this is interesting, given the higher levels of economic participation among men generally, but it is even more so when compared to data from other countries in Africa, which shows that this trend is generally reversed elsewhere, as observed on microwork platforms (see Table 1). In addition to the imperative of finding livelihoods outside of traditional means (as described above), <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/FINAL_Nigeria-e-hailing-note_Aug-2020.pdf">reasons for preferring online work</a> include flexibility, the opportunity to work from home, and the potential for significantly higher earnings.</p><p>However, gendered gaps and dynamics remain. First, it is important to remember that the figures in Table 1 refer to the percentage of internet users that earn a livelihood via online platforms. Given the prevailing digital divide (for one, according to the <a href="https://www.gsma.com/r/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2021.pdf">GSMA</a>, 56% of men compared to only 40% of women in Nigeria make use of mobile internet), women have more hurdles to overcome before they are able to access and productively use mobile internet, and subsequently online platforms. Moreover, <a href="https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/20.500.12413/14727/597_Gender_Roles_in_Nigerian_Labour_Market.pdf?sequence=1">women’s (analogue) employment</a> is concentrated in economic sectors such as agriculture, small-scale commerce, and the informal sector. Initial cross-country evidence shows that <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/i2i-ADP-infographic-2018.pdf">similar differences </a>might remain when moving to online livelihoods.</p><p>Table 1: Digital Platform microwork participation in select African countries disaggregated by gender. Source: Gillwald and Onkokame&nbsp;(2019).</p><p>We intend to further investigate the potential of online platforms to meet the need for more income-generating opportunities for young Nigerian women. We think of women’s (economic) empowerment in digital platforms as the relative ease with which women have access to these platforms and mobilize them for sustainable socio-economic capital.</p><p>Online platforms might contribute to women’s (economic) empowerment through facilitating income-generation, coupled with flexibility and autonomy, which provides more opportunities for women to be self-sufficient and combine a decent livelihood with their other responsibilities. In Nigeria, with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, women entrepreneurs (mostly low-income) working in open markets had to <a href="https://www.womensworldbanking.org/insights-and-impact/covid-19-unlocks-e-commerce-digital-finance-among-low-income-women-in-nigeria/">pivot their trading activities to online platforms</a>, even though many were previously unbanked and undigitized. This shift became imperative because of the increased migration to online shopping. For these women, going digital was a survivalist option to retain their clientele and potentially expand their operations during the lockdown.</p><p>However, studies show that some digital platforms exploit online earners, which might further exacerbate gendered power dynamics. For example, <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/Policy-options-for-regulating-platform-work_Nov-2020-2.pdf">certain platform practices</a>, such as the ability to block users due to bad reviews, put earners at a significant disadvantage. And online environments are not removed from the biases prevalent in offline environments;<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/qydel2020/"> forthcoming research by Caribou Digital</a> finds that freelancers in the Global South can find it beneficial to pretend to be based in Europe or the United States, as they find it increases their likelihood of getting jobs. We might expect to see similar biases impact the online livelihoods of women (remember that almost ¾ of Nigerian men agree that jobs should go to men when they are in high demand!).</p><p>Different stakeholders have different roles to play in creating opportunities for women’s online livelihoods. State interventions, for example, can set <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/Policy-options-for-regulating-platform-work_Nov-2020-2.pdf">regulatory requirements for platforms</a> and apply <a href="https://doi.org/10.14662/IJPSD2017.025">interventions to labor relations</a> overall. In Nigeria the <a href="http://socialprotectionng.com/share/Nigeria%20National%20Social%20Protection%20Policy%20-%20Draft%202016.pdf">2016 National Social Protection Policy</a> establishes a gender-sensitive and age-appropriate framework for enhancing women livelihoods, though it does not recognize online work; the <a href="https://www.decentjobsforyouth.org/commitment/190">Nigeria Youth Employment Action Plan (NYEAP)</a> targets young people within the age range of 18–35 for employment creation in critical sectors of the economy; and the <a href="https://nigerianwomentrustfund.org/wp-content/uploads/National-Gender-PolicySituation-Analysis.pdf">National Gender Policy of 2006</a> aims to mainstream women’s rights across economic sectors. Thus far, however, these policies have not significantly shifted private sector practices from traditional values and power dynamics.</p><p>Online platforms can apply a gender lens to their activities to de-bias their structures and provide more protection to the individuals using them. While work has been done to establish international standards on best practices for online platforms (see, for example, the work done by the <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/">Fairwork Foundation</a>), to our knowledge this is not yet prevalent through a gender&nbsp;lens.</p><p>The development and research communities have roles in unearthing evidence, bringing parties together to learn, and making recommendations! This is precisely where our current project comes&nbsp;in.</p> Our approach  Our key questions are: <p>1) In what ways might platform work empower&nbsp;women?</p><p>2) How can we make platforms work better for&nbsp;women?</p><p>We will undertake qualitative research to answer these questions. This will consist of focus groups and in-depth interviews with women earning livelihoods through online channels — both as gig workers and micro-entrepreneurs — and in-depth expert interviews with ecosystem stakeholders, including civil society, platforms, digital finance providers, regulators, and other private sector&nbsp;actors.</p><p>We will use a participatory video storytelling method to dig deeper into the lived experiences of select female workers by giving them the tools (a phone, video training, and mentoring) to tell their story. See Caribou DIgital’s previous<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/"> participatory video storytelling project </a>with gig&nbsp;workers.</p><p>We will also engage digital platforms directly through a Gender Self-Assessment Survey, conducted via <a href="https://www.v4w.org/gendersmartnexus/">Value for Women’s Gender Smart Nexus</a>. This standardized assessment measures the levels of gender inclusion for different types of businesses. We will adapt this survey to platform operations specifically, allowing us to summarize trends in platforms’ focuses and approaches. This tool will subsequently be available for other platforms to use, and we invite you to get in touch should you be interested in applying it to your own operations!</p> Get involved <p>Between July and September, we will engage with online earners, digital platforms, experts, and other interested folks. Should you be interested in a conversation with us about your work, or feel that there is a certain individual we simply must interview — please don’t hesitate to send us an email! We’ll publish a consolidated country report by the end of 2021, and will share updates on our findings as we move&nbsp;along.</p><p>Raymond Onuoha (ronuoha@lbs.edu.ng)</p><p>Prof. Olayinka David-West — Lagos Business School (ydavid-west@lbs.edu.ng)</p><p>Renée Hunter — Value for Women (rhunter@v4w.org)</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/online-livelihoods-and-young-womens-economic-empowerment-in-nigeria-ccbbea4020e2">Online livelihoods and young women’s economic empowerment in Nigeria</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Future Now Problem blurs the lines between what is feasible NOW and what is only going to be possible in the FUTURE.</p>
<p>NOTE: This article is going to evolve and be updated. I likely won’t announce all of the changes.</p>
<p>The decentralized identity/SSI space is particularly good at creating and exacerbating this problem. We’re working through, with several clients, planning production deployment and the Future Now Problem keeps cropping up. There are so many issues here that I could probably write a small book – though I won’t .</p>
<p>For a quick briefer I recorded a quick Loom video – that I will replace with newer versions as the message gets crisper:</p>
  
<p>When the idea of what is available right NOW is blurred among the ideas of the FUTURE,&nbsp;you can’t differentiate between what is feasible TODAY from what is not ready for prime time.</p>
<p>As an example, there are ongoing issues in many of the “standards” that are driving the industry. Most of the standards haven’t been passed and if they have, they have enough vaguaries that compliance is easy but interoperability is a non-starter. So the sharp projects are working through many of the interop and other issues in their own ecosystems and making progress. In order to do that, they are critically examining where the Future Now Problem has led them astray.</p>
<p>This takes hard work and the ability to operate in a trusted environment. We’re happy to help our clients understand what is NOW and what is FUTURE (and how to plan for and influence that future).&nbsp;</p>

 SUMMARY 



  Since Bitcoin’s inception, blockchain technology has radically transformed finance.&nbsp;  However, none of the new-world benefits of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) may be sustained without adherence to evolving regulatory standards.&nbsp;  Civic CEO Chris Hart explores the past, present and future of DeFi.  



 In banks we trust(ed) 



<p>Not long ago, when someone talked about finance, there was no need to qualify what type of finance they were referring to. Centralized Finance, CeFi now, was the only option. This was true not because innovative ideas were lacking, but because large, central, state-sponsored or legacy financial institutions held all the cards.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The structural friction and inherent inequities controlling financial systems resisted the standing up of a new bank, exchange or regulated entity, and prevented all but the most advantaged institutions from participating in anything other than a transactional relationship.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>For example, when you look at securities trading in the US, most exchanges are owned by a precious few companies, including the Intercontinental Exchange, which is the NYSE’s parent company, Cboe Global Markets or Nasdaq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be sure, there are a few upstart new entrants in the last couple of years, but mostly the exchanges have changed little in the past couple of decades.</p>



 But blockchain and crypto change all that, don’t they? 



<p>With the advent of blockchain and crypto currencies, what is striking is how much has changed, and how so many things still remain the same.</p>



<p>In centralized crypto exchanges (CEX), as in traditional finance (TradFi), enforcement of regulatory compliance rules like Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML), and the structural friction inherent in the granting process of licenses are the mechanisms by which winners and losers have emerged. And with that, the emergence of CeFi for the crypto world has largely occurred.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>A few large crypto institutions hosting central limit order books, lending and other financial services now cater to millions of users worldwide.</p></blockquote>



<p>In effect, CeFi for crypto took the legacy exchange model, albeit with the addition of broker functionalities and removal of the need for clearinghouses, and rebooted it for a new asset class:</p>



  



 Disintermediation of finance: why are we walking but not yet running? 



<p>In many ways, the blockchain developments of the last 13 years have rewritten the rulebook, enabling permissionless innovation of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) such as Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and decentralized central limit order books, Lending Protocols, and the advent of DeFi in general. These products and services, among others, have provided tremendous value to their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFi’s thesis is particularly well suited to replacing important aspects of the centralized finance stack: trading logic (smart contracts / protocols), custody (non-custodial wallets), and security (on-chain elimination of counterparty risk / auditable contracts):</p>



  



<p>However, in other important ways <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401">the rules remain the same</a> for compliance, regulatory oversight and capital markets. The argument goes that it remains crucial to ensure basic safeguards remain in place to curtail bad actors and to provide guardrails for retail investors for whom loss of funds could be monumental.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>What is clear, is that the days of treating regulatory compliance as irrelevant to DeFi, or imagining that somehow the blockchain paradigm exempts the new breed of Fintechs from basic checks like KYC, are coming to a close.</p><p></p></blockquote>



<p>It is true that the more complicated offerings like derivatives (i.e. futures, options) and high leverage trading require a degree of sophistication, but should elite banks decide who gets to participate? And why should those traders and investors who want to participate in DeFi be blocked from doing so, assuming appropriate guardrails are in place? At Civic we believe in the power of DeFi and the more level playing field it provides.</p>



 Is there a way to get the best of both worlds? 



<p>There are good reasons why KYC and AML guidelines need to be followed. However, until now the process of disintermediation of the traditional financial services stack has not allowed for both DeFi structures and compliance frameworks to enable the next wave of innovation.</p>



<p>Civic and our partners are working to change that with the introduction of Civic Pass:</p>



  



<p>With Civic Pass, our partners can move towards meeting KYC &amp; AML requirements with Civic’s SaaS compliance tools. These tool allows for participation with known counterparties and permissioned DeFi pools of liquidity.</p>



<blockquote><p>Ultimately, Civic’s vision is to provide the identity and compliance piece of the DeFi puzzle. We want to enable the complete disintermediation of CeFi and, more broadly, foster the adoption of identity and compliance structures for any on-chain project that needs them.</p></blockquote>



<p>At Civic we believe that the power of decentralization can be coupled with an on-chain identity layer in a way that adheres to regulatory requirements, accelerates the pace of innovation, enables the next 100 innovative blockchain companies and protects individual privacy. Civic is excited to continue to work with these innovators and regulators as we work towards true decentralization of the DeFi governance layer.</p>



<p>If you want to get a glimpse of what that future looks like, check out the first implementation of the Civic Pass solution with <a href="http://dex.solrise.finance/">our launch partner</a>.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>What use cases should a National Digital Identity program prioritize in collaboration with the private sector? As use cases become verticals of their own, what are then some of the horizontal considerations that need to be applied to enable all of the use cases to function within their relative ecosystems? Hakan Yildiz can help us answer these questions being that he’s a Research Associate at TU Berlin and a Consortium Partner at <a href="https://idunion.org/?lang=en">IDunion</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 IDunion 101: a general overview, what are some of the early credentials being issued by government (people and legal entity VCs) and some of the existing ecosystem participants 
 IDunion Use Cases (Verticals): what are some of the government use cases (eHealth, eGov and Education)? What are some of the private sector use cases (Financial, Hospitality, IAM)? 
 IDunion Workstreams (Horizontals): governance, cybersecurity, wallet security, UX, interoperability and more.

 Le due società del Gruppo Tinexta offrono al mercato una soluzione unica, in grado di intercettare malware e truffe prima che possano entrare nella casella di posta 



<p>Roma, 04 ottobre 2021 – InfoCert, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, e Yoroi, attiva nello sviluppo di sistemi integrati di difesa cibernetica, annunciano il rilascio di Legalmail Security Premium, una nuova soluzione di Posta Elettronica Certificata che si distingue per la capacità di combinare la forza legale della PEC con i più alti standard di sicurezza informatica.</p>



<p>Grazie alla collaborazione tra le due aziende, leader nei rispettivi settori di mercato, i clienti di Legalmail potranno avvalersi del servizio di protezione “Legalmail Security Premium”. Il servizio, basato sulla sandbox Yomi di Yoroi, consente di bloccare le comunicazioni sospette, intercettando e neutralizzando elementi malevoli come allegati e/o link prima della consegna del messaggio.</p>



<p>Il livello di sicurezza verrà così aumentato e sarà in grado di fronteggiare al meglio la nuova ondata di cyberattacchi, la cui efficacia è legata molto spesso alla capacità di ingannare gli utenti, inducendoli a cliccare su allegati o link all’apparenza innocui ma con conseguenze potenzialmente drammatiche. La PEC è diventata uno strumento irrinunciabile nella quotidianità, e per tale motivo un canale sempre più appetibile per gli attacchi informatici: basti pensare che, nel prima semestre del 2021, il numero di caselle attive ha superato i 13 milioni, per un totale di oltre 1 miliardo di messaggi scambiati.</p>



<p>“Aumentare i livelli di sicurezza della PEC è un impegno per noi inderogabile. Ciò è confermato anche dal recente rafforzamento di tutte le caselle Legalmail grazie alla possibilità di attivare l’autenticazione a doppio fattore (o strong authentication). Il bisogno di sicurezza non deve però intaccare la facilità d’uso e gli elevati livelli prestazionali che contraddistinguono il prodotto Legalmail e che ne decretano il successo di mercato: la sinergia con Yoroi ci ha consentito di rispondere in pieno a questa duplice sfida. Il risultato è una soluzione all’avanguardia che non ha eguali sul mercato, permettendo di agire da filtro attivo e intelligente a protezione dei nostri clienti”, commenta Carmine Auletta, Chief Innovation &amp; Strategy Officer di InfoCert.</p>



<p>“Il nostro lavoro è proteggere le persone in tutte le attività quotidiane. Molti attacchi ransomware verso la Sanità e le aziende cominciano cliccando su un link o un allegato malevoli. L’email è uno dei veicoli principali attraverso cui i cybercriminali cercano di entrare nella nostra casa virtuale e noi vogliamo fare tutto ciò che è possibile per impedirglielo”, conclude Marco Ramilli, Ceo di Yoroi.</p>

Because of this fact, the anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and other financial crime-related obligations of investment advisors vary considerably from those of banks, broker-dealers, or other formal financial institutions. The risk attendant to these entities is, therefore, more pernicious than that related to entities with stricter regulatory oversight and more onerous reporting obligations.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In this tutorial, you are going to create a single-page application (SPA) that uses a Spring Boot resource server and a Vue front-end client. You’ll see how to configure Spring Boot to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization, with Okta as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. You’ll also see how to bootstrap a Vue client app with the Vue CLI and how to secure it using the Okta Sign-In Widget.</p>

<p>Okta is a computer security services company that provides a lot of great resources for securing web applications. The Okta Sign-In Wdiget is a great way to secure front-end applications because it allows you to easily add a secure login form that is configurable for single sign-on and social sign-on with external providers such as Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn. It provides an implementation of the authorization code OAuth 2.0 flow using PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange).</p>

<p>PKCE is a modification of the authorization code flow that does not require the application to have the client secret, making it suitable for client applications where the code is essentially public. Implementing a secure authorization code flow on a front-end application requires properly handing redirects and the token exchange, which can be a little involved. Fortunately, Okta has simplified this process greatly, handling a lot of the complexity for you.</p>

<p>Requirements</p>

<p>Before you get started, you’ll need to make sure you have a few tools installed.</p>

 
   
    <p>Okta CLI: The Okta CLI is an easy way to create projects that use Okta for security. Follow the installation instructions on the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI project website</a>. You should log in to your existing account or register for a new account using the CLI before continuing with this tutorial.</p>
   
   
    <p>Java 11: This project uses Java 11. OpenJDK 11 will work just as well.  Instructions are found on the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/">OpenJDK website</a>. OpenJDK can also be installed using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Alternatively, <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> is another excellent option for installing and managing Java versions.</p>
   
   
    <p>Vue CLI: You’ll use the Vue CLI to generate the starter Vue client project. Install it according to the <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html">the instructions on the Vue website</a>.</p>
   
 

 Create the Spring Boot Resource Server 

<p>To bootstrap the Spring Boot resource server project, you will use <a href="https://start.spring.io/">the Spring Initializr</a>. It’s designed to help developers quickly configure and generate Spring Boot projects. There’s <a href="https://start.spring.io/">a great web interface</a> that you should take a look at. However, in this project, you’re going to use the REST interface to download a pre-configured project.</p>

<p>This project will have both a Vue client and a Spring Boot server project, so you may want to make a parent directory called something like <code>Spring Boot SPA</code>. Use the following command to download and extract the starter project in the parent directory.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
  -d type=maven-project \
  -d language=java \
  -d platformVersion=2.5.4 \
  -d jvmVersion=11 \
  -d artifactId=spring-boot-spa \
  -d baseDir=spring-boot-spa \
  -d packageName=com.okta.springbootspa \
  -d group=com.okta \
  -d dependencies=web,okta \
  | tar -xzvf -	
</code>   

<p>The command above configures various aspects of the Spring Boot project, including the Spring Boot version and the Java version. It also configures two dependencies.</p>

 
   
    <p>The first, <code>web</code>, includes Spring MVC, Spring’s standard web package.</p>
   
   
    <p>The second, <code>okta</code>, includes Okta’s Spring Boot starter.</p>
   
 

<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">the Okta Spring Boot Starter project on GitHub</a> for more info, but briefly, it streamlines the use of Okta to secure Spring Boot projects. For a resource server, you would typically need to include the Spring Security OAuth Resource Server dependency, but the Okta Spring Boot Starter includes this for you.</p>

<p>Now that you have the basic application in place, replace <code>DemoApplication.java</code> with the following code.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/okta/springbootspa/DemoApplication.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.okta.springbootspa;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }

    @RestController
    @CrossOrigin
    class CaffeineLevelRestController {

        String getCaffeineLevel() {
            List&lt;String&gt; givenList = Arrays.asList(
                    "Head on table asleep. Needs coffee now!",
                    "Not at all. What's wrong?!",
                    "Mildly. Boring.",
                    "Making progress.",
                    "Everything is awesome. Stuff is definitely happening.",
                    "Eyeballs are rolling around in my head and I'm shouting at my coworker about JHipster.",
                    "The LD50 of caffeine is 100 cups. Your developer has had 99 and is talking to the bike rack outside while jogging in place."
            );
            Random rand = new Random();
            String caffeineLevelString = givenList.get(rand.nextInt(givenList.size()));
            return caffeineLevelString;
        }

        @GetMapping("/howcaffeinatedami")
        public String getCaffeineLevel(Principal principal) {
            String userName = principal != null ? principal.getName() : "Anonymous";
            return userName + ", your developer's caffeine level is: " + getCaffeineLevel();
        }
    }

    @Configuration
    @EnableWebSecurity
    class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

        @Override
        protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
            http.cors().and()
                    .authorizeRequests(authorizeRequests -&gt; authorizeRequests.anyRequest().authenticated())
                    .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This example resource server defines one endpoint, <code>/howcaffeinatedami</code>, that returns a random (and hopefully humorous) string designating your developer’s current caffeine level.</p>

<p>There is also an inner class (at the bottom) that extends <code>WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter</code> to configure Spring Security for the application. The configuration class does three things:</p>

 
   
    <p>ensures that all requests require authentication;</p>
   
   
    <p>configures Spring Boot to use the standard resource server security configuration with JSON Web Tokens (JWT); and</p>
   
   
    <p>enables CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).</p>
   
 

<p>You also need to add a line to the <code>application.properties</code> file. This line changes the resource server port from the default <code>8080</code> to <code>8082</code>. You have to do this because the VueJS application will run on <code>8080</code>.</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code></p>

 <code>server.port=8082
</code> 

<p>You now have the code in place for the resource server. You’ll still need to configure the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC settings to use Okta as the provider, but first, I want to explain a little about CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). It’s not just an annoying error your browsers throw at you when you’re trying to develop apps locally! If you already totally understand CORS or are impatient to keep moving, feel free to skip the next section.</p>

 Spring Boot and CORS 

<p>CORS is a protocol that allows for browsers and servers to explicitly allow cross-origin resource sharing. By default, JavaScript running in a browser is restrained by a same-origin policy. This means that a Javascript application can only make calls to a server that resides on the same domain from which it was loaded. As a starting point, this makes a lot of sense from a security perspective and prevents a lot of abuse. However, this policy would be pretty restrictive if developers were not able to allow exceptions.</p>

<p>CORS allows resource servers to explicitly enable cross-origin requests, to tell the browser what type of requests it allows and from what origins. It is a white-listing scheme in the sense that all cross-origin requests will be denied by the browser unless the server is explicitly configured to allow them.</p>

<p>Notice that this protocol is mediated between the server and the browser. The client application, the Vue app in this case, doesn’t really have to do anything about CORS. From the perspective of the client app, the HTTP request to the resource server will either succeed or fail. If it fails because of CORS, the request will return a <code>401 (Unauthorized)</code>.</p>

<p>In this example, the resource server resides on <code>http://localhost:8082</code> and the Vue client will be loaded from the Vue development server at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. Because the port number is part of the domain, these two URLs are considered different origins by the browser. When the Vue app tries to make a request to the Spring Boot resource server, the browser will throw an error unless CORS is properly configured.</p>

<p>Note that not every request will trigger a CORS check. Certain types of simple requests are allowed, particularly requests that only allow form and text content types and the <code>GET</code>, <code>HEAD</code>, and <code>POST</code> request types. Take a look at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">Mozilla developer docs</a> on this for more info. However, any request with the <code>Content-Type</code> header <code>application-json</code> will always trigger a CORS check if made to a cross-origin domain.</p>

<p>The first thing the browser will do when a suitable request is made to a resource on a different domain is to send a CORS preflight request. This is actually a totally separate request made by the browser before it sends the actual request. The CORS preflight request essentially asks the browser if it is configured for CORS, if it will allow the type of request the client wants to send (DELETE, GET, POST, etc.), and if it will allow requests from the specific origin domain. The preflight request has nothing to do with authentication or authorization in the way we normally speak about it. It’s just a quick check to see if CORS is configured and if, in theory, the server might allow the request based on the HTTP verb and the client domain.</p>

<p>If the preflight header is not handled correctly, CORS will return an error to the client application. If the preflight header does not allow the type of request or does not allow requests from the client origin, CORS will also return an error to the client. The actual, original request to the server will never be made. Only once the preflight request has been properly handled will the browser allow the request from the client app to the resource server proceed.</p>

<p>Here is a general outline of a CORS request:</p>

 
   JavaScript client app makes request to resource server on different domain 
   Browser intercepts request, flags it as requiring CORS verification, and sends the CORS preflight request to the resource server 
   Server responds to the preflight request by saying it will allow the client domain to make the type of request 
   Browser sends the origin request to the server 
   Server handles original request, authenticating and authorizing it using OAuth 2.0 and OIDC before returning a reply 
 

<p>From a developer perspective, CORS is something that needs to be configured on the server. Spring Boot makes this easy. There are two places in the Java code where CORS is configured. CORS must generally be enabled for the Spring Boot application. This is done in the <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class in the <code>configure(HttpSecurity http)</code> method by adding the <code>cors()</code> method to the <code>http</code> configuration chain.</p>

<p>The second place is the <code>@CrossOrigin</code> annotation on the <code>CaffeineLevelRestController</code> class. This tells Spring Boot to configure CORS for all endpoints in this controller. By default, this will allow cross-origin requests from any domain. To restrict requests to only our client application domain, we could have used the annotation <code>@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:8080")</code>.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2015/06/08/cors-support-in-spring-framework">this Spring blog post</a> for more info on Spring Boot and CORS.</p>

 Configure the Resource Server for Okta Auth 

<p>You should already have used the Okta CLI to either register a new account or log into an existing account. If not, please do so now. From a bash shell, type <code>okta login</code>, you should see a message that says something like: <code>Okta Org already configured: https://dev-133337.okta.com/</code>. This is your Okta base domain.</p>

<p>The only configuration you have to do for the resource server is to add the <code>okta.oauth2.issuer</code> property to the <code>application.properties</code> file. Spring Security and the Okta Spring Boot Starter will use the issuer endpoint to discover any other configuration it needs (except for the <code>aud</code> claim, which defaults to <code>api://default</code>).</p>

<p>Your issuer is simply your Okta domain plus <code>/oauth2/default</code>, such as <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>Another way to find your issuer URI is to open your Okta developer dashboard. Select Security and API from the left menu. This will show you your authorization servers. Mostly likely you only have the default authorization server that was set up for you when you signed up. This page will show you the audience (again, probably <code>api://default</code>) and the Issuer URI.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Add the issuer URI to your properties file, which should look something like below, replacing <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> with your actual Okta domain.</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code></p>

   <code>server.port=8082
okta.oauth2.issuer=/oauth2/default
</code>   

<p>You now have a working, secure resource server. Go ahead and run the application.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>You should get a lot of console output that ends with the following.</p>

   <code>2021-09-01 11:49:42.136  INFO 370077 --- [           main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8082 (http) with context path ''
2021-09-01 11:49:42.143  INFO 370077 --- [           main] com.okta.springbootspa.DemoApplication   : Started DemoApplication in 2.021 seconds (JVM running for 2.199)
</code>   

 Use the Vue CLI to Bootstrap the Client App 

<p>The next step is to build the front-end, client application. The application will use Vue and the Okta Sign-In Widget to implement a secure client application. The Okta Sign-In Widget allows you to easily add Single Sign-On (SSO) and a secure login form to any application.</p>

<p>The instructions below for integrating the Okta Sign-In widget with Vue are largely pulled from <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/vue/okta_vue_sign-in_widget/#add-an-openid-connect-client-in-okta">this article</a> on the Okta website, which is a great reference if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Create the app using the Vue CLI. Run the following command from the project root directory (the directory above the Spring Boot project directory). It will create a new directory, <code>okta-app</code>, which will contain the client application.</p>

   <code>vue create okta-app
</code>   

<p>Select <code>Manually select features</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure <code>Router</code> and <code>Choose Vue version</code> are selected. <code>Babel</code> and <code>Linter / Formatter</code> were automatically selected for me as well, which is fine.</p>

<p>Select version <code>3.x</code>.</p>

<p>Enable <code>history mode for router</code> (type <code>y</code>).</p>

<p>Select <code>ESLint with error prevention only</code>.</p>

<p>The defaults for the remainder of the options are fine: lint on save, saving configuration in dedicated files, and not saving this as a preset.</p>

<p>Navigate into the project directory.</p>

   <code>cd okta-app
</code>   

<p>You need to install a few dependencies. The first three are required for Okta security and the sign-in widget. The last, <code>axios</code>, is the library you’ll use to make the HTTP request to the resource server.</p>

   <code>npm install --save \
  @okta/okta-signin-widget@5.12.0 \
  @okta/okta-vue@5.0.1 \
  @okta/okta-auth-js@5.5.0 \
  axios@0.22.0
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>src/okta/index.js</code> file:</p>

   <code>import OktaSignIn from '@okta/okta-signin-widget'
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js'

const yourOktaUri = '${yourOktaUri}';
const clientId = '${clientId}';

const oktaSignIn = new OktaSignIn({
    baseUrl: yourOktaUri,
    clientId: clientId,
    redirectUri: 'http://localhost:8080/login/callback',
    authParams: {
        pkce: true,
        issuer: `${yourOktaUri}/oauth2/default`,
        display: 'page',
        scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
    }
});

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
    issuer: `${yourOktaUri}/oauth2/default`,
    clientId: clientId,
    redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
    scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
})

export { oktaAuth, oktaSignIn };
</code>   

<p>In the file above, you need to replace the placeholders <code>${...}</code> with the appropriate values. Before you can do this, however, you need to use the CLI to create the OIDC application on the Okta servers, which you will do directly below.</p>

 Create a Single-Page OIDC Application on Okta 

<p>This time you’re going to create a single-page application for the front-end (instead of the web application type you used for the resource server). Enter the following command into a shell.</p>

   <code>okta apps create
</code>   

<p>Press <code>enter</code> to accept the default Application name <code>okta-app</code>. (Application name here refers to the OIDC application created on the Okta servers).</p>

<p>For Type of Application, Select <code>2: Single Page App</code>.</p>

<p>Change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080/login/callback</code>.</p>

<p>Press <code>enter</code> to accept the default Post Logout Redirect.</p>

<p>You should see some output like the following.</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration: 
Issuer:    https://{yourOktaUri}/oauth2/default
Client ID: {clientId}
</code>   

<p>The values in brackets will, of course, be your actual values.</p>

<p>You need to go back to the <code>src/okta/index.js</code> file and replace the <code>yourOktaUri</code> and <code>clientId</code> variables at the top of the file with your values. The value for <code>yourOktaUri</code> is the Okta URI without any further path specifiers. It will look like this: <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com</code></p>

<p>One of the things that the Okta CLI does for you is to add your application’s base URL to the CORS trusted origins for the Okta auth server. This is necessary because the the Okta Sign-In Widget will be making cross-origin requests, that, as noted above, would be blocked unless CORS is properly handled. You can see this by going to your Okta developer dashboard. with Security and API selected from the left-side menu, and Trusted Origins selected from the API tab. You’ll see that (in this case) <code>http://localhost:8080</code> was added as a trusted origin of type <code>CORS Redirect</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can read more about CORS and Okta in the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/enable-cors/overview/">Okta documentation</a>.</p>

 Finish the Vue Front-End Client App 

<p>The next file you need to create is a wrapper for the Okta Sign-In Widget.</p>

<p>Create a <code>src/components/Login.vue</code> file with the following content.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div class="login"&gt;
    &lt;div id="okta-signin-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
import '@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/css/okta-sign-in.min.css'
import {oktaSignIn} from '../okta'

export default {
  name: 'Login',
  mounted: function () {
    this.$nextTick(function () {
      oktaSignIn.showSignInAndRedirect(
          { el: '#okta-signin-container' }
      )
    })
  },
  unmounted () {
    // Remove the widget from the DOM on path change
    oktaSignIn.remove()
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>This file is verbatim from <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/vue/okta_vue_sign-in_widget/#create-a-widget-wrapper">the Okta documentation</a> on using the Okta Sign-In Widget with Vue. The docs are a great resource for more information.</p>

<p>In order for authentication to work, you need to define four routes.</p>

 
   <code>/</code>: A default page to handle basic control of the app. 
   <code>/profile</code>: A protected route to the current user’s profile. 
   <code>/login</code>: Shows the sign-in page. 
   <code>/login/callback</code>: A route to parse tokens after a redirect. 
 

<p>Update <code>src/App.vue</code> to provide the necessary navigation links.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app2"&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;router-link to="/"&gt;
          Home
        &lt;/router-link&gt;
        &lt;router-link to="/login" v-if="!authenticated"&gt;
          Login
        &lt;/router-link&gt;
        &lt;router-link to="/profile" v-if="authenticated" &gt;
          Profile
        &lt;/router-link&gt;
        &lt;a v-if="authenticated" v-on:click="logout()"&gt;
          Logout
        &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;div id="content"&gt;
      &lt;router-view/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  name: 'app',
  data: function () {
    return { authenticated: false }
  },
  async created () {
    await this.isAuthenticated()
    this.$auth.authStateManager.subscribe(this.isAuthenticated)
  },
  watch: {
    // Everytime the route changes, check for auth status
    '$route': 'isAuthenticated'
  },
  methods: {
    async isAuthenticated () {
      this.authenticated = await this.$auth.isAuthenticated()
    },
    async logout () {
      await this.$auth.signOut()
    }
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
nav div a { margin-right: 10px }
#app {
  width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
a {
  text-decoration: underline;
  cursor: pointer;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>   

<p>Create <code>src/components/Home.vue</code> to define a home page.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="home"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Okta Single-Page App Demo&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;div v-if="!this.$root.authenticated"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How much caffeine has your developer had today? &lt;router-link role="button" to="/login"&gt;Log in to find out!&lt;/router-link&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div v-if="this.$root.authenticated"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Welcome, {{claims.name}}!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        {{this.caffeineLevel}}
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;

import axios from 'axios';

export default {
  name: 'home',
  data: function () {
    return {
      claims: '',
      caffeineLevel: ''
    }
  },
  created () { this.setup() },
  methods: {
    async setup () {
      if (this.$root.authenticated) {
        this.claims = await this.$auth.getUser()
        let accessToken = this.$auth.getAccessToken();
        console.log(`Authorization: Bearer ${accessToken}`);
        try {
          let response = await axios.get('http://localhost:8082/howcaffeinatedami',
              { headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + accessToken } } );
          this.caffeineLevel = response.data;
        }
        catch (error) {
          this.caffeineLevel = `${error}`
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>The code above does a couple things worth pointing out. It demonstrates how to check if a user is authenticated, how to get the user object from the <code>$auth</code> object, and how to get the access token so it can be used in a request to a resource server.</p>

<p>Add a <code>Profile</code> component at <code>src/components/Profile.vue</code>. This route will only be visible for users with a valid access token.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="profile"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My User Profile (ID Token Claims)&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Below is the information from your ID token.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Claim&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/thead&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr v-for="(claim, index) in claims" :key="index"&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;{{claim.claim}}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td :id="'claim-' + claim.claim"&gt;{{claim.value}}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  name: 'Profile',
  data () {
    return {
      claims: []
    }
  },
  async created () {
    this.claims = await Object.entries(await this.$auth.getUser()).map(entry =&gt; ({ claim: entry[0], value: entry[1] }))
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>The <code>/login</code> route is the wrapper for the Sign-In Widget and redirects if the user is already logged in. You already created the component for this route above.</p>

<p>The <code>/login/callback</code> route is part of the <code>@okta/okta-vue</code> package. It handles a lot of the mechanics of the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow, as well as manages token parsing, tokens storage, and redirection after authentication.</p>

<p>Next you need to define the Vue router. Replace <code>src/router/index.js</code> with the following. You might notice that this code requires authentication for two routes: the home route and the profile route.</p>

   <code>import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import { LoginCallback, navigationGuard } from '@okta/okta-vue'
import HomeComponent from '@/components/Home'
import LoginComponent from '@/components/Login'
import ProfileComponent from '@/components/Profile'

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/',
      component: HomeComponent,
      meta: {
        requiresAuth: true
      }
    },
    {
      path: '/login',
      component: LoginComponent
    },
    {
      path: '/login/callback',
      component: LoginCallback
    },
    {
      path: '/profile',
      component: ProfileComponent,
      meta: {
        requiresAuth: true
      }
    }
  ]
})

router.beforeEach(navigationGuard)

export default router
</code>   

<p>Replace the code in <code>src/main.js</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router'
import OktaVue from '@okta/okta-vue'
import { oktaAuth } from './okta';

createApp(App)
    .use(router)
    .use(OktaVue, {
        oktaAuth,
        onAuthRequired: () =&gt; {
            router.push('/login')
        },
        onAuthResume: () =&gt; {
            router.push('/login')
        },
    })
    .mount('#app')
</code>   

<p>You can now run the Vue app.</p>

   <code>npm run serve
</code>   

 Test the Completed Server and Client 

<p>Make sure your resource server is still running. Here are the commands in case you need to restart the server (which, of course, need to be run from the Spring Boot project’s root directory).</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Open the app in your browser at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>Because the app is set to secure the home page, you will immediately be directed to the Okta login screen. Log in using your Okta credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When you enter your credentials, the Okta Sign-In Widget and the Vue app will follow the OAuth 2. 0 Authorization Code flow. In this flow, the client sends the login credentials to the Okta auth server and, if authentication is successful, receives an authorization code. The client app calls the Okta token endpoint, trading this authorization code for a JWT (JSON Web Token). The standard OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow requires that the application send the client secret along with the code to the token endpoint.</p>

<p>However, in the context of a client-side application, putting the client secret in public browser code would be a major security violation. Instead, Okta uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). In this modified flow, the client generates a one-time key that is sent with the request and is associated with the authorized JWT. This is used to ensure that only the client that requested the JWT can use it.</p>

<p>There’s a great, in-depth article on the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/08/22/okta-authjs-pkce">PKCE flow</a> by Micah Silverman on the Okta Dev Blog.</p>

<p>Once you’ve logged in you’ll see the simple application screen below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Notice that it has pulled your name and email from your authentication information. It has also made an HTTP request to the Spring Boot REST server using the JWT to determine the caffeine level of your developer (the <code>/howcaffeinatedami</code> endpoint). Don’t worry! Although the image above is reporting your developer’s caffeine level is “not at all,” never fear. I can promise you this is incorrect and simply a random response merely for mildly humorous effect.</p>

<p>You can also go to the <code>profile</code> page at <code>http://localhost:8080/profile</code>, which will show you all of the claims in the authenticated token.</p>

<p></p>

 Learn More About Application Security 

<p>In this post you saw how to use Spring Boot to create a simple resource server and Vue to create a front-end client. You saw how to use Okta to implement a secure application stack. The front-end client used the Okta Sign-In Widget to implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE for a secure token exchange. The resource server was also secured using Okta by including Okta’s Spring Boot Starter, which made adding JWT auth to the project quick and easy.</p>

  <p>The idea of low-code/no-code (LC/NC) application development is for end users to create their own custom applications, perhaps using a graphical design tool, selecting from a library of existing building blocks, or perhaps even with the assistance of artificial intelligence. Alexei Balaganski explains the concepts behind this new development, takes a look at the current market and, finally, highlights the challenges and security issues that may be hidden behind the use of such application development.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/lowcode-nocode-citizen-developer"></a>

 What is interoperability, what needs to be done to achieve it in the SSI world, and what is the way forward? 



 Why can SSI end up like the tower of Babel? 



<p>There is a lot of activity in the SSI community. Different technological camps are coming together and are working on new common protocols and standards. The goal is to establish interoperability and eliminate security and privacy issues that have been identified in the current solutions. This is an extremely positive development. The community is optimistic and sometimes even euphoric.</p>



<p>BUT, SSI is getting more and more attention on the market. Projects are getting bigger and customers are pushing towards productive systems.  That brings the risk that “obsolete” protocols and/or self-developed ad-hoc solutions will be implemented. “SSI” newcomers see an attractive business opportunity and prioritize profit over SSI principles and commonly agreed protocols. This would result in implementations not being interoperable. In the worst case, we end up with implementations that are advertised as SSI but are proprietary and central systems. You could say a kind of “SSI-washing”.</p>



<p>A lot of discussions is about interoperability. But what does it really mean for all the developers like Jolocom? In this logbook entry, I try to structure the term and make it more tangible.</p>



 Different levels of interoperability 



<p>The German Wikipedia entry for interoperability is a good starting point to explain the different levels (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperabilit%C3%A4t">link</a>). Sorry to all non-German speaking readers, but you don’t need to read the Wikipedia entry. The explanation decides between the following levels of interoperability:</p>



  the structural level addresses the exchange of data,  the syntax level  addresses the extraction of the data,  the semantic level addresses the interpretation of the data and   the organizational level is dealing with the processes.  



<p>Our goal is pretty clear. We want that different actors/modules/implementations can communicate and exchange data. Furthermore, it is important that the data can be extracted so that they can be interpreted on a semantic level.</p>



<p>The differentiation between syntax and semantic level can be tricky. The following example is taken from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifable Credential Data Model</a>.  </p>



<p><code>"name": "Jayden Doe",</code></p>



<p>On the syntax level, I only know that the above example is an attribute and it contains a value. But I have no clue what it means. On the semantic level, I know that the attribute presents a name and the name is “Jayden Doe”.</p>



<p>The semantic and the organizational interoperability level are in the influence sphere of the specific use case and are independent for the actual software development process. Because of that we only focus on the structural- and syntax level of interoperability.</p>



 How Interoperability can be achieved? 



<p>How we can achieve interoperability on the structural- and syntax level? We have several options. Simplified, we have the following options:</p>



  We can use the same software,  we can build software on unified standards and protocols or  we develop “Middelware” acting as a translator between different systems.  



<p>To pick the right option we have to take a look at the goals and framework conditions of SSI.</p>



 What are the goals of SSI and which option can be derived from? 



<p>Self Sovereign Identities should be an open public digital infrastructure for all. Therefore, it must be open source and accessible for all. With this requirement a SSI Infrastructure cannot be one software from one supplier. A single software implementation would be a huge barrier, and it would not support innovation and development.</p>



<p>Another important SSI requirement is privacy. A middleware – a translator between systems – would violate privacy goals. If the communication is routed through a middleware for translation, the middleware knows what, when and with whom information is shared, not good.</p>



<p>The only option left is unified standards and protocols. This is the only way to ensure an open ecosystem without violating SSI goals like privacy or face a vendor lock-in.</p>



<p>We all have to work hard on the goal to speak the same language and avoid a Babel-like fate.</p>



<p>Join us at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/schedule/">33. Internet Identity Workshop from 12-14. of October</a>. We will run a session about interoperability and discuss how we can achieve it.</p>

 Wieso kann SSI, wie der Turmbau zu Babel enden? 



<p>Im Moment ist in der SSI community einiges in Bewegung. Verschiedene technologische Lager gehen aufeinander zu und man entwickelt ein gemeinsames Verständnis, definiert neue Protokolle und Standards. Diese sollen und werden Interoperabilität herstellen und Sicherheits- und Datenschutzprobleme, die man erkannt hat, beseitigen. Dies ist eine überaus positive Entwicklung und man spürt die Aufbruchsstimmung und Euphorie.</p>



<p>ABER dadurch, dass SSI immer mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommt, Projekte größer werden und die Entwicklung in Richtung Produktivsysteme geht, steigt auch der Druck. Dies bringt eine große Gefahr mit sich, dass überhastet obsolete Protokolle oder/und eigene ad-hoc Lösungen implementiert werden. Auch “SSI” Neueinsteiger wittern ein attraktives Geschäftsfeld und räumen Profit und Marktanteilen Vorrang gegenüber der SSI Idee ein. Dies würde dazu führen, dass Implementierungen nicht interoperabel sind. Im schlimmsten Fall landen wir bei Implementierungen, die mit SSI beworben werden, aber im Grunde proprietäre und zentrale Systeme sind. Man könnte sagen “SSI-washing”.</p>



<p>Ein Begriff Interoperabilität ist in der SSI Community und in Projekten in aller Munde. Aber was bedeutet Interoperabilität für Softwarehersteller wie Jolocom? In diesem Blogpost versuche ich den Begriff zu strukturieren und greifbar zu machen.</p>



 Ebenen von Interoperabilität 



<p>Der deutsche Eintrag zu Interoperabilität in Wikipedia ist ein guter Startpunkt um die Dinge einzuordnen (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperabilit%C3%A4t">link</a>). Darin wird zwischen struktureller-, syntaktischer-, semantischer- und organisatorischer    Interoperabilität unterschieden. </p>



  Strukturelle Interoperabilität bezieht sich auf den Austausch von Daten,  Syntaktische auf die Extraktion der Daten,  Semantische auf die Interpretation und  Organisatorische bezieht sich auf die Prozesse.   



<p>Das Ziel ist klar, wir wollen, dass verschiedene Komponenten in einem SSI System miteinander kommunizieren und Daten austauschen können. Des Weiteren ist es wichtig, dass sie diese Daten auch extrahiert werden können, damit sie danach semantisch interpretiert werden können. </p>



<p>Die Unterscheidung zwischen Syntax und Semantik kann schwierig sein. Das folgende Beispiel ist ein Auszug aus dem <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifable Credential Data Model</a>.  Anhand diesem erläutere ich den Unterschied. </p>



<p><code>"name": "Jayden Doe",</code></p>



<p>Auf der syntaktischen Ebene, weiß ich nur, dass der erste Begriff <code>"name"</code> ein Attribut ist und der zweite <code>"Jayden Doe"</code>, der Wert. Ich weiß aber nicht was es bedeutet. Auf der semantischen Eben weiß ich, dass das Attribut den Namen darstellt und der Name “Jayden Doe” ist.</p>



<p>Semantische und organisatorische Interoperabilität liegen in der Einflusssphäre des jeweiligen Anwendungsfalls und sind von der eigentlichen Softwareherstellung zum größten Teil unabhängig. Daher ist für die weitere Betrachtung die strukturelle und die syntaktische Interoperabilität von Relevanz.</p>



 Wie kann man Interoperabilität herstellen? 



<p>Wie kann strukturelle und syntaktische Interoperabilität hergestellt werden? Dafür gibt es verschiedene Wege. Man kann, vereinfacht gesagt</p>



  eine einheitliche Software verwenden oder  Protokolle und Standards definieren oder  “Middelware” entwickeln die zwischen den verschiedenen Systemen als  Übersetzer agiert.  



<p>Um die passende Möglichkeiten auszuwählen, muss man sich Ziele und Rahmenbedingungen vor Augen führen.</p>



 Was sind die Ziele von SSI und welcher Weg leitet sich dadurch ab? 



<p>SSI oder dezentrale Identitäten soll eine öffentliche digitale Plattform für alle sein. Es muss open source und für alle zugänglich sein. Mit diesen Zielen fällt die erste Möglichkeit weg. Eine einheitliche Software für alle würde eine sehr starke Beschränkung darstellen. Innovation würde nicht gefördert werden und der Zugang könnte eingeschränkt werden. </p>



<p>Ein wichtiges weiteres Ziel von SSI ist der Datenschutz, eine Middleware (Übersetzer), also die dritte Möglichkeit, würde dieses Ziel gefährden. Wenn die Kommunikation über einen Übersetzer stattfindet, muss dieser alles mithören, sonst kann er nicht übersetzen. Es muss auch nicht auf bestehende SSI Systeme in Produktion Rücksicht genommen werden. Altlasten und viele verschiedene Systeme sind oft Grund für den Einsatz von Middleware.</p>



<p>Was bleibt also Möglichkeit Nummer zwei. Man muss sich auf einheitliche Protokolle und Standards einigen. Nur so kann sichergestellt werden, dass es keine Einschränkung auf einen Hersteller gibt, der Datenschutz sichergestellt ist und alle Implementierung miteinander sprechen können und somit interoperabel sind.</p>



<p>Wir müssen uns alle gemeinsam anstrengen, dass wir bei einer Sprache bleiben und den SSI Turmbau vollenden. </p>



<p>Wenn Interesse besteht, kommt zum <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">33. Internet Indentity Workshop vom 12-14. Oktober</a> (Onlineevent). Wir werden eine Session zum Thema halten, um das Thema in der Community zu diskutieren.</p>

 The Shyft Network Token Distribution and Economics — Part&nbsp;3  The Shyft Network Token Economics after the release of&nbsp;mainnet. <p>Hello everyone, Shyft Network has officially launched! We’ve laid the foundation for an entire network that will solve complex problems like institutional adoption and multi-jurisdictional regulation. As the blockchain ecosystem quickly scales before our eyes, the industry is now starting to feel the effects of present-day regulations. The need for a solution, like Shyft Network, has never been more&nbsp;urgent.</p><p>The work is not over as we prepare for the next steps, i.e., continuous protocol improvement, community and ecosystem development, and other incredible products on our pipeline. We decided to publish this post to clarify our token distribution and liquidity schedules now that the mainnet is&nbsp;live.</p> Overview  Inflation <p>In the original Token Economics blog post, we explained that the Network Inflation rate was set at 6% of the Initial Token Universe, i.e., 2,520,000,000 tokens, distributed gradually over several years. The Network Inflation rate is composed of three main elements:</p><p>A. Shyft Runtime Inflation DAO’s — 2%: Perpetual Community Funding and Ongoing Ecosystem Wide Resource Maintenance.</p><p>B. Strong Federation — 2%: Inflation per block is generated to pay for the cost of security; all network transactions fees are eliminated through&nbsp;EIP1559.</p><p>C. Byfrost — 2%: Inflation routed to openly pay for the cost of public bridge nodes for asset-weighted Proof of&nbsp;Stake.</p><p>The launch of the mainnet slightly modified the distribution schedule by delaying the Strong Federation component for, roughly, 3.5 months. This component will also be optimized right after the next mainnet hard-fork as the network introduces improvements like EIP1559 (similar to what Ethereum is going through in the next few&nbsp;weeks).</p><p>Another component of token inflation that changed is the Byfrost Bridge staking, which isn’t currently accumulating and will not count towards circulating supply until Byfrost launches later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>The Runtime Inflation DAO component IS accumulating, and we are working on building the DAO structure, governance components and deployment schedule for this to become available as soon as possible.</p><p>Please note also that we reduced the Advisor allocation by 1.28%, from 5.68% to&nbsp;4.4%.</p> Distribution of the Initial Token&nbsp;Universe <p>Note: The Economic Metagame represents 20% of the Initial Token Universe. It’s a deflationary incentive mechanism.</p><p>As users participate in the Wrap Rewards context, there will be a deflationary reduction in the total universe corresponding to the proportion of total assets (E.g. USDT erc20 token) within the Wrap Rewards contract. 20% of the total initial universe is available to be burned over the first 2 years (if lower, will move to further&nbsp;years).</p><p>The Initial Token Universe can be divided into four main categories to show their nature and destination.</p> DAO-Related Assets <p>DAO Related assets represent all buckets destined for community DAOs and other AMM structures to incentivize the growth and development of our community and our network. These funds are not immediately available to the Shyft Network core team or the Shyft Node Federation.</p> Partner and Purchaser Distributions <p>These allocations represent all SHFT tokens that have been sold, distributed, or granted to early token purchasers, strategic and technical partners, advisors, and early supporters of the&nbsp;project.</p> Treasury-Related Assets <p>These buckets represent SHFT tokens that are currently or will be available to the Shyft Network for the ecosystem, business, and partnership development, subject to distribution locks and schedules.</p> Inflationary Mechanics <p>As discussed in our original Token Economics blog post, the Shyft Network has an inflationary component meant to incentivize the creation and continuity of the Node Federation, allowing for the creation of future DAOs for community expansion.</p> Wrapping up <p>For the purposes of calculating circulating supply, the starting date of distribution schedules is March 26,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>You can find our Shyft Network block explorer here: <a href="https://bx.shyft.network/">Shyft POA&nbsp;Explorer</a></p><p>For updated information on Shyft Network’s token supply, please check out <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shyft-network/">Shyft Network, SHFT live marketcap, chart, and info | CoinMarketCap</a>.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

 Our emerging operating logic and how it&nbsp;feels <p>This piece was authored by a member of the Dark Matter Labs team based in the UK as part of the #BeyondtheRules project and, as such, is written in British English and may have particular references to contexts in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>This blog was written in September 2021 and reflects our learning at that&nbsp;time.</p> Our Context <p>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs works to accelerate societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and interconnectedness. We focus on the dark matter — the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the world around us, from policy and regulation to finance and data, governance and democratic participation, organisational culture and identity. What we seek to build in the wider world we look to create at a smaller scale in how we organise together.</p><p>Our context as an organisation, and from which the learning that we share here is anchored, is largely defined by&nbsp;being:</p>  A platform for shared&nbsp;missions  Focused on discovery and&nbsp;learning  International with a planetary view  Primarily virtual  Evolving constantly  <p>In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">blog 1</a> in this series, we have explored the plural platform for shared missions that drive our work and we looked at some of the foundations that we have built to work with international plurality. In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dml-2-4-ef87a1e466c">blog 2</a>, we explored how we compound learning and build legibility in the system to improve our efficacy and how we navigate. In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-3-4-73faf8b283e7?source=collection_home---2------0-----------------------">blog 3</a>, we discussed our system of democratic agency and the foundation of care that underpins it. These elements form a foundation for the mission that we work on together, and manifest the meta shifts in mental models and organising logic that we wish to see in the world at the micro-level.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll look at how these various factors come together into an operating ‘logic’, and what it feels like to work like this, as told by people from the Dark Matter Labs team. We’ll then share more about how we structure this organising/operating at DM and how it manifests.</p> Operating Logic <p>The image above seeks to visualise how the core parts of our operating model work together. It also highlights our thinking and practice around where we believe we need consensus in our work and where we need a deep divergence of thought. Namely, that our very broad shared intentions (at the level of the meta-mission) and our mutual obligations to each other are where consensus feels needed. Whilst in the actual what and how of what we create requires many different perspectives and visions for deep learning, creativity and efficacy to be possible. This broad and open consensus of purpose alongside a deep plurality of means and approaches — sat on a platform not of control of each other, but of elevation and ennoblement of each of us — forms the foundation of our&nbsp;work.</p><p>In the coming months, we hope to codify some of our mutual obligations and expectations on how we make and evolve decisions and rules together through a DM constitution that will underpin our work (this is not yet in&nbsp;place).</p> What does this feel&nbsp;like? <p>In this blog series, we’ve tried to share what we are experimenting with at DML around how we organise and what we’ve been learning as we go. We are stumbling, learning and gradually improving still with so much to discover. In this section, we wanted to share what this way of working feels like, straight from the mouths of the team. One week ago an invitation was sent to the whole team inviting them to answer this one question, as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>Preface:</blockquote><blockquote>“As part of writing the next beyond the rules blog we are hoping to give people an idea not only of what how we organise at DM looks like, but what it feels&nbsp;like.</blockquote><blockquote>We would simply love to hear anything you have to share on this to help ground this blog in our reality and make it more&nbsp;human.</blockquote><blockquote>If you have a spare 5 mins please take the time to share thoughts on what working at DM feels like for you it would be hugely appreciated (everything welcome, it’s not a propaganda platform) Everything will be anonymous.”</blockquote><blockquote>Question:</blockquote><blockquote>‘How does it feel — your experience of how we organise at DM? (Answer this any way you&nbsp;like)”</blockquote><p>These were all of the 21 (around 40% of the team) responses in&nbsp;full:</p>What how we organise at DM feels like, as shared by the&nbsp;team<p>The variety of experiences that people have, often at the same time, is one of the aspects that stands out: ‘coherence and incoherence’; ‘liberating and paralysing’; ‘uncomfortable, exhilarating an enriching’; ‘stressful and liberating’. Working like this can feel like many things for people, but rarely does it feel easy or&nbsp;static.</p> Stewarding how we&nbsp;organise <p>As our work and system has grown in scale and complexity, how we organise has required increasing nuance and intention.</p><p>An increasingly growing group of people who have worked on this approach to organising (what we call ‘the dark matter of dark matter’&nbsp;;) ) has made this evolution possible. They have asked questions, identified needs, spotted patterns, built experiments, gathered feedback, designed deeply and introduced and iterated new processes, mechanisms, structures and spaces with care. It is indeed because of the distributed agency in our system that this has been possible, and here we seek to share more on how we steward&nbsp;this.</p><p>We were inspired by the incredible team at <a href="https://civicsquare.cc/">Civic Square</a>, and their ‘block party’ in collaboration with <a href="https://wearesnook.com/">Snook</a>, to map out on&nbsp;<a href="https://kumu.io/">Kumu</a>:</p>  What we might see as ‘pillars’ of how we organise (which will evolve as our understanding of these develops).  The various areas/domains of work that make up these pillars, and their connections to each&nbsp;other.  The people who are working on each area, with domain holders versus domain supporters clarified by the direction of the&nbsp;arrows.  <p>Together these elements give us a dynamic map of our organising system that is easily editable and navigable and can quickly be iterated as the system and our understanding of it&nbsp;evolves.</p>A Kumu map showing DML operating pillars of work, their domains and the people who hold and support&nbsp;them<p>We can zoom into this map to make visible different elements. For example, the domains of work that contribute towards a pillar, such as ‘Compounding Learning’.</p>A section from the Kumu map showing the Compounding Learning pillar and its supporting domains of&nbsp;work<p>Or how domains connect to each other and who works on it. For example, our formal governance domain (for want of a better term — meaning our company articles &amp; legal documents, their membership &amp; voting structures, the company boards and directors and the agreements between the various companies) and how we approach that is deeply linked to our legal and financial architecture, roles and responsibilities, shared spaces and culture and our financial sense-making. There are many people involved in making this ‘formal governance’ possible.</p>A section of the Kumu map showing the Formal Governance domain, who works on it and how it links to other domains of&nbsp;work<p>The people who make up this team and the time they dedicate to it is regularly in flux. It includes:</p>  A core team of 7 (moving towards 9) from across our varied geographies with currently around 5.5FTE of capacity, who mainly also work in some other projects of DM but spend most of their time on our operations and how we&nbsp;organise  A couple of team members who spend around 1.5days/week each in how we organise, whilst being heavily focused on our strategic pipeline, partners and direction of work, bringing this insight into our operations  4–6 team members who work primarily on projects in different geographies but spend a small amount of time (up to 1/2 day/week) on supporting how we organise, either because of specialist skills and/or geographical insight  Various team members who have an interest in particular areas of work and contribute from time to&nbsp;time  All team input every now and again (e.g. new approaches to pay or agreeing a DM constitution)  <p>Generally, we spend around 10–15% of our total team capacity on our operations/organising (it fluctuates, but we notice that investing below 10% means that we get behind, and closer to 15% allows us to keep better on top of needs). About 40% this time is towards maintaining necessary day to day operating systems (such as recruitment, contracts, bookkeeping, payroll, company legal requirements etc) and about 60% in investing in our broader organising philosophy and improved ways of&nbsp;working.</p><p>This group does not perform a central function of control for Dark Matter Labs, and it is not a team that sees itself as in service of the ‘actual work’. To reference<a href="https://twitter.com/ImmyKaur/status/1441021905587343360?s=20"> this beautifully worded comment</a> by Immy Kaur, this part of our work is a site of responsibility and craft in being “the beating heart, core function, soil from which everything flows”.</p><p>As such, the Finance Holder does not tell the team what they can or can’t spend; rather, they help to make sense of our financial information; share insights in a variety of ways; and steward our financial agreements so that people across the system can make independent and informed financial choices. Similarly, the People Holder does not make the hiring decisions; rather, they build insight, research and deep knowledge about beautiful hiring processes; and support teams to hire in a way that is caring for applicants and effective in its&nbsp;outcome.</p> Thank you <p>Thank you for reading, we hope that this blog series provides some insight into what we have been learning at Dark Matter Laboratories in how we’ve been organising. We have only been able to cover some of the factors involved, and haven’t even touched up the work of hiring, onboarding, people policy, offboarding, governance and so much more. We intend to continue sharing what we learn and thank those who we have learned from, built upon and been inspired by along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>This blog is part of a 4-part series on how we organise and govern at Dark Matter Labs, with other blogs&nbsp;here:</p>  <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">Organising beyond the rules #1 of 4: an international platform for&nbsp;mission</a>  <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dml-2-4-ef87a1e466c">Organising beyond the rules #2 of 4: compounding learning and constructing legibility</a>  <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-3-4-73faf8b283e7">Organising beyond the rules #3 of 4: Distributed Agency, Distributed Care</a>  <p>We are so very grateful for the support that we have had from our fellow co-creators in the ecosystem throughout these years at Dark Matter Labs, such as Architecture 00, Civic Square, Radicle, Vinnova, McConnell Foundation, Lankelly Chase, ThirtyPercy, MIS Maison de l’innovation sociale, NatureScot, Climate-KIC, Google Ventures, One Project, The National Lottery Community Fund, UNDP, Morgan Stanley Sustainable Solutions Collaborative and many&nbsp;others.</p><p>Much of what we have piloted in the last year has been supported by our learning through the #BeyondtheRules project, alongside our partners <a href="https://lankellychase.org.uk/">Lankelly Chase</a>, <a href="http://blackthrive.org/">Black Thrive</a>, <a href="https://www.yorkmcn.org/">York MCN Network</a> and <a href="https://www.demsoc.org/">The Democratic Society</a>.

        <p>Bachelor thesis by Vemund Holte Igesund &amp; Fredrik Sebastian Rognstad – Molde University College</p>
<p>Our bachelor thesis sheds light on the problem consumers have when buying fish products. At the time of purchase, consumers have little to no information about the products, and have no choice but to trust all the players in the product’s supply chain. After reading through articles and studies, it turns out that there are a high number of seafood scammers. One solution we have found is for players to use better traceability systems. The requirement for tracking today is a “one up, one down” system. Every actor in a supply chain only needs to know who they are buying the product from, and who they are selling it to, one step up and one step down.</p>
<p>The aim of our case study has been to find out what we as consumers had to do to get the history of three selected fish products from different grocery stores and a fish product from a restaurant. We tried to trace all the products back to the fisherman / breeder and map the supply chains. After trying to track fish products ourselves, we conclude that the “one up, one down” model is not good enough. We also conclude that the traceability systems actually implemented today are not transparent enough for consumers. We have found a possible solution to the problem that will have the opportunity to make the supply chain of fish products more transparent to consumers. It is a traceability system that uses blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The reason why we have chosen blockchain as a possible solution to the problem comes from three of the characteristics of blockchain: immutable, transparent and decentralized. In the work on our task, we were much in dialogue with the company UNISOT, which has recently developed a traceability system that uses blockchain technology for tracking fish products. In the conclusion, we discuss, among other things, what our case study would have looked like if the fish products from Experiments A to D had been integrated into a traceability system such as UNISOT has developed.</p>

<p>During <a href="mailto:https://www.idnow.io/blog/ensure-player-friendly-id-verification/">the EURO 2020 tournament</a>, our ID verification platform picked up a higher number of fraudulent activities across several clients. In the investigation, our fraud agents found patterns of what could be organized crime attacking specific organizations such as ‘Money Mules’.</p>
<p>By leveraging both machine learning and AI solutions as part of our IDnow platform as well as fraud specialists, fraudulent processed ID’s and activities could be successfully identified, and countermeasures initiated.</p>
<p>Incidents like big sports tournaments where the numbers of ‘Money Mules’ drastically spike are where our IDnow QM Manager such as Philomena and Michał come into play. In our interview today we will get to the bottom of ‘Money Mules’ and discuss recruiting tactics and patterns of fraudsters as well as overall consequences for detected ‘Money Mules’.</p>
  
 Philomena, Michał, let us start with the question of what your responsibilities are at IDnow as a QM Manager? 
<p>Philomena: Our team covers two essential parts to ensure that the quality expectations are met for both customers and users. Firstly, we ensure that our agents are aware and follow the high verification standards, which we have to fulfil from a regulatory point of view. Also, we want to ensure that our users have a pleasant experience going through the verification process.</p>
<p>Michał: The second part is to ensure that fraud attempts are prevented. We feel responsible for assisting our users and customers to not fall for fraud patterns.</p>
<p>Therefore, we analyse detected fraud cases, inform agents what to watch out for, and proactively reach out to our customers when we suspect patterns to find a solution immediately, such as when “Money Mules” are active.</p>
 ‘Money Mules’ is a term that often appears in the financial crime world, but also generally in the business world. Probably everyone has a rough idea about it, but in your experience within the identity industry, how would you define ‘Money Mules’? 
<p>Michał: A ‘Money Mule’ is a person who voluntarily provides their data, motivated by the desire to make easy money as criminals offer fast cash for participation in the fraud procedure. They are often fully aware of breaking the law. But there is no proof that they are fully conscious of all the consequences.</p>
<p>The overall process of “Money Mules” looks like that they either open a bank account themselves, and thereafter give an access and total control to criminals. Alternatively, the fraudsters open the accounts with their data. Both ways enable later to perform various financial embezzlement, e.g., money laundering, modern slavery or terrorist finance.</p>
<p>Philomena: It is also very important to differentiate between ‘Money Mule’ and ‘Social Engineering’ scenarios. ‘Money Mules’ are participating in the fraud scenarios, cooperating as part of the criminal schemes.</p>
<p>In a social engineering scenario, a person is considered a victim of a scam. Their collaboration with the fraudster is not as apparent as they get involved through psychological manipulation. These victims are usually unaware that their actions are breaking the law. They are being tricked into opening accounts, for example, through job advertisements.</p>
 Can you give us an example of a Money Mule case that you encountered? What was your learning? 
<p>Philomena: We recently detected a ‘Money Mule’ pattern originating from the Philippines. At first glance, it looked like an organised criminal activity where users were intentionally cooperating with the fraudsters. By coincidence, we had this rare opportunity to correspond with some people taking part in the scam. After analysing the situation and with the cooperation of the individuals involved, we concluded with high confidence that the users were, in fact, victims of a ‘social engineering’ attack.</p>
<p>Each of the victims was forced to take a loan and got tricked by a shady credit advertisement posted on Facebook. These users were entirely unaware that their actions may bring any penalties to them. We have learned that each case can have a “hidden agenda” that is usually not visible to fraud analysts.</p>
 What are the motives of those involved? 
<p>Michał: Again, we have to distinguish. With what we identify as ‘Money Mules’, we assume a criminal background and an eagerness to make easy money.</p>
<p>Poverty plays a huge role as well, as it can lead to criminal activities. If individuals are desperate or hopeless, they may feel they have no other choice.</p>
 How are ‘Money Mules’ recruited? 
<p>Philomena: Quite often, ‘Money Mules’ are recruited through social media channels. Even if these posts are discovered and taken down by regulatory authorities, it is easy for criminals to re-post scam advertisements. We regularly reach out to hosts (website providers) and make them aware of who is using their services.</p>
<p>Michał: We also see a combination of data leaks and fraudsters. Victims are contacted by a scammer via WhatsApp and get trapped in a social engineering scenario. The approached person might not actively look for any source of income/cooperation but when they receive a random message from an unknown person, somehow it opens an unexpected opportunity to them.</p>
<p>Philomena: From our experience we can, unfortunately, say that&nbsp;it is typically shady trading and investment companies that are constantly looking for victims who would like to taste a “businessman” life.</p>
 What are the consequences for ‘Money Mules’ who have been identified? 
<p>Philomena: Firstly, often all their bank accounts (both accounts with fraudulent and non-fraudulent purposes) get closed or the money is frozen. After getting caught doing these criminal activities, individuals also find it difficult to get credit for things like phone contracts, student loans, and applying for credit in the future. Furthermore, it is also not uncommon to be condemned – individuals can be imprisoned for up to 14 years.</p>
<p>Such activity leaves a mark on the person’s criminal record which brings other consequences – it may also make it challenging to find a job, especially if it is one involving data protection. It is important to highlight this, especially as nowadays, almost every position has something to do with data protection, for example, payments.</p>
 Now that we discussed the subject of ‘Money Mules’, let’s drill further into the phenomenon of ‘Social Engineering’. You already mentioned it, but could you repeat to us, how is this different to ‘Money Mules’? 
<p>Michał: Internally we differentiate them as follows, nevertheless most institutions do not separate between ‘Money Mules’ and ‘Social Engineering’.</p>
<p>Victims of social engineering are not aware that their actions may have legal consequences. The scammer uses psychological manipulation to lure an innocent person into the trap. Usually, they are strongly convinced that they are working as an app tester or a financial clerk.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the tasks given to the victims are designed and described in a way not to draw victims attention. The criminal often provides a fancy job contract, which looks like the actual work arrangement at first glance. Other examples involve applying for a loan. The users are then convinced that the credit can be only issued under specific conditions, which usually contains opening an account with a financial institution and later passing the credentials to the fraudsters.</p>
<p>As a result, the criminal gains access to the freshly created bank account, which may result in further financial malversations in the victim’s name. The scammer will therefore remain undetected, and the whole liability will be passed to the unaware person.</p>
<p>In the case of ‘Money Mules’, the person is willingly cooperating with the criminal. In most scenarios, they are involved in money laundry processes as well and can gain credits for fulfilling different tasks.</p>
 How do victims get involved with ‘Social Engineering’? 
<p>Philomena: Usually, victims fall easily for fake jobs and loan advertisements on social media. In addition, most persons involved in ‘Social Engineering” are very eager to invest their money and are okay with working with a trading company which doesn’t’ necessarily have a good reputation. This is another version of the “boiler room”: The victim receives an “excellent investment offer” that they cannot reject.</p>
<p>Michał: More recently, we came across the so-called ‘Corona Fraud”. Users received a message stating that due to the corona regulation, they are required to register their profile on the specific portal. Naturally, the person then follows these instructions and provides all sensitive data and most likely identify himself/herself for a financial service.</p>
<p>The ‘Corona Fraud’ also occurs on Dating apps when a newly contacted person out of the sudden needs financial help. Also, there is what we call the ‘Inheritance Fraud’. To receive a very attractive sum of money, the victim must open a bank account and perform few money transfers or even provide the scammer with the credentials.</p>
 What are the consequences for the victims? 
<p>Philomena:&nbsp;&nbsp;Fraudsters usually take over the victims’ account and sell the details online, rather on the dark web. Furthermore, usually at this point the victim appears as an easily accessible person (since their data was misused) and attracts other fraudsters. In the following, the victim’s documents/identity are often used for further manipulation and money laundry.</p>
<p>Michał:&nbsp;As for the legal side, there are no legal penalties for being a victim of social engineering. However, the person involved in the fraud might be prevented from leaving their country until the case has been solved. There is also the risk of the person getting a criminal record if the case is not handled correctly and the victim may have to take full liability for the financial losses. It can be a highly time-consuming process to accomplish all the bureaucracy formalities before being actually “free.” Ultimately, the victim might also end with a huge debt and bad credit with credit card institutions.</p>
 Final question: What is – so to speak – the breeding ground for criminal activities such as ‘Money Mules’ or ‘Social Engineering’? What can users on the internet, but also companies, do to put a stop to this? 
<p>Michał:&nbsp;The fundamental problem is that the fraudsters often exploit the victims’ human vulnerabilities. This involves, for example, the financial hardship or interpersonal relationships (for example love relationships) of the victims. The fraudsters often know very well what their victims desire and act accordingly. The scammers work with the victims’ fears and weaknesses.</p>
<p>In situations of need, many people are often more susceptible, so the scammers have an easy target. Also, fake websites, for example, are becoming better and harder for an untrained eye to spot.</p>
<p>Philomena:&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would also like to refer you to the information provided by <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/public-awareness-and-prevention-guides/money-muling">Europol</a>, which summarizes very effective preventive measures. To put it in my own words, Europol recommends the following actions to users on the Internet:</p>
 
 Never give your bank account or any other personal details to anyone unless you know and trust them. 
 Secure your bank cards. Do not disclose your online banking login details, PIN, CVV number, etc. 
 Be very cautious of unsolicited emails or offers made over social media or in person, promising easy money. 
 Ignore any job offer involving money transfers through your bank account, regardless of how authentic they may seem. If an opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 
 If you have received emails of this type, do not respond to them, and do not click on any links they contain. Inform the police instead. 
 Stay alert for job ads and social media posts that promise easy money. Always report the account to the platform provider in order to be taken down and prevent other people from falling for the scam. 
 If you happen to receive an offer in person, decline it and report it to the police. 
 If you suspect that you are caught up in a ‘Money Mule’ or money laundering scheme, stop transferring money immediately, notify your bank or payment provider, and report it to your national police. You could help prevent other people from becoming money mules and even help catch the criminals. 
 
<p>Michał: I’d like to stress the fact that IDnow takes criminal activity / fraud very seriously and this is the reason why we have a dedicated team who is constantly working to prevent these types of frauds. As a trusted partner with very strong security standards, IDnow is constantly working to prevent fraudsters to enter our business customers systems, and of course for IDnow it is also very important to help individuals from being scammed, so our work is ultimately also protecting our end users from it.</p>
<p>Many thanks Philomena and Michał for the insights.</p>

<p>The recent EU announcement about having a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital wallet</a> for all its citizens has given fresh impetus to the world of decentralization and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>&nbsp;(SSI).</p><p>In this context, we caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-doerk/?originalSubdomain=de">Adrian Doerk</a> (popularly known as the <a href="https://ssi-ambassador.medium.com/">SSI Ambassador</a>), the Product Manager and Marketing Lead of Lissi, and the Communication and Public Relations Head at IDunion. This multifaceted personality who owns many hats, talks about the future of SSI, with a focus on the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>Here are some excerpts from this interview.</p> Is SSI going to be big in the coming years? If yes,&nbsp;why? <p>There is a big need for solutions to enable trusted interactions, especially when it comes to identification and authentication. It all stems from the fact that the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-a-bridge-between-the-past-and-the-future-c99668c1e2f0">Internet</a> was never designed for identities of individuals in the first place. Though we have standards and protocols for transactions, these are not constructed to enable the average user control of his or her digital identity without depending on a single third&nbsp;party.</p><p>Even with the existing standards and technologies, there are limits. This is most evident from the countless cyberattacks that happen so&nbsp;often.</p><p>Hence, there is a need for trusted interactions. In particular institutions, the government, and public stakeholders believe these trusted interactions are crucial for a functioning society.</p><p>At the heart of it all is an innate need to safely identify and authenticate oneself in the online world. As of now, this need has not been&nbsp;met.</p><p>SSI can fulfill these requirements as it supports the safe and trusted issuance and presentation of credentials among different entities, and this is why <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/impact-of-self-sovereign-identity-in-real-estate-11456c4b1faa">SSI</a> can be big in the coming&nbsp;years.</p> Are we ready as a society to embrace SSI, in terms of the necessary technologies and infrastructure? <p>Yes and&nbsp;no!</p><p>We’re ready in terms of baseline infrastructure, but when it comes to the nitty-gritty non-technical details such as liabilities and governance, we still have a long way to&nbsp;go.</p><p>As far as the technical infrastructure goes, yes we are right on track to move forward. Though there are some technical aspects that we need to address for <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> to become more widespread.</p> Europe is one of the frontrunners in the SSI space, especially after the digital wallet announcement. How will it impact life in&nbsp;Europe? <p>It will take some time for this regulation to come into effect and we will know more about the specifications for the identity wallet in the next few months or so. Undoubtedly, it is ambitious and can have a far-reaching impact.</p> What will be the accelerator(s) for&nbsp;SSI? <p>It needs to be a combination of government legislation, ecosystem, and startups in the SSI space. All these stakeholders are key for the acceleration of the ecosystem.</p><p>You obviously need the government’s support as nothing moves without it. Community is also very important for sharing <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/solving-the-principal-agent-problem-proxy-issuance-with-verifiable-credentials-c8f97ee9ee9b">problems</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use-cases</a> and eventually, using them to create an ecosystem.</p><p>So, all the stakeholders must come together to serve the community backed by the government’s support in terms of funding and legislation.</p> If you have to pick one accelerator, what would be right at the top of your&nbsp;list? <p>The ecosystem.</p> What, according to you, is the best way to store and manage verifiable credentials? <p>Storing verifiable credentials on the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/do-you-need-blockchain-for-enabling-ssi-452d62b34890">blockchain</a> is a terrible idea, so I hope nobody even thinks of&nbsp;it!</p><p>A <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">wallet</a> provides a user interface and helps users to manage keys and use them for interacting with other parties. Currently, wallets work well on mobile devices, which means data is stored locally on smartphones.</p><p>But at some point, we need to move to desktop devices and browsers, and this would necessitate developers and companies to start thinking about where the data should be stored. Again, this would be a wallet-specific implementation that would depend to a large extent on the use-case and the expectations and actions of&nbsp;users.</p><p>For example, a tech-savvy user might want to decide whether he/she wants to store the data on the mobile device or on any other device owned by the user. However, it can also be stored in encrypted storage on the&nbsp;cloud.</p><p>On the other hand, some users might not care so much about where it is stored as long as they can share it in a safe and secure way. Such users may opt for a wallet service, which is fine too because not everyone is tech-savvy enough to choose their place of storage and ensure a high availability of a local&nbsp;backup.</p><p>In all, we need different solutions for different people to store and manage <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>.</p> As a startup in Europe, what are some things that you’d do in the next two&nbsp;years? <p>It depends on the product and the current state of the company. I would help companies and partners to understand what we are building, so they can offer it to their end customers in such a way that it benefits them greatly. At the same time, every stakeholder must understand what the technology is about and why they should use&nbsp;it.</p><p>This is easier said than done because <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">SSI</a> is a complex technology. So, my focus would be on helping companies to create SSI-based solutions and do everything they can to disseminate information about this technology in a way that everyone can understand.</p> This leads to the next question — What would you do to Create Awareness on&nbsp;SSI? <p>A good way is to use content to explain complex technologies with concepts people are familiar with. In particular, this approach can help people who are new to this industry to get a hang of SSI and the principles and components that drive&nbsp;it.</p> With all these coming together, what changes do you anticipate in the next 3–5&nbsp;years? <p>To be honest, not a whole lot. I don’t foresee a huge societal shift and definitely nothing as impactful as say, the introduction of smartphones.</p><p>What will change is that there will be a greater need to control identities and manage them, and this should make it easy for organizations to offer the concept of SSI to the general&nbsp;public.</p><p>With a growing availability of use cases from different verticals we will see an increased usage of it in the daily life of average people. However, while the public might like the new way of interacting with third parties on the internet a lot of people probably rather say: “That was long overdue” instead of “This will change everything”.</p><p>We signed off on this&nbsp;note!</p><p>We hope that was an interesting read for you and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a> for many such interesting insights.

<p>This week brings two big updates:</p>  One for everyone — the Holochain Launcher  One for developers — a scheduler in Holochain v0.0.108   Holochain Launcher preview: user-friendly hApps <p>I hinted at the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a> in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-v0-0-107-a-release-to-build-on/#holochain-v0-0-107-changelog">last</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-camp-8-starts-in-two-weeks/#dev-camp-8-huge-turnout-exciting-curriculum">two</a> Dev Pulses, but didn’t go deep into it. So what is it?</p><p>Simply: the Launcher finally makes it easy for non-developers to install and use hApps. On their own devices. Without a computer science degree. Now, all you need to do is <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases">download an installer</a> for your OS (Windows, macOS, and Linux are all supported), and it’ll install the Holochain conductor and a basic but user-friendly admin UI. Once you’ve got the Launcher installed, running a new hApp should be as simple as downloading a package and installing it in the Launcher.</p><p>This means that, as a developer, there’s a way to get your hApps into your users’ hands without much fuss. That’s pretty big news! It’s still very new, not yet production-ready, so the devs are asking for feedback — you can report an issue on <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/issues">GitHub</a> or directly from the Launcher’s menu.</p><p>The Dev Camp participants are beginning to battle-test the Launcher, which has already resulted in a few bug fixes and improvements.</p><p>For an alternative approach, I’ve shared before that the folks at Sprillow have created tools that let you embed Holochain into a <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/embedded-holochain-runner">Rust</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain">Electron</a> application. These tools are being used in the desktop version of their <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn">Acorn goal-planning app</a>.</p> Try a peer-to-peer application now!   Find a few friends to test the app with.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases">Download the Launcher</a>.  Install the Launcher.  Download a web hApp, either <a href="https://github.com/eyss/elemental-chess/releases/tag/v0.1.1">Elemental Chess</a> or <a href="https://github.com/holochain/elemental-chat-ui/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha37">Elemental Chat</a> (look for the <code>.webhapp</code> file in the downloads section).  Open the launcher and look for the big blue ‘Install new app’ button.  Select the web hApp you just downloaded.  A dialog will pop up. Leave the app ID field unchanged, leave the membrane proof field blank, and choose a word or a string of random characters for the UID field. You and your friends should all enter the same UID — this ‘<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/#dna">clones</a>’ the hApp’s DNAs, giving your group its own private DHT.  After clicking the ‘Install app’ button, you should see your new hApp listed in the main admin window. Click the ‘Open’ button and the hApp’s UI will open in your web browser!   Make your hApp compatible with the Launcher <p>If you’re a hApp developer, it’s pretty simple to build a Launcher-ready hApp. It consists of a hApp (a collection of DNA files) and an archive of static web assets that you bundle together with the <code>hc</code> dev tool. The Launcher has an internal web server listening on localhost that serves those static web assets to your user’s browser. Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher#packaging-a-web-happ">readme</a> for full instructions.</p> Holochain v0.0.108 introduces a scheduler <p>Sometimes a hApp will want to do something in the background without user interaction. You can always do this behind the scenes in your UI’s code, but what if the UI is closed and this background task is important to how the hApp works?</p><p>The most recent Holochain release brings a host function called <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.108/hdk/time/fn.schedule.html"><code>schedule</code></a>. I’ve written a page on the community wiki that <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-scheduler-in-your-zome">explains how it works</a>; check it out if you need something like this in your hApp.</p> Holochain In Action: Introducing the Launcher <p>This week’s Holochain In Action session gives a demo of the Holochain Launcher with two hApps: Elemental Chat and Elemental Chess. It also gets into Holochain networking, particularly what the bootstrap and proxy services are for, and finishes with some of the technologies the Launcher was built with.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@spacex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">SpaceX</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/rocket-launch?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Back in June, XRPL Labs<a href="https://twitter.com/XRPLLabs/status/1410301187765723139"> integrated its XUMM Wallet with GlobaliD’s self-sovereign identity platform</a> as part of an ongoing initiative to improve XRP Ledger account trustworthiness.</p><p>With GlobaliD, XUMM wallet users are able to link their GlobaliD public profile and have their government IDs attested in order to verify their XRPL accounts. GlobaliD users can now also acquire attestations for their XRPL accounts.</p><p>It’s a pretty big deal. <a href="https://xrpl-labs.com/">XRPL Labs</a> is a startup based in the Netherlands and Estonia focused on developing software for the XRP Ledger that counts <a href="https://ripple.com/">Ripple</a> as an investor. Their <a href="https://xumm.app/">XUMM Wallet</a> offering is the leading noncustodial wallet for accessing the XRP ecosystem with over 200,000 active users and a vibrant developer ecosystem.</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPLLabs/status/1410301192702410757">How to verify your XUMM Wallet with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <p>A noncustodial wallet is a type of crypto wallet where users have personal custody of their assets. Think of it as having cash in your wallet. The money is yours and you have total control over it when it comes to receiving cash or making payments.</p><p>Contrast that to a custodial wallet that you might have with a service such as Coinbase or Uphold. This is more analogous to a bank account, where the service provider has custody over your assets. You can still receive and make payments as you’d like, but now you’re relying on a central operator to hold onto and make available your assets when necessary.</p><p>These platforms are convenient for users as they can rely on the trust and security of the service provider. Companies like Coinbase and Uphold have stringent KYC/AML (Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering) processes to comply with relevant regulations and to ensure safety for their&nbsp;users.</p><p>With a noncustodial wallet, the onus of trust and security falls on the user. As we like to say at GlobaliD, your sovereign digital identity is a right — but it’s also a responsibility.</p><p>It’s also why GlobaliD’s partnership with XRPL Labs makes so much sense. By integrating GlobaliD, XUMM Wallet users are able to link their digital identity to their wallet, enhancing trust across the ecosystem. By verifying their digital identities, users can know whether or not they’re dealing with the right&nbsp;person.</p><p>That choice, of course, is also up to each individual user as this is an entirely opt-in feature. Users who have completed their ID attestation receive a blue checkmark next to their name, signaling to others that they’ve completed the process. Aside from their name, profile photo, and checkmark, no other information is made&nbsp;public.</p><p>Users who wish to maintain full privacy while still enhancing trust are able to have their ID attested without sharing their name or photo and still get ablue checkmark.</p><p>Whenever it comes to trust, there are always trade offs with privacy and anonymity. With GlobaliD’s self-sovereign framework, you essentially get the best of both worlds. You maintain ownership and control over your identity and your data. And only you decide what you’d like to share. Neither GlobaliD nor XRPL Labs has access to your personal information.</p><p>Thus far, 1463 users have acquired blue checkmarks by linking their GlobaliD identity to their XUMM Wallet, and according to XRPL Labs founder Wietse Wind, the feedback has been resoundingly positive:</p><blockquote>“On the XRP Ledger, accounts (non-custodial wallets) are much like an online identity. While they can be anonymous, many use cases, businesses and other users benefit when users can demonstrate that their blockchain accounts (accounts on the XRP Ledger) can be&nbsp;trusted.</blockquote><blockquote>We’re seeing a clear shift in the XRP Ledger ecosystem among end users — a preference for a more personal user experience, increased trust when sending tokens, and vigilance when it comes to accepting issued tokens versus a completely anonymous situation.</blockquote><blockquote>An integration between GlobaliD and XUMM has been requested and suggested by end users in the past. Now, the integration is live — and with compliance and privacy becoming increasingly important topics for the entire ecosystem, we invite all XUMM users to get their “blue checkmark” for their XRP Ledger account by leveraging the GlobaliD + XUMM integration.”</blockquote><p>More than trust, it’s also about fun. (Or rather, maybe we tend to have more fun when we can trust each other.) One new feature is a public Tip Bot. By integrating GlobaliD, users are able to know who they’re tipping as well as to see who’s tipping them if everyone is opted&nbsp;in.</p><p>All of this, however, is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more exciting updates from GlobaliD x XRPL&nbsp;Labs!</p><p>Want to learn more?

<p>CoinPost: HotCity is one of the Ardor blockchain use cases in which a gamification-based reward model has been implemented and tested to address environmental issues and achieve sustainability. The aim is to crowdsource data of industrial and commercial waste heat in urban planning as potential renewable energy sources. In order for citizens to participate voluntarily and enjoyably, digital points, issued as tokens on the Ignis child chain, are distributed as rewards for providing that information, that can be redeem as vouchers for goods and services by partner companies.</p>

 Sessions and OAuth 2.0 Applications 
 
 
<p>An application that uses an OAuth 2.0 redirect, an <a href="https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/">"Authorization Code Grant"</a>, typically uses a server-side session to temporarily store the state of the login process until it completes. Let’s look at a simplified OAuth login flow:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
<p>A user requests to log in - either by clicking on a login button or automatically when they request a protected page.</p>
 
 
<p>Web App stores information about the current session - OAuth state info and optionally a PKCE code verifier and/or a nonce for OpenId Connect (OIDC).</p>
 
 
<p>The response is a browser redirect to the authorization server.</p>
 
 
<p>User interacts with the authorization server to provide credentials and confirm consent.</p>
 
 
<p>Authorization server issues redirect with a code back to the web app.</p>
 
 
<p>User authorization is finalized on the backend.</p>
 
 
<p>The web app reads the previously stored OAuth data from the session.</p>
 
 
<p>Verification that the user has been authorized with the authorization server.</p>
 
 
<p>Auth Server response with an OAuth access token.</p>
 
 
<p>Web app stores access token in session.</p>
 
 
<p>User is logged in.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Two separate requests are made to the web application: the initial login request and a verification step. Both requests access the same session information. For your application, this means once you start scaling, you need to think about session management.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Stateless with JWTs 
 
 
<p>At this point, you might wonder if you can cram everything in a JWT (JSON Web Token) and make this process stateless; removing the need for any session clustering. You could, but you would need to use a JWE (JSON Web Encryption) to ensure the browser didn’t have access to any sensitive data. There are a whole host of reasons <a>not to use JWTs as session tokens</a>, but those issues are outside the scope of this post.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Load Balancer Sticky Sessions 
 
 
<p>Another option to avoid session replication or clustering is to use "sticky sessions" (or "session affinity"), but this creates a fragile environment. If a web server fails or is taken down for any reason, all users associated with that server would essentially be logged out. Sticky sessions also violate the <a href="https://12factor.net/processes">12-factor principles of process statelessness</a>.</p>
 
 






Don’t confuse 12 Factor’s reference to "process statelessness" with what’s meant by "stateless" in the previous section. There we refer specifically to the need for an application relay on the "state" of a server between requests, for example data cached in memory or a file. Instead, a <a href="https://12factor.net/backing-services">backing service</a> should be used. In the case of session storage, the example of Redis is used, which is exactly what we’re going to do in the next section.



 
 
 
 
 Setup HAproxy and Redis 
 
 
<p>To build a load-balanced application, we need a minimum of three things—a load balancer (HAproxy), shared session storage (Redis), and multiple instances of a web application (Spring Boot).</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to skip right to the code, take a look at this <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-sessions-example">GitHub</a> repo.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new directory for this project:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkdir oauth-sessions
cd oauth-sessions</code> 
 
 
 
 Configure HAproxy 
 
<p>HAproxy is used to distribute requests between multiple <code>backend</code> applications and create a configuration file, <code>haproxy.cfg</code>, that will serve two different web apps (one on port <code>8081</code>, and another on <code>8082</code>).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>global
    daemon
    maxconn 2000

    # send request logs to stdout, to make debugging easier
    log stdout format raw local0

defaults
    mode http
    log global
    option httplog
    timeout connect 5000ms
    timeout client 50000ms
    timeout server 50000ms

frontend http-in
    bind *:8080
    default_backend webapps

backend webapps
    balance roundrobin

    # `host.docker.internal` refers to host that is running Docker Desktop
    # On Linux add `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` to `docker run` to
    # mimic the functionality
    server webapp1 host.docker.internal:8081
    server webapp2 host.docker.internal:8082</code> 
 
 
 






Make sure there is a trailing newline, or you may have trouble starting up HAproxy.



 
 
 
 Start HAproxy and Redis with Docker 
 
<p>I’ll be running the example web application directly on my laptop, but HAproxy and Redis can both run as Docker containers. Create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>version: '3.8'
services:

  haproxy:
    image: docker.io/haproxy:2.4-alpine
    volumes:
      - ./haproxy/haproxy.cfg:/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    extra_hosts:
      # Docker Desktop uses `host.docker.internal` for the host,
      # mimic this for linux installs, requires Docker 20.10+
      - host.docker.internal:host-gateway
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

  redis:
    # Starts Redis without persistence
    image: docker.io/redis:6.2.5-alpine
    ports:
      - 6379:6379</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Start both HAproxy and Redis by running:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker compose up</code> 
 
 
 






You can stop the process by pressing Ctrl+C or running the <code>docker compose down</code> command from the same directory.



 
 
 
 
 
 Build a Secure Spring Boot Application 
 
 
<p>Now that the system dependencies are out of the way, let’s move on to building a Spring Boot application.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new Spring Boot application by visiting <a href="https://start.spring.io">start.spring.io</a> and selecting the Web and Okta dependencies or by running the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>https start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
  bootVersion==2.5.4 \
  dependencies==web,okta \
  groupId==com.example \
  artifactId==webapp \
  name=="Web Application" \
  description=="Demo Web Application" \
  packageName==com.example \
  javaVersion==11 \
| tar -xzvf -</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To give a visual indication of which server handled the request, create a REST controller that displays the server port in <code>src/main/java/com/example/Endpoints.java</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class Endpoints {

    @GetMapping("/")
    String serverInfo(@Value("${server.port}") int port) {
        return "Hello, your server port is: " + port;
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 Start the Spring Boot Application 
 
<p>In the previous section, HAproxy was bound to port <code>8080</code>, which is also the default port for Spring Boot. Start the application on port <code>8081</code> using:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>SERVER_PORT=8081 ./mvnw spring-boot:run</code> 
 
 
 
<p>At this point, the Spring Boot application has NOT been configured to use Redis or OAuth, but you can still test out the server by grabbing the auto-generated password from the console output. It will look something like this:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Using generated security password: 4302a714-580b-4d01-91d9-5d9597ee1bb5</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Copy the password and make a request to the Spring Boot application:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8081/ --auth user:&lt;your-password&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You will see a response containing the server port:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Hello, your server port is: 8081</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Great, this means that the Spring Boot application is up and running! Now make sure you can access the server through the load balancer on port <code>8080</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/ --auth user:&lt;your-password&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should see the same response; if you see a <code>503 Service Unavailable</code>, try the request one more time.</p>
 
 






The HAproxy configuration used in this post does NOT have health checks enabled, so it will alternate requests between port <code>8081</code> and <code>8082</code>; this is intentional to simplify the configuration. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html">Spring Actuator</a> if you want to add health checks and other monitoring to your application.



 
 
<p>Stop the Spring Boot server using <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>C</code>. It’s time to secure the application with OAuth 2.0.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Secure Spring Boot with OAuth 2.0 
 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>
 
 
<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter.
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to:
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>Now that the application has been configured to use OAuth 2.0, start two different instances (open two different terminal windows):</p>
 
 
 
 <code>SERVER_PORT=8081 ./mvnw spring-boot:run</code> 
 
 
 
<p>And the second one on port <code>8082</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>SERVER_PORT=8082 ./mvnw spring-boot:run</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Accessing the applications through the load balancer will yield odd results; open a private/incognito window to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and try to log in. You will be redirected to Okta where you can type in your account credentials. However, after pressing the Sign In, you will see an error page:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Think back to the sequence diagram at the beginning of this post, and see if you can spot the problem. The initial login request (step one) happened on one instance, and the final one occurred on another (step six). Updating the application to use shared session storage will fix the problem.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s do that!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Share Sessions with Redis 
 
 
<p>If you are following along, you already have a Redis server running; now we’ll configure the Spring Boot application to make use of it. Luckily, <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-session">Spring Session</a> makes the process painless.</p>
 
 
<p>Open up the <code>pom.xml</code> and add the following inside the <code>&lt;dependencies&gt;</code> block:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-data-redis&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.session&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-session-data-redis&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 






By default, Spring Session configures Redis to connect to <code>localhost</code> on port <code>6379</code> and NO password. Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/current/reference/html5/guides/boot-redis.html#boot-redis-configuration">Spring Session documentation</a> for various configuration options.



 
 
<p>Restart the Spring Boot applications. (Remember there’s one on port <code>8081</code> and another on <code>8082</code>).</p>
 
 
<p>Open up your browser again and try to access <code>http://localhost:8080/</code>; this time, you will be able to log in without issue!</p>
 
 
<p>Refresh the browser a few times and you will see the response alternating between the ports:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Hello, your server port is: 8081</code> 
 
 
 
<p>And:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Hello, your server port is: 8082</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Easy enough, just a couple of dependencies to configure shared session storage! If Redis isn’t your jam, Spring Session also supports <a>databases</a>, <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-session-hazelcast">Hazelcast</a>, <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-session-data-mongodb">MongoDB</a>, and <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-session-data-geode">Apache Geode</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn More OAuth 2.0 and Session Management 
 
 
<p>This post shows how to manage sessions for a simple load-balanced application that uses OAuth 2.0. Our example focused on the Spring Boot portion of the application, but it’s far from production-ready. A few other concerns would need to be addressed first:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>A single HAproxy and Redis instance are single points of failure</p>
 
 
<p>Redis data is not persisted</p>
 
 
<p>Redis connections are not secured</p>
 
 
<p>TLS should be enabled for <a href="https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy-ssl-termination/">HAproxy</a> and the <a>Spring Boot application</a></p>

   Even though passwords can be compromised easily and are generally considered unsafe, they are still ubiquitous in a time when multi-factor authentication and biometrics are easily available. There’s little doubt that eliminating passwords improves security, but to effect fundamental change you must start with the customer experience and ask yourself where it’s possible to take it.

 Musicians Get Bypassed, Again <p>Universal Music, the largest of the three big music labels, went public last week. The valuation was something on the order of $53 billion, and this is another chapter of the story where profits from artists get paid out to corporations and shareholders rather than the creators themselves.</p><p>This IPO is about the past, though, not about the future. The vast majority of the music managed by the large labels is legacy catalogs now. And the majority of new music is not going into this old system. Still, the legacy catalogs continue to generate incredible revenue and profit for the labels, not necessarily the artists or even the publishers because of the way deals were negotiated for streaming. A few years back the <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2015/05/22/fk-it-heres-the-entire-spotifysony-music-contract/">contract</a> between <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/19/8621581/sony-music-spotify-contract">Spotify and Sony was made public</a>, and it demonstrated that, despite all the laws in place to protect publishers and artists, agreements can be written to bolster the profits of labels instead. By specifically avoiding the language of royalties and instead paying as much as $42 million over three years in ‘advances’, they sidestepped the need to actually pay the artists.</p> How Musicians Make a Living, Today <p>But if you talk to many artists these days, they will tell you that the way they make a living is no longer based simply on selling their music. Some offer it up for free. Many do have it on the streaming services and receive some payment for it. But many artists have found their bread and butter to be performing and giving fans intimate access to their creative processes. This new form of engagement or interaction was first seen in some of the centralised platforms for musicians. Starting as far back as MySpace and then Bandcamp and other services, artists began having more direct interaction with their fans online. This took a leap with interactive live streams during the lockdowns when in person events were essentially cancelled making earning a living excruciatingly difficult for performers.</p> The Challenges of Music 3.0 <p>There’s been an uptick in music projects on blockchain. While it’s exciting to see new energy in the music tech space that is currently not reliant on the legacy music labels, these solutions have inherent limitations if the focus is streaming, because music consumption typically isn’t limited to just the new stuff - a generalised streaming service that cannot offer the catalogs of the label giants is going to have a steep hill to climb in terms of user experience.</p><p>Further, blockchain has inherent limitations and costs. Even with newer sidechain solutions and faster transaction speeds, it just isn’t suitable for the sort of interactive community apps that are needed. Add in the wasted processing and the effects to the environment and it seems like merely a transitional step on the exciting path to tomorrow. So some of the blockchain startups who are not focused on streaming legacy catalogs, like Songcamp or Catalog, may find a friend in Holochain where they can more easily and cost-effectively achieve their goals.</p> John Lennon’s Imagine, Take Two <p>What could be the vision for music in the future? If today’s reality for musicians and performers is that it’s less about music streaming or unit sales and more about fan and listener interaction -- what if that were to snowball? If the mojo between artists and fans today is driven by intimacy and decentralization, the tech that supports their relationship should support that, rather than be at odds with it.</p><p>And what’s beyond that? If the tech enabled intimacy and decentralization, could the relationships become richer and more generative? Could fans become co-creators, remixing artists’ music, boosting the popularity (and revenue) of the original artists while gaining some recognition of their own?</p><p>Imagine platforms where the hosting power required for all of the music sharing and the community interaction is contributed by the community itself. That means essentially zero cost data storage. The more the network grows, the healthier the platform gets. Holochain is peer-to-peer, collaborative-first technology that can support real-time, user-friendly applications — applications that connect artists directly to their supporters.</p><p>Imagine platforms where every artist is recognized and fairly rewarded for their work whether it is streamed or remixed. Suddenly, ‘borrowed riffs’ are tolerated and even encouraged because everyone gets detailed attribution and compensation (when desired) without any middlemen. Holochain provides the cryptographic accountability trails necessary to support this sort of creative explosion.</p><p>Imagine a future of music that belongs not to labels and distributors, but to a thriving network of music creators and lovers. Holochain is where the future of distributed music tech can thrive.</p><p>Holochain is ready now for developers and creator cooperatives to start designing and building.</p><p>Ready to find out more? Then <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">check out the DevCamp</a>, in progress now, where over 1500 people have signed up to learn how to design and build Holochain apps. If you are not a developer, we have alternatives and opportunities for you to engage as well.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@anthonydelanoix?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Anthony DELANOIX</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>The world will move towards decentralized identity if we make it easy for them to do so—and easy means, above all, fast. The solution is machine readable governance—a smart way of implementing rules for how to manage trust.</p>

<p>While digital experiences are rapidly becoming the norm for mortgage lending, the verification process has largely remained a manual, paper-driven process. Fortunately, this is changing.</p>
<p>Finicity, a Mastercard company, is the only authorized report supplier that offers a digital, single-vendor solution for assets, income, and employment authorized for representation and warranty relief through both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. By automating the asset and income verification process, providing transaction data for rent payment history and providing a 10-day pre-closing report, we can help you streamline the approval process and in turn even be a more inclusive lender.</p>
 Approved by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae&nbsp; 
<p>Finicity is an authorized supplier for <a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/tools-learning/loan-advisor/our-solutions/aim-asset-income-modeler">Freddie Mac’s Loan Product Advisor® AIM</a>, which automates borrower assets, income, and employment assessment for lenders. By leveraging the expertise of third-party service providers, AIM helps to deliver a simpler, more efficient loan origination process.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae’s Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) validation service also accepts our <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/desktop-underwriter-validation-service/du-validation-service-verification-report-vendors">mortgage verification services</a> to independently validate borrower assets, income, and employment data—providing<a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty"> Day 1 Certainty®</a> on validated loan components. By digitally validating secure third-party data through DU, you can help eliminate the paper chase and help get your borrowers approved quicker.</p>
 Rent payment history in credit decisioning 
<p>On September 18, Fannie Mae introduced the inclusion of rent payments in their automated mortgage credit decisioning process in DU. Fannie Mae identifies recurring rent payments in bank statements and transaction data as a factor which could deliver a more <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/perspectives/helping-renters-unlock-door-homeownership">inclusive credit assessment</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For first-time homebuyers who may have a limited credit history but a strong rent payment history, the enhancement creates new opportunities for homeownership while still promoting safe lending. Fannie Mae <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/fannie-mae-introduces-new-underwriting-innovation-help-more-renters-become-homeowners">said 17% of applicants</a> who have not owned a home in the last three years and who did not receive a favorable mortgage recommendation could have instead received an “approved” or “eligible” recommendation if their rental payment history had been considered.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the rent payment history feature, Finicity provides a <a href="https://docs.finicity.com/finicity-lend-reports/#finicity-lend-report-list-7">Verification of Asset and Income (VOAI) report</a> through its Mortgage Verification Service (MVS) that includes up to 24 months of transaction data that Fannie Mae can use to identify rent payment history and provide a more favorable credit assessment.</p>
<p>The VOAI report can be called with a direct API or is available currently in <a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/">ICE Encompass and Encompass Consumer Connect,</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.simplenexus.com/">SimpleNexus</a> mortgage point-of-sale (POS) platform.&nbsp;</p>
 10-day pre-closing verification 
<p>Additionally, Finicity’s 10-day pre-closing reports provide just the right data GSEs need for 10-day verification of employment.</p>
<p>In adding a 10-day pre-closing report to our mortgage verification services, we have enabled lenders to receive only the data GSEs require for the 10-day verification. You can use these<a href="https://docs.finicity.com/refresh-reports-2/"> 10-day pre-closing reports</a> to view just your borrower’s employment status rather than refreshing our current full reports that contain financial data. This minimizes the introduction of new income data or other redundant and unnecessary underwriting changes.</p>
<p>One of the reports available is the VOE Transactions report, which contains 120 days of refreshed transactions with dates and description but no amounts or totals so that income is not re-assessed. It shows the latest direct deposits in the income streams so that it can be determined that the borrower is still being paid on their regular cadence.</p>
<p>Another option is the VOE Payroll report. This contains only employment status—no income or other data—so lenders can see that the individual is still employed according to their payroll provider.</p>
<p>Our 10-day pre-closing reports are part of MVS at no extra charge and are currently only available for lenders connecting directly to Finicity.</p>
<p>These new reports could help you improve accuracy and simplify the process of verifying employment within ten days of closing, which is simplifying the loan origination process even further without increasing risk. Because these products are part of Finicity MVS, you would no longer have to call your borrower’s employers to get the information or manually ask for any extra interaction from the borrower.</p>
 How can you access these 10-day pre-closing reports? 
<p>To pull the VOE reports today, your team will need to code directly to the endpoints. You can find<a href="https://docs.finicity.com/refresh-reports-2/"> documentation here</a>. As we integrate them further into LOS and POS platforms, they will be even easier for consumer loan officers to access.&nbsp;To see Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Services in action,<a href="https://www.finicity.com/demo/"> request a demo here</a>.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Modern businesses depend on digital information. For quite a few years already, it’s been considered the world’s most valuable commodity, worth more than oil, gold, or even printer ink. Some of the world’s largest companies have turned data into their primary source of income, generating billions in profits every year, but for the rest of us, there is always data that is critical for our business’s success or even basic survival. Information such as intellectual property, customer data, or financial records is rightfully called “crown jewels.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as opposed to gold that you can just put into a safe, data only generates value when it’s being actively used - accessed, transformed, visualized, or exchanged with partners – otherwise it only amounts to deadweight with recurring storage costs. Even worse, unless access to the data is properly regulated and secured, it can potentially lead to a data breach and a hefty compliance fine. In other words, it is usually not the data itself, but the underlying data management platform that unlocks the true value of your crown jewels – that is, a database.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing, almost religious debate about the kind of database most suitable for working with different types of data. Should it be a single universal system for handling all your data or should you rather use a combination of specialized engines optimized for, say, financial transactions vs. analytics, full-text search, or time-series data management. Personally, I believe that from the business perspective this dichotomy is completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>For a customer, the ideal database is the one that is essentially invisible, providing all the necessary functions without any overhead of managing the underlying hardware and software infrastructure. The closest thing to this ideal we can get today is a managed database in a cloud platform; these DBaaS solutions are very popular with customers since they come with a promise of fully elastic scalability, high performance, and extremely low maintenance. Since such services are usually based on popular open-source engines improved and managed by cloud service providers, the initial learning curve is also very low.</p>
<p>In reality, however, many companies working with databases in the cloud will eventually face multiple reality checks. First of all, not all data can be moved to the cloud at all, so it becomes necessary to maintain separate database technology stacks in hybrid environments. Secondly, open-source databases running on commodity hardware often do not scale as well as promised, leading to performance issues and other bottlenecks. Finally, when data is sprawled across multiple disparate data sources, running analytics across them becomes increasingly difficult without bringing in yet another specialized database just for this purpose (to say nothing about moving data between databases and the security and compliance implications of such designs).</p>
<p>Does it mean that every company with a cloud-first strategy will face these challenges? Not at all, as many are perfectly happy with their highly distributed and loosely coupled applications. Unfortunately, not all business use cases can be so easily adapted for modern architectures like microservices, and even those that can, will eventually feel the burden of consolidating their data for analytical purposes. Perhaps, at that moment, all they’ll be dreaming about would be an alternate universe where they’ve decided to keep all their data in a single unified database.</p>
<p>Do such solutions even exist today? Yes, and one notable example is <a href="https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exadata/">Oracle Exadata</a>, which is a combination of a hardware platform optimized for OLTP and OLAP Oracle Database workloads and the database management software to run on it. Introduced back in 2008 as a high-performance platform to run Oracle Database on-premises, since 2015 it also powers the company’s cloud services. Exadata offers identical capabilities on-prem, in the Oracle public cloud, and as the Exadata Cloud@Customer private database cloud service in customers’ data centers. It is also the foundation of one of the company’s flagship database products – the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/for-oracle-the-future-is-autonomous">Oracle Autonomous Database</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the company <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-introduces-next-generation-exadata-x9m-platforms-2021-09-28/">introduced a new generation of the platform, Exadata X9M</a>. From the hardware perspective, it is based on a shared Persistent Memory architecture and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) that powers massive improvements in IOPS and latency compared to commodity hardware. Exadata Cloud@Customer X9M allows organizations to have Oracle manage the private database cloud infrastructure deployed in their data center with a single-rack system providing up to 992 vCPUs, more than 11 TB of memory, and intelligent storage servers with up to 576 CPU cores for SQL processing, 18 TB of Intel Optane persistent memory (PMem), and 769 TB of usable storage capacity. This provides unprecedented performance for OLTP workloads, with up to 22.4M read IOPS and ultra-low I/O latency of less than 19 microseconds - up to 87% better performance at the same price, effectively lowering the cost of running databases by nearly 50%.</p>
<p>Running the Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer X9M in customer datacenters or on Exadata in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure enables fully elastic scaling of database compute consumption and supports the full range of automated maintenance capabilities (patching, backup, performance tuning, etc.) regardless of whether it is deployed on-prem or in the cloud. New Operator Access Control capabilities on Exadata Cloud@Customer ensure that all access to customer databases is highly regulated and based on strict principles of Privileged Access Management so even Oracle cloud operators can’t access the data or make unapproved changes to the system. Most crucially, however, all customer data always resides in the same single database, accessible for any kind of transactional,&nbsp; analytical, or document workload, and is always encrypted to ensure its security and compliance posture.</p>
<p>With this news, Oracle has clearly elevated the customer expectations for a database cloud service and is on a trajectory of demonstrable rapid innovation. Simply put, other database cloud services, based on separate code bases and engines, don’t come close to matching the capabilities of Oracle Autonomous Database on the Exadata platform.</p>
<p>Still, for quite a few companies, especially those focusing on open-source and cloud-native development, this approach towards data management might look controversial at the first glance. What about the freedom from vendor lock-in? Isn’t Oracle software always very expensive? To answer these questions, one has to consider the numerous benefits of Oracle’s approach: an architecture, where all data and multiple types of workloads reside in a single, strongly secured data platform without the need to ever migrate them to a different one (and remember, migrating between on-prem and the cloud is completely transparent since both run the same database software and on the same Exadata infrastructure).</p>
<p>Combined with the promise of up to 50x performance improvement compared to Oracle’s competitors, the resulting total costs of running critical business applications on Oracle often turns out to be even lower than relying on random tools and multiple cloud databases, when you include the time and money needed to move data among them. Also, let’s not forget that Oracle Database can run virtually anywhere you want—on a Dell server, in AWS, on an Exadata—it’s the customer’s choice. The same cannot be said about “cloud-native” database services like AWS Aurora and Redshift—they can only be run in the public cloud, as not even AWS Outposts supports them on-premises.</p>
<p>Customers who run their Oracle Databases on Exadata simply attain net incremental capabilities that don’t exist anywhere else. In this regard, one should carefully consider what “vendor lock-in” even means nowadays and which option gives customers more freedom. In the end, only you can decide what kind of setting your crown jewels are worth. Just keep your mind open to all available alternatives and focus on business results, not philosophical arguments.</p>

<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Rinki some questions about her upcoming presentation.</p>
  
 How do you see the role of a CISO today and in the future? 
<p>The role of the CISO has transformed, right? When I started my career, the word CISO didn't really exist outside of banking. I started my career in a utility company. There was no CISO there. In fact, one of the companies I went to work for in tech very early in my career, they had hired the first non-bank CISO. And I remember when I started the CISO role was just starting to come to bear, and folks were just starting to learn what a CISO did. And now it's every company, it's almost mandate that you have to have a security leader in place. And the security leader has taken various forms. And depending on company to company that you go to, the CISO is not like a CFO or a Chief Legal Officer with very defined structure in how those functions usually perform, how they report, how they are organized. The CISO is still kind of varying, and it's still being defined, in company to company, in some companies it's a very business risk compliance function and others, it's more of a technical function that's developing architectures for different products, in others, it's just a compliance function. It just depends, but the amazing part is that the CISO role is almost at every company that you look at now, and even start-ups are thinking very early about bringing a CISO in early on.</p>
<p>And, now more than ever, I think you're starting to see the development of risk committees in addition to audit committees and board meetings at companies. CISOs are not just presenting at the board. They might be presenting at the audit committee, at the risk committee, and the CISO role now you see more CISOs serving on boards as well. The value of a Chief Information Security Officer has just grown tremendously. And I think in the future, we'll see, hopefully more and more non-tech boards have CISOs on them and the CISOs just having a very powerful role in a company, helping enable the business strategy, which is already starting to happen. But I think we're going to see, just a complete elevation of this role.</p>
 In your experience, what are the most difficult challenges for organisations to transform their existing culture into a security culture? 
<p>I think the toughest part around security culture is it's all about how do you win the hearts and minds, right? You can develop security standards all day. You can build tools all day. But who cares if nobody cares, if there's a way to bypass it and folks don't really take to heart why this is important, then you're really losing the essence of security and winning the hearts and minds, I think is a very, very, very hard job. You have to understand how a person works. That person might be in the development org., they might be in the engineering org., or they might be in the legal org. or the marketing org., and you have to think about what they care about, how they work and then really bring the right data to them to say, this is why this is important and figuring out in the context of your company, how do you build that culture?</p>
<p>And it varies from company to company. I remember at a very engineering heavy culture that I worked in, we had to bring proof of how we could attack the app that they had built to make them really believe that they had to understand security in a more meaningful way and when they saw their own app, that they had developed, being attacked like that, I think that's what won their hearts and minds to say “Oh, wow, okay. That now I really do understand why this is important”. And bringing data to the discussion, I think always helps in transforming security culture. And that data varies depending on what team it is that you're trying to influence. I would say one thing I also learned is that information security has been something that organically grows in the company and you kind of see where it starts really small and it’s a grassroots effort and then it starts kind of growing.</p>
<p>Although that can be effective, it's a lot slower than having top-down championship. And what I mean by that is having your executive team at the highest levels, championing security, winning their hearts and minds first and making them your biggest champions and allies and driving the security culture. And if you have that at the top, I think it makes it a lot easier and you can run security then a lot faster and companies who do that well, I think they see their business runs faster because security becomes an enabler. And you don't see as many incidents and having to go and firefight later on.</p>
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your FireSide Chat: “Transforming Security Culture”? 
<p>Yeah. I'm looking forward to doing the fireside chat. And I think some of the things that I hope to share are some of the things we talked about today at a deeper level, but I think there's a lot more to it, right? When you're transforming a security culture, it also matters that your information security team, how you've built that, who you've brought on board - that their mindset itself is in a good place as well. And I think, in this past year, we've gone through a lot, past year and a half. Gosh, it will almost be two years with COVID, right. We've gone through a lot.</p>
<p>You know, we've seen not only just because of the pandemic, but there's a lot of world events and things that affect mental health and so forth, which makes people prone to more mistakes. I think sharing some of my personal stories on what I went through during that time, and how, coming to a company in a hundred percent high remote environment, having to build trust in a remote environment like that, and then having to build security culture was extremely challenging. But here I am one year into the role and we've made major progress. And I think, in the fireside chat, I'm really excited to get deeper into those stories and, share with all of you, my learnings.</p>

 Avoiding shipwrecks and the identity challenges ahead&nbsp; 





 




With more and more digital adoption we are connecting our physical and digital worlds, the opportunity for convenience is increasing, yet the likelihood of privacy is decreasing. How do we balance these trade-offs? Will the companies that find this balance foster greater loyalty alongside the need for enterprises to adapt, the distributed world is becoming more and more mainstream?




 




Can we challenge ourselves to find the middle road, where we create great customer experiences that are also Privacy and Security by Design?

 GiD Report#179 — Crypto crackdowns continue, but Twitter doubles&nbsp;down <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-178-the-wsjs-fb-investigation-and-gary-gensler-s-senate-testimony-36a7aec242c7">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The global crypto crackdown continues  What people are&nbsp;saying  Chart of the week (China bans&nbsp;crypto)  Twitter doubles down on&nbsp;Bitcoin  Chart of the week (DeFi&nbsp;rising)  Stuff happens   1. The global crypto crackdown continues <p>First, China continues turning up the heat on its crypto ban. According to Coindesk:</p><blockquote>Authorities in China’s Inner Mongolia province <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/27/inner-mongolia-seizes-10100-mining-rigs-from-government-tech-park/">seized 10,100 crypto mining rigs</a> from a government-operated tech park, according to local media. This comes days after top government officials renewed a crackdown on crypto trading and mining. Separately, Huobi Global announced Sunday it would <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/26/huobi-to-gradually-expel-its-china-users-in-wake-of-ban-token-slides-to-8-month-low/">stop serving existing users in China</a> by the end of the&nbsp;year.</blockquote><p>In response to increasing regulatory pressure, crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/24/ftx-moves-headquarters-from-hong-kong-to-bahamas-report/">FTX moved its HQ from Hong Kong to the&nbsp;Bahamas</a>.</p><p>We’re feeling the heat here in the U.S. as well. The Biden administration is set to appoint a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-22/biden-to-tap-crypto-big-bank-critic-to-run-wall-street-watchdog">crypto</a> (and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/23/business/saule-omarova-comptroller-currency.html">Big Bank</a>) critic to run the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. (Contrast this to crypto-friendly Brian Brooks, who ran the same office under&nbsp;Trump.)</p><p>The Biden administration is also going after crypto payments in its fight against ransomware. Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/us/politics/treasury-department-combating-ransomware-cryptocurrency.html">the NYTimes</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="http://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a>):</p><blockquote>The Biden administration took action on Tuesday to crack down on the growing problem of ransomware attacks, expanding its use of sanctions to cut off digital payment systems that have allowed such criminal activity to flourish and threaten national security.</blockquote><blockquote>The Treasury Department said it was imposing sanctions on a virtual currency exchange called Suex, in the administration’s most pointed response to a scourge that has disrupted U.S. fuel and meat supplies this year, when foreign hackers locked down corporate computer systems and demanded large sums of money to free&nbsp;them.</blockquote><p>Three states are also going after Celsius, saying that the crypto lender violates securities law. Here’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/17/3-states-alabama-securities-commission-also-claims-celsius-violated-securities-laws/">Coindesk</a>:</p><blockquote>In an order dated Sept. 16, the state regulator said it believes Celsius violated state laws through its “Earn Rewards” program. Texas and New Jersey state regulators announced similar findings on Friday, with New Jersey filing a cease-and-desist and Texas announcing it would hold a hearing in February to determine if a cease-and-desist should be&nbsp;ordered.</blockquote><blockquote>Celsius has 28 days to respond to the Alabama regulator and show cause why the regulator should not impose a cease-and-desist order. If the company does not respond, the regulator will assume Celsius is waiving its right to a hearing and immediately move to impose sanctions.</blockquote><p>And the big news, of course, is that Coinbase has canceled the launch of its new lending program following the SEC’s threat to sue. Here’s <a href="https://blockworks.co/coinbase-cancels-plans-to-launch-lending-program/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Blockworks</a>:</p><blockquote>The company said in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/sign-up-to-earn-4-apy-on-usd-coin-with-coinbase-cdad79e5f5eb">a blog post</a> on Friday that it was making “the difficult decision” not to launch the initiative, which would have allowed eligible customers to earn interest on select assets on Coinbase, starting with 4% annual percentage yield, or APY, on USD Coin (USDC). Coinbase has also discontinued the waitlist for this&nbsp;program.</blockquote><blockquote>“We had hundreds of thousands of customers from across the country sign up and we want to thank you all for your interest,” the Sept. 17 Coinbase blog states. “We will not stop looking for ways to bring innovative, trusted programs and products to our customers.”</blockquote><p>With crypto hovering at around $2 trillion in value as mainstream adoption expands, this was always going to be the new normal. This next chapter will be figuring out how to build necessary bridges between the crypto world and the regulated mainstream reality.</p> Relevant:   Via <a href="http://global.id/rcb">/rcb </a>— <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/us/politics/treasury-department-combating-ransomware-cryptocurrency.html">The Biden administration is combating ransomware with a crackdown on cryptocurrency payments.</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/j">/j</a> — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/china-deems-all-crypto-related-transactions-illegal-in-crackdown">China Widens Ban on Crypto Transactions; Bitcoin&nbsp;Tumbles</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/business/dealbook/stablecoin-crypto-regulation.html">Here Come the Crypto&nbsp;Rules</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/coinbase-cancels-plans-to-launch-lending-program/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Coinbase Cancels Plans to Launch Lending Program — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/17/3-states-alabama-securities-commission-also-claims-celsius-violated-securities-laws/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=NODE%20SEPT%2020%202021&amp;utm_term=The%20Node">3 States: Alabama Securities Commission Also Clawims Celsius Violated Securities Laws</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-declares-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrency-transactions-illegal-11632479288?mod=djem10point">China Declares Cryptocurrency Transactions Illegal; Bitcoin Price&nbsp;Falls</a>   2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Here’s Kraken’s legal chief <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/fantasy-to-not-expect-regulation-crypto-exchange-lawyer-says">Marco Santori speaking speaking with last&nbsp;week</a>:</p><blockquote>“You’re just living in a fantasy world if you don’t believe that this industry is going to face heavier, more Wall Street-like regulation from governments in the U.S. and abroad, and Kraken has simply been practical about that future,” Santori said on Bloomberg’s “QuickTake Stock” broadcast Thursday.</blockquote><blockquote>“I’ve certainly followed Brian’s tweets, and I’ll say that look, you’re just not being honest with yourself about the crypto community if a little bit of you doesn’t think he’s saying what a lot of people are thinking,” Santori said. “I can’t support that kind of approach with regulators. It’s never been successful historically and from our experience, we’ve found the SEC to be open to discussion.”</blockquote> 3. Chart of the week&nbsp;(1/2) <p>(Sent from a friend, source unknown):</p> 4. Twitter doubles down on&nbsp;Bitcoin Jack Dorsey, Photo: TED Conference<p>Twitter announced a slew of new crypto features last Thursday that included crypto tipping and NFT profile verification.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/24/twitters-new-crypto-features-are-a-bfd/">Coindesk’s David Morris</a> (via <a href="http://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>I think Thursday’s announcement of new crypto features on Twitter is of a similar significance. First up is a tipping feature that will connect profiles to Bitcoin and Lightning Network addresses (as well as other payments services). The service isn’t available on Android yet, so I haven’t been able to use it. But early glimpses show a streamlined and intuitive experience that looks set to smoothly onboard new bitcoin users. Twitter also says it will implement non-fungible token (NFT) verification on the platform soon, though no firm timeline was announced.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>NFT verification, however, will be a step change. The feature is still in development but it will provide some way of confirming and visually conveying that an NFT displayed in a Twitter profile is authentic, and that it is owned by the same person as the Twitter profile. As we’ve discussed in these pages at length, NFTs are a novel and powerful way to flex and show community affiliations online, but this integration will make those claims vastly clearer and more powerful.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, in El Salvador, there’s more crypto wallets than banks only a month after it became legal tender, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/27/almost-a-third-of-salvadorans-are-using-the-bitcoin-wallet-bukele-says/">according to Coindesk</a>:</p><blockquote>Almost a third of Salvadorans, or about 2 million people, are actively using the state-issued Chivo bitcoin wallet, according to President Nayib Bukele. If the figure is accurate, more people are using cryptocurrency than any particular bank in El Salvador less than a month after BTC became legal tender&nbsp;there.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/jack-dorsey-s-square-moves-closer-to-a-bitcoin-exchange">Jack Dorsey’s Square Moves Closer to a Bitcoin&nbsp;Exchange</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/twitter-new-features-tips-creators-7eb10779-b4cb-41d3-84bc-b157c04a6563.html">New features spread Twitter’s wings</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">Twitter accelerates again with Bitcoin tips, NFTs, recorded Spaces, creator fund and more — TechCrunch</a>   5.

<p>We’ve launched new features that give you more control to tailor your users’ experience signing into your application.</p><p>In this post, I’ll cover a round-up of the most recent product&nbsp;updates.</p> Allow List and Block&nbsp;List <p>Last month, we released Allow List and Block List, an access control feature that helps you easily manage who is and isn’t allowed to log in to your app from the ease of your Magic Dashboard. No code is&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Access can be gated in 2 ways: explicitly allowing only certain emails and domains through with<a href="https://magic.link/docs/customization/access-control#allow-list"> Allow List</a>, or blocking certain emails and domains with<a href="https://magic.link/docs/customization/access-control#block-list"> Block List</a>. For example, you can specify a unique email address like email@magic.link. Alternatively, you can use a domain wildcard like *@magic.link for additional flexibility. Up to 20,000 specific email addresses or domains to be added to your Allow List or Block&nbsp;List.</p><p>We’ve heard from our customers that this capability comes in handy for many use cases. Some of the most popular we heard&nbsp;include:</p>  Rolling out a private beta for your&nbsp;app  Managing access for a gated community  Working on a membership-based app or&nbsp;service  <p>To get started, head to the Settings tab to toggle on an <a href="https://magic.link/docs/customization/access-control">Allow List or Block&nbsp;List</a>.</p> Customizable Sessions <p>Now with Magic, we have made it easy for you to customize your user’s session length all without the need to write an additional line of code. Our new refresh token persists without requiring your users to re-authenticate for up to 90 days. Not only this, the refresh token works with privacy browsers and browsers with 3rd party cookies disabled, providing a persistent session for your&nbsp;users.</p><p>From the Magic dashboard, navigate to Session Management under your app Settings page and toggle on Auto Refresh. You have the flexibility to pick session lengths ranging between 7 days and 90 days. The feature is available for email and all social login&nbsp;methods.</p> Microsoft and Twitch OAuth&nbsp;Support <p>We’ve expanded our list of federated social login providers to include <a href="https://magic.link/docs/social-login/microsoft">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://magic.link/docs/social-login/twitch">Twitch</a>.

				  The world will move towards decentralized identity if we make it easy for them to do so—and easy means, above all, fast. The solution is machine readable governance—a smart way of implementing rules for how to manage trust.  
			  
				
				
				 If you want a high-speed train to go fast, you need the right kind of track. It needs to be laser-straight, have few, if any, crossings, and be free of slower freight trains. Unfortunately, the U.S. has, mostly, the wrong kind of rails: lots of crossings, lots of freight trains, and lots of curvy and unaligned tracks. One section of the Northeast Corridor can’t handle train speeds above 25mph. And while billions will soon be spent on new high-speed trains that are lighter, more capacious, and more energy efficient, they will still run on the same rails at the same speeds. <p></p>
<p>As we race ahead with decentralized identity networks—Ontario’s announcement of its Digital ID program is the most visible sign yet that we are in an accelerating phase of a paradigm shift on identity—we face lots of infrastructural choices, the answers to which could put us in an Amtrak-like bind.</p>
<p>If you think of a decentralized identity network as a set of rails that allow information to be issued, shared, and verified, this process should be as frictionless and fast as possible; and it is, because it is powered by software—called agents— that enable consent and trust at every point in the system. Once you decide that an issuer of a verifiable credential is trustworthy, verifying their credentials is straightforward. You can also apply all kinds of rules at the agent level to govern more complex information requirements in a frictionless, automatic way. A verifier agent could be programmed to accept only certain kinds of tests from a laboratory, or only tests from approved laboratories at a national or international level. The ability to do this instantaneously is essential to adoption.</p>
<p>This is why machine-readable governance, which takes place at the agent layer, is integral to the successful deployment of any kind of decentralized trusted data ecosystem: It’s a real-time way to handle governance decisions—the Boolean choreography of ‘if this, then that’— in the most frictionless way possible. This also means that a network can organize itself and respond as locally as possible to the constant flux of life and changes in information and rules. Not everybody wants the same thing or the same thing forever. </p>
<p>Machine-readable governance therefore functions as a trust registry—literally a registry of who to trust as issuers and verifiers of credentials—and as a set of rules as to how information should be combined, and for whom, and in which order. It can also power graphs—sets of connections—between multiple registries. This means that different authority structures can conform to existing hierarchical governance structures—or to self-organize. Some entities may publish their ‘recipe’ for interaction including requirements for verification, while others may simply refer to other published governance. When everyone knows each other’s requirements, we can calibrate machine-readable governance to satisfy everyone’s needs in the most efficient way possible.</p>
<p>Choreographing this complex workflow at the agent level delivers the speed needed by users. </p> 
			  
				
				
				  The elements of machine-readable governance  
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>Machine-readable governance is composed of elements that help to establish trust and enable interoperability: trusted participants, schemas (templates for structuring information in a credential), and rules and flows for presenting credentials and verifying them. Machine-readable governance can be hierarchical. Once a governance system is published, other organizations can adopt and then amend or extend the provided system.</p>
<p>In the diagram above, Government A has published a complete set of governance rules.</p>
<p>Government B selected Schema 1 for use and added its own rule and flow to the governance from Government A.</p>
<p>Federal Medical Assn. C created its own list of trusted issuers (C1, C2), selected Schema 1 for use, and layered&nbsp; customized governance on top of the governance that Government A publishes.</p>
<p>State Medical Assn. D has taken the layered governance selected by Federal Medical Assn. C and duplicated everything except its list of issuers.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>If we have this fantastic, high-speed way to verify in decentralized networks where, then, is the Amtrak problem?</p>
<p>It lies in the belief that the best way to do governance is to divert all traffic through a centralized trust registry. This trust registry will be run by a separate organization, third party business, or consortium which will decide on who is a trusted issuer of credentials—and all parties will consult this single source of trust.</p>
<p>Here’s why this isn’t a good idea:</p>
<p>First, the point of high-speed rails is speed. If you must ping the trust registry for every look up, then you have created a speed limit on how fast verification can take place. It will slow down everything.</p>
<p>Second, a trust registry creates a dependence on real-time calling when the system needs to be able to function offline. A downloadable machine-readable governance file allows pre-caching, which means no dependence on spotty connectivity. Given that we want interoperable credentials, it’s a little bit naïve and first-world-ish to assume the connection to the trust registry will always be on.</p>
<p>Third, a centralized trust registry is unlikely to be free or even low cost, based on non-decentralized real-world examples. Being centralized it gets to act as a monopolist in its domain, until it needs to interact with another domain and another trust registry. Before you know it, we will need a trust registry of trust registries. With each layer of bureaucracy, the system gets slower and more unwieldy and more expensive.</p>
<p>This kind of centralized planning is likely to only benefit the trust registry and not the consumer. And it can all be avoided if governments and entities just publish their rules. The kicker is that as the trust registries currently envisioned cannot yet accommodate rules for choreographing presentation and verification, it’s literally a case of ripping up the high-speed track and replacing it with slower rails.</p>
<p>Yes, the analogy with Amtrak isn’t exact. The tracks that crisscross the U.S. are legacy tech while decentralized identity is entirely new infrastructure. But trust registries are an example of legacy thinking, of bolting on structures conceived for different systems and different infrastructural capacities.</p>
<p>We can, with machine-readable governance, have smart trust registries that map to the way governments, local, federal, and global, actually make decisions and create rules.</p>
<p>We also move further away from a model of trust that depends on single, centralized sources of truth, and toward zero trust-driven systems that enable fractional trust—lots of inputs from lots of sources that add up to more secure decision making.</p>
<p>But most of all, we use the rails we’ve built to share information in a secure, privacy-preserving way in the fastest, most efficient way possible.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the eighth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://t.me/andreidita">Andrei</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English</a> and <a href="https://t.me/ontologyromania">Romanian</a> Communities.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I heard about Ontology in late December, 2017, on Neo’s Discord. Since I was a Neo supporter, I decided to take a deeper look at what Ontology wanted to do. Also, since I’m a philosopher, it seemed very intriguing to see such a philosophical concept as the name of the&nbsp;project.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>Basically, the concepts and goals described in their White Paper, especially the goal to build artificial trust using blockchain infrastructure. This goal, if it’s achieved, will have a great impact upon&nbsp;society.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I think the key role of a Harbinger is to promote the blockchain vision to those new to the subject and also to enlighten those already into blockchain about the importance of Ontology’s vision in this landscape. My favorite thing about being a Harbinger is being involved in creative discussions with like-minded people about technologies like decentralized identity.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Being part of the Ontology community is important to me because I truly think blockchain technology is a key aspect in making the world a better place. Also, since Ontology focuses on fundamental issues like distributed trust and digital identity, I can witness first hand how these ideas are taking&nbsp;shape.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>I would say that Ontology’s community is both friendly and helpful. Every time someone is in need of help, both admins and community members will put in the extra effort to make sure the issue is solved in the best way possible.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>The main channel I use is <a href="https://t.me/ontologyromania">Telegram</a>, followed by Discord. I prefer to interact with others in live discussions, therefore these platforms are appropriate.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>The best memory I have is helping people who were panicking about losing their assets. Their happiness when the issue was solved gave me a great&nbsp;feeling.</p><p>The advice I would give to someone looking to become a Harbinger is to always do his best to try to understand the viewpoint of the other party, especially when what others are saying might trigger adverse reactions on your&nbsp;behalf.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Helpful, friendly, mature.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>I think with the launching of EVM integration, Ontology should focus on expanding its tech community from the huge reservoir of Ethereum-based developers. The tech community was always a strong point for Ontology but having it expand also to those familiar with Solidity programming could greatly enhance the visibility of the Ontology ecosystem to the large Ethereum-based audience.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>I think EVM integration is a key milestone which will establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform. Also, something that I would like to see in the future would be the ability to link ONT ID with Telegram and use that to whitelist group members. Telegram is the most used platform for crypto and is full of scams, so such a tool would help make it a safer&nbsp;space.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 By Humpty&nbsp;Calderon <p>Over the past year, there has been a notable increase of awareness and interest towards decentralized identity solutions. Decentralized identity solutions help users, amongst other things, to control their digital identity without the input of intermediaries. As well as the individual user benefits, decentralized identity solutions have the potential to create seamless, accessible, and verifiable ecosystems. Decentralized identity holds the potential to solve many issues across the DeFi sphere and&nbsp;more.</p> What is decentralized identity? <p>To begin with, it is important to define what we mean by decentralized identity or DID. A DID can be provided to anyone or anything, be it a person, organization, or device. In contrast to typical identifiers such as drivers licenses or passports, DIDs have been designed so that they do not rely on centralized registries, identity providers, or certificate authorities.</p><p>For example, key pairs used for creating digital wallets are siloed to the blockchain where they are created. DIDs on the other hand can operate across a variety of platforms including different blockchains. Together with verifiable credentials (VCs), people can create a more robust version of their identity, linking real-world credentials like your college degrees and certifications, social media accounts, and government-issued documents such as a driver’s license or passport under one secure&nbsp;ID.</p><blockquote>Rather than creating crypto whales, integrating DID into crypto protocols can ensure that participation is open to all and money can be more evenly distributed around ecosystems.</blockquote><p>While identity issuers and verifiers may interact to discover information related to a DID, the design enables the DID holder to have complete control over their identity and data, choosing what information, if any, they wish to share with any other party. What this looks like in reality is that users who make use of decentralized identity protocols, can securely manage their digital identity by storing it on a phone or cloud service with a private key that grants access to the verified user&nbsp;only.</p> What are some of the challenges that DID seeks to&nbsp;solve? <p>Right now crypto mainly revolves around monetary use cases. Exemplifying these are decentralized apps (dApps), which favors capital over membership or contributions made to ecosystems. Plutocratic (one-token-one-vote) systems reinforce an unfortunate cycle that makes most dApps speculative and only beneficial for those with&nbsp;capital.</p><p>A more desirable and egalitarian model would be to create an ecosystem that offers one-human-one-vote use cases. DID can play a role in this, by seeking to provide humans active within the crypto ecosystem with the ability to verify their identity and use their on-chain reputation to create more accessible, secure, and rewarding experiences.</p><p>Rather than creating crypto whales, integrating DID into crypto protocols can ensure that participation is open to all and money can be more evenly distributed around ecosystems. As well as this, one-human-one-vote protocols, backed up by DID can help to more accurately quantify participation in governance, unshrouding the makeup of certain protocols that give members votes based on&nbsp;capital.</p> DeFi <p>When it comes to DeFi, DID can help fix some of the issues associated with airdrops. If projects only airdropped to users verified using DID protocols, they would ensure the fair distribution of tokens across participant pools. Members would have to be authenticated, reducing the potential for bots to drain airdrop contracts, which is a pressing issue for some in the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p><p>DID protocols allow for credit evaluation systems to verify users scores and background based on data stored on blockchain. This means that users can access credit-based lending, whilst still maintaining control of their identity. Through DID, all parties are able to access decentralized financial systems, not just&nbsp;whales.</p><p>Reputation systems that measure on-chain behavior can help to split out responsible borrowers from degens, essentially making the whole system more robust and reliable. DID can facilitate giving users a self-sovereign credit score that they can use to access credit, borrow, and&nbsp;invest.</p> NFT <p>There are exponential benefits wrought from implementing DID solutions in the realm of NFTs. NFTs, which have experienced an unparalleled surge of interest in recent months have many potential use cases, but have been mainly popularized by their usage in digital art. By deploying DID solutions with NFTs, buyers and sellers will be able to verify the creator or any given digital artwork, as well as the collector.</p><p>This ensures that representative value will be transferred to the creator or seller. DID could also be implemented to help keep NFTs in the hands of the communities that support them, instead of scalpers who mint tokens for speculation, raising the price of tokens, making it near impossible for those without capital to access&nbsp;them.</p> DAO <p>DAOs are groups of people working towards a common goal with a shared bank account. Without tools to measure community needs and member contribution, they can fail to assess the needs of their members or fairly incentivize good contributors.</p><p>DAOs using token-based governance prioritize the views and needs of large token holders who may not be active contributors, leaving out groups of people that may be active contributors but not hold large amounts of tokens. DID can enable governance mechanisms that more accurately measure community opinion.</p><blockquote>The more the lines are blurred between digital and physical life, the more our online identities will grow and evolve in complexity.</blockquote><p>It is crucial that DAOs recognize members who are making impactful contributions and reward them accordingly. DIDs can surface member contributions more clearly allowing for incentives to be used to reward and retain good&nbsp;people.</p><p>Furthermore, as DAO members become proficient in their roles, DIDs can allow them to create verifiable resumes to present their contributions to other DAOs who may then assess their value up front and incentivize them accordingly.</p> What are some projects developing DID protocols? <p>Ontology brings trust, privacy, and security to Web 3.0 through decentralized identity and data solutions. They’ve developed a comprehensive identity infrastructure including an identity wallet that allows you to easily create digital identities, a composable, cross-chain reputation protocol, and a DeFi protocol that leverages your decentralized identity and self-sovereign reputation to enable undercollateralized loans. Learn more about Ontology at <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io</a></p><p>Bright ID is a social identity network that allows you to prove that you’re only using one account. Creating your digital identity is as simple as installing an app and verifying your identity by joining a connection party. You can enjoy the benefit of your unique identity straight from the app. Learn more about BrightID at <a href="https://brightid.org/">https://brightid.org</a></p><p>Idena is the first proof-of-person blockchain based on democratic principles. Every user has a crypto identity — one single person with equal voting power and mining income. Every unique human that operates an Idena validator node can start mining Idena. To verify you are a unique human, you do not need to disclose any personal data (no KYC). You join a validation ceremony and solve a series of flip-tests (human-made CAPTCHAs). Learn more about Idena at <a href="https://www.idena.io/">https://www.idena.io/</a></p><p>Serto is a decentralized identity platform making it easy for everyone to exchange data in a trusted, private and scalable way. Easily verify the issuer of any piece of data. Turn free-form data into verifiable credentials, issue them to partners and customers, and integrate data from other parties into your processes — all in a trusted way. Learn more about Serto at <a href="https://www.serto.id/">https://www.serto.id/</a></p><p>Gitcoin connects the community developing digital public goods, creating financial freedom, and defining the future of the open web. They’ve developed the Proof of Personhood Passport, a transportable proof of personhood identity for the web3 space that allows you to earn rewards by proving your personhood on any integrated dApp, leveraging the same identity you already use on Gitcoin Grants. Learn more about Gitcoin at <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">https://gitcoin.co/</a></p> What does the future hold for&nbsp;DID? <p>The prominence of decentralized identity solutions within and outside the blockchain and crypto industry is likely to grow exponentially in the coming years. The more the lines are blurred between digital and physical life, the more our online identities will grow and evolve in complexity. If these identities are stored among multiple centralized systems, they will become harder to manage. Decentralization solves these problems, and the impact it will have on the future will likely be significant.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/humptycalderon">Humpty Calderon</a> is the Head of Community at <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Jolocom macht jetzt auch Beratung?&nbsp; 



<p>Eigentlich macht Jolocom schon immer Beratung. Neben der technischen Kompetenz, den Projekten und den Aktivitäten in Gremien, Verbänden und Vereinen haben wir unsere Kunden in den letzten 7 Jahren natürlich auch beraten. Aufgrund des Wachstums von Jolocom haben wir uns dazu entschlossen, die Beratung weiter auszubauen, um unsere Kunden noch besser unterstützen zu können und die Bereiche klarer zu trennen.</p>



<p>Im Folgenden ein Auszug aus den Aktivitäten der letzten 7 Jahre:</p>



Für große Ansicht hier <a href="http://jolocom.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jolocom-SSI-consulting-standards-scaled.jpg">klicken</a>



 Was kann Jolocom, was andere nicht können? 



<p>Unser Beraterfokus liegt natürlich auf Dezentraler Digitaler Identität (aka Self Sovereign Identity). Unser Vorteil liegt darin, dass Jolocom in den letzten 7 Jahren enormes know-how durch Projekte aufbauen konnte. Es wurde nicht nur Wissen im Technologiebereich aufgebaut, sondern auch ein umfangreiches Netzwerk durch aktive Arbeit in Gremien (z.B. W3C, DIF, INATBA, ESIF/EBSI), Vereinen (z.B. Bundesblock) und Konsortien (z.B. Schaufensterprojekte Digitale Identitäten). Jolocom deckt alle Bereiche und Ebenen ab, von erstem Kontakt mit dem Thema digitale Identitäten, Erstellung der Strategie, Auswahl der Technologie bis zu einer Implementierung. Dies ermöglicht eine effiziente Beratung aus erster Hand ohne zeit- und kostenintensive Umwege.</p>



<p>Beratung vom Anfang bis zum Ende Betrieb ohne Umwege.</p>

 Unsere Prinzipien – offene Plattform 



<p>Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass eine dezentrale Identität eine offene Plattform mit einheitlichen Standards sein muss, unabhängig von einer einzelnen Lösung. Produkte und Lösungen müssen interoperabel sein. Nur so können die Potentiale der Technologie für den Einzelnen, für den öffentlichen Bereich und die Privatwirtschaft umgesetzt werden. Dieser Grundsatz leitet uns in der Beratung und in der Erstellung unserer frei verfügbaren Plattform. In der Beratung sind wir daher technologieunabhängig und verfolgen das Ziel, dass ein Vendor lock-in oder andere Abhängigkeiten vermieden werden.</p>



 Was bietet Jolocom Consulting? 



<p>Diesen Beratersatz kennen sie sicher: “Jeder Kunde ist individuell”. Das stimmt auch. Wir haben trotzdem Kategorien von Beratungstätigkeiten definiert, um die Orientierung zu erleichtern.</p>



Ein Schritt nach dem anderen



  Your soil – Aufbau von Wissen:<br>“Verfügt ihr Unternehmen über das benötigte Wissen, um die Auswirkung und Chancen von dezentralen Identitäten richtig abzuschätzen?”<br>Der Wissensaufbau ist wichtig bevor man sich über Anwendungsfälle den Kopf zerbricht. Das Wissen kann durch Vorträge, Workshops oder Coaching Session vermittelt werden.<br>  Your ideas – Ideen und Anwendungsfälle:<br>“Welche SSI Anwendungsfälle können helfen Geschäftsprozesse zu vereinfachen oder Neue zu entwickeln, und sind diese umsetzbar?”<br>In dieser Phase können wir mit Ihnen Anwendungsfälle erarbeiten, bewerten und reihen.<br>  Grow ideas – Ausarbeitung und Planung:<br>“Was brauche ich und was bedeutet es einen Anwendungsfall umzusetzen?”<br>Haben sie eine vielversprechende Anwendung identifiziert können wir bei Strategieentwicklung, Business Case Erstellung, Budget- und Projektplan, Architekturerstellung, Buy/Build/Join Entscheidungen, Lieferantenauswahl, Ausschreibung, Konsortienbildung/-suche/-beitritt, etc. unterstützen.<br>  Implement ideas – Umsetzung:<br>“Wie kann ich sicherstellen, dass die Implementierung so läuft wie geplant?”  



<p>Jolocom Consulting unterstützt sie, egal für welche Produkte oder technischen Partner sie sich entscheiden. Jolocom Consulting unterstützt bei Projekt-/Konsortienmanagement und als Spezialist, damit die Lösung wie geplant in Betrieb geht und die Potentiale realisiert werden.</p>



<p>Seit August ist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-freitag-blockchain/">Andreas Freitag</a> bei uns. Er wird den Beratungsbereich von Jolocom weiter ausbauen und ist der erste Ansprechpartner für alle Fragen betreffend Consulting (andreas[at]jolocom.com).</p>

<p>Back in early August, in partnership with DevPost, we announced the Okta Identity Early Access Hackathon, and invited developers everywhere to "build something awesome with the Okta Identity Engine (OIE) Limited GA release."</p>
 
 
<p>Our aim was to give participants the chance to explore the new platform with its new capabilities for customer identity and access management. In exchange, we hoped to gain early stage feedback and a feel for what engaged the dev community worldwide.</p>
 
 
<p>At the close of the competition on September 14, we surveyed all participants and tallied up the results. A panel of judges evaluated the qualifying submissions, discussed, deliberated, and selected winners. It wasn’t easy.</p>
 
 
<p>A huge round of applause to the hundreds who registered and participated, a shout-out of gratitude to everyone who offered support and guidance in the forums, and special props to those ten teams and individuals who made it to the finish line.</p>
 
 
<p>Here are the numbers—</p>
 
 
<p>Total Hackathon Registrants:  493<br>
Eligible App Submissions:  10</p>
 
 
<p>And here, without further ado, are the winners and their projects:</p>
 
 
 Honorable Mention 
 
 
<p>Name: <a href="https://devpost.com/software/bubble-connect/">Bubble Connect</a><br>
Prize: $500 USD<br>
Description: Authenticated Twillio/WhatsApp chatbot.</p>
 
 
<p>Bubble Connect, from Avi Wolicki, shows the idea of allowing a user to prove their identity when dealing with a chatbot. It’s described by its creator as "an easy-to-use integration providing authentication in chatbots and other messaging services such as WhatsApp and SMS." We’d love to see how this application evolves further.</p>
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Third Place 
 
 
<p>Name: <a href="https://okta-hackathon-2021.devpost.com/submissions/255969-okta_builder_/">App_ builder_</a><br>
Prize: $3,000 USD<br>
Description: Application to bootstrap and configure Okta sample applications.</p>
 
 
<p>Folks from Okta’s Developer Relations team love to build with and create tools that get working applications up and running quickly, like <a href="https://start.spring.io">Spring</a> / <a href="https://start.steeltoe.io/">Steeltoe</a> Initializers, <a href="https://code.quarkus.io/"><code>code.quarkus.io</code></a>, and the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a>, so it wasn’t a big leap for us to see potential in App_ builder_.</p>
 
 
<p>Sameera Perera, who developed App_builder_, was motivated by curiosity, and by the desire to share what he’d learned. With his collection of starter templates, Sameera succeeds magnificently in his goal of "facilitating an easiest path for new users who need a lot of references to build up their first project." We can’t wait to see what new templates are next.</p>
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Second Place 
 
 
<p>Name: <a href="https://devpost.com/software/family-newsletter">Bill Panda</a><br>
Prize: $5,000 USD<br>
Description: Personal bill payment reminder system.</p>
 
 
<p>Bill Panda is one of the nicest custom-themed implementations of the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget">Okta Sign-In Widget</a> we’ve seen to date, and makes use of self-registration and MFA flows. The application lets you add recurring bills, expenses, and budgets, and create projections.</p>
 
 
<p>Marco Ledesma made Bill Panda to satisfy a personal itch. Learning about Okta auth has given him ideas for new features, and other ways to extend his project. We can’t wait to see what’s next for the panda, and look forward to hearing about the Laravel package mentioned by Marco for integrating Okta.</p>
 
 

 
 
 
 
 First Place 
 
 
<p>Name: <a href="https://devpost.com/software/gooseclip">GooseClip</a><br>
Prize: $10,000 USD<br>
Description: Authenticated peer-to-peer communication platform</p>
 
 
<p>Matthew Mckenzie’s GooseClip submission was in a league of its own. The project features a highly polished demo video, as well as web, CLI, and mobile applications that demonstrate aspects of the project as well as its creator’s technical prowess. Rooted in the Go programming language, and inspired by "a frustration at the lack of interoperability of our modern devices," GooseClip "integrates fast, secure peer-to-peer functionality" into a project in a few simple steps. It obscures the complexity of peer-to-peer networking by presenting a 2-route API, /attach and /connect.</p>
 
 
<p>Matthew has big plans to evolve GooseClip, and we plan to follow along. Here’s hoping the grand prize will help this goose take flight!</p>
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Most Supportive Hackers 
 
 
<p>There are many roads to glory, and all developers rely on the work of those who came before them. Sometimes help comes in the form of code—libraries, building blocks, open source projects. Other times, good information and solid guidance at the right time can mean the difference between failure and success.</p>
 
 
<p>We awarded the "most supportive hacker" prize to three individuals, based on the number of valuable and helpful responses they provided to other participants on the Okta Developer Forum’s hackathons category during the competition.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s close with kudos to Lenya Hope (1st place), Monish Basaniwal (2nd place), and Chaitanya Shah (3rd place) – who didn’t let competition get in the way of generous collaboration and knowledge-sharing. Thank you all.</p>
 
 
 
 
 What’s Next for Early Access Hacks and Hackers 
 
 
<p>We’re thrilled with the results of this Early Access Hackathon experiment, delighted by the creative range of submission, and the geographic diversity of the qualifying submissions. We had winners from the United Kingdom, the United States, Sri Lanka, Israel, and India, and participation from dozens of countries.</p>
 
 
<p>We’ve been surveying and listening to feedback from participants, and we’re compiling what we’ve learned, so that we can prioritize what comes next for the Okta Identity Engine, and the tooling developers need to build more great apps and services.</p>

<p>Introduction: AERGO, One Of The Few Blockchains Backed By The Top 20&nbsp;VC’s</p>The Names Here Speak For Themselves: And AERGO Is Amongst Some Of The Most Well Known Blockchains In The&nbsp;Space<p>It is evident that in order for a blockchain project to succeed, it must follow numerous principles for mass adoption; awareness, technological success, a strong community and strong monetary backing: AERGO has just that. Within the realm of cryptocurrency, seventeen out of the top twenty venture capital firms in the entire world have invested in blockchain companies, and AERGO has made it onto that prestigious list, which cannot be overstated. AERGO, based off of the infographic above and Blockdata is one of the largest fifty-four companies out of one-hundred and thirteen companies to be invested in by some of the largest venture capital funds in the world. AERGO is alongside cryptocurrency behemoths such as Coinbase, Binance, Kucoin, Solana, Uniswap, OpenSea, Ripple and many others, proving the necessary point to comprehend for new and veteran investors and innovators alike that AERGO, as a project, is alongside these other titans of blockchain industry in venture capital&nbsp;backing.</p><p>Sequoia Capital: A Powerhouse Titan Of Venture Capital Equity Sees Potential In AERGO, Along With Other Contributors</p>The Powerhouse Venture Capital Firm Believes In AERGO And Invested Their Own Capital Into The Company As A&nbsp;Startup<p>For a cryptocurrency in the Top 450 in totality of market capitalization, this comes as a major shocker, however, it wouldn’t be surprising to see major traction within the AERGO ecosystem as time goes on. Did you know that Sequoia Capital, one of the most well known powerhouse companies in the venture equity space, invested in AERGO? If you’re unfamiliar with Sequoia, well, they also invested in companies such as Apple, Google, Oracle, PayPal, YouTube, Instagram and Whatsapp. Other contributors in the private token sale include, but are not limited to, FBG, GBIC, Arrington XRP, Dekrypt, Rockaway, Neo Global, Divergence Digital as well as many more traditional VCs, specialist crypto funds, and angel investors. It speaks volumes that AERGO is alongside some of the largest names in the entirety of the cryptocurrency space in venture capital backing. Out of the many venture capital firms that participated in the early investment of AERGO, it is incumbent to break down some of these expansive and prominent firms that entrust in AERGO’s vision and technology.</p><p>Backers Upon Backers: VC’s Upon VC’s: The Persistent And Consistent Backing Of&nbsp;AERGO</p>The Above Picture Speaks For Itself: These Are The Major Backers And Early Investors Of&nbsp;AERGO<p>Breaking down the entirety of these backers would turn this article into a dissertation, but it is crucial to understand how prominent some of these companies are in the venture capital world, Sequoia, covered previously, being one of these major firms. Arrington XRP Capital is one of these major venture capital firms that emphasizes investment into startups and promotes incubation of promising projects that exist within the realm of blockchain. Alongside AERGO, Arrington XRP Capital’s portfolio includes prominent projects such as BlockFi, Polkadot, Near Protocol, Algorand, Terra, Certik and XRP. Arrington XRP Capital has raised over 300 million dollars in funds, their latest being on June 10th, 2021 which raised a total of 100 million dollars. RocketFuel, another venture capital firm, consists of some of the brightest minds from cutting edge conglomerates such as Snapchat, Airbnb, Uber and Accenture. Many employees of RocketFuel are graduates from leading universities such as MIT, Columbia and UC Berkeley. RocketFuel has invested in prominent projects alongside AERGO, which include ICON, Chainlink, Harmony One, Vechain, Qtum, Wanchain and Bluezelle. Block VC is one of the most prominent venture capital firms in digital assets, with over 100 employees worldwide and exposure to 60 cutting edge projects, amounting to 600 million dollars total in investment. Block VC assisted in early investment rounds for AERGO, which emphasizes the point that they see AERGO as a cutting edge technological innovator within the blockchain sphere. These are just four projects out of 30 different organizations that participated in AERGO’s seed funding, so why is this important, well it is important for numerous&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>Venture Capital Investment: The Calling Card Of A Promising Project</p>Out Of The Nearly 13,000 Cryptocurrencies That Exist, AERGO Has Succeeded In Proving Itself To Venture Capital Firms As A Blockchain Project With Longevity And Technological Ingenuity<p>Venture capital investment is not to be taken lightly; these companies are filled with some of the brightest minds in seed financing, specifically around digital assets. To garner the attention of retail investors is one thing, but to garner funding and attraction from a multi-million dollar professional firm, that is a whole other animal to reckon with. AERGO has solidified itself, through this notion, as a major contender of being one of the most promising projects that exist within the blockchain space and their venture capital backing proves that point. To garner attention and attraction, specifically from Sequoia Capital, is an outstanding feat for a company, especially a company where they directly participated in seed funding for the AERGO startup, among many other prominent firms. Mass adoption is led by those with prominence and knowledge on the prerequisites of what makes a promising project, and the fact that AERGO was one of 54 projects out of 113 with the most venture capital backing says something surrounding its overall trajectory and innovation as a blockchain company.</p><p>Conclusion: Blockchain Adoption Is Accompanied By Venture Capital Firms: The Solidification Of&nbsp;AERGO</p>Venture Capital Proves The Validity And Longevity Of A Project: AERGO Has Passed That&nbsp;Test<p>AERGO is poised to be one of the most dominant blockchain projects in South Korea and the entire Asian continent. Through the many seed investors and venture capital firms that have invested in AERGO, which has been shown to be alongside some of the most well-known projects and organizations in blockchain, exemplifies the ideal that AERGO is here to stay, to continuously grow in the future. This is AERGO, a blockchain project that emphasizes eVoting solutions, venture capital and governmental validity from various organizations which include some of the most prominent venture capital firms in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

<p>Aktualisierung (Stand 29.09.2021):&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die “ID Wallet” wurde inzwischen wieder aus den App Stores genommen (<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/buerokratieabbau/e-id-1962112">mehr hier</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir begrüßen den Schritt und freuen uns, dass die Bundesregierung den Hinweisen aus der Community zur Verbesserung der IT-Sicherheit und Nutzerführung folgt und weiter nachgehen will. Unsere Befürchtung, dass dieser misslungene erste Aufschlag&nbsp; auf die SSI Community und deren enormes Potenzial abfärben könnte, wird sich damit hoffentlich nicht bestätigen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir hoffen, dass in der Weiterentwicklung des “Ökosystem Digitaler Identitäten” intensiver mit den Schaufenstern “Sichere Digitale Identität” und der übergreifenden Begleitforschung zusammengearbeitet wird. Wir bringen unsere Expertise hier gerne ein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>———————————–</p>



<p>Seit dem 23.9.2021 ist die “ID Wallet” in den App Stores welche es Bürger:innen erlauben soll ihre digitale Identität zu verwalten. Die „ID Wallet“ der Bundesregierung wurde im Rahmen des Projekts “Ökosystem digitaler Identitäten” vom Bundeskanzleramt entwickelt und von der bisher unbekannten&nbsp;<a href="https://digital-enabling.eu/">Digital-Enabling GmbH</a>&nbsp;(Tochterunternehmen der esatus AG) entwickelt. Sie soll Nutzer:innen die Möglichkeit bieten Ihren Personalausweis und Führerschein auf Basis der Self-Sovereign Identity Technologie auf ihrem Smartphone zu nutzen.</p>



<p>Hintergrund</p>



<p>Die vorgestellte&nbsp; „ID Wallet“ hatte ursprünglich den Zweck ein Pilotprojekt um den Anwendungsfall des<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/suche/start-pilot-hotel-check-in-1914392">&nbsp;Hotel-Checkins</a>&nbsp;abzubilden. Der Pilot wurde auf Basis Hyperledger indy / ARIES 1.0 implementiert. Für einen temporären Piloten war diese Entscheidung verständlich. In der Fachcommunity wird dies inzwischen als überholt angesehen, da sich gerade im Blick auf eine Anwendung in der Breite (mit großen Nutzer:innenzahlen und Anbietern) Probleme ergeben. Für den Roll-out auf Bundesebene ist die eingesetzte Technologie daher nicht geeignet.</p>



<p>Ein Schnellschuss der nach hinten losging</p>



<p>Der Start der „ID Wallet“ App verlief äußerst holprig und wurde mit Stand 27.09. auch ausgesetzt. So hat die App bisher zwar zehntausende Downloads, aufgrund des medialen Echos, zugleich startet die App aber bei einem Großteil der Nutzer nicht einmal oder bricht im späteren Prozess ab. Das Rating von 1,x von 5 Sternen bei über 7000 Bewertungen spricht hier Bände.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Der Vertrauensvorschuss, den diese Nutzer:innen der App mit dem download gegeben hatten, ist damit verspielt worden, was sich auch in<a href="https://gist.github.com/rena2019/a7d68aceded5a99439504656ea8ffef0">&nbsp;einschlägigen Foren</a>, den sozialen Netzwerken und Kommentarspalten nachlesen lässt.</p>



<p>Die Kritik im Detail&nbsp;</p>



<p>Es gibt neben der eingeschränkten Funktionsfähigkeit, die ärgerlich und dem anfänglichen Vertrauensaufbau zu einer neuen Technologie nicht dienlich ist, noch weitere und weitaus wichtigere Punkte die bislang bei der Beleuchtung des Debakels der „ID Wallet“ App nicht ausreichend Berücksichtigung fanden! Die Punkte sind:</p>



<p>Offenheit und Transparenz:&nbsp;<br>Die eingesetzte “ID Wallet” ist nicht open source, man kann also nicht unabhängig überprüfen was wirklich mit den Daten geschieht. Bei anderen Projekten wie der Corona Warn App wurde hier deutlich besser gearbeitet. Ähnliches gilt auch für den Herausgeber der Wallet, der wider Erwarten nicht die Bundesregierung ist, sondern eine bisher unbekannte Firma.</p>



<p>Infrastruktur:&nbsp;<br>Eine zukunftsfähige Identitäts-Infrastruktur muss in jedem Fall als offene und dezentrale Infrastruktur angelegt sein. Nur so lassen sich die Risiken für Datenschutz und Kontrolle durch Dritte ausreichend eingrenzen. Ein<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1898280/d9819a40553a9543b9e8f3acb620b0c2/digitale-identitaet-neu-download-bundeskanzleramt-data.pdf?download=1">&nbsp;“Ökosystem digitaler Identitäten”&nbsp;</a>wie es vom Bundeskanzleramt im März 2021 beschrieben wurde sollte nicht allein als Kooperation zwischen Regierung und Privatwirtschaft verstanden werden. Vielmehr muss sichergestellt sein, dass die Bevölkerung und Zivilgesellschaft an diesem Prozess beteiligt wird.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Standards:&nbsp;<br>Um die oben genannten Punkte zu erreichen, muss auf einheitlichen Standards aufgebaut werden. Die Piloten des Bundeskanzleramts bauen auf der Technologie Hyperledger Indy in der Version 1.0 auf, die diverse Probleme in Bezug auf Standard Compliance und Skalierbarkeit hat. International laufen die Abstimmungen für einen skalierbaren und auf Interoperabilität hin ausgerichteten Stack bereits auf Hochtouren. Offene Gremien wie der W3C, Decentralized Identity Foundation und Linux Foundation spielen hier eine wichtige Rolle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Einbindung:&nbsp;<br>Bei einem solchen Vorhaben, muss so früh wie möglich die Zivilgesellschaft eingebunden werden (z.B.:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ccc.de/">Chaos Computer Club</a>), da ansonsten das Risiko besteht&nbsp; die Akzeptanz der Lösung massiv zu verringern. Einen einmaligen Verlust des Vertrauens kann man in diesem Bereich schwer wieder herstellen.</p>



<p>“Schaufensterprojekte” der nachhaltigere Weg</p>



<p>Das BMWi hat 2019 das Schaufensterprojekt „Sichere Digitale Identitäten“ als Forschungsprojekt ausgeschrieben. Im Rahmen des Innovationswettbewerbs&nbsp;<a href="http://schaufenster-sdi.de/">„Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten“</a>&nbsp;möchte das BMWi herausragende Ansätze für interoperable und einfach nutzbare ID-Ökosysteme fördern, die in Modellregionen anwendungsnah erprobt werden sollen. Nach einer Wettbewerbsphase 2020, an der 11 Konsortien teilnahmen, hat seit April 2021 die 3-jährige Umsetzungsphase begonnen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inzwischen arbeiten die 4 ausgewählte Konsortien an der Umsetzung von selbstbestimmten digitalen Identitäten (ONCE, ID-Ideal , SDIKA, und ID-Union). In über 40 Anwendungsfällen wollen die 60+ Konsortialpartner die technologische Infrastruktur selbstbestimmte Identitäten weiterentwickeln und für Bürger:innen nutzbar machen. Auch Führerschein und Personalausweis sollen hier digital in einer Wallet App auf dem Smartphone abgebildet werden.</p>



<p>Eine wesentliche Vorgabe des Projektträgers ist Interoperabilität aller im Schaufenster verwendeten Technologie Bausteine für selbstbestimmte Identitäten (SSI = Self Sovereign Identity). Um dies sicherzustellen, gibt es zusätzlich zum Schaufenster die<a href="https://digitale-identitaeten.de/">&nbsp;Begleitforschung</a>, die diesen Prozess unterstützt.</p>



<p>Das BMWi hat die SDI Projekte auf einen realistischen Zeithorizont von 3 Jahren ausgelegt. Man hat sich bewusst gegen eine vorschnelle Einführung dieser innovativen Technologie entschieden, da diese sich immer noch in einem Forschungs- und Erprobungs-Stadium befindet. Ein wesentlicher Anspruch der SDI Projekte ist, dass diese komplexe Aufgabe als eine gemeinsame verstanden wird, die von allen Beteiligten sauber aufgesetzt werden will und muss. Nur so lässt sich das volle Potenzial selbstbestimmter Identitäten erschließen, sowie die Lernkurve exponentiell steigern. Dieser Ansatz wurde von Bundeskanzleramt und Verkehrsministerium mit dem vorschnellen Release der “ID Wallet” weitestgehend in den Wind geschlagen.</p>



<p>Debatte um Walletanbieter</p>



<p>Wie das aktuelle Debakel der „ID Wallet“ zeigt, ist es weder im Interesse der BürgerInnen nur auf eine Wallet angewiesen zu sein, noch ist dies für den öffentlichen und privaten Sektor von Interesse. Wesentlich ist die Implementierung globaler Standards unter Open Source (Quelloffener Code), denn nur diese werden es ermöglichen, dass wir unsere digitalen Identitäten weltweit einsetzen und selbstbestimmt verwalten können.</p>



<p>Der Ansatz nur einer exklusiven Wallet, oder nur eines Blockchain (Ledgers) gefährdet Sicherheit und Rechte der Bürger:innen, und verhindert das Entstehen einer selbstbestimmten globalen Kommunikations-Infrastruktur, die gerade in diesen Zeiten so essenziell wie nie zuvor ist.</p>



<p>Selbstbestimmte Identitäten sind nur dann selbstbestimmt, wenn Bürger:innen eine Wahl haben und frei entscheiden können, welche Standard konforme Wallet sie zu welchen Bedingungen nutzen wollen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unsere Empfehlung</p>



<p>Wir empfehlen dem Bundeskanzleramt und der neuen Regierung einen Schulterschluss mit den Schaufensterprojekten Sichere Digitale Identität des BMWi und der übergreifenden Begleitforschung zu suchen, vor allem im Hinblick auf:</p>



  Ausrichtung und Mitarbeit an internationalen Standards (DIF, W3C).  Unabhängigkeit von einem spezifischen Ledger (oder anderen PKI Services), Anbietern, Software und Lizenzen  Interoperabilität (national und international) und  Schaffung einer öffentlichen digitalen Infrastruktur (offenes Netzwerk statt geschlossener Plattform) für BürgerInnen und Unternehmen um gesellschaftliche und volkswirtschaftliche Vorteile zu generieren  Die gesamte Infrastruktur muss Open-Source sein  



<p>Die “ID Wallet” App sollte umgehend zurückgezogen werden, um die Reputation der dezentralen Identitäten nicht weiter zu schädigen. Die eingesetzte Lösung ist nicht sauber implementiert und getestet, noch auf internationale Standards aufgebaut, und somit auch nicht zukunftsfähig.</p>



<p>All dies sind jedoch Grundvoraussetzungen um eine Europäische und globale Anschlussfähigkeit sicherzustellen. Der Zeithorizont von 2 bis 3 Jahren der SDI Projekte ist ambitioniert, scheint hierfür jedoch realistisch und sinnvoll.</p>

<p>The privacy industry is applauding the Federal Trade Commission for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/ftc-bans-spyfone-and-ceo-from-surveillance-business">banning</a>&nbsp;SpyFone and its CEO from the surveillance business following allegations they secretly harvested and sold real-time data that could easily lead stalkers and abusers to their potential targets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The personal data, accessed through a hidden device hack, revealed device owners’ locations, phone use, and other online activities like email and video chats. Not only could stalkers and abusers access the data, but potentially so could identity thieves and other cybercriminals.</p>



<p>SpyFone purports to be a parental monitoring tool for keeping an eye on the kids. But as is often the case with these tools, it’s bought by abusers wanting to track the target of their abuse. This makes it&nbsp;<a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/">stalkerware</a>, for which the official definition is software, made available directly to individuals, that enables a remote user to monitor the activities on another user’s device without that user’s consent and without explicit, persistent notification to that user in order to intentionally or unintentionally facilitate intimate partner surveillance, harassment, abuse, stalking, and/or violence.</p>



<p>A key characteristic of stalkerware is that it requires physical access to a device to install it on that device, which means it’s most commonly installed by a person for the purposes of partner surveillance, facilitating gender-based and domestic violence, harassment, and sexual abuse. With stalkerware, abusers can track GPS location, call information, text messages and social media activity.</p>



<p>The FTC alleges that SpyFone.com and its CEO Scott Zuckerman:</p>



  sold stalkerware apps that allowed purchasers to secretly monitor the device owner’s photos, text messages, web histories, GPS locations, and other personal data  required purchasers using the app on Android devices to bypass many of the phone’s restrictions and instructed users on how to hide the app from the device owner  failed to keep the data it illegally obtained secure with basic security measures.&nbsp;  



<p>This is the second case the FTC has brought against stalkerware apps, but the first in which it’s obtaining a ban. The FTC order also requires SpyFone to delete the information it collected illegally and notify device owners that the app had been secretly installed.</p>



<p>As a proud member of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/anonyome-labs-joins-global-fight-against-stalkerware/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>&nbsp;helping to stop tech-facilitated violence and abuse, Anonyome Labs welcomes the FTC’s decision. This is a first from the FTC, and a good one at that. We hope it makes the entire stalkerware industry re-think its choices.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs takes the protection of user data seriously. We empower people to be able to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. Through our privacy and cybersafety application,&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, and our enterprise solutions in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, we help people to communicate and interact with third party services or other people without using their personally identifiable information (e.g. personal phone number, email address, credit card), which reduces the risk of that information being used for tracking or stalking.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>On September 8th, 2021 <a href="https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2021-09-07-T-Systems-and-Google-Cloud-Partner-to-Deliver-Sovereign-Cloud-for-Germany" title="https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2021-09-07-T-Systems-and-Google-Cloud-Partner-to-Deliver-Sovereign-Cloud-for-Germany">Google and T-Systems announced</a> their intention to build and deliver sovereign cloud services for German enterprises, the public sector, and healthcare organizations.&nbsp; So, what are a sovereign cloud services and why does this announcement matter?</p>
 Sovereign Cloud 
<p>The sovereign cloud is seen as a solution to the risks that arise from the increasing dependence of organizations on cloud services that are owned by foreign entities and delivered from outside of the local jurisdictions.&nbsp; These risks include loss of critical services through geopolitical disputes, interception of data by foreign governments, privacy and theft of intellectual property, as well as lock-in to proprietary service interfaces.</p>
<p>Governments around the world have enacted laws and introduced regulations in an attempt to mitigate against these risks.&nbsp; In Europe, the EU GDPR (General Data Protections Regulation) is an example of this.&nbsp; The subsequent <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf" title="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf">Schrems II judgement</a> and <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf" title="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf">European Data Protection Board recommendations</a> highlight the need for technical controls as well as legal contracts covering data processed in foreign jurisdictions since governments are not bound by civil contracts.</p>
<p>The idea behind the sovereign cloud is to ensure that the services provided are within the control of the jurisdiction where it is used.&nbsp; This can be achieved in several ways.&nbsp; Within Europe there are some cloud services that are locally owned and delivered.&nbsp; However, these services find it hard to compete against the economies of scale enjoyed by the global hyperscale cloud services.&nbsp; Therefore, using purely local providers usually involves increased costs and or reduced functionality.</p>
<p>Another approach is for state sponsored projects.&nbsp; However, these have a chequered history when it comes to innovation and, in any case, the richness of the existing hyperscale cloud services leaves an enormous gap to close.&nbsp; Therefore, quite sensibly, the European <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html" title="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">GAIAX project</a> does not seek to replace the existing cloud services but rather to increase local control.&nbsp; Google, together with other hyperscale cloud providers, is a founding member of GAIAX.</p>
<p>It is this context that the partnership between Google and T-Systems should be viewed.&nbsp; According to Google the object of this is to deliver a European Cloud on Europe’s terms.&nbsp; The core focus is on the DACH (German, Austrian and Swiss) markets covering enterprises, the public sector, and healthcare organizations.</p>
 Google and T-Systems Sovereign Cloud for Germany 
<p>Google and T-Systems have described the 3 areas of sovereignty that this offering will support.&nbsp; These are data sovereignty, operational sovereignty, and software sovereignty.</p>
<p>They describe data sovereignty as covering 9 areas.&nbsp; These include customer control over the location of their data, controls against unauthorized access such as encryption by default and customer control over encryption keys as well as visibility and control over administrative access by Google administrators.&nbsp; They extend to include a promise not to sell the customers’ data and not to use the customers’ AI models for any other purpose.&nbsp; Most of these areas are supported by all the major IaaS providers.</p>
<p>Operational sovereignty covers 6 areas.&nbsp; These include support for local administration in selected regions, customer control over and visibility of administrative access and data decryption and visibility of security and hardware configurations changes to the infrastructure. They extend to customer audit based on consolidated tamper evident logs, zero trust control over access and the ability to support third party administration.&nbsp; These are important differentiators.</p>
<p>Software sovereignty – this provides consistent orchestration and management of workloads across multi-clouds, private cloud to provide survivability, based on and compatible with Open Source and Opens Source APIs.</p>
<p>Google says that this will be achieved through the use of a common hardware and software stack for both the public and sovereign clouds. The sovereign cloud will be delivered through a trusted partner and include additional controls and sovereignty guarantees which will be operated by the partner.</p>
<p>In terms of implementation the plan is to deliver in phases.&nbsp; Phase 1 July 2022 – Encryption management, data localization, access control, open source.&nbsp; Phase 2 2023 – Identity Management, Audits &amp; Comprehensive Trust Management. Phase 3 2024 – Fully operational sovereign controls, data access, monitoring, security, deployment, audit.</p>
 Opinion 
<p>The DACH market has been slow to adopt cloud services because of fears such as unauthorized access to sensitive data as well as concerns over the legality of their use.&nbsp; These are increased due to the perceived difficulties of achieving security and compliance obligations.&nbsp; This is welcome as it appears to be a practical approach to resolving these challenges. It clearly addresses some of the operational control and data privacy issues.&nbsp; However, it is not clear how it would enable service continuity in the event of geopolitical dispute since the underlying service is ultimately controlled by Google.&nbsp; In addition, local partnership to deliver sovereign services has been unsuccessfully tried before by other providers.</p>

<p>The incentives in the global marketplace are utterly broken, giving rise to drastic inefficiencies, environmental harm and human rights abuses around the world. How do we create a market economy that doesn’t consume the&nbsp;world?</p> Intro: Fix the Incentives, Fix the&nbsp;World <p>As it currently stands, centralized institutions are incentivized not to secure truth in their products or services but rather shield themselves from potential liabilities. While many companies offer warranties to their products, these are limited almost entirely to the primary markets. As soon as an object begins trading in the secondary markets, liability dissipates.</p><p>The only other sources of truth available beyond the manufacturer are the specialist firms which rate and certify objects of a particular domain: fine art, collectible cards, instruments, etc. However, these institutions are limited in their capacity by their lack of a shared record of an object’s history. Best case there’s an entry in a single database. Worst case: a single paper certificate.</p><p>This disconnected certification system and lack of initiative and coordination in securing product information has incredibly adverse effects on society: counterfeiting abound, environmental harm, and human rights&nbsp;abuses.</p><p>So how do we break out of the silos of separate “truths” and crowdsource expertise to build a better marketplace that doesn’t absolutely consume the&nbsp;world?</p><p>Our answer: Trust Communities</p> What are Trust Communities? <p>Built on the Mattereum Asset&nbsp;Passport</p><p>Before diving into this concept it is important to discuss the core component of the Mattereum Protocol: the Mattereum Asset Passport&nbsp;(MAP).</p><p>In short, a MAP is a bundle of legal warranties tied to an object. While these warranties can vary with the object in question, the initial warranty is often some form of identification. Other warranties in a MAP may include authentication methods, carbon offsets, anti-slavery certification, tokenization (or connections to any smart contract or software system), and many others. These warranties are essentially “<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/composable-commerce-with-mattereum-asset-passports-4e102f85139a">legal lego</a>” of various contract terms that will range greatly between different asset classes and will accrue around assets over&nbsp;time.</p><p>The warranties within a MAP are not informal handshakes on the internet but rather legally-enforceable terms of a contract that the buyer opts into, evidenced by cryptographic signatures which bind counterparties to the underlying legal agreement. All claims are backed by financial stake, giving all warrantors accountability and skin-in-the-game for their assessments. This framework also provides access to dispute resolution protocols in the event of systemic or commercial fallout via an arbitration clause in the contract.</p><p>Later this year we will integrate <a href="https://www.unn.finance/">UNN.finance</a> risk management pools so that there is a DeFi-native way of supporting product sales using Mattereum. We are also building bridges with the regular insurance industry. This approach means a single asset can be protected by both DeFi-native and fiat-native risk management protocols.</p><p>Once a MAP has been generated, we must then have a system in place to incentivize and secure this object warranty system over time without centralized institutions.</p><p>Building Product Information Markets with Blockchain</p><p>Commerce on the internet is both a technological and social phenomenon, so any proposed system must address the fundamental social and technical challenges that go into curating and securing product information.</p><p>Socially, in the absence of centralized trust we must incentivize experts to apply their domain-specific knowledge to supply warrantied information around goods and services.</p><p>Technically, we need a shared, open database for recording the provenance of an object and a programmable transaction system which powers the aforementioned incentive mechanism. This system must also overcome the transaction costs of bringing in experts (who are not dealers) to rapidly and efficiently deploy their expertise.</p><p>Mattereum Trust Communities</p><p>With blockchain and smart contracts, we can power commons-based peer production of product information with built-in crypto-economic incentives and clear lines of accountability.</p><p>With product information markets enabled by Trust Communities, we can incentivize truth in markets by allowing experts to make money on their expertise and face consequences for erroneous claims. Simple concept, powerful implications.</p><p>Let’s look at some examples.</p> Eliminating Counterfeit Goods <p>According to a<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/trade/trends-in-trade-in-counterfeit-and-pirated-goods_g2g9f533-en"> joint report</a> by OECD and EUIPO based on 2016 data, counterfeit and pirated goods accounted for over $500 billion in international trade in that year alone: up to 3.3% of world&nbsp;trade!</p><p>The range of markets affected include common consumer goods such as clothing and electronics, B2B products like chemicals and construction materials, luxury fashion, fine art, and even pharmaceuticals, food, and medical equipment.</p><p>This scale of fraud doesn’t just burn the top 1% with a forged Monet or Picasso discovered in their collections. This can have a real impact on public <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/usernotices/counterfeitResp.html">health</a>, safety, and <a href="https://wtop.com/tracking-metro-24-7/2018/09/inspector-general-fake-labels-on-electrical-parts-used-in-metro-car-maintenance/">infrastructure</a>.</p><p>The product information market method could adapt to ALL of these industries at the consumer and business level. The main difference is where the Asset Passport is generated in the product lifecycle.</p><p>With consumers, we can generate MAPs to secure the storied value of unique or limited objects such as art, instruments, cultural artifacts, or precious metals, leveraging a network of third-party, independent certifiers with relevant expertise to stake their assessments via warranties, challenge any existing claims, and even earn from the continued sale of these&nbsp;items.</p><p>At the business level, we could embed MAPs within corporate supply chains even before the manufacturing stage to have a truly transparent and information-rich view of the entire product lifecycle, from design and specifications, to production, to purchase and resale. Cryptographically verifiable by any and all parties. Think of something like KickStarter: you put money in at the design stage and get an NFT. You can resell that NFT as the product approaches physical delivery. The new owner of the NFT will get the final product when it ships: ideal for rarities and exciting new&nbsp;drops.</p><p>Most industries feature third-party expertise outside of the key corporations such as certification firms and engineering tear-downs. With Mattereum Trust Communities, we can build product information markets that aggregate and incentivize the use of this underutilized knowledge, restoring value, increasing liquidity, and bringing peace of mind to trade at all&nbsp;scales.</p> Powering the “Lean Green” Circular&nbsp;Economy <p>Before we can ever achieve an ultra-efficient and sustainable circular economy of goods, we must first solve for the deep lack of trust in online transactions. Just as liability dissipates when goods reach the secondary market, so does their value. E-commerce platforms like eBay and Amazon provide incredible reach with their two-sided marketplaces, but the frequent fraud, dodgy dispute resolution procedures, and high fees severely hinder the valuation of secondhand goods. The “doubt discount” runs far and wide in these markets, where the vast majority of all material goods&nbsp;reside.</p>Eliminating the Doubt Discount of Digital&nbsp;Commerce<p>As an example, let’s look at a useful item in virtually any setting: the Honda EU20i portable electric generator. By reputation, these generators run forever: it’s the Rolls-Royce of small generators. On eBay, they’re roughly 60% discounted from new, even if they’ve only been run a few hundred hours. Enter our Trust Community experts:</p><p>Examine the generator. Write a warranty on its expected future lifespan. If it breaks down before that, the buyer gets paid. The simplest form: “I’ll buy this generator for $1000 if it breaks down in the next two years.” This gives the expert the chance to repair it and resell it. Simple market mechanisms.</p><p>The result is the second hand generators are worth a lot more if they last. Garbage units can’t be warrantied, so they don’t attract higher resale prices. This produces a flight to quality in the market, reducing the overall number of failed generators sitting in the scrap&nbsp;heaps.</p><p>This has two benefits: those goods which are produced in a re-identifiable form and can be warrantied will sell for higher prices initially, because of more stable, higher secondhand value, and these goods will provide more hours of service for lower landfill cost than low quality goods. The “secondhand circular economy” then kicks in. There’s less unused cheap and nasty generators gathering dust in garages, because people buy a good generator secondhand when they need it, and sell it again for nearly what they paid for it — a rational price given how long these things&nbsp;last.</p><p>Now imagine this system for any product of lasting&nbsp;utility.</p><p>Using product information markets, the secondhand marketplace suddenly evolves from the place where value goes to die to the ideal means of acquiring goods of tested, durable worth. As a society, we could do more with less, increasing profitability in peer-to-peer economies and greatly reducing&nbsp;waste.</p> Revealing the True Costs of&nbsp;Trade <p>Trade globalization is rife with negative externalities. For the purposes of this article, let’s look at two examples of suffering imbued within the global machinery of trade, and how Trust Communities and Product Information Markets can help combat this systemic injustice.</p><p>Climate</p><p>With unchecked carbon emissions being an accelerant of climate change — which will have cascading effects throughout our agriculture, infrastructure, and general quality of life now and in the future — we can view this by-product of trade as contributing to suffering in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Despite the threat, there’s plenty of greenwashing and CSR/ESG theatre from the corporate sphere, as well as gaslighting of the populace.</p><p>Global coordination to avert the worst-case scenarios in the future is a combined policy, social, and technological challenge: a veritable “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wicked problem</a>.” Policy and social awareness are beyond the scope of this article, so let’s look at supportive solutions on the tech&nbsp;side.</p><p>Even though we have carbon calculators for individuals and businesses alike as well as marketplaces for purchasing carbon offsets, there still lacks a fine-grain accounting of C02 and energy costs across all of industry.</p><p><a href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx">Carbon Calculator</a></p><p>For assets secured by the Mattereum Protocol, carbon offsets can be purchased through third-party marketplaces and be warrantied within the Asset Passport. For products which emit carbon throughout their lifecycle — such as gas-powered vehicles — multiple offsets can be purchased and warrantied over&nbsp;time.</p><p>In a future where net-zero products gain a premium over non-net-zero goods and services due to demand and possibly mandate, Trust Communities can help facilitate Product Information Markets for end-to-end carbon accounting of trade and push us further to a greener future. Decentralizing this process is necessary to maintain accountability for all parties involved — in particular corporations and governments which have the largest carbon footprints and therefore the most responsibility.</p><p>Slavery</p><p>The most pernicious and hidden suffering of trade globalization lies upon the millions of slave laborers which exist in the world today. While exact numbers are of course impossible to count, the ranges estimate the total number of slaves in the world today to be 20–40 million, with 10 million estimated to be children and the vast majority being women and&nbsp;girls.</p><p>The clothes on our backs. The minerals in our smartphones. The likelihood of anyone reading or writing this not owning a product touched by a slave is incredibly slim. The truth is that throughout the global supply chain, there are shadowy areas far removed from the corporate offices or warehouses where material and labor is sourced by stripping the basic rights and dignity of other human&nbsp;beings.</p><p><a href="https://slaveryfootprint.org/">Slavery Footprint</a></p><p>While fair trade products are prevalent, they are limited in number and scope. In reality, slavery-free trade and decent labor conditions should be the standard mode of industry rather than a unique offering.</p><p>Similar to climate, the path forward for meaningful systemic change will be a combination of progressive policy, social awareness, and technological innovation.</p><p>On the tech front, Mattereum is actively researching and developing methods of warrantying anti-slavery certification. In practice, an independent, expert individual or firm within a Trust Community could investigate the supply chain of a particular product for any labor abuses, either supplying the warranty or checking an active claim if there is any suspicion on its authenticity.</p><p>The exact implementation of this is a work in progress, but we are joined in the effort by human rights activist and anti-slavery expert Helen Burrows to design the process in the context of the Mattereum Protocol.</p><p>This work is a culmination of decades spent thinking on how to manage scarce resources on the planet such that people’s basic necessities of living are secured, even in the worst of situations.</p><p>For a longer read, Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta distilled his insights on the technological and social transformation of material culture in his book, The Future of Stuff, where he explores how material culture has made monsters of us all and how we can build a better path forward where humanity can live in equilibrium with the planet at the expense of no&nbsp;one.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Stuff-Vinay-Gupta-ebook/dp/B08B4F5QK3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+future+of+stuff&amp;qid=1632531819&amp;sr=8-1">The Future of Stuff</a></p> Better Markets Make a Better&nbsp;World <p>The potential of Product Information Markets as described here is a reformation, rethinking, and possibly a path to redemption for the markets consuming the world today. If taken to the nth degree, Product Information Markets could create a multi-dimensional pricing mechanism beyond supply and demand: energy costs, material costs, C02 emissions, labor hours, worker conditions, etc. Imagine if we were able to index and filter markets along these lines. We could virtually eliminate fraud, piracy, environmental harm, and root out human rights abuses all across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>With this information at hand, people could engage in material culture in a way that does not conflict with their core principles. They can even configure tools to prevent them from contributing to negative externalities like accidentally buying products with unchecked carbon emissions or slaves in the supply chain: automated morality systems that overcome the mental transaction costs of simply not doing harm to society.&nbsp;.</p><p>This vision of a market economy which incentivizes truth and prices out societal harm does not require central command economies, heavy bureaucracy, or some undiscovered paradigm-shifting technology.</p><p>It simply demands a will to change, and the technology to make sure that people’s decisions are correctly implemented.</p><p>About Mattereum</p><p>London-based Mattereum was established in 2017 by a trans-disciplinary team with a track record in designing and launching nation state-level infrastructure and headed by former Ethereum release coordinator Vinay Gupta. With blockchain-enabled authentication and tokenization of physical assets with built-in legal guarantees, Mattereum removes the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has plagued digital commerce for&nbsp;decades.</p><p>Follow us as we bring the Mattereum Protocol to an expanding variety of markets ranging from memorabilia, gold, wine, to prized classical instruments, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>More at: <a href="http://www.mattereum.com/">http://www.mattereum.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/mattereum">https://twitter.com/mattereum</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/mattereum">https://t.me/mattereum</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/bringing-truth-to-market-with-trust-communities-product-information-markets-d09fb4a6e780">Bringing Truth to Market with Trust Communities &amp; Product Information Markets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An explainer on how to complete proposals and improve your runway in OceanDAO&nbsp;grants.</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">OceanDAO</a> is a community-curated grants&nbsp;DAO</p><p>In OceanDAO, there are humans on the other side voting for your team’s proposal. They’re assessing your team’s ability to deliver, using track record in previous grants as a key guide. This can be subjective as there is a wide range of possible targets. We need something that is flexible enough to handle OceanDAO now has mechanisms to report and assess track&nbsp;record.</p><p>This post is a guide for you, as a project team, about OceanDAO Funding Levels, <a href="https://oceandao.notion.site/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standings</a>, <a href="https://oceandao.notion.site/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">How To: Submit an Update</a> and complete your proposals,</p><p>The rest of the post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2 onboards the user to the grant&nbsp;program.  Section 3 describe the different funding levels accessible by DAO participants.  Section 4 covers Project Standings.  Section 5 provides different examples on submitting and completing proposals.  Section 6 talks a bit about the&nbsp;future.   2. Completing Grants <p>If you are learning how to write a proposal, working on submitting a proposal, or perhaps have already been funded, then this blog post may help you improve how to coordinate with the&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>If you want more context, you can read here <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki#steps---summary">How To: Submit a Proposal</a>. You can also visit our <a href="https://oceandao.notion.site/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing</a>&nbsp;page</p><p>We’ll be focusing on the Grant Deliverables parameters inside the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Grant-Proposal-Template">Grant Proposal Template</a>, and how to reconcile your grant with the DAO. You may be familiar with <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Port</a> at this point, and how to submit a new Proposal.</p>Submitting a Grant Proposal (using the template) into Ocean&nbsp;Port. 3. Funding&nbsp;Levels <p>So, why should you complete your proposals?</p><p>With the introduction of a Proposal Update mechanism, enables the DAO to signal the delivery of their work and completion of a grant. This in turn, allows teams to return to the DAO and ask for more&nbsp;funding.</p><p>As teams complete on their promises, continue to drive towards ROI&gt;1, and receive funding, their funding ceiling may go up, enabling them to increase their roadmap, or scale with more impunity. It is up to each Individual|Team|Project|Business|Organization|DAO to effectively manage their treasury.</p>Completing proposals gives teams access to greater&nbsp;funding. 4. Project&nbsp;Standing <p>The second reason to submit an update, and complete your proposal, is to maintain a good project standing. We’ll keep this post simple, and focused on what’s most important: getting to&nbsp;green.</p>Different project states. You need to be in the green to apply for a new&nbsp;grant.<p>As soon as the round concludes, funded projects receive the “Unreported” standing and they have 3 months to submit an update. Your standing needs to be in the green to apply for additional grants.</p> 5. Submit Updates &amp; Complete&nbsp;Grants <p>Our goal then is to get from our ⬜️Grant Deliverable promise, to a ✅️Completed state.</p><p>This is very easy to do once you have submitted your proposal. You just reply to your original proposal inside of Ocean Port, with an explanation of the work completed, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47344571/how-to-draw-checkbox-or-tick-mark-in-github-markdown-table">all checkmarks set to completed</a>.</p>Submit a proposal to receive funding. Reply to your proposal to update and complete&nbsp;it.<p>Identifying what to write and how to reconcile the grant might be a bit more challenging. This post tries to provide insights into a few different examples, to make some initial recommendations.</p> New Proposal <p>You will first start by submitting your proposal to <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Port</a>.</p><p>For the sake of this blog, we’re going to be forming a Data Union that collects images of people giving each other high fives. Participants that submit new high fives receive $FIVE tokens as a reward. The project name will be “Awesome Data&nbsp;Coop”.</p><p>Good enough for&nbsp;now.</p><p>We submit our proposal which includes many details, including considerations for ROI&gt;1, and provide multiple Grant Deliverables that will receive funding. We also provide some estimates.</p><p>High Five!</p>For the remainder of the blog we’ll be providing examples based on this submission. Submit Update — Completion <p>Since our team of super shadowy coders estimated everything perfectly and delivered on time, we share details about what we have delivered, point to results and outcomes, and share our next steps towards&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Our Project Standing will remain Complete if no one Disputes our&nbsp;update.</p><p>We should be on our way to submitting another proposal to further our web3 contracts, deploy a DAO, and begin farming high&nbsp;fives.</p>High Five! Submit Update — Reconciliation <p>In this scenario our team did not hit all their&nbsp;goals.</p><p>Although we completed the Technical Design, and UX Wireframe, we ran into challenges building the dApp. As a young team, we underestimated the work ahead and ran into more work than anticipated.</p><p>That’s ok, we got a lot of the frontend and smart contracts delivered to provide a basic MVP in testnet. We explain how the funds were used to generate this first deliverable, we communicate a new plan which is composed of 3 phases, and set the deliverable to complete.</p><p>Our Project Standing will remain Complete if no one Disputes our update and reconciliation.</p>High Five! Submit Update — Refunding <p>In this scenario our team bit more than it was ready to&nbsp;chew.</p><p>We got a Technical Design, and UX Wireframe out the door, but we’re not too happy with it. More importantly, our initial R&amp;D showed technical limitations based on the original methodology we planned to use. Further to that, our lead engineer quit the&nbsp;project.</p><p>At this point, we feel that it would be most constructive to retire the project, and refund the&nbsp;grant.</p><p>After sending the funds back, our Project Standing will remain Refunded if no one Disputes our update and reconciliation.</p>Low Five!<p>Although refunding is an acceptable means to provide a resolution, we believe there are more constructive ways to empower teams to&nbsp;succeed.</p> Submit Update — Pivot <p>In this scenario, we experienced all of the same problems as the example&nbsp;above.</p><p>However, instead of sending the funds back, we are pivoting the project and using the funds to bootstrap our next&nbsp;project.</p><p>Since we have some remaining funds, we’ll take them into consideration in our future proposal. We have already been open with the community about these challenges, so we link to the new Proposal that further explains the&nbsp;pivot.</p><p>Our Project Standing will remain Completed if no one Disputes our update and reconciliation.</p>High Five!<p>We should anticipate most projects to fail. Teams that succeed will provide asymmetrical ROI. For these reasons, we should support projects as much as possible to reconcile their deliverables and continue building.</p> 6. Ok, so what’s&nbsp;next? <p>As OceanDAO evolves, higher Funding Levels and different eligibility criteria might be introduced to further increase the funding&nbsp;ceiling.</p><p>Projects building in OceanDAO should continue to build, create traction, increase their <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/On-ROI#whats-a-good-metric-for-bang">bang</a>, receive funding, and speed up their flywheels.</p><p>Furthermore, OceanDAO projects will be able to update their proposals and manage their Project State more easily.

<p>This week marks a major milestone in our development of the ShareRing ecosystem. After 3 years of tireless planning, building, rebuilding, testing, and re-testing, we have submitted v1.0 of the ShareRing app to the Google Play, Samsung Galaxy, and Apple App stores.</p>



<p></p>



<p>This blog will help to detail what’s included in version 1.0 of the app, as well as give you a hint at what’s to come.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Before we get into the details, let’s get one thing out of the way. Staking and Swapping is NOT included in this version of the app. Our commitment to our corporate clients to release the app for eKYC and ShareRing Access required us to de-prioritise it for this release. Rest assured though, it will be added to the next version of the app within the next 6 weeks. I’m sure that you would all agree that ‘real world’ usage needed to take priority in this case.</p>



<p></p>



<p>What’s included in v1.0 of the app:</p>



  ShareRing ID sign up, which includes;  ID Card, Passport and Driver’s license scanning and checking for over 2500 ID types from around the world.  Face-match and liveness detection.  Document proof (digital hash) stored on the blockchain    



  eKYC sign-up, ID and document solutions for financial institutions.  



  ShareRing Vault, which includes  Storage and document proof of self-sovereign identity documents  Storage and document proof of Health Documents  Storage and document proof of address verification    



  ShareRing Access  For supported events and venues, you can gain express entry by scanning the ShareRing QR code at the entrance. We are currently piloting this and will roll it out in select locations over the coming months.  Along with ShareRing Access is the Web App that is available for venues and events to successfully verify identity, age, or health status of customers that enter.    



  SHR Wallet  This has limited functionality until staking and swapping is activated.    



  Document Issuance  One of the supporting apps for the ShareRing ecosystem is our Document Issuance app. This is a versatile app that’s used by document issuers such as the health centers, credit unions, etc. It allows them to scan and digitally sign any ‘verified at source’ documents that are added to your ShareRing Vault. A full explanation on ‘Verified at Source’, ‘Self Verified’, and ‘ShareRing Verified’ will be published in the coming weeks.    



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>What’s on our roadmap:</p>



<p>This list is in no particular order and may change based on external priorities, but here is a subset of the main features and products that we are adding over the coming months.</p>



  Offline Access – During our pilot tests of ShareRing Access we identified improvement opportunities for areas with low/no cellular coverage. Our solution is Offline Access. This provides the same level of functionality as the existing ShareRing Access, but will work without any cellular network.  



  Staking – Staking is complete and going through some final regression testing. There’s one small issue with how we’re displaying transaction history in the app, but the rest is working well.  



  Swapping – We have redesigned our swapping functionality to utilise smart contracts for the SHR/ERC20 swaps. This is expected to be ready for internal testing within the next couple of weeks. We will test and release it soon after.  



  ShareRing Payments – We have put a huge amount of work into our payment system, including the regulatory hurdles required to ensure we do this properly.  



  Accommodation – Our ShareRing Travel system moved into user acceptance testing (UAT) today. The next step after testing is complete, is to gain certification from Rakuten Travel Exchange, before launching in Q4 of this year. We will add the express check-in functionality after the initial accommodation rollout. This will be activated in parallel to a number of travel destinations opening for business.  



  Smart Contracts for ShareLedger – When we activate the smart contracts module on ShareLedger, anyone will be able to build their own DAO that takes advantage of the protocols that we have built for identity, access, ShareRing Vault, NFT’s, or DeFi.  



  Dependants – ShareRing Vault will be updated to allow you to add any dependents (such as children) to your vault. This will be beneficial for Visa applications, Travel bookings, Event access, and many other areas.  



  Activities – Through our partnership with a world’s major activities provider, we will be allowing you to book activities, such as cooking classes, tours, fishing trips, etc through the ShareRing App.  



  QR Code Issuance – A completely offline ShareRing ID experience for people without smartphones.  



  eKYC v2.0 – An enhanced KYC experience with expanded functionality for insurance companies and financial institutions.  



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>We are very excited and proud of this initial release of the ShareRing App, and we look forward to welcoming you on our journey as we build out our ecosystem.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This episode features a live recording of an <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/280323809/">Indicio community event</a>. </p>
<p>Digital Wallets are taking off! OS operators such as Apple are starting to support open standards for digital credentials (<a href="https://spec.smarthealth.cards/">here</a>). Technology disruptors (like the companies represented in this episode) are taking wallet solutions to market (<a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">here</a>).</p>
<p>This objective of this discussion is not to take a deep dive from a technical perspective, but more from an adoption standpoint.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This image was taken from a presentation on Digital Trust. If you’re looking for a better framing on SSI and Digital Trust, we wrote an article to hopefully help you better articulate it <a href="https://northernblock.io/introduction-to-digital-trust/">right here</a>.</p>
<p>About Episode</p>
 
 
 An introduction to SSI and the role of Digital Wallets 
 
 
 How does one go about building digital wallets? (UX and various other considerations) 
 
 
 What are some promising Use Cases for Digital Wallets

 Distributed Agency, Distributed Care <p>This piece was authored by a member of the Dark Matter Labs team based in the UK as part of the #BeyondtheRules project and, as such, is written in British English and has particular references to contexts in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>This blog was written in September 2021 and reflects our learning at that&nbsp;time.</p> Our Context <p>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs works to accelerate societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and interconnectedness. We focus on the dark matter — the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the world around us, from policy and regulation to finance and data, governance and democratic participation, organisational culture and identity. What we seek to build in the wider world we look to create at a smaller scale in how we organise together.</p><p>Our context as an organisation, and from which the learning that we share here is anchored, is largely defined by&nbsp;being:</p>  A platform for shared&nbsp;missions  Focused on discovery and&nbsp;learning  International with a planetary view  Primarily virtual  Evolving constantly  <p>See <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">blog 1</a> in this series for more information on our context and current structure.</p><p>A distribution of agency is a defining feature of how we organise and this blog aims to explore that in detail. When I use the term ‘agency’ here I mean the distribution of power and of autonomy and also the correlating responsibility, accountability and risk-holding that sit alongside them (for a deeper exploration on these elements and how they sit alongside each other see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-balanced-governance-and-behaving-well-everywhere-every-day-5aa852b4843e">this blog</a>). We will&nbsp;cover:</p>  Our system of self-management  Legal and financial risk&nbsp;holding  Accountability  Decision-making and community organising  The relevance of&nbsp;pay  <p>We have found that a system of distributed agency unchecked can also have a propensity to compound existing inequalities in a system (and/or create potential harm), and we look to counteract this with a platform of deep care, security and safety that underpins our work together. We will explore what this looks like in the areas&nbsp;of:</p>  Care as a foundation for our&nbsp;work  Self-management of time and minimum&nbsp;rest  Distributed acts of&nbsp;care  Training and Structural support  Clean feedback   Self-management <p>DML as a self-managed organism. For us this means that each of us takes responsibility for our agency in the system — our agency is not predetermined by a position or&nbsp;‘rank’.</p><p>When it comes to our roles and responsibilities, these are not our job ‘title’ but more like a hand of cards that we hold at any time and that regularly may change (see more on this in blog 2 to this series). We can choose to change these, whilst we ensure that the responsibilities are handed over to someone who is also happy to take them&nbsp;on.</p><p>The scope of each of our work varies per person — some may be focusing on the scope of a project, some on a series of projects, some at the scope of a mission and some at the scope of the whole organism of DM. As such, we do not consider that there is no hierarchy, but rather a dynamic hierarchy that is dependent on what makes sense for individuals and the wider system at any given&nbsp;time.</p><p>We each have the autonomy to decide how a piece of work that we hold/steward is done (whatever its scope) within the parameters of the shared mission that we have, the agreements that we make to each other and any contractual terms. We all hold/steward different pieces of work with a range of scope and negotiate with each other how they fit together.</p><p>Some hold clearer roles to drive forward improvements to how our shared operational system works and are more likely to lead this, although anyone can craft and propose changes/directions into our shared system (and shift into these&nbsp;roles).</p><p>High autonomy and high choice are balanced with the responsibility that each of us hold for what we propose and accountability for our work. This means — among many things — taking on workload, exposing our reputations, showing up when things go wrong, explaining our decisions, accepting failures. Genuinely stepping into this agency requires each of us to show up and face reality head-on, and that can be emotionally difficult and mentally demanding, compared to having a bounded responsibility within a system where blame can be passed up the chain. We notice that this way can also be much more effective, rewarding and liberating.</p><p>Our bandwidth to take on the emotionally and/or mentally demanding aspects of high agency is naturally influenced by the situations that we are each in at that time and the structural conditions that affect them. We have learned that choice alone as a system to determine personal agency is one that readily compounds existing structural and personal inequalities and privileges.</p><p>At an organisational level, we cannot redress the structural impact of a socioeconomic system. We can, however, aim to embed our shared platform within a culture of deep care, which nourishes people to step into their full agency (whatever that means to them, including the boundaries they put to that) and seeks to counteract underlying imbalances.</p> Legal and financial risk&nbsp;holding <p>A system cannot thrive where power and autonomy are distributed but risk-holding is concentrated. And yet, when it comes to legal and financial risk-holding, our methods to distribute this are heavily constrained by the external rules of the systems that we sit in, such&nbsp;as:</p>  The legal companies through which we operate require Directors who take on the legal responsibilities of company records and accounts, with the risk of being fined, prosecuted or disqualified if not completed fully or correctly.  Some banking systems will only allow banking access for companies with Persons of Significant Control  Loans may require signatories to agree to take on the financial liabilities of the&nbsp;lending  <p>In traditional hierarchies, the people holding these risks normally also have the decision-making power to control the company, and they are both responsible and accountable for the company&nbsp;risks.</p><p>We seek to fully comply with the rules of the system whilst also being true to the principles of how we organise. We currently organise around this as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Directorships are held by ‘legal stewards’ who hold the official risks of a DM company (or companies, when more than one) as one of their roles. They have the minimum powers that they need to fulfil their legal duties as Directors, such as to veto any large decision that might expose them personally to significant risk as Directors or contradict their duties (we have not yet faced such a scenario but might one day), without playing a control function for the&nbsp;company.  Day-to-day decision-making is held by people across the ecosystem, and de facto risk holding is shared as much as possible to not create unnecessary risk liabilities on the legal stewards.  <p>Let’s take the example of financial cash flow risk to illustrate what this looks like in practice. Normally in a small not-for-profit the executive team might make a plan in the case of cash flow risk, and it’s not uncommon for them to temporarily forfeit payments if it were needed during a cash flow crisis to ensure that others are paid. Distributed risk management at DM means that in a cash flow risk scenario:</p>  an approach and decisions for cash flow management are made by a finance group who can decide on behalf of the whole following sense-making with the full&nbsp;team  The shouldering of financial implications is distributed more widely across the system among those who nominate themselves to hold more&nbsp;risk  <p>For example, when we recently faced an issue following a large receivable falling overdue — impacting our payments for a number of weeks — the Finance Holder at DM called an (optional to attend) All-Hands meeting to lay-out the situation and our options to the whole team, and to invite shared approaches. On that occasion, a proposal was made, evolved live and collectively agreed upon, whereby an absolutely no pressure invitation was made to anyone who would be happy to provide a 0% interest loan for a short fixed period of time. By the end of the day, 6 loans were made for 3 weeks which brought all of our outgoing payments back on track. There was a lot of care in the specific details of how this was structured and communicated — including the emphasis on only offering where someone was comfortable to do so; the non-glorification of loan-making; the details of the loans and loan-makers kept anonymous. These loans were all fully repaid on banking the overdue receivable invoice and the feedback from the teams across DM around this process was notably positive.</p> Accountability <p>As explored by Ebrahim and Weisband in Global Accountabilities: Participation, Pluralism, and Public Ethics (2007), in a ‘principal-agent’ view of accountability, accountability involves individuals or groups reporting to a recognised authority(ies) to justify their behaviour, be scrutinised, and the possibility for a penalty to be imposed. Its core components include transparency, justification, compliance and sanctions, with the capacity for sanctions being an important part of retributive justice. This approach requires there to be an agreed relationship between power-wielders and those holding them accountable, and a shared understanding of the standards of behaviour that they are accountable to.</p><p>Without a hierarchical vertical structure of power in a system, the embedded binaries of power-wielder and accountability-holder make less sense. When our work is based on relationships of care, the capacity for punitive retribution becomes much less of a&nbsp;concern.</p><p>We are starting to put together a draft thesis on what accountability means for us, although we still have much more work to do on this. So far, we recognise that our accountability sits at various&nbsp;layers:</p>  Accountability to ourselves (what we choose to commit our time to, our families, needs, passions)  Accountability to each other (in caring for each other and distributing governance fairly between us and following up on things that we committed to)  Accountability to our shared missions (to whether the way we set our intention and spend our time brings us collectively towards the missions that we&nbsp;share)  Accountability to the living world (to the choices that we make and how these affect the human and non-human world that we are in balance&nbsp;with)  Accountability to future generations (to the human and non-human populations of the future who are impacted by the choices that we make&nbsp;now)  <p>These show up in many different ways:</p>  Part of the embedded training for the team is around setting your personal boundaries and learning to hold them, holding yourself accountable to your needs. People at DM have manifested this in various ways such as personal and self-declared time tracking followed by an analysis of time spent which is declared to the&nbsp;team.  Our clean feedback processes allow us to raise issues of accountability to each other directly, with&nbsp;care.  We are each accountable for our decisions and approaches, and Working Out Loud (see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dml-2-4-ef87a1e466c">blog 2</a> on this) helps to make that transparent  Where there are ongoing issues with accountability from someone in the team that is beyond a 1:1 relationship, a team can be invited to support a process of more structured wider feedback to explore together where a misalignment lies.  Our projects have project-holders, contract holders and budget holders who are considering deadlines, taking care that we meet terms and keeping on track financially. These are roles that people hold (for now), not their identity or their rank. They can hand these responsibilities over or evolve them, according to what makes the most sense for them and the system. They hold any accountability needs of partners, funders and others with whom we work around our shared performance and compliance, where&nbsp;needed.  Our legal stewards hold accountability for the overall progress of each respective company.  <p>Being self-managed does not mean ignoring accountability or risk in a system. Rather, accountabilities and risks align to the scope of responsibility, power and autonomy in our roles (with higher or lower degrees in different roles); and that these roles are cards that we hold at any given time, and can&nbsp;change.</p><p>We still have a lot of work to reimagine what accountability means for us in detail, and to embed more deeply into our work. We hope to bring in place intentional structures and processes for this in the coming 6&nbsp;months.</p> Decision-making &amp; community organising <p>Making decisions in a self-managed organism might sound like one of the trickier areas to get right, and in some ways it is (particularly when this way of working is less familiar), and in other ways it can also be very&nbsp;natural.</p><p>It’s a bit like making decisions within a family setting wherein the person who — say — handles the cleaning wouldn’t ask for advice or permission each time they clean a surface, although they might check for objections before they throw paperwork in the bin, and if they wanted to hire a cleaner there would be a discussion together before going ahead, weighing up the options and finding the best approach. These options of advice, consent, co-sensing &amp; consensus play out organisationally in similar ways. Most day-to-day decisions (clean a surface) with relatively minor implications are taken by the people closest to the questions — that might mean one person takes a decision, or that they take advice from others close to the question and then make a decision. They would declare these decisions if they are significant, and others would have the chance to object if they expressly disagree. Feedback can also be given through the clean feedback method so that issues or disagreements can be discussed directly.</p><p>Decisions with a medium level of impact would start involving more of a community organising approach.</p><p>For example, the decision of setting up a new international payroll system affects many people and affects our shared finances. We start by researching the options, speaking to providers, finding out services that they do, don’t provide, costs, ease of use, process etc. This allows us to gather an overview of the options available and their potential impacts. We then speak to the people that those options might impact (those holding responsibility for parts of the delivery, or responsible for finances who would need to factor in costs) and gather their insights. We then find out how many people it would impact and in what ways — reaching out to those individuals (via a survey, or directly, as appropriate). We gather all of this information together and work out options in terms of an approach — we would weigh these up against the kind of world that we want to bring into being. We would then invite all of those affected/all interested or the whole team and present all of the findings. At this point, depending on the specifics, we might use one of a few approaches:</p>  Propose an approach using a process such as Percolab’s <a href="https://medium.com/percolab-droplets/generative-decision-making-process-cf0b131c5ac4">Generative Decision-Making</a>, if there were a clear favourable option on the table,&nbsp;or  Ask for opinions across a sliding spectrum, with comments, if there is not an obvious best approach. We would ask people about their fields of tolerance to find where the least contested option&nbsp;is.  <p>This would either give us a way forward (in the former) or a shared direction (in the latter) that the responsibility-holder can take forward to implement.</p><p>Decisions that are more complex and affect us all more deeply normally involve a co-sensing approach. This might involve facilitated discussions from space holders to explore the topic in detail, wherein we can get a better feeling of the question by listening to different perspectives to it, hearing how different people experience it, and exploring all its connections together so that we can get a shared sense of the interconnectivity of the question. At that point we may be able to progress with a process of consent rather than consensus — rarely do we feel that we need to all agree on what the best decision is, as long as it is within all of our realms of tolerance. However, in some cases where people would be deeply affected (a change in purpose, say) we would agree by consensus.</p><p>Making these methods clear and legible to assist people to navigate DM is work that we still need to&nbsp;execute.</p> The relevance of&nbsp;pay <p>Our pay formula — decoupled from rank or role (see more on this in blog 1 to this series) — is an important foundation for our system of self-management, distributed decision-making and moving roles. It means that people can genuinely choose and agree upon their roles, projects and responsibilities in any given scenario based on what makes the most sense, without it having an impact on their pay. This also invites them to step back (and, sometimes, get out the way of others) in decisions and situations when they might not be closest to the problem, without it creating a perceived negative implication to pay, prospects, roles etc. It frees all of us to take up less space as much as it does&nbsp;more.</p><p>Despite various flaws in its current form, it inherently incentivises us to collaborate, care and be effective rather than to compete for positions or resources and thus is an important foundation for this way of&nbsp;working.</p> A platform of&nbsp;care <p>When we recognise that people are creative, caring beings who want to commit their time to things they care about and do so in a way that improves our shared conditions, our preoccupation comes not with how we can control them but how we can care for them in a way that enables them to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>This might&nbsp;mean:</p>  Structurally creating space for the other commitments that are important to each of us (see e.g. self-management of&nbsp;time)  Inviting each other to improve and grow, particularly where we might have habits or behaviours that can cause harm (see e.g. clean feedback)  Recognising that each of us has barriers, traumas, enablers in our routes to this, and may need care as we work through them (see e.g. training and structural support)  ‘Seeing’ each other and the labour and care that we put into this (See e.g. clean feedback)  <p>Our work at DM is uncertain and complex and invites us to think daily about some of the existential questions that we face. It invites us to inspect what influences how we show up, such as what triggers us in our work relationships and where those triggers might stem&nbsp;from.</p><p>This might be coupled with challenging situations in other areas of our lives, and not forgetting the last 20 months amid a pandemic, which for many of us has had huge implications including on mental&nbsp;health.</p><p>If there is anything important in how we show up together, it’s the care, understanding, mutual support and realness with how we do&nbsp;it.</p> Self-management of time and minimum&nbsp;rest <p>The ability for each of us to manage our own time — including our working schedules and also our time off — is a foundation part of&nbsp;this.</p>  Our holiday policy is currently structured with a minimum holiday per year and no maximum. It invites each of us to take the rest that we need and to structure it in ways that work for&nbsp;us  Each of us is able to set our working schedule according to what we need to be effective (there are no ‘core mandatory hours’, for example, and people might fluctuate between 9–5, ‘oxford hours’ with a long afternoon break, a mix of day and night working, or indeed whatever hours work for them, ensuring it is viable for their work and&nbsp;teams)  <p>This invites us to create a balance in our lives that enables our creativity and ensures that we have rest. It also fundamentally recognises that we are all caring and decent adults who know best what we need and who want to do well by each&nbsp;other.</p><p>This is certainly evident from how this policy works in practice, Despite an unlimited holiday policy, our main collective challenge is in people take the minimum amount of time off to properly&nbsp;rest.</p><p>Since autonomy is also deeply linked to responsibility, for many people at DM their commitment and care to the missions mean that taking time off can seem to be at the cost of not doing work to the quality that we want to, or leaving colleagues with high workloads. Cultural norms also play a role in the rest we take, where some cultures embrace long periods rest and others revere ongoing&nbsp;work.</p><p>Active peer encouragement helps but we have found is not enough to create equity in rest, and we are currently exploring measures to ensure that enough rest can be a genuine option for everyone at DM, such as by bringing in two periods (in summer and winter) a year where we actively discourage work to be scheduled so that the team can more easily plan holidays, and rewording of the policy so that the invitation to take holiday particularly speaks to people who have not been accustomed to this as a&nbsp;norm.</p> Distributed acts of&nbsp;care <p>As a group of people who generally recognise the importance of care for each other, people who are struggling are likely to be spotted and supported by those who interact most with them. This support might mean helping them to take time off, sending thoughtful gifts or offering to talk through matters or distribute workloads. We recently decided collectively to create a common pool care pot of funds, which everyone can access to use to spend on other team members whenever they spot someone needing&nbsp;support.</p><p>These acts are valuable and important, although alone do not address the deeper care and structural support that we may&nbsp;need.</p> Training and Structural support <p>A year ago we brought on a specialist coach and trainer who provides a range of training and group coaching around some of the key capabilities for self-management and agile teams. This includes:</p>  Clean language and clean&nbsp;feedback  Learning from&nbsp;emotions  Creating and holding boundaries/limits  Time management  Choosing and noticing attention  <p>This training has been fundamental in helping us as a group of individuals to practice some of the behaviours and habits that come with a self-managed and agile way of working, particularly among many of us who may have worked in very different structures.</p><p>We have noticed that our shared spaces of reflection (weekly optional meetings for shared reflection) quite often hold space where people surface some of the deeper personal experiences or organisational dynamics they see and/or are sat with. Yet, we are currently lacking the triage and follow up support to link what people experience to group process work, coaching, therapy, practical needs or funding for the above for them to directly access this. We are currently putting an approach in place to this, and in August we signed off together a budget that will fund some of this provision. We welcome examples of how others have found ways to approach this as we work out how to structure this&nbsp;well.</p> Clean Feedback Screenshot of our shared Notion page with Clean Feedback&nbsp;guidance<p>Without managers, we still need processes for feedback and recognition. Providing clean feedback to each other — particularly after a potential misunderstanding or misalignment — becomes of the most caring acts that we can&nbsp;do.</p><p>Following Caitlin Walker’s conception of clean feedback in her book “From Contempt to Curiosity”, the biggest difference between regular and clean feedback is that the latter is designed/ prompted in a way that helps separate out what actually happened from what you are making up about that event and from the impact it is having. It also enables you to be specific in your feedback and put the growth of the receiver&nbsp;first.</p><p>This is made possible through a very simple structure for your feedback: 1. Evidence — what you saw or heard 2. Inference — the meaning you made of what you saw or heard 3. Impact — the effect it had on a situation or on&nbsp;you</p><p>We follow Brene Brown’s (from Dare to Lead) 10 signs of being in the right headspace to give feedback to know when the time is&nbsp;right.</p><p>Alongside the training courses that are run to help us to learn how to use this technique:</p>  We have a Clean Feedback page that details the intention, process and tools for&nbsp;it  There is a group of people who are available to help pairs or groups to use this technique with each other if they need additional support  <p>The act of sitting with a colleague in a space of respect and inviting them to improve is truly powerful, and can also be emotionally demanding. Clean feedback allows us to make time to recognise and truly see each other, our intentions, our labour and effort, even when the reason for the conversation may have been conflict.

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the seventh interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/hackteen">Hamzat</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English Community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I heard about Ontology in the early days from online blockchain communities. I subscribed to the Ontology newsletter and the rest is&nbsp;history.</p><p>What attracted me to the project was its novel approach to making digital identity easy to prevent data theft, abuse etc., even before news about GDPR and Cambridge Analytica surfaced. So, the foresight of the team alone was sufficient to make me want to get involved.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>Ontology was of interest to me owing to its novel consensus approach, solution to data theft and privacy and lastly, building a future proof digital identity framework that could stand the test of time. Helping others to understand Ontology’s mission and vision is the reason I became a supporter and champion of its&nbsp;brand.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>Being able to communicate or share information about developments in the Ontology ecosystem, helping people learn about Ontology, solving their issues (<a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, staking, and general knowledge) while providing feedback are my key roles as a Harbinger. My favorite part is the ability to help others and seeing them&nbsp;grow.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Ontology has a very big mission and vision to accomplish as regards building a future proof digital identity framework that can stand the test of time. Ontology achieving this milestone and more is the reason I am supporting the&nbsp;project.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Ontology has created a niche for itself, being a fairly distributed token project with a novel consensus mechanism. Aside from that, Ontology has support for over 30 languages/local communities working together with the mission of building a truly future proof decentralized identity framework.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>My key communication channels for engagement are Telegram and Twitter. Though Ontology has a community and sub-communities with respect to different languages on Telegram, Reddit, Discord, YouTube, WeChat, and Kakao. Overall, <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> makes it easy to communicate and manage group activities as well as resolve issues. I would like Ontology to do more Twitter threads, which will call for engagement and feedback when explaining newly launched products, integration or implementation.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>The community being unapologetic, ready to help, also most are selfless. That alone is a memorable moment for the community. Lastly, the Ontology team is very innovative. My advice to people wanting to become a Harbinger is that they should be selfless and helpful to&nbsp;others.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Educational, unique and innovative.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>Ontology, as a blockchain startup, has grown over the years and has achieved many important milestones and partnerships with other blockchains. Worth mentioning, is the provision of their novel DID protocol for use on Binance Smart Chain and also the Welcome Home app for&nbsp;Daimler.</p><p>There is room for improvement in the area of marketing and communication. We have a good product to showcase but marketing is important for widespread acceptance and adoption. Twitter threads can help explain new products, updates, implementations or integrations, and feedback from the community, which positively impacts the project both short and medium long&nbsp;term.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>As stated above, integration with Binance Smart Chain is a huge one that could open doors with other projects to integrate Ontology’s decentralized identity framework. So, the community understanding Ontology’s mission and vision is very important, as it will help in educating others and thereby impacting their lives in a positive&nbsp;way.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco</a> has been trailblazing since 2012, when we first published <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">our manifesto</a> and committed to empower people to capture, analyse and benefit from their personal data.&nbsp;This commitment hasn’t wavered over the years. The last 18 months have seen the Meeco team double by growing our Australian, Belgium and London offices. &nbsp;




 




We secured new partnerships in Australia with <a href="https://mylifecapsule.com/">My Life Capsule</a> and in Europe with <a href="https://heder.be/">Heder</a>, creating <a href="https://www.miks-it.com/">mIKs-it</a>, the safe multimedia app for children. Our <a href="https://www.meeco.me/#international-recognition">multiple awards</a> have validated our mission and motivated us to continue delivering empowering tools for the data challenges of today.&nbsp;




 




In addition to our other enterprise partners, our recent work with <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/">eftpos</a> and <a href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera Hashgraph</a> has resulted in us being selected as a <a href="https://www.fintechaustralia.org.au/">FinTech Australia</a> <a href="https://blog.meeco.me/meeco-announced-as-finnies-2021-finalist/">Finnies finalist in the “Excellence in Blockchain/Distributed Ledger” category</a>.&nbsp;




 




Our growth together with our commitment to Privacy by Design and Security&nbsp;by&nbsp;Design reinforced the&nbsp;opportunity to embed security into every process across the business.&nbsp;




 




We are delighted to announce that after months of preparation we have been granted ISO 27001:2013 certification. We sat down with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-f-campbell/">Neil Campbell</a>, Meeco’s Head of Security and Compliance to get a bird’s eye view of the journey.&nbsp;




 





 What is ISO 27001? 




ISO 27001 is the leading international standard for information security, published by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).




 









 





 What is the importance of achieving ISO 27001 certification? 




ISO 27001:2013 provides the framework for a best practice Information Security Management System (ISMS). The importance of this to any organisation is that it provides an independent assessment of the organisation’s security practices, and ensures that their policies, procedures and KPIs are appropriate to deliver high levels of security in all aspects of operations and management.&nbsp;




 




The power and utility of Meeco’s products and services are dependent on customers being able to trust that their data is securely held, and that the services underpinning the product are delivered based on Security by Design principles. Meeco’s ISO 27001 certificate is a clear indication that our security policies and processes meet the stringent levels demanded by the standard across all aspects of our operations. This is what our customers and partners should expect from an organisation that puts security at the heart of its product design and operations.&nbsp;




 





 What did the process entail? 




The preparation for Meeco’s ISO 27001 certification audit took&nbsp;months of internal planning. This was driven by our desire to ensure that security principles and processes were established and embedded into the DNA of the organisation; and not simply to gain a certificate. This meant huge collaboration between different internal departments such as the Security Team, Engineering Team and Product Team. As a result of our combined effort, we achieved ISO 27001 certification at first attempt, without any non-compliant items to address.&nbsp;




 









 What does this mean for Meeco going forward? 




Meeco has set a high bar in its achievement of ISO 27001 certification, but the work doesn’t stop there. Meeco has a program of continuous improvement in its security practices and procedures to make sure that we are always vigilant in delivering the best outcomes for our customers and partners.&nbsp;




 




These efforts support our robust technology offer: a mature and enterprise-ready suite of products backed by solid risk management practices, security and code management.&nbsp;




 




This is an important milestone for Meeco and the partners we serve and support, made possible by the team’s commitment to be data and security pioneers. The ISO 27001 accreditation ensures that&nbsp;our clients and partners also benefit from strong protection for all their data and intellectual property: a sound infrastructure for trusted personal data ecosystems. &nbsp;

<p>This week’s release brings few developer-facing features, but it’s a big one in terms of performance. Holochain v0.0.107 is set to unleash an explosion of progress for the HoloPort Alpha Program.</p> V0.0.107 is for Holo hosting <p>Even though we’ve released a number of Holochain versions with plenty of features and fixes, the version on the HoloPorts is over three months old. That’s mainly because we <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-gets-some-parts-upgrades/#lmdb-to-sqlite-the-road-to-infinite-scalability">switched to a new database engine called SQLite</a>. This change held long-term promise for making Holochain infinitely scalable via sharding, but in the short term performance was much <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-94-when-signup-goes-wrong/">slower</a> than the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/a-new-holochain-developer-release/#seen-in-dev-team-land-upcoming-initiatives">previous database engine, LMDB</a>. The Holo team decided it would make an unacceptable experience for Elemental Chat testers, so they decided to stay with the LMDB version until the SQLite version could match its speed.</p><p>I’m excited to share that the SQLite version is now even faster, more efficient, more stable, and more reliable than the LMDB version. The dev team has recently made optimisations and bug fixes to the database layer and gossiping, and data is now getting stored and gossiped faster, while HoloPorts can comfortably host more users per machine.</p><blockquote>“I'm also getting really good results. We easily pass LMDB parity targets.”<br>— Alastair Ong, Holo engineer, after running Elemental Chat stress tests on Holochain v0.0.107</blockquote><p>After chatting with Alastair, I learned that <a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_/status/1437908801135554561">every performance benchmark has been surpassed</a>: some are slightly better, while others are orders of magnitude better. One Elemental Chat benchmark, designed to measure the time it took for all agents to reach consistency, went from a hefty 10.23 minutes to a tiny 36 seconds (a 17× improvement). These performance gains come with significantly reduced resource consumption; another test was able to host seven times more agents on the same hardware.</p><p>(And we suspect that things are even better than that — perhaps up to 100× better for some metrics. The main bottleneck now appears to be our <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">testing framework</a>, not Holochain itself.)</p><p>Now that the Holo team can move to this version, they’ll update Elemental Chat and the Holo suite of apps to take advantage of it. Service Logger, Holo Hosting App, HoloFuel, the HoloPort registration flow, and the client/host connection components will get features and fixes that have been planned for a while.</p><p>And it also means we can start inviting more hosts and Elemental Chat testers to participate — which paves the way for the <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">HoloPort Alpha Program</a>! If you’re a HoloPort owner, <a href="https://forum.holo.host/t/holoport-alpha-program-registration-general-info/3687">here are the instructions</a> for registering in the program.</p> v0.0.107 Is for the Dev Camp <p>You may have <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-camp-8-starts-in-two-weeks/#dev-camp-8-huge-turnout-exciting-curriculum">heard the news</a> that the community-led Dev Camp 8 starts next week. In order to support the Dev Camp, we wanted a fairly stable version of Holochain so that participants have a good experience. This release comes after a lot of improvements, so we’re confident that it’s a good baseline for them to start building on.</p><p>Of course, there will be weekly Holochain releases throughout the Dev Camp, so it’ll keep getting more solid. We intend to keep updating participants about breaking changes and new features</p> Holochain v0.0.107 changelog   Relaxed chain top ordering properly merged (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/985">#985</a>): This feature was scheduled for last release, but an incomplete merge caused it to be non-functional.  Only one agent full-sync (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/978">#978</a>): This interim fix allows a conductor hosting multiple agents in the same DHT (such as a Holo host) to only involve one of their agents in DHT syncing, which reduces gossip traffic dramatically in full-sync DHTs. This feature is behind the configuration parameter <code>network.tuning_params.gossip_single_storage_arc_per_space</code>, and is disabled by default. Native Holochain installations are unlikely to benefit from it. (Holo hosts, on the other hand, see up to a 50× increase in the number of cells they can comfortably handle.)  Fix SQLite connection parameters (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/978">#978</a>): These fixes resulted in big speedups for HDD-based HoloPorts and should be helpful for native Holochain installations too. As part of these fixes, you can tune the durability of writes with the configuration parameter <code>db_sync_mode</code>, which mirrors SQLite’s <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous"><code>synchronous</code></a> flag.  Web happ bundle helpers (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/991">#991</a>): These internal fixes help the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a> manage installed hApps more easily.   Dev Camp excitement building <p>Well, even though I’m not a developer (at least not anymore), I thought I might help out with Dev Camp. So I’ve been privileged to listen to the back-room conversations of the organisers and support team, and they’re getting really excited! With 1500 applicants, it’s been a bit overwhelming, but they’ve changed the format in ways that will support everyone better.</p><p>The Holochain community stretches the globe, so it’s appropriate that the Dev Camp is shifting to support people who aren’t in the ideal time zone. Although the sessions will favour people in the Europe, Middle East, and African time zones, they’ll be recorded, and there will also be live support sessions for the Americas and Asia-Pacific. And there will also be a dedicated Discord server for anytime conversation — both among participants, and from support volunteers. And lastly, the Dev Camp section of the forum will be there for more lengthy discussions.</p><p>The app you’ll be building, called Tragedy of the Holocommons, is a turn-based game in which players try to consume natural resources cooperatively without causing them to collapse. It will exercise and grow your understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual consistency</a> (a very important concept in hApp design), <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/6_crud_actions/">CRUD chains</a>, <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/5_links_anchors/">links, anchors</a>, <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/">signals</a> and more in a format that lets you learn with your peers and gain wisdom from experienced developers.</p><p>Each Dev Camp is hosted by a slightly different team of community members. It takes a lot of work, a lot of care and time, to organise something this big, and they're doing it all for free. It’s truly a labour of love, and I want to thank the current team Nastasia, Alex, Tim, Guillem, Hedayat, Lily, Peter, Tats, Sid, and the many other contributors for everything they’re doing.</p> Still time to register! <p>But it starts next week, so do hurry! It’s free, the curriculum sounds really fun, and it’s got a great crew of leaders, facilitators, teachers, and mentors. It’ll last six weeks (with a break in the middle), with weekly live sessions for Europe time zones and support sessions for Asia-Pacific and the Americas. There’ll also be a Discord server where you can talk with participants and the support team any time you like. Now <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">go and sign up</a>!</p> Holochain In Action: Composability in the real world <p>During today’s AMA, the <a href="https://youtu.be/G9Q05C-Gv6A?t=2676">conversation turned to composability</a>. The developers among you are familiar with that term, but for those of you who aren’t, it means “the ability to easily glue chunks of software together to make new things”.</p><p>Why do we care about this? Highly composable software modules, which try to do only one thing and do it well, can unleash an explosion of creativity among the developers who find them and start playing with them.</p><p>It sounds like a good way to build software, doesn’t it? We think so too, and so do many of the developers who build with Holochain.</p><blockquote>“The composability of a Holochain application is a very fundamental thing about it, so [during Dev Camp] we will cover the architectural things that follow from it: how do you build applications differently, knowing that they can be composed from so many different parts?”<br>—Nastasia Emelianova, Dev Camp 8 lead organiser</blockquote><blockquote>“This is one of those features or capacities of the framework that stands to accelerate what’s possible in app development. [Knowing that Dev Camp will get that out] in a way that’s intelligible [to developers] early enough so that they’re not doing it the hard way, but actually learning from the get-go, that you can lean on the expertise of others and the things that others built — that’s what I’m super excited about.”<br>—Mary Camacho, Holo executive director</blockquote><p>The latest Holochain In Action session, number 18, takes a deeper look at the <a href="https://github.com/eyss/elemental-chess">Elemental Chess</a> hApp. This time it looks at how the app is actually just a collection of composable modules — <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/profiles">profiles</a> to allow players to give themselves human-readable names, <a href="https://github.com/eyss/invitations">invitations</a> to allow them to invite each other to a game, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/elemental-chat/tree/develop/crates/joining_code">joining_code</a> to manage access to game spaces, and <a href="https://github.com/eyss/hc-turn-based-game">hc_turn_based_game</a> which is the engine that powers the games. On top of this are a zome that actually <a href="https://github.com/eyss/elemental-chess/tree/main/dna/zomes/chess">implements the rules of chess</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/eyss/elemental-chess/tree/main/ui">UI</a> that brings it all together.</p><p>Their exploration of hc_turn_based_game shows the power of composability — when all the heavy bits are already built, it becomes quick and easy to build a new game. They’ve already done tic-tac-toe, and I hear they’re working on Elemental Go (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">game</a>, not the <a href="https://golang.org/">programming language</a>) next.</p> Subscribe to blog posts by email! <p>Yeah, it’s kind of old-fashioned, but email newsletters are also kind of cool again. If you like reading the Dev Pulse and other Holochain blog columns, but don’t like having to check the blog all the time, make life easier on yourself — just subscribe. 😉 You’ll find the form below the comments section.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ralphkayden?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Ralph (Ravi) Kayden</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>The first on-chain decentralized exchange on Solana with permissioned access based on digital identity, Solrise DEX Pro, launches today.</p>



<p>LONDON and SAN FRANCISCO (Sept. 23, 2021) — <a href="https://solrise.finance/">Solrise Finance</a>, a Solana-based decentralized investment platform, and Civic Technologies, a leading innovator in digital identity solutions, have partnered to launch the first on-chain decentralized exchange on Solana with permissioned access based on digital identity. With growing regulatory scrutiny, a permissioned DEX sets the stage for more checks and balances within the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>“This is our way of bridging the world of institutions to DeFi without resorting to centralization, thanks to Civic,” said Filip Dragoslavic, Co-Founder of Solrise. “With Solana already being the most familiar DeFi ecosystem for traditional finance, we expect to become one of the primary hubs for institutions that wish to jump into the ecosystem.”</p>



<p>The new DEX, named Solrise DEX Pro, is built on Project Serum, an on-chain decentralized exchange that utilizes Solana’s throughput to offer a traditional order book experience. Civic Pass, Civic’s identity verification for DeFi or any dApp, and Solrise DEX Pro together create a permissioned environment that is more suitable for institutional players. Solrise DEX Pro will receive support from one of the largest digital asset firms in the space, Alameda Research, a key investor in the Solana ecosystem. The firm will be providing initial liquidity for the DEX as well as ongoing support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though permissionless access is considered a core principle of DeFi, the concept is often at odds with the goals of large capital allocators. These institutional investors would like to participate in the DeFi ecosystem, but must meet specific regulatory requirements in order to do so. The introduction of Solrise DEX Pro allows the Civic and Solrise teams to create a parallel ecosystem for institutional players, which are able to tap into the larger ecosystem of Solana on-chain liquidity, while staying in a familiar and permissioned environment. The platform is designed to complement existing permissionless DeFi structures rather than to replace them.</p>



<p>“A permissioned DEX paves the way for more participants in the DeFi ecosystem, including institutional investment,” said Chris Hart, CEO of Civic. “We’re building technology that thoughtfully protects individuals, their digital identities and our new financial systems. In Solrise, we’ve found a partner that shares our values and is working with us to set a higher standard that will ultimately benefit the broader industry.”</p>



<p>Civic provides a KYC solution, through Civic Pass, that a dApp provider can use as an input to their compliance program. Solrise DEX Pro uses Civic Pass to determine which participants meet their rigorous standards for verification prior to allowing them the ability to trade. From Solrise DEX Pro, users are guided to use Civic’s identity verification technology solution. Once the user has completed the Civic Pass screening process, Solrise DEX Pro will use the results of the screening to allow trades on the DEX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investors may use <a href="http://dex.solrise.finance">Solrise DEX Pro</a> immediately and also <a href="https://youtu.be/k5AbYcKlBKo">watch a demo</a>. The DEX is available to qualified users, which excludes users in the United States and sanctioned countries.</p>

 Interview Introduction <p>In the installment of the XTZ.News “Tezos Dev Series”, <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/">Gravity</a> offers a Q&amp;A with our Lead Engineer, François&nbsp;Guérin.</p><p>In this Q&amp;A, François shares his insights on the Tezos ecosystem and his experience developing Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol on&nbsp;Tezos.</p><p>François, can you start off with a short intro about yourself and your work at&nbsp;Gravity?</p><p>I’ve been the Lead Engineer at Gravity for the last two and a half years. After getting a Master’s degree in Math, Computer Science and Cryptography, my first experience with blockchain was as the Blockchain Tech Lead at Aubay France, where I implemented a private blockchain within a compliant document certification application.</p><p>Now, I manage the technical team at Gravity, which includes an IT Development Manager and Frontend Developer. At Gravity, we leverage blockchain technology to build trusted digital identities.</p><p>Users and small businesses leverage Gravity to safely share their personal data to access services such as financing, humanitarian aid, employment, and government services. International organizations and institutions use Gravity to efficiently collect verifiable data for improved service delivery, interoperability and&nbsp;impact.</p><p>As the Lead Developer, a big part of my role is to build Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol and blockchain architecture on&nbsp;Tezos.</p><p>I’ve also worked to deploy a decentralized credential repository and have Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol recognized by W3C standards as a <a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth/status/1382325329277124608?s=20">W3C decentralized identity verifiable credentials standards implementation</a>, ensuring that our protocol is more scalable, standardized and transparent.</p><p>Why are you interested in blockchain?</p><p>I like that with blockchain, there’s a direct application of my studies with this intersection of math, cryptography and computer&nbsp;science.</p><p>Blockchain is also a technology that’s still somewhat “new” for a lot of people, and it’s constantly evolving. I like that there’s a lot that you can learn from and bring to the blockchain tech community.</p><p>What has been your experience developing on&nbsp;Tezos?</p><p>With Tezos, it’s really exciting as an engineer to be challenged to innovate and develop in a space that’s always evolving and growing. I have experience with smart contract development using Michelson, the native language for smart contracts.</p><p>I’ve also had the chance to implement Gravity’s own version of the <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">Tezos DID Method</a> and <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">DID Manager</a>, which are key components of our decentralized identity protocol on&nbsp;Tezos.</p><p>A DID Method is the mechanism by which a particular type of decentralized identifier (DID) and its associated DID document are created, resolved, updated and deactivated.</p><p>The Tezos DID Method specifies how Tezos can be used for DID creation and management, compatible with the issuance, storage, and verification of Verifiable Credentials. DID Managers are smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain that implement the Tezos DID method’s specific on-chain functionalities.</p><p>What tools do you&nbsp;like?</p><p>Personally, I like spoons. No, but really, I like Taquito. Each Tezos node exposes an http API so we can access them. Taquito wraps an http client in order to access the http API in a more convenient way.</p><p>What do you find most valuable about developing on Tezos compared to other blockchains?</p><p>I think the Tezos ecosystem’s focus on formal verification of smart contracts and on-chain governance is extremely important. And compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin, Tezos is cheaper, more efficient and better for the environment. Because Tezos is a liquid-proof of stake protocol, it also consumes less resources than the proof of work of other blockchains.</p><p>For me, elliptic curves are something that you don’t typically see as a developer. As someone with a math background, I see the importance of having a strong cryptographic mechanism, which Tezos offers. Because the language is extremely cryptic, it also allows developers to have greater control over what we’re developing.</p><p>What Tezos projects are you most excited&nbsp;about?</p><p>Everything is interesting, but I really like TZIP-16! It’s powerful, and you can have what we call “views functions” attribute getters and meta-data. It’s not only the smart contract, you also have this upper layer that allows you to have off-chain data.</p><p>It was great when I worked to integrate Gravity with the TZIP-16 standard. With this <a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth/status/1374401827664400395?s=20">TZIP-16 implementation</a>, now we can provide off-chain metadata during the resolution of DID Documents from&nbsp;DIDs.</p><p>What do you hope to see from the Tezos ecosystem in the&nbsp;future?</p><p>If something like OpenTimestamps appears on Tezos, it would be really exciting!</p><p>What’s on the horizon for&nbsp;Gravity?</p><p>Most people know about Gravity’s work with organisations like the UNDP Turkey, the Kenya Red Cross and the DIGID Project consortium of NGOs to leverage decentralized identity for improved humanitarian action (check out the <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth">latest case studies on our Medium blog</a> to learn&nbsp;more).</p><p>As we continue to deepen our work in the humanitarian space, Gravity is also focusing on building out our supply chain finance (SCF) use case. In fact, we just <a href="https://youtu.be/AhiKZUa__5o">released a new video</a> to share how our digital ID solutions for supply chain financing work.</p><p>The idea is that our SCF solution builds trust among financial service providers, merchants and suppliers to unlock greater financing opportunities for all stakeholders.</p><p>Our tech team is really excited to be developing this solution, which uses decentralized ID and blockchain technology to enable small business merchants to create trusted financial identities using digital ID wallets that can give them access to affordable working capital and help them grow their businesses.</p><p>As an engineer, it’s awesome to keep building technology that can be leveraged for different real-world use cases and have such a big impact on people’s everyday&nbsp;lives!</p><p>To learn more about Gravity, follow us&nbsp;today!</p><p>Gravity is an ID2020-certified digital ID solution that empowers individuals, international organisations, and governments to create trusted decentralized identities that are private, portable, and persistent.</p><p>Our vision is to build human-centered digital ID solutions for easy, transparent, and secure data sharing for all people, anywhere in the world.

			<p>Luxembourg, 23rd September — Tokeny Solutions has announced the recognition of the T-REX protocol as ERC3643. The open source suite of smart contracts enables the issuance, management and transfer of permissioned tokens and is already used by large financial institutions to tokenize real-world assets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Ethereum community has officially merged the T-REX protocol in its GitHub repository of EIPs as ERC3643, making it an official standard for permissioned tokens. The ERC3643 allows actors in capital markets to interact with DeFi and the broader digital assets market in full compliance.</p>
<p>Amidst its continued explosion in growth this year, regulatory bodies around the world are getting ready to clamp down on the DeFi space. According to DeFi Pulse, in the first half of 2021, the total value locked (TVL) in the space by users grew from $25bn to $70bn, almost 180%. With this in mind, the space has now firmly caught the attention of regulators, and their focus will be turned to any actor not following regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>The ERC3643 allows actors wishing to interact with digital assets to ensure their activities remain compliant with global regulatory requirements. Since its inception in 2018, the standard has been used to issue security tokens worth over $8.5 across in 180+ jurisdictions via the T-REX platform. It does this through the use of permissioned tokens and digital identities, i.e. tokens that can only be sent or received based on the verified credentials of investors.</p>
<p>These tokens are fully controllable by their issuer and can be recovered even if the private key of the wallet holding them is lost, as the ownership of the assets is guaranteed by digital identity. In the same way, the ERC3643 can represent cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fiat currencies and NFTs to ensure compliance and ownership for both investors and responsible entities.</p>
<p>ERC3643 is compatible with the well-known ERC20 standard, enabling interoperability with any wallet of the Ethereum ecosystem. Also, it can be deployed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains, sidechains and Layer 2 solutions. Concerning security, the standard has been audited and confirmed by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky. Meanwhile, the ERC3643 is licensed under CC0 1.0, allowing developers and companies to contribute, copy, modify, distribute and develop the standard.</p>

		 
	 
    It’s been more than three years since we started the development of the T-REX security token protocol. We are extremely excited that the interface has been recognized as ERC3643 and merged into the EIP repository on GitHub. It is now the go-to standard for those issuing security tokens on public blockchains.  Joachim LebrunHead of Innovation at Tokeny Solutions       As the DeFi space continues to grow in both size and also maturity, the need for compliance will continue to rise in importance. Investors need protection, and issuers need to know who they are dealing with, and this is exactly what the ERC3643 does. We’re delighted to take this role in the industry, and continue to build the space’s credibility by allowing actors to remain compliant.  Luc FalempinCEO at Tokeny Solutions

<p>Introduction: The Amalgamation Of Democratic Governance Within AERGO: Pikkle’s Purpose And How It&nbsp;Works</p>Pikkle Is The First Blockchain Based Voting And Global Viewer Participation Platform Built On&nbsp;AERGO<p>It is evident that the democratic process hasn’t been perfected since its inception in ancient India and ancient Athens and it is time for that to finally change 2500 years since its inception. With innovations in immutable and transparent technology, brought on by the blockchain, we as a society have the opportunity to revolutionize the democratic process to promote an equitable environment for egalitarian populism. On the AERGO blockchain exists a voting platform that has been utilized by the Korean Broadcasters Association, an institution that has existed since 1974 with over 40 members of the organization nationwide in South Korea. Pikkle aims to solve numerous issues that plague the democratic process which include: cost inefficacy, voter targeting and fraudulent ballot counts. Pikkle has also identified a major dilemma that has only existed for the last 20 years, with the advent of social media where internet titans can easily manipulate and influence voter participation for the political intent of the platform itself. Pikkle aims to solve that stagnation of democracy and resuscitate the virtue of democratic egalitarianism.</p><p>Pikkle operates in a seamless manner where individuals who aren’t adept in the realm of blockchain can utilize this application without even realizing it operates on a blockchain. Pikkle collects users views and assists in their decision making through an app service instead of the traditional cold calling and electioneering paradigms that have persisted in the 20th century into the 21st. Through the immutable and transparent technology known as blockchain, in this case, AERGO, Pikkle aims to prevent stakeholders and platform titans from interfering or manipulating voters; its main vision is to create an equitable environment for all participants. This holds true to the value of its name “Pikkle” a direct amalgamation of the two works “Pick” and “People.”</p><p>Data Analysis: Pikkle In Action: AERGO’S Promotion Of The Democratic Process</p>Blockchain Is The Next Step In The Democratic Process And Through Analysis, We Can See This In Action With&nbsp;Pikkle<p>Democracy cannot truly be tested for equity without its fair share of data analyst on the basis of actual egalitarian populism through actual elections. At AERGO and Blocko, it is evident that these sister companies understood well that “so-called experts” were not making fair evaluations on the basis of social media cultural voting. It is evident that internet decisions are based on the cultural and political bias’s of the platform itself, and in recent years, many social media platforms, specifically Twitter and Facebook, have been accused of politically drawn motives in the last three American elections. Pikkle resolves such a notion with a dynamic solution: make it impossible for votes to be tampered with by recording all voting results in real-time on the AERGO public blockchain (not private) while simultaneously eliminating high costs of voting that can incur when consolidating government entities and ballot counters, promoting monetary and equitable efficiency. Now the main question is, although all of this sounds incredible, has it been used and proven effective as an application, and the simple answer is, yes, absolutely, numerous times within the Seoul Drama Awards hosted in South&nbsp;Korea.</p><p>Data Analysis Continued: The Ceremonial Events That Utilized Pikkle: The Democratic Voting Paradigm Of The&nbsp;Future</p>Did You Know That Pikkle Has Been Utilized In One Of The Most Prominent Media Events In Asia, Specifically South&nbsp;Korea?<p>Talk is cheap, and action creates value and vision, and Pikkle does just that. Pikkle was utilized in the Seoul Drama Awards that had a widespread affect throughout South Korea and into neighboring nations as well and it is important to highlight the importance and wide-spread participation that this event created. It is incumbent to realize the immense amount of votes that incurred that Pikkle has created in in just a short amount of time since its inception and you will be shocked with the amount of total votes that occurred with Pikkle. I’m sure you’re curious to see the numbers, and we will get there shortly I&nbsp;promise!</p><p>Pikkle is a world-wide phenomenon that isn’t exclusive to AERGO’S country of origin, South Korea and has garnered a foothold in not only East Asia, but South East Asia as well. The Seoul Drama Awards Korean Drama Award was a celebration of the Best Male and Female Actors, the Best Picture and the Best Theme Song. This was a South Korean event and proves the point that Pikkle has a dominant foothold in its home nation as a blockchain alternative to traditional voting mechanisms. The Korean Broadcasting Awards Popularity Award highlighted the Best Entertainment, Actor and Singer Category and the Korean Broadcasting Grand Prize For Best Picture surrounding Variety TV, Entertainment TV, Music Composition TV and Drama TV also utilized Pikkle! Pikkle was also utilized in the 48th Annual Korea Broadcasting Award Show! On the main website, you can see at the top that it specifies, through the utilization of Pikkle “Who will win the Popularity Award at the 48th Broadcasting Awards, vote right&nbsp;now.”</p><p>The 48th Annual Korea Broadcasting Award Show and the awards thereof are the most prestigious in the entirety of the entertainment industry in South Korea; did you know that the South Korean President himself directly announces the opening speech for the ceremony. This is a massive feat that cannot be overstated. This event has created a newly established popularity award section to be awarded by the general public beginning this year! BTS, also known as the BTS who has associated and worked with prominent DJs such as Steve Aoki. Fun fact, the BTS have sold over 20 million albums and is the best selling artist in Korean history and have been named in the “Top 100 People In The World.” They have been featured on TIME Magazine and have received numerous awards such as six American Music Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, 24 Golden Disk Awards, and nominations for a Grammy! BTS became the youngest ever recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit award from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture. BTS specified, that they were so moved by the new Popularity Award that they said “I heard that the Popularity Award was made for the first time at this awards ceremony, and I'm grateful that I'm the first winner.” Kim Sun-ho a Korean Actor best known for his work in the television series “Start-Up” and Kim So-hyun who became the youngest actress to achieve the most followers at her age, approximately 10.1 million followers were also presenters as well! Now how does Pikkle play into this prestigious event, well, Pikkle was used in the voting for the newly created Popularity Award and also, directly influenced its inception as a category of&nbsp;award!</p><p>Participation In The Democratic Process: The Totality Of Users Under&nbsp;Pikkle</p>Sometimes I Ponder, With The Immense Amount Of Numbers I Am About To Convey, How AERGO Hasn’t Shaken Hands With The Statue Of&nbsp;Liberty<p>Data analysis that was collected in this study on Pikkle’s awareness and utility was on the basis of regional information. The event had a staggering amount of users spanning five different nations from East and Southeast Asia. In totality, the Seoul Drama Awards Asia Star Award garnered over 2.5 million votes, basically 1 million more than the residential population of Manhattan. Of the tallied information, approximately 12,396 votes were cast from Taiwan, 2,700 from Indonesia, 136,443 from China, 18,735 from Japan and 2,323,077 million from Thailand. That is already 2,493,351 votes spanning five nations, an outstanding feat of regional importance! The Seoul Drama Awards Korean Drama Award garnered 625,269 votes for Best Male Actor, 834,630 votes for Best Female Actor, 583,212 votes for Best Picture and 1,627,728 votes for Best Theme Song. This event brought in 3,670,839 votes. To add to the prestige of these numbers, Pikkle was also utilized in the Korea Broadcasting Awards Show, specifically in the newly formed Popularity Award! The Korean Broadcasting Awards Popularity Award garnered 127,059 for Best Entertainer, 553,437 for Best Actor, and 1,118,006 in the Best Singer Category. Do the math my friends, that’s another 1,868,006 votes! Lastly, the Korean Broadcasting Awards For Best Picture brought in 3,418 votes for Variety TV, 2,594 for Entertainment TV, 1,177 for Music Composition TV, and 4,547 votes for Drama TV. A total of 11,736 votes were cast. TNow do the math, in total, Pikkle enabled 8,044,428 votes, a staggering feat!</p><p>The Affect On The AERGO Mainnet: No Problem At&nbsp;All!</p>The AERGO Blockchain Handled These Events Like A Champion!<p>During the event, a total sum of 2.7 million transactions occurred on AERGO during the voting period, which is the largest number of cases in which the AERGO blockchain has been utilized. This data proves that AERGO can withstand over 200,000 transactions a day and 3 events per second. In large-scale of things, specifically surrounding the real-time voting that occurred resulting from these events, where records are lost due to a large number of concurrent viewers, the AERGO mainnet blockchain had stable data processing without any loss whatsoever even in cases with up to 70,000 concurrent users, 16 awards at 4 awards. In the category voting, a total of 8 million votes were successfully counted, and the maximum number of votes in a single category was 2.32 million; the AERGO blockchain, through these events, has proven itself as an extremely capable and effective blockchain platform that can handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per-day. There was only a slight issue that occurred due to the nature of blockchain, not because of any issue with the AERGO mainnet itself. Resulting from the immutable feature of blockchain technology, when the initial organizers requirement to involve as many users as possible were set, they could not be changed in the middle of the voting process. The AERGO team understood this greatly, and intends on utilizing this process for future voting cases to emphasize the importance of setting initial requirements before utilization.</p><p>Conclusion: Pikkle, The Future Of Democratic Function</p>Pikkle Is A Blockchain Voting Platform That Will Only Expand Its Utility In The Future So Stay&nbsp;Tuned!<p>Based on the results of the utility of this application in accordance to the amount of votes that were cast, it is evident that Pikkle has solidified its ability as a unique and expansive blockchain voting platform that is here to stay, and will only grow substantially in the future. When it comes to applications, peak user experience is necessary to cause a “peak of interest” and there are many functions in the works for Pikkle. Pikkle is not going anywhere, Blocko isn’t going anywhere and neither is AERGO and these statistics prove that&nbsp;notion.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose! I am not a financial adviser and I am not responsible for any of your trades. It is incumbent that you always do your own research before investing in anything!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-great-democratic-solution-the-pikkle-statistic-22cb12ee3657">The Great Democratic Solution: The Pikkle Statistic</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Refinements to Ocean’s access control setup for enterprise-grade use cases. Permissions enable you to restrict access to publishing and consuming in your fork of Ocean&nbsp;Market</p> 1.1 Introduction <p>A large part of Ocean is about access control, of the decentralized variety. Ocean’s baseline approach is datatokens: a consumer can access a resource (e.g. a file) by redeeming 1.0 of the datatokens for that resource. Datatokens follow the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC20 standard</a>.</p><p>Enterprises and other users often need more precise ways to specify and manage access. Consider a medical data use case, where only an appropriately credentialed EU researcher can browse available medical datasets, or download the datasets themselves. Or what if one wanted to restrict to employees of a specific country, or consortium, region, or a combination thereof? Questions like this were often asked by our enterprise collaborators.</p><p>This means Ocean must address how to control access more precisely, at these two&nbsp;levels:</p>  Marketplace-level fine-grained permissions for browsing, publishing, etc within a marketplace frontend  Asset-level fine-grained permissions on consuming the asset&nbsp;itself  <p>Ocean now has support for&nbsp;both.</p><p>This article is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p>  The rest of Section 1 describes the high-level approaches for (1) and (2), and how they reconcile with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and datatokens  Section 2 gives details on marketplace-level fine-grained permissions  Section 3 gives details on asset-level fine-grained permissions  Section 4 concludes on fine-grained permissions   1.2. Market-Level Permissions: Overview <p>Back to the medical data use case: only an appropriately credentialed EU researcher can use the marketplace data. How to specify who can access&nbsp;it?</p><p>A first idea would be to have a list of all the “allowed” people. But this has problems. Imagine an enterprise publishing 1000 data assets, and for each asset having a list of all its employees. If someone new is hired, they’d have to update all 1000&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s a cleaner way. Access is based on a role, specified as a credential. E.g. “is an employee of x”. To continue the example above: new hires might get the credential when they join the company. Since they have the credential, they have permission. That’s it&nbsp;:) This credential-based approach is known in the data industry as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">Role-Based Access Control</a>&nbsp;(RBAC).</p><p>For market-level permissions, Ocean implements RBAC via an “RBAC server”. It implements restrictions at the user level, based on the user’s role (credentials).</p><p>The RBAC server is run &amp; controlled by the marketplace. Therefore permissions at this level are defined by the marketplace.</p> 1.3 Asset-Level Permissions: Overview <p>Let’s go back to the medical data use case, where only an appropriately credentialed EU researcher can download the datasets themselves.</p><p>How do we handle this? There’s a&nbsp;tension:</p>  Datatokens on their own aren’t enough — it would mean that anyone with 1.0 datatokens could access that&nbsp;data.  Yet we want to retain datatokens approach since they enable Ocean users to leverage existing crypto infrastructure to get data wallets, data exchanges, data unions, and more out-of-the-box. The thousands of man-years of effort dedicated to create these crypto tools can be used directly as tools for a data ecosystem.  <p>We can resolve this tension by drawing on the following mental&nbsp;model:</p><blockquote>Imagine going to an age 18+ rock concert. You can only get in if you show both (a) your concert ticket and (b) an id showing that you’re old&nbsp;enough.</blockquote><p>We can port this model into Ocean, where (a) is a datatoken, and (b) is a credential. The datatoken is the baseline access control. It’s fungible, and something that you’ve paid for or had shared to you. It’s independent of your identity. The credential is something that’s a function of your identity or your roles in society (the RBAC&nbsp;stuff).</p><p>Ocean now supports fine-grained permissions for asset-based access control. Here’s how: a consumer can only access the resource if they have 1.0 datatokens and one of the credentials in the “allow” list of the&nbsp;DDO.</p><p>Ocean also has complementary deny functionality: if a consumer is on the “deny” list, they will not be allowed to access the resource. The rules combine as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>Access = allowed — denied.</p><p>Allowed = everyone by default, or allow list if it has&nbsp;entries.</p><p>Denied = entries in deny&nbsp;list.</p><p>Initially, the only credential supported is Ethereum public addresses. To be fair, it’s more a pointer to an individual, not a credential; but it has a low-complexity implementation so makes a good starting point. For extensibility, the Ocean metadata schema enables the specification of other types of credentials like W3C Verifiable Credentials and more. When this gets implemented, asset-level permissions will be properly RBAC&nbsp;too:)</p><p>Since asset-level permissions are in the DDO, and the DDO is controlled by the publisher, asset-level restrictions are controlled by the publisher.</p> 2. Marketplace-Level Permissions: Details  2.1 Outline <p>This feature is specifically designed to work in forks of <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> and is not required. We have not enabled them in Ocean Market itself, to keep Ocean Market open for everyone to use. On the front end, the permissions features are easily enabled in a fork of the market by setting environment variables. On the back end, the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">RBAC server</a> can be deployed and maintained specifically for your&nbsp;project.</p><p>The primary mechanism for marketplaces to restrict their users’ ability to publish, consume, or browse is the role-based access (RBAC) control&nbsp;server.</p><p>Figure 1 shows how the market interacts with the RBAC server to validate the user's permissions. When a user connects a wallet to the market, a request is made to the RBAC server to establish if the user has permission to browse the market. The RBAC server retrieves the user’s role from the mapping in keycloak (or alternatively user-role mappings can be stored in a JSON) and then responds with “true” to the market if the user has the correct role for browsing.</p>Fig 1. The market requests permissions from the RBAC&nbsp;server<p>The RBAC server defines four different roles:</p>  Admin  Publisher  Consumer  User  <p>Admin / Publisher</p><p>Currently, both users with either the admin or publisher roles will be able to use the Market without any restrictions. They can publish, consume and browse datasets.</p><p>Consumer</p><p>A user with the consumer role is able to browse datasets, purchase them, trade datatokens and also contribute to datapools. However, they are not able to publish datasets. If they visit the publish page, they will see an error that explains they don’t have the required permission.</p>Fig 2. Viewing the market without the publish permission<p>Users</p><p>Users are able to browse and search datasets but they are not able to purchase datasets, trade datatokens, or contribute to data pools. They are also not able to publish datasets.</p>Fig 3. Viewing the market without the consume permission<p>Users without a&nbsp;role</p><p>If a user attempts to view the data market without a role, they will not be able to view or search any of the datasets.</p>Fig 4. Viewing the market without browse permission<p>No wallet connected</p><p>When the RBAC server is enabled on the market, users are required to have a wallet connected to browse the datasets.</p>Fig 5. Connecting a&nbsp;wallet 2.2 Mapping User to&nbsp;Roles <p>Currently, there are two ways that the RBAC server can be configured to map user roles to Ethereum addresses. The RBAC server is also built in such a way that it is easy for you to add your own authorization service. The two existing methods&nbsp;are:</p>  Keycloak  JSON  <p>If you already have a <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">Keycloack</a> identity and access management server running you can configure the RBAC server to use it by adding the URL of your Keycloak server to the KEYCLOAK_URL environmental variable in the RBAC&nbsp;.env&nbsp;file.</p><p>Alternatively, if you are not already using Keycloak, the easiest way to map user roles to ethereum addresses is in a JSON object that is saved as the JSON_DATA environmental variable in the RBAC&nbsp;.env file. There is an example of the format required for this JSON object in&nbsp;.example.env</p><p>It is possible that you can configure both of these methods of mapping user roles to Ethereum Addresses. In this case, the requests to your RBAC server should specify which auth service they are using e.g. “authService”: “json” or “authService”: “keycloak”</p> 2.3 Default Auth&nbsp;service <p>Additionally, you can also set an environmental variable within the RBAC server that specifies the default authorization method that will be used e.g. DEFAULT_AUTH_SERVICE = “json”. When this variable is specified, requests sent to your RBAC server don’t need to include an authService and they will automatically use the default authorization method.</p> 2.4 Deployment <p>The RBAC server is a node.js express application and needs to be deployed specifically for your project. The easiest way to set up the RBAC server is inside a docker container, instructions for getting setup can be found in the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">GitHub&nbsp;repo</a>.</p> 3. Asset-Level Permissions: Detail  3.1 Outline <p>Allow and deny lists are advanced features that allow publishers to control access to individual data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Publishers can restrict assets so that they can only be accessed by approved users (allow lists) or they can restrict assets so that they can be accessed by anyone except certain users (deny&nbsp;lists).</p><p>The general idea is to have “allow” and “deny” lists in an asset’s DDO, where each entry is an Ethereum address. Ocean Provider uses this information to decide whether to give&nbsp;access.</p><p>Allow and deny lists are not enabled by default in Ocean Market. You need to edit the environmental variables to enable this feature in your fork of Ocean Market. To enable allow and deny lists add the following environmental variable to your&nbsp;.env file in your fork of Ocean Market: GATSBY_ALLOW_ADVANCED_SETTINGS=”true”.</p> 3.2 Advanced&nbsp;Settings <p>Once the advanced settings have been enabled, you will see a new “Edit advanced settings” section on the asset details page. To use allow or deny lists you need to navigate to your data asset and click on “Advanced Settings”.</p>Fig 6. Advanced&nbsp;Settings 3.3 Add address to allow&nbsp;list <p>In order to add a user to an allow or deny list, you need to first know their Ethereum address. You can then enter the address of the user into the input section and click the “ADD”&nbsp;button.</p>Fig 7. Add address to allow&nbsp;list 3.4 Removing a user from an allow or deny&nbsp;list <p>To remove a user from an allow or deny list you can click the cross next to their Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p>Fig 8. Removing a user from an allow or deny&nbsp;list 3.5 Submit changes to allow or deny&nbsp;lists <p>Any changes you make on the advanced settings page need to be submitted and signed in a transaction. To do this, first, click the “SUBMIT”&nbsp;button.</p>Fig 9. Submit changes to allow or deny&nbsp;lists 3.6 Sign Metamask transaction <p>Next, you will need to sign the transaction in Metamask, or the wallet of your choice. If you have any difficulties signing the transaction, refer to our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/">guide on setting up Metamask</a>.</p>Fig 10. Sign Metamask transaction<p>When the process of updating the allow or deny lists is complete you will see a success&nbsp;message.</p>Fig 11. Update allow or deny list&nbsp;success 4. Conclusion <p>Ocean is a tool for decentralized access control. Its baseline approach is datatokens, where a consumer can access a resource for 1.0 datatokens.</p><p>Based on feedback from our enterprise collaborators, we have introduced functionality for more fine-grained permissions:</p>  Marketplace-level fine-grained permissions for browsing, publishing, etc within a marketplace frontend. It’s implemented via an RBAC Server. Permissions are controlled by the marketplace operator.  Asset-level fine-grained permissions on consuming the asset itself. It’s specified by the “allow” and “deny” fields in the DDO. Permissions are controlled by the publisher.  <p>Thanks to everyone who helped to contribute to this article, and especially the technology that this article describes: especially the Ocean core software team and our enterprise collaborators who have been so valuable in shaping this&nbsp;feature.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/"> Reddit</a>,<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a> &amp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/"> Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thanks for joining. Today, we talk about the role of identity in financial inclusion. And for that our special guest is Amit Sharma. He has engaged in a myriad of roles that intersect financial markets, risk management, regulatory compliance, and international development. He is the Founder and CEO of FinClusive, a hybrid financial technology and regulatory technology FinTech, RegTech company dedicated to financial inclusion.</p>
<p>Prior to FinClusive, Amit worked on both the public and the private sectors, including the empowerment capital, Mitsubishi UFJ, and at the US Treasury Department first, at the inception of the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, TFI, and later as a Chief of Staff to the Deputy Secretary and advisor to Treasury’s Senior Team Under Secretary Henry Paulson.</p>
<p>Hello, Amit.</p>
<p>Amit Sharma: Hello, how are you today?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. It’s a pleasure talking with you, Amit.</p>
<p>Amit: It’s great to be here. Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great. So Amit, let’s talk about digital identity. And of course, the first thing we want to hear from our guests is the journey. Please tell us your journey to this world of digital identity and also FinTech.</p>
<p>Amit: Sure. Thank you for that. You listed a little bit on the intro of my bio. I have had the good fortune of being in the development sector. I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Asia. I did development work in Asia as well as in South America. After the tragic events of September 2001, I had the opportunity to join the US Treasury Department, at the time at the inception of what became really a third of the department’s efforts to combat illicit finance, both the US and the global anti-money laundering financial crimes compliance space.</p>
<p>We were looking at ways to understand financial movements to go after bad guys, terrorists’ financiers, drug traffickers, organised criminals, understanding how they move money in the financial system. And secondly, trying to create defensive mechanisms so that banks, nonbank financial institutions can protect themselves and their customers from that exploitation. So, many rules and regulations were formed during that time.</p>
<p>I had the good fortune of then moving up to what’s called the front office and working with the senior team at the Treasury Department, really in the early phases of the financial and credit crisis in 2008, and working with international governments, as we thought through how to stem that crisis, and really the broader risks in that vein.</p>
<p>After four or five years at the Treasury Department, I realised as a financial regulator I wanted to get into the belly of the beast and into the global banking space, really understand it from the ground up, and I joined a global bank called Mitsubishi, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. I was working with the heads of the global markets group, I ran the New Products division, and really saw first-hand how global banking on the commercial investment banking side really depended on a lot of outdated technology and policies and procedures. And it was really during that time that we started to see the early technology innovations a la FinTech in payments and credit, in lending, in products, in services, but also in risk and compliance – regulatory technology.</p>
<p>And as institutions started to think about how to innovate and become more modern in their technology stack, it really provided an opportunity to see where and how financial services could be brought to the masses. And it was around that time, toward the end of my time at Mitsubishi, where I joined a group of senior financial regulators, bankers, technologists. And we did a study under the Center for Global Development around de-risking and basically found that anti-money laundering and regulatory compliance growth over the course of many years really forced many financial institutions to make a false and binary choice in that they looked at certain segments of the economy: low-moderate income, global remittances, non-profit work, international correspondent banking, and how many traditional financial institutions basically said – as regulatory compliance measures grow, they were forced with this choice to include several of these segments of our economy or exclude them because either they were too high a perceived compliance risk, or unprofitable, or both, and they began to de-risk. And that was never the intention of the growth in financial regulatory compliance. Instead, we had to focus on financial inclusion.</p>
<p>And this was really the inception of FinClusive and why we founded FinClusive. Number one, the growth of more disruptive, alternative financial services products that are being brought to the marketplace, a la FinTech companies, and decentralised applications, virtual assets service providers, those in the crypto space, providing solutions that really brought financial access to products and services to that last mile, to low-moderate income, the globally underbanked, unbanked, but really small businesses and non-profits and others, including FinTech companies and crypto companies themselves being viewed by traditional banking as high compliance risk.</p>
<p>So we set out to solve that by doing two things. One, really modernising regulatory compliance because it had grown into its own sector and the average institution, whether you’re a small credit union, or a global FinTech, or a large multinational bank, we’re spending upwards of 25-30 plus percent of their operating budget on compliance. And we knew we could modernise that but change the ethos of compliance from a more exclusionary tack to a much more inclusionary tack. We didn’t have to have that false binary choice of either including those segments of the economy versus financial system integrity. We could actually create security, system integrity, consumer protection, as well as engage more segments of the economy that had been excluded or marginalised from financial services. And digital identity is central to that.</p>
<p>When we look at the billion people or more on the planet that are not born with an official identity, how do they access financial services? And highly regulated industries, like financial services, like healthcare, and others, require the ability to verify and validate those individuals, what we call traditional ‘Know Your Customer’? And so we set out to solve that broader challenge by streamlining and modernising compliance and partnering with institutions by enabling FinTech applications and regulatory technology applications to really drive a more inclusive economy. And by bringing more modern digital identity solutions to both individuals and businesses, we could provide greater access and provide the essential privacy protections, consumer protections in tandem. And that’s really what FinClusive is all about. In some ways, we’re trying to rectify a bit of the overreach from a regulatory compliance perspective that we had initiated, and really go to the intent, which is a safe and accessible and inclusive economy for all. That’s the core of FinClusive.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s a super interesting journey you have had, of course, from public sector, private sector. And now today, you are in the entrepreneur side, with a super important mission about financial inclusion with FinClusive, and you already started illustrating what you are doing. If we go to a broader idea about what is this role? We’re talking about this role of digital identity in financial inclusion. You mentioned already 1 billion people without IDs, it’s actually I think you are the second guests in this podcast who mentioned that, and it strikes me every time I hear that number. It’s really unbelievable. Please tell us about what is the role of digital entity in financial inclusion first of all, for the individuals.</p>
<p>Amit: Sure. On the individual side, absolutely, 1 billion people that don’t have just legitimate identity. But beyond that, many jurisdictions, many countries continue to rely on quite antiquated paper-based forms of identity, hardcopy forms of identity. And as the broader community, and I mean globally, increasingly is digitising, the digitisation of our economy, we buy more of our products and services, basic everyday needs, groceries, to paying our utility bill, to accessing education and even health services and the like online.</p>
<p>And so we need to be able to create an environment where digital forms of identity can be verified and validated. And that has been challenging, you know, the broader identity fraud landscape is pretty high. And in fact, within the financial services space, the US Federal Reserve has reported that synthetic identity fraud, in other words, fake names associated with real individual identity numbers, like personal passports and driver’s licenses and social security numbers and that like, that’s costing US financial institutions alone, over 6 billion annually. It’s one of the largest growing types of financial crime in the US and globally, certainly.</p>
<p>And so, it’s not just the 1 billion that don’t have a specific form of identity. It’s really the number of folks that do have those identity stores and you have two parts of this challenge. One, the exploitation of otherwise less secure, more antiquated forms of identity. And secondly, the digitisation of our broader economy that requires that we have digital forms of identity that both allow us to verify and validate someone is who they say they are. But then we can also ensure that when we engage in services like finance, we are in fact, knowing our customer, KYC, which is a central part of the broader regulatory compliance ambit.</p>
<p>All of the anti-money laundering requirements for banks, non-bank financial institutions, and now the growing FinTech sector, the growing crypto sector, they are obligated to know who they’re dealing with. So KYC and KYB is central to the engagement of those sectors, of those parts of the economy, of those individuals and households that struggle to obtain and maintain that access.</p>
<p>And so, this problem set extends well beyond the 1 billion people to the number of folks that have IDs that really need to be able to both protect essential privacy controls, make sure that they are not also subject to fraud, manipulation and abuse. And importantly, ensure that financial services providers, at least that’s the domain that we look at, that personal identity is also in tandem with the protection of that personal identifying information.</p>
<p>The good news is that today, we have greater technology capabilities today to enable both privacy protections, as well as access through verification and validation without that compromise. Now, what we need to do is ensure that the regulatory and legal frameworks that enable these digital identity solutions to also take hold. And these will have tremendous applications the world over from refugee crises that we are seeing growing over time in places like Latin America, Africa, Asia. We’re seeing this unfold in front of our eyes in places like Afghanistan, with the crisis there as well.</p>
<p>So whether it’s a disaster recovery, or humanitarian-related issue, or a political-related issue, corruption-related issues, these issues around digital identity as a solution to allow us to verify and validate, know who our customers and our beneficiaries are, so that we can provide access, but also engage in providing tools and services that truly financially empower those individuals. So it’s a far-reaching problem but we have greater technology today to help solve that problem than we had before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. And it’s great to hear that the technology is here and is being used, and soon is going to be used more in services. Now, turning into the organisations, entities, companies, tell us the other side of this financial inclusion, but for the organisations.</p>
<p>Amit: Absolutely. I’m glad that you’re drawing that distinction. And you heard me reference KYB, Know Your Business. Know Your Customers, individuals, is absolutely very important. What folks sometimes tend to forget is that when we look at financial inclusion, we tend to focus on the two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half billion people and largely low-moderate income, like the global poor, as lacking access or sustainable access to financial services. But that is just scratching the layer.</p>
<p>When we really think about the access channels that really provide financial empowerment, we have to look at businesses, legal entities as well. Many small and medium enterprises equally struggle to engage in lending, in credit and other forms of basic financial services to grow their businesses. And this is hugely debilitating, because if you think about approximately 90 plus percent of global businesses are small and medium enterprises – 90 plus percent.</p>
<p>In the United States, note that in one of the richest countries in the world, 99% of all US companies are categorised as small businesses. And many of these organisations are 1, 2, 3 person entities that rely on personal credit history, personal background checks, personal financial history that enables them to access financing. And so, this is the engine of job creation in the world is small business. We have to be able to enable those organisations to access essential financial services and products to grow those businesses and thrive. So it’s a huge economic empowerment challenge in this regard.</p>
<p>Now, other legal entities are equally challenged. Non-profits and NGOs, non-governmental organisations, that are responsible for the support of many, many, many worthy humanitarian and other activities that either governments or the private sector have not been able to fill. Those NGOs and NPOs have been categorised by many financial services companies, traditional banks, as high compliance risk. And quite frankly, global regulators, the US included, have historically categorised these organisations as potentially exploitative for terrorist financing and money laundering.</p>
<p>And when you say this out into the general public, of course it puts traditional banks, who are highly regulated, under the scrutiny of these regulators to say, “Look, I don’t want to have undue scrutiny. I’d rather not do business with them at all.” And so, legal entity verification and validation, from small businesses to non-profits to even global corporate is hugely, hugely challenging. Global corporates, even with multiple what we call beneficial owners, multiple significant parties that control that organisation, there are now obligations for a financial services company to ensure that they not only know and validate the legitimacy of the organisation itself, its status and certification as a corporate entity or a small business or LLC.</p>
<p>Also, if they’re a money service business, are they appropriately registered? If they’re a FinTech company or a virtual asset service provider, do they have the appropriate licenses? Have we done the background checks of the owners of that company because they have a fiduciary responsibility? And unfortunately, legal entities themselves have been created to exploit financial services and systems, right, for these money laundering and other illicit activities. So, legal entity verification that leads to Know Your Business, KYB, is long overdue for a modernisation as well.</p>
<p>This is where we get excited about the good work that the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation is doing. We have, as you know, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/finclusive-validation-agent-gleis/" title="partnered with Ubisecure and RapidLEI and GLEIF">partnered with Ubisecure and RapidLEI and GLEIF</a> to be an issuer and <a href="https://rapidlei.com/gleif-validation-agents/">Validation Agent</a> of <a href="https://rapidlei.com/faq/what-is-a-legal-entity-identifier-lei/">Legal Entity Identifiers</a>, backed by that compliance data so that financial services all over the world can understand the legitimacy of these organisations and engage them to provide essential products and services.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as we go to an increasingly peer-to-peer financial services environment, where merchants and individuals are engaged together, where businesses are engaged directly with each other without a specific financial intermediary, reinforcing the legitimacy to each other is hugely important. And so therefore, the KYB scenarios that require digital applications for legal entity verification and validation are immensely important. And it’s a massive pain point for financial services all over the world. And both addressing the exploitation and security issues, as well as the inclusion issues for businesses themselves, will go a long way to drive ultimate economic empowerment, especially as I said earlier, that is the true engine of economic growth all over the world.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And also one of the stats you mentioned, the 99% of the companies in the US is small business.</p>
<p>Amit: That’s right. And that’s the engine, right. The job creators aren’t the big multinational companies. The job creators are small businesses, entrepreneurs that are starting their businesses and local shops, whether they be tech-enabled, non-tech, they have to have a form of legitimacy, and it’s often on the back of one or two or three individuals to be able to create.</p>
<p>And so, legal entity verification, legal entity digital identities, are equally as important as the individual identities because they form the gateway to be able to access essential and critical financial services. It’s a larger challenge. And so when we think about financial inclusion, we tend to only think about the unbanked or traditionally poor, low-moderate income. And really the challenge is much more wide reaching when you consider legal entities like non-profits, small businesses and others.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, you have illustrated pretty well the problem in the individuals and in the organisations and how they’re very linked to each other. No surprise, of course. Please tell us now how, in particular, your company FinClusive is solving these problems.</p>
<p>Amit: So FinClusive, as you pointed out in the beginning, we’re a technology company. We look at the rapidly evolving financial services landscape, and we see some challenges, but we see them as tremendous opportunities to drive financial inclusion. There’s a growth in more decentralised alternative financial services providers out there. The growth in financial products and services is not really happening in the traditional banking sector. It’s happening in the financial technology sector, the nonbank financial institutions like crypto or virtual asset service providers, peer-to-peer applications, blockchain-enabled networks that allow individuals, households, businesses to send value via tokens or cryptographic means to each other without any intermediary involved. These have tremendously huge opportunities to drive inclusion.</p>
<p>Now, as that happens, the need to address the essential KYC and KYB elements are incredibly important. And so, we have built our technology to enable FinTech companies, money service businesses, crypto companies to effectively partner with banking institutions, because at the end of the day, if you want access to insured deposits, you have to touch a bank. If you want access to what at least is today and for the near term, the largest payment rails on the planet, wires and SWIFT transactions and the like. You need to be able to engage with the bank.</p>
<p>And so, that’s the core service that we provide. We provide that linkage between the crypto and alternative value transfer and payment spaces with the traditional payment spaces and traditional banking. Now we do that with a foundational compliance as a service platform, which effectively brings a number of best-in-class services for the anti-money laundering and regulatory compliance requirements that financial services of all types must comport with. And it has often been very piecemeal, you have one provider for Know Your Customer, another provider for document management and verification, another provider for sanction screening and background checks, another provider for reporting.</p>
<p>What we do is bring many of those capabilities in one workflow, one full stack approach that is fully API enabled so it can be plug and play to a FinTech company in Latin America, a crypto exchange in Asia, a money service business in Africa, a non-profit or crowd funding platform in Europe, or even the most traditional bank. And so, by creating that as a foundation, we believe that Compliance-as-a-Service and compliance itself can be and is critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>This is where the incorporation of modernised identity management systems is hugely important. So we have, like I said, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/finclusive-validation-agent-gleis/" title="partnered with Ubisecure and RapidLEI">partnered with Ubisecure and RapidLEI</a>. We’re excited about the partnership. We’re a Validation Agent and issuer that can provide Legal Entity Identifiers that are backed by full compliance data. Every individual that comes to our platform and is KYC checked is given a unique digital credential backed by their compliance data. And what that does is it protects their underlying personal identifying information, but allows the verification and validation of the requisite checks so that organisations of all types so that financial institutions and intermediaries that are engaging with each other, whether it’s peer-to-peer, or via a central intermediary, can do that verification and validation very fast, efficiently and cheaply.</p>
<p>With the LEIs, we can go even further and provide the engagement for organisations to have a legitimacy of their legal enterprise when interacting with each other. It legitimises them interacting with each other, which in an increasingly peer-to-peer world is hugely important for security and trust. And we create these enablers of trust by the implementation of the LEIs for small businesses, non-profits that are engaging many organisations for financial services and products, whether it’s payments or accounts or otherwise lending and credit products and the like, we bring that sense of legitimacy and efficiency.</p>
<p>The other piece of this that is so strong and powerful is that it brings a standardisation, a common set of standards help bring common understanding, both between those organisations that need that legitimacy, and it reinforces the commercial and personal engagements, especially when we are interacting in a financial or economic money transfer way – that requires trust. So LEI is truly help enable the trust between those counterparties and enable the verification, validation and security elements when multiple financial services providers are engaged, where they can say “Yes, I can verify and validate that that organisation is completely legitimate, that the compliance elements, the Know Your Business and Know Your Customer elements are verified, and that my extension of products and services are now going to – number one, the intended parties, but number two are going securely to those that had been verified and validated.”</p>
<p>So that’s how we have incorporated the Validation Agent program. We’re excited about the ongoing modernisation of verified Legal Entity Identifiers as well, where we can provide those digital credentials so that organisations of all types can engage with the global financial services economy, wherever located in ways that are both secure, and verifying for their own engagement between each other. That’s what’s exciting.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds really exciting. And again, in one of the explanations you just gave that let’s say one of your customers, one FinTech, one organisation that wants to have the checks, they have so many different checks, given by different providers, traditionally some of them might be even manual so it’s, of course, the value proposition that you are offering now, sounds super solid. And plus, the addition of the LEIs in this workflow sounds super solid in what we need.</p>
<p>Amit: Well, absolutely. And I’ll say the excitement about this is that this is a long time coming. And I think now we have the technology to enable this environment in ways that we didn’t 5, 10 plus years ago. Remember that highly regulated industries are bound by the laws that the particular regulator must provide. And when doing so, we need to remember that highly regulated industries like financial services, like healthcare, like education, are bound by laws in that jurisdiction and identity management is equally the same for financial services KYC, KYB. And so the rules governing US institutions may differ from rules governing European institutions, African institutions, LatAm, their individual countries in those continents have different rules.</p>
<p>So standardisation is very important in a now modernised and globally connected world. Today, I don’t have to technically go through any intermediary and I can send money from me to you in Europe, peer-to-peer. So what specific regulation are we covered by is it the US, is it the Euro zone? We have to have a common set of standards. The proponents of the LEIs really believe in that common and standardisation. That’s what’s exciting about this. And the technology now, with verified LEIs, with Validation Agents that can issue and validate the Legal Entity Identifiers themselves. And from our standpoint, be able to back that by the underlying compliance data, the data checks, the background checks, the monitoring, so that we can protect the system from abuse, that’s critical. And now we can put them together.</p>
<p>And so, that common set of standards should be purported worldwide. And as we do that, we create that sort of trust economy, using the technology today to both protect the privacy elements of the individuals and entities, while also being able to create a trust framework to verify and validate that who we are dealing with is exactly who we intend to deal with. And that should span every jurisdiction because we do not live in a country-defined world now. We live in a global community,</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Very unified world we live, definitely. Thanks a lot for explaining all these challenges and how you are solving this problem. I would like to close this with a final question. For all business leaders that are listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write down on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Amit: That’s a great question. I’ll go back to sort of the beginning where you asked me a little bit about my background. Like I said, I’ve had the real opportunity and blessing to have worked in government, worked in the private sector, in banking, and otherwise. I have had the opportunity to work in the development and NGO sector. And all of those sectors play an important role to driving sustainable development and growth in our economy globally.</p>
<p>Often, we tend to look at these other sectors antagonistically. If we’re in the private sector, we look at regulators and policymakers as hinderances to our ability to grow. When we’re a regulator or a policymaker, we look at the innovation that happens in the private sector. And we say, “Wait a second, we need to put some constraints and rules to ensure that that innovation does not lead to exploitation of individuals and entities.” And then we look at the NGO sector providing essential services where private sector solutions and government solutions are not filling that void.</p>
<p>All of them matter. We must take an ecosystem approach of diverse experience and expertise to move the needle. Driving real impact commercially, economically requires that we bring all of those assets to bear to provide solutions for the global economy. And so that means we have to put aside this antagonism between sectors and really embrace that diversity of experience and expertise, because all of them are required to find collaborative solutions to drive real impact and changes in our broader society and our economy.</p>
<p>When we can do that, we really embrace inclusivity, not only to address safety and security issues. They are just not binary choices. We can drive inclusivity, as well as safety and security in tandem. And the only way to do that is that we embrace an ecosystem approach through our individual companies. We will not be the only provider of a solution. We must work with each other to provide those solutions that will be scalable, and sustainable.</p>
<p>So if there’s any lasting comment I would make, I would just say that when it comes to the diversity of your internal teams, to just even the engagement of partners and counterparts, is to look at the whole segment of our economy, from the NGO and development sector, to the government and public sector to the private sector and the innovation that happens there. All of those required to move together to really shape change.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. Thanks a lot Amit for this conversation. Please tell us how people can be in touch with you or follow you if they would like to hear more.</p>
<p>Amit: Fantastic. I invite any and all that want to contribute to this broader mission. We certainly are trying to do so. We are working with a number of organisations to create best practices in a framework for global finance in this alternative and sort of decentralising economy. It’s called <a href="https://finclusive.com/rulebook">The Rulebook</a>. We have more on those frameworks as well as our products and services and our partners at our website – <a href="https://finclusive.com/">finclusive.com</a>.</p>
<p>You can also connect with us via email, just writing in <a href="mailto:contact@finclusive.com">contact@finclusive.com</a> or <a href="mailto:info@finclusive.com">info@finclusive.com</a> to learn more. And then we also have on the social media side, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/finclusivecapital">LinkedIn</a> and Twitter that we’re quite active <a href="https://twitter.com/FinClusiveCap">@FinClusiveCap</a>. So please reach out to us on any one of those channels and we would love to connect and see how we can collaborate to advance these common objectives.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot Amit and all the best.</p>

<p>How Verifiable Credentials can transform your business</p><p>Dock’s API allows you to easily issue, verify, manage, and revoke verifiable credentials and decentralized identities. PDF certifications can be easily forged meaning online diplomas and certifications are becoming less valuable. Dock has built a decentralized network on which organizations can create their own identities, and use these identities to issue credentials that can be cryptographically verified. </p><p>This approach removes the manual verification steps from the process of issuing and handling non-verifiable credentials and saves an organization heaps of time. Verifiable Credentials also stop any fraudulent activity and ensure all credentials on a digital wallet are genuine. </p><p>With hundreds of organizations offering online courses, businesses must work to set themselves apart from the competition. Verifiable Credentials allow LMS organizations to produce unique certifications tailored to each individual and stop any fraudulent activity. Millions of people sign up for online courses daily. With most free online courses, everyone, whether they’ve attended or not, receives a certificate verifying they have completed the course. According to a study carried out by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/thousands-of-people-sign-up-for-online-classes-they-never-end-up-taking/281709/">The Atlantic</a>, two-thirds of people who sign up to take an online course do not show up. For others who don’t sign up but want to claim the accomplishments, the PDF certificate can easily be copied and imitators can fake their accomplishments.

 GiD Report#178 — The WSJ’s FB investigation and Gary Gensler’s Senate testimony <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-177-should-coinbase-litigate-to-innovate-3213b882c583">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The WSJ FB&nbsp;expose  Gary Gensler’s Senate&nbsp;hearing  The future of NFTs and&nbsp;DeFi  Stuff happens   1. The WSJ Facebook expose that everyone’s talking&nbsp;about Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Photo: Fortune Live&nbsp;Media<p>Throughout Facebook’s lifetime, we’ve seen a consistent pattern of behavior that goes something like&nbsp;this:</p>  Facebook does something bad that stirs up controversy. In the early days, it was typically about privacy or security. These days, that controversy has expanded into human/cultural/social impact, moderation, democracy, monopoly power (and its abuses),&nbsp;etc.  Facebook acknowledges the issue, pledges to fix it, and promises the company will “do the right thing” — whatever that might&nbsp;be.  Some time passes, the news cycle moves on, and Facebook never really addresses the&nbsp;problem.  <p>That playbook worked for years — as the budding social network grew from scrappy startup to post-IPO Big Tech behemoth.</p><p>A series of investigations from the WSJ suitably called <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">The Facebook Files</a> more or less reveals that&nbsp;fact:</p><blockquote>Facebook Inc. knows, in acute detail, that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm, often in ways only the company fully understands. That is the central finding of a Wall Street Journal series, based on a review of internal Facebook documents, including research reports, online employee discussions and drafts of presentations to senior management.</blockquote><blockquote>Time and again, the documents show, Facebook’s researchers have identified the platform’s ill effects. Time and again, despite congressional hearings, its own pledges and numerous media exposés, the company didn’t fix them. The documents offer perhaps the clearest picture thus far of how broadly Facebook’s problems are known inside the company, up to the chief executive himself.</blockquote><p>For most people, it’s probably not the most surprising revelation.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">The Facebook&nbsp;Files</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/carolyn">/carolyn</a> — <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353">Facebook Says Its Rules Apply to All.

The other big news of the week: Gary Gensler’s Senate&nbsp;hearing <p>Not much new here if you’ve been following the newsletter. Gary Gensler doubles down on his crusade against crypto, in particular, targeting crypto exchanges.</p><p>From <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sec-gary-gensler-crypto-regulation-exchanges-coinbase-securities-lending-2021-9">his Senate testimony on the&nbsp;subject</a>:</p><blockquote>“I’ve suggested that platforms and projects come in and talk to us. Many platforms have dozens or hundreds of tokens on them,” Gensler&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“While each token’s legal status depends on its own facts and circumstances, the probability is quite remote that, with 50, 100, or 1,000 tokens, any given platform has zero securities.”</blockquote><blockquote>He added: “Make no mistake: To the extent that there are securities on these trading platforms, under our laws, they have to register with the Commission unless they qualify for an exemption.”</blockquote><p>Felix Salmon <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-4d8d56a5-e785-44a8-82ad-008a4fad8354.html">provides some sober analysis</a>:</p><blockquote>State of play: Few if any U.S. crypto companies can say that they are regulated by the SEC or any other national regulator. Most of them are regulated at the state level, as money transmitters.</blockquote><p>…</p>  The SEC complains that crypto companies like Coinbase don’t come to it for regulation. They should do so, says Gensler, because those companies deal every day in tokens that can be considered securities, and a thumbs-up from the SEC would confer a degree of legitimacy that would be extremely reassuring to investors both small and&nbsp;large.  The crypto companies, on the other hand, complain that they can’t stand still waiting for regulatory approval on the basis of decades-old securities laws, while the rest of the world leaps ahead with innovations like distributed exchanges — smart contracts where it can be hard to even find a corporate entity to regulate.  <p>…</p><blockquote>The bottom line: The bigger the money, the more the demand from conservative investors for clear rules and regulations. “The DeFi guys want the TradFi money, but they don’t want the rules,” Ledger’s Joel Edgerton said at the Blockworks conference, contrasting crypto-based decentralized finance with dollar-based traditional finance. “It doesn’t work like&nbsp;that.”</blockquote><p>Nice timing then for Coinbase to <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1438247595877416962">look to offer futures and derivatives trading</a>.

				 <blockquote>
<p>Vous possédez des UNIK sur Unikname Network et voudriez les sortir sous la forme d’une autre crypto ? Vous avez des ETH, des BTC, des BNB… et vous préféreriez avoir des UNIK pour utiliser les services de la Plateforme SSI Unikname ou participer à la vie du réseau ?</p>
<p>Bonne nouvelle, les équipes Unikname développent actuellement des Bridges pour que le token UNIK devienne un token multichain !</p>
<p>Mais qu’est ce qu’un bridge entre deux blockchains ?&nbsp; Comment est-ce que cela fonctionne en général et comment fonctionnent les bridges avec Unikname Network ? Quelle sera la première blockchain interconnectée avec notre réseau ? On vous dit tout !</p>
</blockquote> 
			  
				
				
				 <p></p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Qu’est-ce qu’un Bridge entre deux blockchains ?  
			  
				
				
				  Pourquoi contrsuire des bridges ?  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Le but des bridges est de permettre l’utilisation d’une crypto donnée sur une blockchain à priori incompatible. Par exemple, les BTC, ETH et BNB ont longtemps vécu dans des écosystèmes hermétiques les uns aux autres. Or depuis quelques années avec la mise en place de bridges cross-blockchain, il devient possible d’exploiter ces cryptos dans les différents écosystèmes des unes et des autres.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>En effet, les bridges permettent aux tokens natifs d’une blockchain de devenir multichain. Les tokens à échanger sont verrouillés sur leur blockchain native, et ils sont forgé sur la blockchain de cible sous une forme particulière que nous détaillons par la suite. Ces programmes établissent ainsi des canaux d’échanges de token d’une blockchain à une autre en utilisant des smart-contracts pour surveiller les transactions spécifiques reliant les réseaux entre eux.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Aujourd’hui, les tokens natifs d’un grand nombre de réseaux peuvent être impliqués dans les transactions sur de multiples blockchains.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les dessous des bridges  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Pour transférer des tokens, le bridge va donc les verrouiller sur la blockchain de départ, et les forger sur la blockchain d’arrivée. Ces nouveaux tokens émis par le bridge ne sont pas exactement les mêmes que les tokens de départ : il s’agit d’une version embalée dans un format exploitable sur la blockchain de destination. On appelle ces nouveaux tokens des Peg.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Il n’est possible de créer des Peg que sur les blockchains comme Ethereum ou la Binance Smart Chain, capable de gérer des smart-contract.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>L’interconnexion des écosystèmes se fait donc via des réseaux spécifiques, permettant de connecter une blockchain manipulant des smart-contracts à n’importe quelle autre, et donc par rebond, à connecter entre elles toutes les blockchains, qu’elles permettent l’écriture de smart-contracts ou non.</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Pour faciliter le développement communautaire de bridges, des standards de Peg ont émergé. On retrouve par exemple le standard des tokens ERC20 sur le réseau Ethereum, celui des tokens BEP20 sur la Binance Smart Chain, et il en existe encore bien d’autres.</p>
<p>Le réseau bitcoin ne permettant l’écriture de smart-contract, il n’existe pas de Peg sur la blockchain bitcoin. En revanche, il existe des PegBTC sur un grand nombre de réseaux.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Comme la génération d’un Peg sur un réseau cible correspond à la suppression d’un token natif sur la blockchain de départ et inversement, il n’y a pas de création de supply. Il s’agit plutôt de transferts de tokens d’un réseau vers un autre selon un smart-contrat assurant l’équilibre des flux. </p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les bridges de Unikname Network  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Résolument décentralisé et ouvert à l’ensemble de la communauté blockchain, Unikname s’ouvre au reste du monde des cryptos en établissant ses propres bridges avec différentes blockchain équipées de smart-contract.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le UNIK, un token cross-blockchain  
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le projet Unikname Network est résolument tourné vers l’interopérabilité. De la même façon que les UniknameID sont des identifiants décentralisés conçus pour être multi-plateformes, les tokens UNIK doivent être utilisables sur de nombreuses blockchains.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Unikname travaille donc sur le développement de plusieurs bridges et le premier connectera Unikname Network au réseau Ethereum. Il sera disponible peu de temps après l’<a>Initial Dex Offering</a> (IDO) du projet Unikname. Il sera très prochainement possible de transformer ses UNIK en ETH et inversement, en passant par le premier PegUNIK jamais émis, qui sera donc un token ERC20. Les nouvelles avancées seront communiquées sur le canal <a href="https://t.me/Unikname_network">télégram </a>de Unikname.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Un premier bridge bientôt disponible  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Cette connexion entre le réseau Ethereum et le réseau Unikname fonctionne comme nous l’avons décrit ci-dessus : il existe une relation entre le nombre de PegUNIK disponible sur Ethereum et le nombre de UNIK destiné aux échanges sur Unikname Network qui est de un pour un.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Convertir ses ETH en UNIK  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Lorsqu’un utilisateur souhaite convertir des ETH en UNIK, il doit d’abord acheter des PegUNIK en ETH. Cet échange à lieu sur le réseau Ethereum selon le cours du UNIK. Il va ensuite demander la conversion de ses PegUNIK en UNIK. Pour cela, il va utiliser le bridge Unikname. Ce bridge va alors s’activer, et brûler, c’est-à-dire détruire définitivement, l’ensemble de PegUNIK à convertir. Simultanément, le même montant de UNIK va être déverrouillé sur le crypto-account&nbsp; de séquestre Unikname et envoyé sur le crypto-account Unikname de l’utilisateur. Ces flux ont lieu sur le réseau Unikname Network.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>La balance PegUNIK / UNIK est bien restée à l’équilibre, il n’y a pas eu de création de monnaie. En revanche, l’utilisateur a converti ses ETH en UNIK, et il peut maintenant disposer des services de la Plateforme SSI Unikname et prendre part à la vie du réseau.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Convertir ses UNIK en ETH  
			  
				
				
				 <p>À l’inverse, il est possible de vouloir convertir ses UNIK en ETH pour les utiliser sur le réseau Ethereum ou pour les trader. Il faut activer le bridge dans l’autre sens.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Lorsque l’utilisateur déclenche la conversion, il envoie les UNIK à échanger dans le crypto-account de séquestre Unikname pour les verrouiller. Ensuite, des PegUNIK sont forgés sur Ethereum et envoyés dans wallet de l’utilisateur. Il est maintenant libre de les convertir en ETH et d’en disposer comme il le souhaite.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Pour en savoir plus<br>  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Sur Unikname Network, plutôt que de brûler et de forger des UNIK, un crypto-account de séquestre à été mis en place. La création de supply sur le réseau est extrêmement limitée depuis l’entrée de la token économie dans sa <a href="https://www.unikname.com/en/discover-unikname-network-episode-3-supply-heading-into-phase-2/">Phase 2</a><a href="https://www.unikname.com/en/discover-unikname-network-episode-3-supply-heading-into-phase-2/"></a> et la création ou la suppression de token à chaque échanges compliquerait la compréhension du réseau.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>L’adresse de ce crypto-account de séquestre est publique et n’importe qui peut vérifier via l’<a href="https://explorer.unikname.network/">explorateur</a> Unikname Network<a href="https://explorer.unikname.network/"></a> que les seuls UNIK qui y entrent ou en sortent correspondent bien à du forgeage ou de la destruction de PegUNIK sur Ethereum.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Comme pour l’enregistrement de n’importe quelle transaction sur la blockchain Ethereum, les échanges ETH ↔ PegUNIK et PegUNIK ↔ UNIK génèrent des frais qui sont entièrement à la charge de l’utilisateur.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Conclusion  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Le UNIK, bien que token natif de Unikname Network est un token multichain. Grâce à un système de bridge, il est possible de l’utiliser sur un grand nombre de blockchains, ou de convertir les cryptos les plus courantes en UNIK sur le réseau Unikname.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Les bridges développés par&nbsp; les équipes Unikname garantissent un équilibre dans le nombre total de UNIK en circulation. Lors d’un échange entre deux réseaux, il n’y a ni création ni destruction de token. Les règles de gestion de supply de Unikname Network restent inchangées, c’est l’horizon du UNIK qui s’est agrandit.</p>

<p>Badges &amp; other digital credentials significantly benefit the offerings of LMS systems</p><p>The value created by digital badges and credentials affects more than just the organizations issuing them - they also greatly empower the recipients. By receiving and managing digital badges, individuals gain control over their digital identities and can elevate the story of their professional journey.</p><p>A digital wallet allows an individual to collect and instantly share information about themselves, and this information can be instantly verified. For example, an individual can complete an online course and get a digital certification. An employer can instantly verify the certification and the individual it belongs to. </p><blockquote>With verifiable credentials and decentralized identity, credentials and certifications can be given digitally, and be digitally signed by the new employer.</blockquote><p>Leveraging blockchain and verifiable credentials can transform your business</p><p>Whether you’re comfortable developing with blockchain or quite unfamiliar with the technical concepts behind it, Dock can help you access its many benefits. Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are an open standard for digital credentials, allowing the accreditation to be verified without any contact with the issuing body. </p><p>An individual will complete an online course and receive a digital credential to hold in their digital wallet. The timestamp of when the accreditation was given, how long it is valid for, and any other information needed is stored in a hash on the blockchain. The verifier can request access to the credential on the wallet and will also have access to view the decentralized identity recorded in the blockchain. The holder of the digital wallet has control over their identity and accreditations, and should they wish to, they can send signed copies of their credentials to third parties and add it to social media platforms such as LinkedIn, which can elevate their professional story, and these accreditations can be instantly verified. </p><p>In real life…</p><p>When someone completes an online course, some organizations provide a PDF format certification. These certifications can be easily forged and it can be difficult to know what accreditations a person has completed. The reality is that employers must verify a candidate’s qualifications they claim to have accomplished, this process to verify - search for the issuing company, call or email, and wait for a response, can take weeks and months. </p><p>Fortunately, blockchain technology and digital credentials solve these issues for good. They enable a digital ecosystem of trustworthy communication where each accreditation an individual shares about themselves can be verified instantly. </p><p>For more information, <a href="https://calendly.com/d/zp6v-mk5m/free-consultation-with-dock">schedule a consultation</a> with our experts.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://riddleandcode.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6bbe708abce949d6a8bc7a0db&amp;id=d29f4e5396&amp;e=e90f533832">award</a>&nbsp;is one more milestone in the consortium’s track record of excellence with cryptography and blockchain, after Dyne.org led the flagship H2020 project&nbsp;<a href="https://riddleandcode.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6bbe708abce949d6a8bc7a0db&amp;id=d44b7f2f19&amp;e=e90f533832">DECODE</a>,&nbsp;RIDDLE&amp;CODE’s blockchain solutions&nbsp;are deployed in banking and utility markets Europe wide and InfoCert being the largest Certification Authority at European level and eIDAS certified QTSP.</p>



<p>The European Commission’s vision for EBSI is&nbsp;to leverage distributed ledger technologies to create international and intra-communautaire services for public administrations.&nbsp;The European Blockchain Partnership aims to scale the investment fund to a fully developed&nbsp;<a href="https://riddleandcode.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6bbe708abce949d6a8bc7a0db&amp;id=96293b8ac0&amp;e=e90f533832">platform</a>&nbsp;with up to €2 billion in funding.</p>



<p>The consortium led by the non-profit foundation Dyne.org is developing a multilayered network of blockchains for distributed secure execution of smart contracts, including edge-computing scenarios deployed on low-power embedded devices and chips. The blockchain-agnostic solution offers compatibility with a wide range of products to grant freedom of choice to participating member states and solution developers. Existing integrations include BigchainDB, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth and Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Dyne.org’s&nbsp;<a href="https://riddleandcode.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6bbe708abce949d6a8bc7a0db&amp;id=34ffac5105&amp;e=e90f533832">Zenroom</a>&nbsp;is the core component of the solution.

It is a core part of the DECODE tech stack for Smart Cities and it makes it easy to understand the complexity of data transformation while being compatible with any platform, including Legacy Infrastructure. We make Crypto for Citizens and we make it Open Source.“</p>



<p>Each member of this consortium gathers together a mature experience developing and deploying industrial standards, as well as facilitating open source community adoption of technologies, including the presence in major blockchain standardisation initiatives such as ISO TC/307, INATBA, W3C and Sovrin.</p>



<p>The combination of blockchain-specific hardware solutions for critical infrastructures, developed by RIDDLE&amp;CODE, will help turn data sources into trusted ones and lay the foundation for EBSI’s automated processes and scalability. The combination of InfoCert’s leadership and scale when providing services for digital trust, security and identity management complying with standards will allow Europe to adopt mature blockchain solutions to mission-critical environments.</p>



<p>For the initial phase of EBSI’s procurement, the consortium proposes a&nbsp;<a href="https://riddleandcode.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6bbe708abce949d6a8bc7a0db&amp;id=bea7ff0c64&amp;e=e90f533832">revolutionary solution for a European Digital Product Passport</a>.&nbsp;As a path to success, the consortium plans to work actively to create an open “playing field” in Europe that can easily integrate a diversity of solutions and open this promising industrial field to new players from the public and private sectors.</p>



<p>Quote from the consortium members:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The consortium’s unique combined understanding of cryptography, blockchain and identity technologies as well as its global market positioning, give us the tools and the strength to bring EBSI to the next level. We are truly excited to embrace the policy makers, the businesses and the developers into an inclusive community, to fuel their ideas and products into the European Union’s blockchain.” </p>Andrea D’Intino (EBSI Project leader, Dyne.org)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“The blockchain landscape diversifies into layer one and layer two technologies. Layer one is used for attesting values and identities with a small transaction payload and low frequency. Layer two is used for high-volume, low-value, day-to-day transactions. Then, there is the neglected but important layer zero, where blockchain meets products and goods of the physical world. This is exactly where RIDDLE&amp;CODE contributes to EBSI.” </p>Thomas Fürstner (Founder &amp; CTO, RIDDLE&amp;CODE)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Being involved in shaping the future EU blockchain infrastructure not only makes us extremely proud, it also could have an important strategic impact on our reference market. An EU blockchain infrastructure could represent the backbone on which EU Trust will be built in the future.” He further commented: “InfoCert, as the leading Qualified Trust Service Provider in the EU, aims to further strengthen its thought leadership role in a constantly evolving market. InfoCert has an impressive track record in building innovative solutions and an ambitious R&amp;D program focused on Digital Identity and Digital Trust. It includes the exploitation of emerging technologies, among which blockchain is one of the most promising. Our partners have tremendous technical competencies in distributed ledger technologies, while InfoCert has very distinctive expertise in building Trust Frameworks. Joining forces was natural and proved to be crucial in the success of our consortium.“</p>Carmine Auletta (Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, InfoCert – Tinexta Group)</blockquote>

<p>18-Month Plan Towards a Fully-Decentralized and Long-Term Sustainable Grants&nbsp;DAO</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">OceanDAO</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-roadmap-update-mid-2021-3ea6ba80795d">is</a> a community-curated grants DAO that is key to Ocean’s long-term sustainability. We aim for OceanDAO to be fully decentralized by the end of 2022, with the future up to the Ocean ecosystem. This post describes how we plan to get&nbsp;there.</p><p>The rest of this post is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Section 2 gives an overview of past to future. It reviews how OceanDAO started from a small number of teams, and has grown and evolved since. It also outlines a future of greater scale, stability, and decentralization  Section 3 elaborates on target&nbsp;outcomes  Section 4 reviews tools towards the target&nbsp;outcomes  Section 5 gives the specific roadmap, quarter by quarter to the end of&nbsp;2022  Section 6 concludes.   2. Overview, from Past to&nbsp;Future  From 0-&gt;1 (The&nbsp;Past) <p>Based on the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Web3 Sustainability Loop</a> design, it has been operational since Q4 2020. In early 2021 we published our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-roadmap-update-mid-2021-3ea6ba80795d">2021 Q1/Q2 roadmap</a>. It outlined several key challenges; candidate solutions; and a cohesive plan to move forward. By <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-round-7-results-92c567d6d540">Round 7</a> (late summer 2021) we had delivered on the plan’s&nbsp;targets.</p><p>Let’s review the major&nbsp;items.</p><p>In early summer 2021, we introduced a variety of changes in order to scale out OceanDAO. These three mechanisms together enabled the DAO to improve funding and gather sufficient capital efficiency to enable positive&nbsp;growth.</p>  Granular Y/N voting enabled each project to be more thoroughly curated.  Variable funding enabled both small and large projects to easily access&nbsp;funding.  Burning the remainder of funds not granted, introduced an ROI&nbsp;floor.  <p>The impact of these updates has been significant. Internal processes to execute the monthly operations have steadily improved, and are beginning to scale out. Most importantly, projects have been able to increase their ability to access funds, and funds have been burned by the DAO as expectations from contributors continue to increase.</p> To 1-&gt;N (The Future — Scaling) <p>Where to from here? The overall goals are to scale funding, retain average ROI &gt; 1.0 (necessary for growth), and to fully decentralize. We want successful community teams to access greater funding in order to scale aggressively. We want internal OPF teams to eventually be funded by the DAO, eroding differences between “core” and “community”. All teams that are delivering should feel “safe” with stable / reliable funding; so we need to update voting systems towards less volatile outcomes. To access greater funding, DAO projects need to more easily report updates and metrics, while voters should be able to improve efficiency by more effectively navigating this data. When voters are able to easily understand ROI, and projects can measurably prove fundamental outcomes, then funding can grow with impunity.</p><p>To summarize, the focus for OceanDAO in 2021–2022 is stability, scale, and decentralization.</p><p>We’ve already started in the stability and scale path as teams can now request larger amounts of funding, an increase from $20K cap to $50K (as of R10), adjustments to the funding distribution were also implemented to continue growing the number of returning teams contributing in OceanDAO. The introduction of a reporting process to maintain good standing will help participants reconcile their deliverables and outcomes for the DAO. Decentralized teams such as Ocean Pearl, are working on a comprehensive UX to bring the underlying mechanisms to&nbsp;life.</p><p>These are near term approaches to improve stability, scale, and decentralize. Let’s discuss the strategy more rigorously for longer time&nbsp;periods.</p> 3. Target Outcomes 2021–2022 <p>During the summer of 2021, the OceanDAO team continued identifying a wide range of challenges while identifying forward-looking solutions to achieve our growth and sustainability goals. Stability, scale, and decentralization were key concepts identified. The following outcomes emerged as North Stars, directing the evolution of the&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Stability</p>  OceanDAO needs to have sustainable voting and funding systems to enable existing DAO and OPF teams to be funded by the&nbsp;DAO.  Grantees should signal progress to the DAO in a consistent manner, while incentivizing projects to reach completion.  Whale voting and the impact of onboarding new projects, should be softened.  <p>Scale</p>  An UX that reflects the underlying mechanisms and supports the growing OceanDAO ecosystem needs to be&nbsp;built.  A snowball effect of new projects and proposals entering the&nbsp;DAO.  Multiple funding tiers should be introduced to facilitate the scaling of a wider range of projects.  New methods to calculate and report ROI to reduce friction, and introduce new funding mechanisms.  <p>Decentralization</p>  Automate grants program process to reduce overhead and human interaction.  Decentralize grants program and funding distribution to enable new web3 functionality and interoperability to be developed.   4. Candidate Tools <p>With these outcomes defined, we identified many candidate tools to help drive these outcomes. Here are several promising ones, grouped by the target outcomes of Stability, Scale, and Decentralization.</p><p>Stability</p><p>Stability enables a stream of continuous funding for OceanDAO teams, aligning projects towards delivering outcomes, while improving proposal and voting efficiency.</p>  Voting and Funding Stability. Conviction Voting for more stable funding available to support larger teams. Shift over internal OPF teams to be funded by the&nbsp;DAO.  Systems of accountability. Implement “Standing”. Teams submit updates to reconcile their grant deliverables. Integrate a decentralized dispute mechanism to remove OPF as a Certificate Authority. DAO can easily identify teams that are in good standing. Projects need to complete deliverables before applying for more&nbsp;funding.  Soften whale voting and activity. Implement Quadratic Voting. Group all proposals under a single ballot. Full voting power can only be deployed once towards New and Existing&nbsp;teams.  <p>Scale</p><p>Scale delivers important mechanisms that drive Ocean bottom-up initiatives. By improving ROI transparency and expanding funding tiers, OceanDAO can deliver funding more effectively. As incoming proposals snowball and the DAO grows in size, improvements to the UX will make significant impacts to every participant.</p>  Ocean Pearl. Define initial UX requirements and make them transparent. Formalize OceanDAO tech stack + FE/BE layers. Integrate Pearl team into Zenhub. Improve design and roadmap transparency. Decentralize FE.  Expand funding tiers. Add lower and higher funding tiers. Make it easier for smaller projects to access funding. Increase the ceiling to fund larger teams. Increase transparency of each&nbsp;layer.  Improve ROI transparency. Implement project standings. Develop new metrics and KPIs to report ROI. Improve FE/reporting systems.  Grant Proposals “snowballs”. Develop new growth strategies. Build relationships with universities and other institutions. Implement DAO Week. Launch proposal referral program to incentivize virality.  <p>Decentralization</p><p>Decentralization transforms manual processes into automated &amp; scalable systems enabling further DAO decentralization with projects like Pearl. It enables us to better leverage <a href="https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/organization-legos-the-state-of-dao-tooling-866b6879e93e">emerging Web3 / DAO&nbsp;tooling</a>.</p>  Automate grants program. Write grants program into code and reduce ongoing overhead. Remove human interaction. Integrate Pearl&nbsp;data.  Decentralize grants program. Make grants web3 native. Decentralize fund distribution. Integrate systems like Kleros to decentralize conflict resolution while leveraging the right mechanisms.   5. Specific Plans By Quarter 2021–2022 <p>With Stability, Scale, and Decentralization oriented outcomes, the OceanDAO Product Team did extensive planning. We reconciled this with internal challenges, community expectations, governance best practices, and the latest DAO&nbsp;designs.</p><p>Below is the result, for our 2021–2022 plans, organized quarterly. These plans support these three DAO pillars, and in turn (we hope) help to drive the outcomes. We also reserve the right to change our plans based on learnings in the rapidly evolving DAO environment.</p><p>The plans focus on OceanDAO products; dovetailing these are extensive activities in voting, funding, and communications towards the 2021–2022 OceanDAO&nbsp;goals.</p> Summary <p>This image summarizes the aims per quarter. It includes outreach (row 1), monthly ops (row 2)&nbsp;, and product work (remaining rows). The following subsections elaborate on product work, per&nbsp;quarter.</p> Q3 2021&nbsp;Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q3/2021. In fact, good news: the end of Q3 2021 is near; we can report that these are already complete. Highlights are automating the grants process, expanding available funding, and aligning&nbsp;Pearl.</p>  Project “Standings”. Give a means for <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">teams to report their grant deliverables</a>, so the DAO can better understand how well a team is delivering on its target outcomes. This helps align every participant towards ROI &gt; 1.0, and reduces friction across the DAO. It’s a foundational element about team track record, on which future features can&nbsp;build.  Automate via DAOBot. This is an activity to migrate grants ops from being done by hand to being executed by code. Proposals are deployed automatically, winners are calculated and reported on time, and the schedule is executed as intended. Anyone can <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/DAOBot">read the code base</a>, or <a href="https://airtable.com/shrvk1ENKwlG8vOBL">visit the Airtable configuration</a>, to see what is being designed and deployed.  Ocean Pearl Alignment. The Pearl team is building a high-quality webapp to encompass key OceanDAO tasks, such as reviewing projects. They are working closely with the OceanDAO Team to align Pearl product goals with OceanDAO goals, and planning that results from it. This has improved transparency between teams and early communication around new features, while Pearl works towards onboarding initial&nbsp;users.  Expand Available Funding: add $50k tier. The new mechanisms to increase transparency on team track record give the opportunity to raise the funding cap for teams that are delivering. So for round 10 we expand the ceiling to $50k for projects that have completed &gt;= 3 proposals, with more to come in the&nbsp;future.   Q4 2021&nbsp;Targets <p>We have the following goals for Q4/2021. The highlights include improving ROI measures, referrals, and softening whale&nbsp;voting.</p>  Easier for Teams to Calculate ROI. OceanDAO must handle softer and squishier goals, complementing the extreme precision of Ocean Data Farming. However, toward the “ROI &gt; 1” goal, we can still make it easier for teams to report metrics, by providing them with more off-the-shelf tools. That’s the aim&nbsp;here.  Referrals to Drive proposals. To continue growing, we must increase the number of proposals and new teams entering OceanDAO. The tactic here is to incentivize the DAO community to get New Teams to submit proposals that receive&nbsp;funding.  Ocean Pearl Integration. Pearl is scheduled to be further integrated in Q4. OceanDAO teams will be able to register, update, and submit their proposals to the grants program through&nbsp;Pearl.  Soften Effect of Whale Voting. Voting should reconcile skin-in-the-game (1-token 1-vote), with democratic ideals (people having sufficient voice). The Quadratic Voting (QV) mechanism balances these. We will implement it here, plus initial Sybil protection (needed once you go beyond 1-token&nbsp;1-vote).   Q1 2022&nbsp;Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q1/2022. The highlights are launching a stable funding stream to make it safer to work in OceanDAO long-term.</p>  Stable / reliable income via Conviction Voting (CV). We want to make it feel “safer” to work for OceanDAO over longer time frames. This is critical to long-term ecosystem health. The general idea is to soften monthly binary yes/no funding outcomes. The specific approach is <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-34019bd17b10">Conviction Voting</a>&nbsp;. CV gives an effect of a “lowpass filter” over time: a voter’s weight on a project depends on their amount staked and length of time staked into the project. The overall setup is: OceanDAO would have two funding tracks: monthly “batch” voting (status quo), plus “continuous” voting (CV). CV funding allocations will start small, and increase based on learnings / feedback. ROI &gt; 1.0 will be a key constraint in the CV track&nbsp;too.  Refine Ocean Pearl. Keep working with Ocean Pearl team to support more OceanDAO user stories. This is a prerequisite to full decentralization.   Q2 2022&nbsp;Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q2/2022. The focus will continue to be around Conviction Voting to improve the overall&nbsp;system.</p>  Refine “stable / reliable income”. The “batch” voting track has been evolved and refined for the better part of a year, to get continually better at serving the community. We expect similar for “continuous” (Conviction Voting) track. Accordingly, this roadmap allocates two quarters worth of work to arrive at a CV system that we’re sufficiently comfortable with in order to scale&nbsp;funding.  Decentralize Dispute Resolution. Currently, disputes on team “standing” are handled via community discussion, with the OceanDAO core team as the final arbiter if needed. The latter is centralized; fortunately it hasn’t been needed yet. To be fully decentralized, OceanDAO needs to decentralize this. Kleros decentralized arbitration is one way. Approach or timing is subject to&nbsp;change.  Refine Ocean Pearl. Keep working with Ocean Pearl team to support more OceanDAO user&nbsp;stories.   Q3/Q4 2022&nbsp;Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q3/2022 &amp; Q4/2022. The focus will be shifting existing systems into a web3 native stack, that may interoperate between other contracts and primitives.</p>  Decentralize OceanDAO. Here, we do all remaining things for the DAO to be fully decentralized. This includes decentralizing some ops tasks like “filter projects for voting” and final transfer of funds to teams. There will likely be more&nbsp;tasks.   6. Conclusion &amp; Looking&nbsp;Forward <p>Until recently, OceanDAO focused on getting initial product-market fit (0-&gt;1) using some <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-roadmap-update-mid-2021-3ea6ba80795d">key components and mechanisms</a>. Those are now in place. The aim now is to scale in traction (0-&gt;1) along with improving stability and becoming fully decentralized. This article summarized how we plan to achieve&nbsp;that.</p><p>We aim for OceanDAO to be fully decentralized by the end of 2022. At this point, there will no longer be a distinction between “community” and “core” teams, it will simply be the Ocean ecosystem. Future improvements will be up to anyone in the ecosystem. Some teams may be chasing their own business models, such as a product for a given vertical (e.g. DeFi) or for a particular user base (e.g. Gaia-X). Others may do “public goods” work for the benefit of the ecosystem. The OceanDAO voting community can vote to bias funding towards what they feel will help drive growth the most. The only constraints are to ensure growth (ROI &gt; 1.0) and being in line with Ocean mission &amp; values. The future is up to the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>Notes</p><p>[ 1 ] “0 → 1” is a concept popularized by Peter Thiel in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296">Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the&nbsp;Future.</a></p><p>This blog was written in consideration of all staff, teams, and community members, whose commitment and feedback allows OceanDAO to continue improving.

<p>In more&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/">news</a>&nbsp;on national&nbsp;privacy laws, post-Brexit Britain is using its newfound freedom from the EU to set its own data privacy regulatory agenda.</p>



<p>According to the country’s culture secretary,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/26/uk-to-overhaul-privacy-rules-in-post-brexit-departure-from-gdpr">Oliver Dowden</a>, Britain could put an end to&nbsp;“irritating cookie popups and consent requests online,” and set new rules based on “common sense, not box-ticking.” New Zealand’s highly regarded privacy commissioner, John Edwards, has been appointed information commissioner to lead the change.</p>



<p>But while Britain plans to move away from the&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/26/uk-to-overhaul-privacy-rules-in-post-brexit-departure-from-gdpr">“world leading data policy,”</a>&nbsp;any new rules it sets will still need to protect EU-to-UK data transfers.</p>



<p>It appears that Britain wants to revert to a data protection or privacy framework that is not as strict as the GDPR and will try to redefine the appropriate balance between individual and commercial interests. Every country has a slightly different spin on that based on their history and how they arrived at their law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new British data privacy law could look more like the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-and-why-you-must-still-keep-control-of-your-personal-information/">CCPA</a>. It will be interesting to see where it lands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Da oggi tutti gli utenti Legalmail avranno la possibilità di attivare gratuitamente l’autenticazione a due fattori per l’accesso alla propria webmail, aumentando ancor di più il livello di sicurezza del proprio account di Posta Elettronica Certificata.</p>



<p>InfoCert, con Legalmail, è il primo provider PEC a offrire ai propri utenti la sicurezza aggiuntiva dell’autenticazione a doppio fattore, che sarà presto uno standard comune verso la convergenza alla PEC Europea. Ancora una volta InfoCert si conferma come provider di riferimento in tema di sicurezza e innovazione per i propri clienti.</p>



 Cos’è l’autenticazione a due fattori? 



<p>L’autenticazione a due fattori o autenticazione forte (dall’inglese Strong Authentication) è oggi uno dei sistemi di protezione più sicuri per i nostri account.&nbsp;Consiste nell’aggiungere un secondo fattore di autenticazione alle classiche User e Password, come, ad esempio, un OTP, un Token o una notifica sul proprio Smartphone. Questi elementi devono essere indipendenti tra loro, in modo che un’eventuale violazione di uno di essi non comprometta l’affidabilità degli altri.</p>



 Attiva l’autenticazione forte sulla tua Legalmail con MyInfoCert 



<p>Gli utenti Legalmail possono attivare l’autenticazione forte in completa autonomia nel menu impostazioni della propria webmail. Per abilitare il doppio fattore sarà necessario scaricare e attivare l’App MyInfoCert, e collegarla al proprio Account PEC. MyInfoCert, l’innvoativa applicazione di InfoCert già utilizzata per l’autenticazione di Livello 2 per SPID, grazie al sistema di notifiche smart ed al riconoscimento biometrico di impronta digitale o del volto, rafforzerà le difese della propria casella da accessi indesiderati.</p>



<p>MyInfoCert è disponibile per sistemi operativi Android, iOS e Harmony OS.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/reinwarth">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>As social beings, people interact with their environment, whether as citizens of a state, as employees of a company or as contractual partners (customers, insured persons) with a company in the private sector. Even if a large number of such transactions can take place anonymously (coffee to go on the way to the office in the morning does not require identification), proof of identity or the reliable assurance of a particular characteristic ("of legal age," "fully vaccinated") is often indispensable.</p>
<p>From a functional and technical point of view, a distinction must be made between different steps. Identification, i.e., the one-time onboarding of a real identity into an identity ecosystem, is usually performed only once per ecosystem, but can be very time-consuming and expensive. The reward for this procedure is simplified authentication, i.e., more or less portable, rapid proof of this identification in the form of an ID card or access to a technical system. Depending on the character of the identity ecosystem (state, bank, insurance company), the stored attributes of an identity are also updated subsequently in order to reflect ongoing developments.</p>
 Between KYC and least disclosure 
<p>In many cases, a more comprehensive knowledge of the identity and its characteristics will be necessary (for example, when signing) a credit agreement. But in many cases, reliable proof of only a few, specific characteristics is quite sufficient. Permission to dance in a club after a certain time depends on a defined age (name and exact date of birth are irrelevant here). The same applies to the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol.</p>
<p>But even critical characteristics that are not necessarily everyone's business must be verifiable to third parties in individual cases without disclosing an excess of detailed information. Discounted admission to a museum as a pupil or student does not require disclosure of the respective university or course of study. It must be possible to prove an unspecified disability in order to acquire cheaper tickets for public transport without disclosing medical details.</p>
 Regaining trust in assured identities is essential 
<p>No matter whether it is about secure identification or the proof of individual properties. The reality for all of us is that comprehensive and universally applicable policies and mechanisms do not exist for this very purpose; trust in digital identities has been profoundly destroyed in a time when identity fraud and weak authentication are our daily reality.</p>
<p>Trust in digital identities is difficult to achieve outside of individual silos and islands. In addition to nation states as issuers of digital identity credentials in the form of an electronic ID card or passport, the financial industry in particular, i.e. banks and insurance companies, has already made a strong showing in this regard. The reasons for this commitment on the part of the financial sector are obvious: money is at stake here, and trustworthy identities are the basis for any interaction between customers and institutions. The same applies to other industries, such as telecommunications providers.</p>
 Federating beyond the silo has proven difficult 
<p>Beyond the use in just one specific industry, trustworthy issuers of identity proofs (verifiable credentials) have recently been found, which can then provide identities and their properties for many business processes. However, again depending on the region or country, take-up (and thus usability) often does not reach a critical mass.</p>
<p>Two dimensions are essential: In addition to the highest possible trust in the identities and their properties, it is about their scope and usability. This is an unsolved problem to date, because while the trustworthiness of the identities is a central challenge for the individual identity ecosystems which is also solved in the respective silo, their focus is naturally on their own customers/citizens in the first approximation. Interoperability is not a core business. This massively limits identity reach as the second relevant dimension.</p>
 Putting the pieces together at a global scale 
<p>Concepts, standards and technologies would be available here and now, tried and tested, and we use them every day in online shopping or in our professional environment, but they are always reduced to individual walled gardens.</p>
<p>This is where the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-sakimura-leibbrandt-introducing-gain">Global Assured Identities Network (GAIN)</a> comes in, first publicly announced at EIC 2021 in Munich. More than 150 globally recognized experts in the identity environment have brought together their expertise from a wide variety of fields to elevate trust and reach in identities to a global level. Starting from (but not limited to) the financial industry, which has proven to be able to confidently provide identities for your business models, concepts are defined and tested here to enable interoperability for identities from all participating institutions.</p>
<p>End users obtain identities from an institution (bank, government, telco) that certifies them. By federating these, GAIN provides a reusable, trusted identity that they can use against a variety of relying parties/service providers, i.e., government agencies, but also institutions and commercial entities in a self-determined and controlled manner. In line with the concept of verifiable credentials, only those attributes are used that are required for the purpose of a transaction, i.e., proof of age or simple proof of identity without disclosing other attributes.</p>
<p>The complexity of this network, which is global by definition, is hidden by the fact that GAIN, as a network, knows the respective identity providers for the end users and mediates communication with them. Different architectures are spanned, the varying assurance level of different identities and providers is taken into account, and global interoperability is enabled. A variety of positive outcomes could be achieved, including basic increase of trust in identities, simplified on-boarding of customers and clients for arbitrary services, provision of under-banked communities with resilient identities, e.g. based on telecommunication identities (which have already taken over this role in many regions, but without further interoperability), reduction of fraud, but especially also the increase of a person‘s individual sovereignty in handling his/her identity data in the respective transaction (minimal disclosure).</p>
 Call to action: Proving viability and achieving a critical mass 
<p>The concept is promising, but until a "Login with GAIN" via the identity at my own bank or with my ID card for fast and trustworthy onboarding is available in addition to the "Login with Google/Apple/Facebook" button, a lot still has to happen.</p>
<p>Proof of value and a high level reach are the next steps. Rapid and widespread adoption by the financial industry worldwide, but also beyond, for example by eIDas solution providers or telecom companies, is imperative and essential.</p>
<p>The presentation of the network on the occasion of the EIC therefore also focused on the call for participation in this network, starting with a proof of concept soon. Interested parties are invited to take a look at the <a href="https://www.iif.com/Portals/0/Files/content/Innovation/09_13_2021_gain_digital_trust.pdf">compact white paper</a> as a first reading and introduction. The implementation has already started, interested Identity Information Providers are called to register and to interoperate promptly. Technical, organizational and legal framework conditions are roughly outlined, but in particular also possible business models and benefit aspects are documented. GAIN offers a highly exciting perspective for a global network of assured and trusted identities. The task now is to quickly implement a critical mass in order to prove the real benefits at scale.</p>

So we’re using the technology we’ve built, especially our citizen engagement platform Inclued, to help people get involved with projects that interest them and where they want to improve specific services — and for researchers to find, invite and communicate with these interested individuals.</p><p>The technology allows people to gather information about themselves and to keep it safe and secure in their own personal data store. They can let service providers see details about them — for example their age, the area they live in, if they have a disability and so on — without the service provider knowing who they actually&nbsp;are.</p><p>Service providers can then send secure messages to the sorts of people whose input they need to make their services better, asking them if they would like to take&nbsp;part.</p><p>As part of this work, we will also ask people about their motivations for taking part. For example, is it because they have felt particularly frustrated about an experience, because of a general desire to contribute, because it’s interesting, or perhaps because they can earn some extra&nbsp;cash?</p><p>By getting the right insights and improving the way information is shared — in a way which protects people’s privacy and puts them in control — we believe more people will want to get involved in shaping the services they use to improve the quality of these services. At the same time it will cut the cost of finding people who want to take part: especially people whose needs or views don’t fit into the pattern of the majority of ‘mainstream’ service&nbsp;users.</p><p>The initial work for this was funded as part of delivering a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/connecting-citizens-and-government-for-better-designed-services-9b58205185ce">CivTech sprint challenge</a>, which responded to the published challenge: “How can technology be used to engage citizens in designing Digital Public Services?” This next step brings these tools fully to life and makes them available to user researchers and service designers across the Scottish Government working on public services and the citizens they engage&nbsp;with.</p> What the tools&nbsp;do <p>Specifically, the tools help citizens:</p>  List details about themselves, including their preferences, so that these details are kept private and under their control, but can also be shared with others if the person wants&nbsp;to,  Apply for and connect to services without having to fill in&nbsp;forms,  Re-use information about themselves many times over in different circumstances, so they don’t have to keep repeating themselves when dealing with a different service,  Review projects they have been invited to and request participation in projects that they would like to take part&nbsp;in,  Provide safe and secure messaging between themselves and service providers.  <p>Meanwhile, subscribers can:</p>  Create projects,  Invite citizens to participate,  Streamline and make consistent a lot of routine administration,  recruit citizens based on the criteria needed without citizens needing to reveal these often protected characteristics,  gain an overview of all design projects, including metrics like participants’ feedback,  view a showcase of present and past projects in the same organisation, so they can better maintain and share best practice and past learning.  <p>We are really excited to be contributing to this project, which takes us another step towards our mission of putting citizens at the centre of services that genuinely work for&nbsp;them.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">Supporting citizen participation in the design of public services</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The UK Gambling Commission set out new regulations in May 2019 in an aim to make gambling safer and more fair for users. A key focus of this was around identity verification for online gambling, with new rules enforcing that operators must verify a customers age before they deposit into an account, gamble using their own money or a free bet bonus, or access “free to play” versions of gambling games.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, the commission has encouraged operators to consider using AI-Powered Verification applications. These applications aim to solve the challenges created by these new regulations by streamlining the verification process and making it faster and simpler.</p>
<p>The easiest way to apply these applications to a platform is working with an identity verification partner with experience in gaming. Here are the key factors to keep in mind when looking for an ID Verification partner:</p>
 Due Diligence&nbsp; 
<p>It’s vital to do your due diligence and make sure an identity verification partner is the best choice. This comes in the form of experience: just because a service, like AI-Powered Verification, is new, doesn’t mean the company behind it should be new too.</p>
<p>It’s vital to work with a company that has the experience and can show they know how to deliver a flawless product, as well as have a detailed background working within the market.</p>
 Honesty and Trust 
<p>Honesty and trust are two vital elements when dealing with suppliers, but it can be difficult to find in an undeveloped industry. Currently, there’s no perfect solution to the challenges that come with ID verification, so the best partners are ones that will admit their shortcomings and be transparent with their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>The role of an ID verification partner is to assist you with mitigating risk, as well as outline the limitations of the technology. You should be looking for a provider that is open and not only assists you, but also raises the bar around your compliance responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
 Security&nbsp; 
<p>Security is a business-critical factor that is sometimes overlooked when discussing advances in technology. However, RagTech sees rapid evolution and, thus, security around protecting data and privacy should be a key focus – a non-negotiable element of a partnership.</p>
<p>It will be vital to discuss the level of security that is offered by an ID verification partner, as it is something that is crucial for your most valuable asset, the customers.&nbsp;</p>
 Support 
<p>Whether a company is a startup or a well established vendor, the key behind their success will be the implementation of an idea, rather than the idea itself. That’s why it’s vital to find a partner that has a solid team behind them, that will deliver a service successfully, as well as share in-depth plans, detailing how they will deliver on their promises.&nbsp;</p>
 Engagement With the Regulators 
<p>When it comes down to it, betting service relies on the regulators. Their acceptance of your service and ID verification applications can make or break your approach to compliance. Your partner should be just as interested in this area as you are and should be constantly providing support with the regulators. If they don’t show a clear interest in this, then you should ask yourself if you are engaging with the correct solution.&nbsp;</p>
 Global Scalability 
<p>As we all know, compliance is the most expensive and complex part of a gaming company’s operation and businesses grow and expand into new markets, the cost and complexity only increases.</p>
<p>This means it’s vital to have an ID verification partner that is able to scale up and address multiple jurisdictions and competing compliance regimes. Working with a partner that is able to do this will minimise growing pains, especially one that is able to apply their solutions globally.&nbsp;</p>
 IDnow Autoident – The AI-Powered ID Verification Solution 
<p>Now that you know what to look for in an ID verification partner, look no further than IDnow. As an identity verification company<a href="https://www.thebusinessdesk.com/northwest/news/2061260-german-id-verification-start-up-expands-to-manchester">&nbsp;now present in the UK</a>, IDnow provides a solution to the new ID verification challenges with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">Autoident</a> – an AI-Powered ID verification tool.</p>

 Organising #BeyondtheRules at Dark Matter Labs — 2/4  Compounding learning and constructing legibility <p>This piece was authored by a member of the Dark Matter Labs team based in the UK as part of the #BeyondtheRules project and, as such, is written in British English and has particular references to contexts in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>This blog was written in September 2021 and reflects our learning at that&nbsp;time.</p> Our Context <p>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs works to accelerate societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and interconnectedness. We focus on the dark matter — the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the world around us, from policy and regulation to finance and data, governance and democratic participation, organisational culture and identity.</p><p>Our context as an organisation, and from which the learning that we share here is anchored, is largely defined by&nbsp;being:</p>  Mission-led  Focused on discovery and&nbsp;learning  International with a planetary view  Primarily virtual  Evolving constantly  <p><a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">Blog 1</a> in this series shared more information on our context and current structure.</p><p>In this 4-part blog series, we share how we have been building the organisational infrastructure for this work and what we are learning as we go. This blog focuses on how we are organising to navigate complex, emergent&nbsp;work.</p><p>In <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">blog 1</a> we discussed how we are a learning-based organisation — we enter most of our work not knowing the outcome — and sitting with uncertainty, complexity, and emergence is in every part of our fabric. Indeed, our own ‘dark matter’ and the organisational infrastructures that we build to shape how we show up together is also emergent. We are each constantly taking on and shedding roles; alongside, our projects and who works on them regularly shift and change as does the scope and nature of those projects and how they collaborate towards broader missions. Aside from our shared intention, there is little in how we work that is&nbsp;fixed.</p><p>This allows our work to genuinely reflect the complex emergence of our reality and for us each to autonomously follow what we see is needed to fulfil our missions, which is constantly evolving. This way of organising can create significant challenges for people to navigate themselves through the many moving parts of these systems (blog 3 will share more on our system of self-management, which is a needed complement to&nbsp;this).</p><p>We are learning (at times through moments of pain) about the need and means&nbsp;to:</p>  actively and intentionally construct (because it is indeed a social construct and takes work to build) just enough legibility of the system — in a way that updates itself as the system&nbsp;moves  and actively compound learning across that&nbsp;system  <p>These crafts play a role in liberating each of us to do our work incrementally well, enabling a shared wisdom that is beyond what any of us can reach on our&nbsp;own.</p><p>How we do this takes different forms and is constantly under development. Some of these forms we describe&nbsp;below.</p> Compounding learning <p>We use the word ‘compounding’ intentionally to nod to the difference between learning — which can involve somebody learning something and/or sharing that with somebody or many others — and the compounding of learning* — which involves different learning coming together to create a new augmented level of shared understanding as a&nbsp;result.</p><p>Creating the conditions for this type of learning is a craft and one that we recognise to be among the most important for working in complexity and emergence, especially as an international team. In doing this, building a plural peer community of interest and practice, mutual accountability, collective credibility, and shared capabilities unlocks a bigger potential for impact than any of us would be able to individually. More about the theory of that in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-e3ab44f0dc3">this&nbsp;blog</a>.</p><p>*Distinct from the definition of compound learning described <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/compound-learning-the-most-powerful-tool-for-acquiring-skills-faster-123e14f9f9d9">here</a> as used by Warren Buffet. There may be others who speak of this way of understanding compound learning that we are not yet aware of — if you are we would love to hear about&nbsp;it.</p> DM Downloads <p>DM Downloads is a bi-weekly virtual space curated to compound learning across similar or complementary lines of work across the ecosystem.</p><p>The topics are identified by the session curator, who considers the cross-cutting frameworks of DM (practices, missions, deep code innovations etc) and makes a schedule according to how advanced or ready each one is to present new material, how strategic it is to have some conversations based on some upcoming opportunities or developments, as well as their potential for cross-pollination. The schedule is shared, open for comment and suggestions.</p><p>The structure of the Downloads is:</p>  Introduction by the&nbsp;curator  Presentations from people working on this topic (circa 5–7 mins each, held by a time-keeper), sharing what they have been doing and learning in the&nbsp;work  An open discussion for them to share what comes up in hearing each others’ work, and for the wider group to share questions, thoughts and&nbsp;ideas  <p>We write up the key takeaways shared and discussed for a broader audience through our ‘DM Notes’ series on our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/">provocations page</a> to share them more widely and invite interaction (part of our practice of Working Out Loud — see more on this&nbsp;below).</p><p>The leap in shared understanding of our work is noticeable following the launch of these spaces. This is evident in their attendance (normally at least half the team), the high levels of the team watching (and watching back) the recordings as well as the internal appreciation expressed after each one. DM Downloads are also becoming an essential tool in giving new DM members a quick overview of some practices that might relate to their work in their onboarding.</p> DM Debates <p>DM Debates is a new bi-weekly open forum for discussing and developing some of the core assumptions we hold in our work and as an organisation — whether this isour stance on universal basic income or the philosophical dilemmas of a tree having self-sovereignty.</p><p>The topics are organised by people nominating and voting for topics they’d like to discuss — those with more votes are debated first. The format involves two (self-nominated) people who propose alternative viewpoints to the question, followed by an open (self-facilitated and self-moderated discussion) with 5 points of view per person as a loose guide. The speakers can comment on the discussion at the end and somebody self-nominates to capture the main points and relay them back at the end. One person captures the core points discussed and relays them back in summary at the end of the&nbsp;session.</p><p>Both our Debates and Downloads are org-wide optional spaces for anyone interested to join. They are recorded and shared so that people can also watch them in their own time or read the presentations, according to their preference.</p> Gatherings <p>Nothing can match the impact that gathering together in a relaxed way has on our sense of learning, connection and understanding. Now that we are 55 or so people across 15+ countries the actual logistics of this is huge; a central group plays a role to help consider logistics and structure of how we gather, involving people across DM in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Within a pandemic and in the context of climate breakdown, we are still working out the degree of face to face / hybrid / virtual that we will need to balance (recognising that these decisions have important implications).</p><p>In August 2021 we held a hybrid gathering where we gathered across 7 geographical clusters local to the team over four days. By that&nbsp;time:</p>  The team had not physically met since December&nbsp;2019  In that time the makeup of the team had changed significantly, we had almost tripled in size and the majority of DM people had not met more than one other DMer in&nbsp;person.  We had run a series of virtual Gatherings which had strived to test the limits of what can be achieved to build cohesion and legibility across the organisation in the virtual space during the first 18 months of the Pandemic.  <p>We knew it was such an important moment for learning how we might do this going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>We approached the challenge of working with different time zones&nbsp;by:</p>  Splitting the time table for everyone between the same synchronous and asynchronous sessions. So for 6 hours every day the team were connected together for all team sessions (Europe Morning, Asia Evening) and the other 18 hours were for each cluster to connect with each other and work together on topics set in the synchronous times from that&nbsp;day.  A central group orchestrated the schedule and logistics, while clusters led their local schedules and activities.  We nominated both Facilitators in each cluster to ensure timekeeping during the synchronous times of day and host content related conversations in asynchronous time and ‘Ministers of fun’ who were responsible for ensuring the team were making enough time to decompress, connect with each other, rest and eat well across the programme.  <p>Things that worked&nbsp;well</p>  Meeting people physically was the highlight for everyone (a feeling of belonging, connection, and a better understanding of DML and the “gorgeous human beings” / brilliant minds that make up the&nbsp;team:)  Quality of the content delivered was high and the subjects we chose were good for the time (The opportunity to learn more about DML as an organisation -history, finance, etc — and community -shared values, aspirations etc)  Overall flow of the gathering, the balance of synchronous and asynchronous time, roles different people played, quality of content in sessions (Mix of online and offline. Time spent together in clusters. Mix of lofty but fiercely practical. Range of voices. Time for conversation and exploration. Ways to capture the pulse of the org. Great&nbsp;hosting)  <p>Things that we can learn and develop going&nbsp;forward</p>  The quantity of content was very high and people felt compressed - in future, presentations move into videos that we watch&nbsp;offline  Overall, participants requested more together time for sharing experience, exploring more personal topics to open space and breakout conversations on the content. In future, more time for open space or chance for people to follow their own&nbsp;energy  Clusters experienced the gathering in quite different ways according to factors like group size. In future, more training / better equipped/briefed local facilitators with more sessions delivered by them in the local context to be responsive to the nuances of each&nbsp;cluster.  <p>We intend to move&nbsp;towards:</p>  As all team physical gatherings become less and less likely we are looking to how do we both drive down the impact of the team convening, running them with minimal to no flights and making them a more regular fixture as a part of our organisation’s rhythm and practice.  This is all part of a flow and rhythm that includes DM Downloads, DM Debates, All team Critical Sessions and Project team site visits/pop up studios where there is an emphasis on working in person, in groups, on work, that has been set free by everything else around&nbsp;it.  Physical gatherings can then be focused on spaces to connect deeply with each other, reflect, deliberate, work together and&nbsp;play  The clusters in Malmö, Sweden; Jeju, South Korea; Reading, UK; Venice,&nbsp;Italy Working Out Loud and Declaring Assumptions <p>According to <a href="https://www.toolshero.com/personal-development/working-out-loud/">this Tools Hero&nbsp;article</a>:</p><blockquote>“the concept of Working Out Loud was first described by Bryce Willians. In 2010 he published the blog post ‘When will we work out loud? Soon!’ on his blog The BrycesWrite. When he came up with the concept, he proposed the following simple formula for&nbsp;WOL:</blockquote><blockquote>Working out loud = observable work + narrating your&nbsp;work</blockquote><p>Later the concept would be expanded upon by John Stepper. Today Stepper advocates the effectiveness of the concept worldwide. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpjNl3Z10uc">TED Talk</a>, he stated that with WOL, he was stimulating a worldwide movement.”</p><p>Similarly, for us working out loud means declaring your work and, in particular, declaring/narrating the assumptions behind the direction that you are taking, so that the wider system&nbsp;can:</p>  See the direction you are going in (and when we are all doing this, sense how the system is moving and&nbsp;fluxing)  Learn from your findings and assumptions and how you act on&nbsp;them  Give you useful comments, feedback or thoughts to help&nbsp;you  <p>We use Slack as our main day-to-day communication channel to assist this&nbsp;process.</p>  Each team member posts a brief daily update in Slack’s org-hq channel on roughly their work of the day (some focus on what they are looking to learn, or questions they are sat&nbsp;with)  We declare wider decisions and their reasons into relevant slack channels, depending on their&nbsp;scope  Example of Working Out Loud in Slack&nbsp;posts<p>Part of the art of this is learning how to work out loud without creating information or task overload or overwhelm. This is nuanced for each person and there are many factors balanced in doing this, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Our hq posts per person are 1 per day only, to keep manageable  Slack channel posts focused on declaring and sharing decisions and assumptions kept to what is needed and posted only where needed (inc using Slack group tags so that messages reach the right&nbsp;people)  More detailed records stored on Notion, optional for people to&nbsp;access  Each team member individually managing their notifications, blocking out their schedule as needed for undisturbed time and practically managing their time and space (with training on prioritisation and time management to support that and tech support for information management)  <p>This area warrants a blog in itself so this just nods to some of the considerations in how we make these critical practices manageable.</p> Constructing Legibility <blockquote>“…in today’s world we find ourselves far from shore where things are uncertain, complex, and dynamic. As we all learn the practice of strategic design by doing, and collectively establish the field, legibility is the key. Trailblazing, here, is about going out of your way to make your path&nbsp;legible.</blockquote><blockquote>That means always leaving a few lanterns floating on the water to share not just where you went, but how you got&nbsp;there.”</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://helsinkidesignlab.org/pages/posters.html">Helsinki Design&nbsp;Lab</a></blockquote><p>Navigating a dynamic, ever-changing environment and making personal choices that have reference to these different levels of consideration is complex. As the degrees of complexity increase, it has become clear how autonomy in this system — without finding the system navigable — can be debilitating. It can be, for example, particularly debilitating for those who typically work with high responsibility-taking (for example, the people who wrap up all the loose ends, think through the details and thrive in clear logic and clarity).</p><p>We have been developing scaffolding to help us to see the ecosystem of people within DML, their roles, ambitions, ways of working and how these link to our contract, finances and missions, in ways that enables a broad variety of personality types to confidently embrace their autonomy.</p> Roles and responsibilities <p>At DM, a role is not a job title; it is an area of responsibility that serves a purpose. Each of us will regularly change (pick up, hand over, build new) roles so that we can be responsive to situations at hand. Early in 2021, we were starting to feel the impact of not having a legible system for who was holding which roles at any given time and the responsibilities they entailed, which we recognised was bringing a range of risks, including:</p>  *Stepping on each other’s toes*<br>Wait, you’ve already been working on this? Me&nbsp;too.  *Spreading that energy marmalade too thin*<br>Not sure how I got here, but I have way too many responsibilities at the&nbsp;moment  *Things falling between the cracks*<br>Oh, I thought YOU were doing&nbsp;this?  *Unknown Skills Spectrum*<br>How do I find someone with a specific skill or expertise?  *Lost and Stuck*<br>I don’t see clear pathways to grow and develop in the organisation  *Unknown Capacity*<br>How do I estimate the capacity of people? I need help&nbsp;now.  <p>As we now reach over 50 people, creating just enough shared legibility is one of our most important crafts for the DM team to self-navigate this ever-moving decentralized system.</p><p>A group within DML has been working on how we can each codify (in a decentralised way) our roles and responsibilities in a way that reflects its dynamic evolutionary nature. The approach thinks about roles are cards that we hold at any given time (a role played within a mission, a project or a team), some of which we may put down and pick up over time. Each role card has a description of the role and an overview of its responsibilities both to and from other roles (described by the cardholder or a former holder). Alongside this people can declare which cards they hope to put down or wish to pick up in the future, so that those building future projects or building teams for new projects can spot patterns, see who might be interested and can reach out to each other to&nbsp;discuss.</p><p>This role cards system is currently being developed and trialled.</p>Screenshot from a Miroboard where the DM team identified and described their role&nbsp;cardsScreenshot from a Miroboard where the DM team identified responsibilities and accountabilities between their role cards and&nbsp;others’<p>Being able to visualise the current and upcoming capacity of team members is an important aid to this in helping us&nbsp;to:</p>  Spot when people are over-capacity and provide them with care (care is not one person’s role, this is in all of our&nbsp;roles)  Recognise when people may (or may not) have upcoming capacity so that people can navigate whether to invite them to join a piece of&nbsp;work  Get a sense of the patterns that play out and if there is anything we need to be collectively aware of or address in those&nbsp;patterns  <p>This area of work intersects with ‘external rules’ (e.g. regulation) that are part of the systems that we work in.&nbsp;Namely:</p>  Transfer pricing calculations (these are transfers between legal entities that are required to meet international tax law, e.g. where a team member works significantly on a piece of work contracted by a legal entity that they are not paid&nbsp;from)  Project reporting (where a breakdown of personnel cost or time spent is required as part of our contracts)  <p>We seek to collate and fully comply with this information whilst not being driven by it. The current system being trialled involves each DM team member indicating their capacity across their projects per month on their personal Nation page, information which is then drawn through synced or shared databases to create an overview of shared capacity per project and per mission over time. Whilst we recognise that using an FTE and capacity approach is less than ideal, at this stage it fulfils a need for shared information that assists us to navigate our way through the system whilst we work towards an alternative approach in the&nbsp;future.</p> DM missions portfolio <p>Constructing legibility about the missions that we are working towards and the work that we do towards them is another area that we have focused significant energy to this year. This has been covered by a few blogs recently, including<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f"> blog 1 of this series</a> (section: ‘Led by Planetary Missions’) and this <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-5-50e46540dd05">DM Note</a> on Mission Holding at&nbsp;DM.</p> Centers and&nbsp;horizons <p>One of the difficult practical things about working in emergent systems is when to draw a line around an enquiry or the scope of our work. Most of the questions that we explore are interconnected, complex questions and as inquisitive people who want to do things well we have a cultural tendency to overwork as a result — e.g. what we might have been envisioned as a short enquiry becomes an expansive systems map and forum. It is hard to be true to the topics we explore whilst trying to artificially bound them (and indeed is problematic in many ways to do so); and yet, not bounding them can result in overwork by the team and overburdening ourselves in partnerships (and partners perhaps wondering why we keep broadening the&nbsp;remit).</p><p>Recent conversations have included thinking early on about where the horizons are for our work. Recognising that a horizon is not a boundary or an end, only the limit of what we can perceive (and that this horizon shifts depending on where we are), by considering the horizons to a piece of work we can identify how wide we intend to focus attention. Alongside, if we can identify the centres of our enquiries — the questions that sit at the heart of what we are trying to discover — then that horizon can be informed by distance from the centre and help to ground where energy is focused. This is an idea more than a practice, at&nbsp;present.</p> Manuals of&nbsp;Me <p>The iterative dynamic nature of our organising requires us to all have strong skills in self-management, much of which means the ability to build good relationships. Since this is such a critical part of our work we have a part-time team member focused specifically on supporting these team capabilities, running internal training on holding boundaries, building relationships, giving and receiving clean feedback, time management, etc.</p><p>This is complemented by team members building a Manual of Me, outlining how they like to work, what roles they like to play, hours they like to work, things that help us to understand them so that we can all get better at navigating each other. This becomes an incredibly valuable resource at the point of groups newly working together and discovering what it means to work together&nbsp;well.</p>Screenshot of Manuals of Me in our shared&nbsp;Drive<p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dmls-manual-of-us-d41b1c235869">Read more here</a> on how we think ‘Manuals of We’ can help partners to navigate each other during collaborations and example of one that we made for one of our partnerships.</p> Wielding tech <p>Tech plays a really important role in this area of our work, helping to build efficiency and simplicity in what might otherwise be hugely cumbersome. Our Tech and Tools group does incredible work finding ways that tech can create shortcuts through what already exists (rather than detours, creating extra work). The main platforms that we use currently are:</p>  Notion: as a shared database, project and info management space  Slack: for direct communication, updates and&nbsp;sharing  Google Workspace: for meetings, shared folders, shared documents (presentations, spreadsheets etc), shared calendars and emails (which is mainly for external communication)  Miro: for ideation and sense-making  Alongside Kumu, Adobe, Airtable, Discord, Loom and&nbsp;others  Screenshot from a recent Tech and Tools meeting on tool integrations<p>The tech and tools group learn how to wield these tools and to integrate them in a way that maximises our shared efficiency and supports the wider team to upskill. For example, our shared financial dashboard on Notion draws through information from finance meeting notes (using synching blocks) and forecasting spreadsheets (using integrations) to create an internal dashboard for the whole team to view our financial situation and considerations. The userface presents on the information useful but draws it from existing information in our systems, meaning that there is no additional work required for the finance team to maintain&nbsp;it.</p>Screenshot from recent Tech and Tools presentation discussing some of our key upcoming legibility and learning plans of&nbsp;work<p>In blog 3, we will look at how we are working towards a distributed system of governance through self-management, legal stewardship and other means. It looks at the platform of deep care, security and safety required for&nbsp;this.</p><p>If you would like to receive updates (every few weeks/months) about the #BeyondtheRules project you can do so via <a href="https://dark-matter-labs.typeform.com/to/jpm8rdp1?typeform-source=provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">this short form</a>.

<p>WeChat: The public beta version of&nbsp;Bridge Champ, the first on-chain application of the bridge game developed by Jelurida, is coming soon. Therefore, the&nbsp;recent updates&nbsp;on the Bridge Champ development progress by Lior Yaffe got covered in this&nbsp;article. The focus is on finalizing the Bridge Champ inner game mechanisms. Tournament setup, game bots, user monitoring, and NFT rewards will be gradually released after the beta version. Next, the blockchain interface will be tacked using the IGNIS tokens. The platform will function as a centralized crypto-fiat exchange and will support withdrawals and rewards distribution while offering services as high-level APIs. The final goal is to make Bridge Champ interfacing with Ardor, its child chains, and its assets as simple as possible to promote mainstream adoption.</p>

			 Cyrille De Ciancio is DevOps Engineer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Cyrille De Ciancio, I’m 33 years old and I live in France near the Luxembourgish border. I started my professional career in Luxembourg as a system engineer in an international bank. After seven years working in Luxembourg, I’ve decided to move to Asia.</p>
<p>I first landed in Hong Kong where I worked for 3 years, then with my family, we decided to move to Bangkok in Thailand where we stayed for a year and a half.</p>
<p>My professional path allowed me to meet and learn how to work with people from all around the world, and it brought me valuable soft skills which are (to me) even more important than the technical ones.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I was in Thailand when I decided to move back to Europe and look for a job. During my research, I saw a DevOps open position on Tokeny’s website and I’ve applied. From the first interview, I had a very good feeling about Tokeny, the team, its culture and its ambitions.</p>
<p>We moved forward with other interviews and a few weeks later I joined the company.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Working at Tokeny brings me all the components I need to be professionally beaming: trust, autonomy, listening… On top of that, there are so many technical challenges which need to be tackled, together with an impressively skilled tech team, the motivation is always at a high level.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Besides new technologies, traveling and discovering new countries, different people and cultures have always been very important to me, I love it. I really like getting deep into the countryside of places I’m visiting.</p>
<p>I also love cooking but honestly I still need more practise 🙂</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p></p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My dream is quite simple: I wish a long, happy and healthy life for my family and everyone else I share my life with.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I would love to live in a world where frontiers do not matter much. A world where we would teach kids how to become happy before teaching them how to become rich.</p>

  Identity sprawl is a challenge facing most modern enterprises as a result of inorganic growth, piecemeal identity solutions, and more recently, a loss of control due to unplanned remote work. This sprawl leads to tremendous technical debt and has turned identity and access management into a roadblock for many organizations.

<p>The Holochain development team is moving to regular weekly releases of the Holochain conductor, HDK, and supporting libraries. These regular releases will bring incremental improvements in stability, performance, and developer ergonomics. This comes at the right time, because Dev Camp 8 is starting on September 28th – less than two weeks! Yes, it’s finally here!</p><p>This week’s release, Holochain v0.0.106, is a small one in terms of developer-facing features, bringing a new admin API endpoint for hApp uninstallation and the first iteration of a ‘web hApp bundle’ format. Along with some low-level features… just small ones, like, you know… sharding (!!!)</p><p>[ EDIT 17 Sept: The changelog has one correction; relaxed chain top ordering isn't available yet. ]</p><p>[ EDIT 20 Sept: I've added two breaking changes to the changelog; app developers take note! ]</p> Dev Camp 8: huge turnout, exciting curriculum <p>Yes, the community-led Dev Camp 8 is finally about to happen. We’ve all been astounded by the response — the organisers have received over 1500 applications from all over the world. That’s seven times more than last Dev Camp! This is a nice problem to have, but it has meant that the organisers have had to figure out how to deal with so many more participants. So they’ve taken the past couple months to strategise with the developer community and Holo organisation to make sure it’s a success for all.</p><p>It also adds some new features, which aren’t required for Dev Camp but are required for a couple of tools that will be used in Dev Camp. These tools are <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Launcher</a>, an end-user hApp runner, and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/create">create</a>, the beginning of a new RAD scaffolding tool. In order to support Launcher, the conductor admin API now has an `UninstallApp` endpoint and there’s a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/973">new web hApp bundle format</a>.</p><p>To me, Launcher, create, and web hApp bundling feel like big news. They aren’t ready for prime time yet, though, so I’ll share more about them later.</p> Still time to register for Dev Camp! <p>Yes, that’s right. Even with the huge number of applications, and even though it starts in only 12 days, you can still join the Dev Camp. It’s free, the curriculum sounds really fun, and it’s got a great crew of leaders, facilitators, teachers, and mentors. It’ll last six weeks (with a break in the middle), with weekly live sessions for Europe time zones and support sessions for Asia-Pacific and the Americas. There’ll also be a Discord server where you can talk with participants and support folks any time you like.</p><p>I’ll write more about the Dev Camp next week, but in the meantime — <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">go and sign up</a>!</p> Holochain v0.0.106 release notes  Sharding has landed (sort of) <p>The sharding code is all written, integrated, and ready to be turned on with a configuration setting. When it’s disabled, a Holochain conductor operates as it always has — in ‘full-sync’ mode, with every node storing a copy of every piece of data. This is how Holochain will be deployed on HoloPorts until we can test sharding further.</p><p>If you want to experiment with sharding, here’s how to turn it on in the conductor config:</p> <code>network:
    # … transport config excluded …
    tuning_params:
        gossip_dynamic_arcs: true
</code> 
<p>And if you’re feeling extra adventurous, there are <a href="https://docs.rs/kitsune_p2p_types/latest/kitsune_p2p_types/config/tuning_params_struct/struct.KitsuneP2pTuningParams.html">other gossip tuning params</a> you can play with too.</p> Web hApp bundles <p>There already is a hApp bundle format, which bundles up all the DNAs necessary for the Holochain side of a full hApp. You can use the <code>hc app</code> command, which takes a <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.0.1/holochain_types/app/struct.AppManifestCurrent.html">hApp manifest</a> file and produces a bundle with the extension <code>.happ</code>.</p><p>This new web hApp bundle and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain_types-0.0.6/crates/holochain_types/src/web_app/web_app_manifest/web_app_manifest_v1.rs">manifest format</a> (link to source code; documentation hasn’t been published yet) adds the ability to include a zip file full of web UI assets, along with the rest of the hApp, in a bundle with the extension <code>.webhapp</code>. This will be used as a common format for both Holo hosting and the Launcher.</p> Full changelog   [ EDIT: This feature is included, but a merge issue caused it to be inactive. It'll be reactivated in next week's release. ] Relaxed chain top ordering (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/939">#939</a> and<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/941"> #941</a>): If you’ve been getting <code>HeadMoved</code> errors when making lots of zome calls from your UI, this new feature could be helpful. Rather than having to call that function again if another function has beaten it, it allows you to specify that its batch of writes can be ‘rebased’ on the new chain top. This is an option for any entry logic that doesn’t require strict source chain ordering.  <code>WebAppManifest</code> and <code>hc web-app</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/939">#973</a>): This is the beginning of a bundle format for hApps that contain both a DNA bundle and a web-based UI. This format will be used by both the upcoming Launcher and the Holo Hosting App.  <code>UninstallApp</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/939">#969</a>): This admin API endpoint had already been stubbed out; now it’s functional. It allows hApp managers like the Launcher to completely remove a hApp.  Sharding compiled in (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/943">#943</a>): No longer hidden behind a feature flag, sharding can now be turned on with the conductor configuration parameter <code>network.tuning_params.gossip_dynamic_arcs</code>.  [ EDIT: Added to changelog 20 Sept ] Hashes are no longer serialised to Base64 strings by default; if you depend on this behaviour, add the <code>"encoding"</code> feature flag to the <code>holo_hash</code> dependency in your zome <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:    <code>holo_hash = {version = "0.0.6", features = ["encoding"]}</code>   [ EDIT: Added to changelog 20 Sept ] <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.106/hdk/prelude/struct.Timestamp.html"><code>Timestamp</code> structs have changed</a>. If your zome code or client code directly interacts with <code>Timestamps</code> and their serialised representations, you may need to do some refactoring. Otherwise, you should only need to recompile your zomes against HDK 0.0.106.  [ EDIT: Added to changelog 21 Sept ] <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.106/hdk/time/fn.sys_time.html">sys_time</a></code> now returns a <code>Timestamp</code> rather than a <code>Duration</code>.   Documentation Drive follow-up: new goodies for new devs <p>A couple months ago, community dev <a href="https://github.com/Connoropolous">Connor Turland</a> instigated a Documentation Drive. (And I’m so grateful to him.) Here are three exciting things that came out of that work.</p> Updated Application Architecture <p>Of all the Core Concepts, the one I was least satisfied with was Application Architecture. I felt like it didn’t do a great job of explaining how hApps are put together and run, and Connor agreed. So he rewrote it, I massaged it and added new pictures, and now you can <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/">read the updated version</a>. If the Holochain stack never made sense to you before, it probably will now!

 Interview Credify’s Director of Engineering Shuichi Nagao 



<p>Vietnam has been an attractive place for innovation and international investment, especially in the technology industry. In this article, we would like to discuss with Shuichi Nagao, Credify’s co-founder and Director of Engineering, what businesses should know about Vietnam’s Information Technology (IT) resources, especially before entering the market.</p>



<p>Before founding Credify, Shuichi had been working as a Fullstack Engineer in the FinTech space, such as payment and blockchain (Ethereum). Since 2019, he has been running Credify mainly in Vietnam. From his diverse experiences, Shuichi can share his knowledge on Vietnam’s IT industry, and how businesses can leverage these resources.</p>







 Can you tell us about yourself and your journey from a full-stack developer to co-founder of Credify? 



<p>I’m Shu, a co-founder, and Director of Engineering. I learned machine learning at the University of Tokyo and in the last year of my university I joined a start-up company that two of my classmates founded, as software engineers. Through working with real products whose page views were like millions per day, I learned web development and iOS development. Eventually, this company was acquired by a big Japanese company for a decent amount of money, which was stunning to me. You know, the two of my classmates became millionaires! More importantly, you could impact/change people’s lives!</p>



<p>I have around 50 classmates, and at least 10 people out of 50, as far as I know, are entrepreneurs or very early-stage members of start-up companies. So I was interested in running my own business at some point, however, back in 2017, I decided to work as a software engineer in a FinTech company because I wanted to deep dive into complex software development to understand how systems work well before doing something for myself.</p>



<p>When I attended a tech conference on Ethereum in Tokyo, I met Makoto Tominaga and got along with him. At that time, I was interested in a different environment to challenge myself and impressed with Makoto’s vision and his experience and we started to work together in time.&nbsp;</p>



 As the co-founder of Credify, why did you choose Vietnam as the primary market? 



<p>Frankly speaking, I didn’t see Vietnam as the first market at the very beginning. Makoto and I came to Vietnam for software development at first, as we got a partner outsourcing company in Saigon. As we had been developing the MVP in Vietnam, we saw opportunities in the Vietnamese market (regulation in Vietnam, particularly around personal information, is not as well established as that in Japan, the economy is growing rapidly, etc.) and then we started to focus on the Vietnamese market. And also, the pandemic prevented us from moving to another country.</p>







 What do you think are the similarities of emerging markets in SouthEast Asia, and particularly Vietnam, regarding their IT resources? 



<p>The number of outsourcing companies is outstanding compared to developed countries. Due to the low cost compared with the developed countries, the emerging economies tend to have many outsourcing businesses, particularly in software development. In the outsourcing IT companies, you would work on different projects with quite limited periods of time (like every quarter) and you would need to strictly follow the requirements provided by clients or business analysts (I didn’t know of this position – Business Analyst – until I had come to Vietnam).</p>



<p>That engineers in the SEA speak English was impressive. I’m from Japan and find a lot of Japanese engineers with very good engineering skills without English speaking skills (writing &amp; reading are mostly fine). I think there is kind of correlations between technical skills and English skills particularly in SEA because they need to use English to learn new technologies, while Japanese, Korean, and Chinese have more information in their mother tongue.</p>



 What are the strengths and weaknesses of Vietnam’s emerging IT sector? 



<p>Vietnam has a significantly growing economy and more and more demands of hiring from IT companies, therefore from a macroeconomic perspective, the Vietnamese talents will keep becoming stronger. Besides, the competitiveness of Vietnamese engineers is strong compared to other countries in SEA with the solid government’s support for STEM education, so leader-class engineers in Vietnam will get good opportunities to work globally.</p>



<p>As a weakness, I would say the mindset. In nature that Vietnam has quite a number of outsourcing software companies, the product-driven mindset is not easy to cultivate. If you are assigned a new product every quarter, it will be difficult to love your product. I believe that great products and services will be created by a team that is passionate about their own products and services. That being said, there are more and more new growing IT startup companies in Vietnam nowadays, which I think will change this situation as engineers can have more opportunities to work for those growing product companies.</p>







 What are the most on-demand IT services, positions &amp; skills? How can Vietnam develop to meet that demand? 



<p>Engineering Manager and Tech Lead are very competitive. If you were to launch a new office in the IT sector in Vietnam (maybe a new company, maybe a subsidiary in Vietnam as a foreign company), you would need a software engineer who can build a product and a team. It goes without saying that this person should have both strong technical skills and management skills, but how can people develop these skills? I find Vietnamese engineers tend to follow the orders and try to complete them as much as possible by the due date (of course, not everybody), however, it is significantly important to understand (and make clear) the business requirements and figure out what exactly to do as a dev team by themselves without those orders. Having this self-starter mindset and ownership will be key.</p>



 What strategy should Vietnamese business use to best leverage this human resource, especially the increasing number of new freshers graduating from university? 



<p>Two things in my opinion; mentorship and branding. Working with top talent will be incredibly important particularly for juniors and freshers to set a role model. In my experience early days as a software engineer, I did pair programming with a great performer sometimes and I often asked senior engineers many questions like how to write testable code and how to design architecture. With regards to branding, good engineers bring more good engineers but finding the first ones is tough. Building a good reputation as to what the tech team does and making output by way of publishing tech blogs or open-source will be effective.</p>



 Finally, what are the qualities/values that Credify looks for in a potential employee developer? 



<p>I do value passion and mindset to grow our products together. Technical skills are important, but I like people who are passionate about what they do and I want to work with those people. I am sure that Credify can provide people with challenging and exciting opportunities.</p>

<p>Abstract — Smart contracts are being introduced to IOTA, which has proposed an interesting take on distributed ledgers by proposing the Tangle. The Tangle promises to provide a more scalable transaction infrastructure with lower fees, potentially overcoming limitations of Ethereum and other blochain-based ledgers. Due to the current alpha state of IOTA smart contracts, the official documentation lags and it is a bit of challenge to get a working setup. To help interested developers and the IOTA community to more quickly try out smart contracts, this article describes how to set up a private IOTA network with the latest state of the software and demonstrates a workable prediction market smart contract developed in&nbsp;Rust.</p> Introduction <p>Smart contracts are codified contracts using rules and algorithms that can automatically trigger and incur electronic transactions of cryptocurrencies like Ether. The expected economic impact of smart contracts is very large as they allow for improving the efficiency of many existing business models and they also allow for completely new business models. For instance payouts of insurance contracts can be automated using smart contracts or autonomous cars could also pay tolls and parking fees automatically.</p><p>While smart contracts are already well known amendments from blockchain approaches like Ethereum, these approaches suffer from shortcomings like low throughput, and high transaction costs. For these reasons, the IOTA foundation had set out to first propose a new and more scalable transaction system based on the so called “Tangle”. Secondly, IOTA version 2.0 is currently under development, and it includes an approach to smart contracts. Smart contracts under IOTA 2.0 are promised to be built on an infrastructure that both scales well, and incurs low transaction costs.</p><p>Before the background of a promising new approach for smart contracts, I started to explore how to set up a private IOTA network for development and how to develop and deploy a smart contract on it. As the IOTA developer documentation is lagging it was quite a challenge to get a working solution. Thus, the main contributions of this article are, (1) a proper description how to set up the network and how to enable smart contracts, and (2) a fully working demonstration smart contract, which implements a simple prediction market in which multiple network participants can predict and bet on a certain outcome of an&nbsp;event.</p><p>The outline of this article is, I give (1) an overview of IOTA and the network’s smart contract integration, (2) a description of how to set up an environment for developing and testing IOTA smart contracts, (3) an implementation of a simple prediction market as a smart contract, (4) some notes and insights on IOTA and smart contracts, and (5) a conclusion.</p> The IOTA Network and Smart Contracts <p>IOTA is about a new kind of public and permissionless distributed ledger for exchanging value and data. The IOTA network has been designed to overcome the main bottlenecks of Blockchain-based distributed ledgers. Due to the organization of transactions (of value) in a chain, there is just one end to append new ones, which makes it slow. Thus, in contrast to the Blockchain-based approaches the distributed ledger of IOTA is organized in a different way. The Blockchain, which is central to Bitcoin or Ethereum for instance, is replaced by the Tangle. The Tangle connects transactions via edges in a directed (and acyclical) graph (see next figure). In contrast to the Blockchain, there are multiple nodes (representing transactions) on which new edges to new nodes, i.e., transactions, can be appended.</p>The Tangle data structure of IOTA’s distributed ledger. Green: validated transactions, White: not yet validated, Grey: new transactions. <a href="https://iota-einsteiger-guide.de/was-ist-iota.html">Source</a> (2021–09–10)<p>Beside the data structure, there are further key differences to classic Blockchain-based approaches. The consent mechanism requires no miners because all users help in validating transactions. Therefore, transactions can be essentially conducted with zero fees. The current IOTA network still requires a central coordinator, defining trusted transaction milestones, which other transactions need to reference to be also trusted. To achieve true decentralization, the planned update to IOTA 2.0 should overcome this limitation.</p><p>The key properties and key promises of <a href="https://www.iota.org/get-started/what-is-iota">IOTA</a> are of&nbsp;being</p>  highly scalable by a new data structure allowing for parallel transactions  requiring few resources and being suitable for devices and&nbsp;sensors  having zero-fee transactions  running fast transactions  finally approving messages within&nbsp;seconds  providing a distributed network, which is robust against&nbsp;attacks  <p>These properties would enable a layer of trust and a very scalable and efficient messaging system for the <a href="https://www.iota.org/get-started/what-is-iota">“machine economy”</a> with a very large amount of devices connected to the Internet. The current version of IOTA on the Mainnet is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOTA_(technology)">1.5</a>, which went live in April 2021. Version 1.5 is seen as an intermediate step in maturing the IOTA technology and proving its usability and practical value. This would form the basis for smart contracts that use the messaging capabilities of the IOTA network. Smart contracts are supposed to be introduced in version 2.0 the latest and might <a href="https://twitter.com/iota/status/1428704497992413185">be even backported to 1.5</a>. At the time of writing, smart contracts are subject to development.</p>IOTA network layers. <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/blob/develop/documentation/static/img/protocol_specification/layers.png">Source</a> (2021–09–10)<p>The design for IOTA 2.0 foresees different layers (see figure above) that separate the general underlying messaging, transacting, and validating infrastructure from the application layer, which comprises also smart contracts, which would then use layer 1 capabilities to realize their features. A main reason for separating smart contracts into another layer is to not compromise the messaging functionality. Smart contracts run on Wasp nodes on layer 2 in connection with Goshimmer on layer 1, responsible for conducting transactions and messaging (see next&nbsp;figure).</p>GoShimmer for messaging and Wasp nodes for smart contracts in an IOTA 2.0 network. <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/blob/master/documentation/ISCP%20architecture%20description%20v3.pdf">Source</a> (2021–09–10)<p>Due to the separation of Wasp and Goshimmer, they need a technical capability to connect and interact with each other. Therefore, Goshimmer nodes contain a “txstream” plugin, which needs to be activated for connecting Wasp nodes. Smart contracts are developed in the Rust programming language. <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is known to generate very performant and memory efficient executables while preventing the developer from many classes of errors by a helpful compiler and a well-designed language. To test smart contracts and run unit tests against smart contract functionality, the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/iotaledger/wasp/packages/solo">“solo” environment</a> written in Go can be&nbsp;used.</p> Setup <p>The described setup defines a private IOTA 2.0 network you can run on your laptop. The network hosts a layer 1 Goshimmer node for messaging and a layer 2 Wasp node for running smart contracts. On this basis, the next chapter shows how to develop and deploy a smart contract to this&nbsp;network.</p> Environment <p>I used Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with latest updates and upgrades&nbsp;and</p>  installed git  installed <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust</a> 1.53.0 for developing native IOTA smart contracts by<br>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs |&nbsp;sh  installed wasm-pack 0.10.0 for compiling smart contracts into “WebAssembly” binaries by<br>curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf |&nbsp;sh  <p>Installed dependencies for <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/INSTALL.md">rocksdb</a> required by Goshimmer as its underlying database&nbsp;engine:</p>  sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev  sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev  sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev  sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev  sudo apt-get install liblz4-dev  sudo apt-get install libzstd-dev  <p>Cloned and built Goshimmer 0.7.5 from the develop branch (in the version of 2021–08–16) according the following description:</p>  git clone -b develop <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer.git">https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer.git</a>  git checkout tags/v0.7.5  cd goshimmer  go build -tags&nbsp;rocksdb  <p>Prepared Goshimmer for transaction handling<br>Save the <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/prediction-market-smart-contract/blob/main/goshimmer/config.json">config.json file</a> to your Goshimmer directory to</p>  enable the txstream plugin, which allows Goshimmer to communicate with Wasp&nbsp;nodes  disable the portcheck plugin  <p>To check whether Goshimmer synchronizes its time and whether messaging works, open up the dashboard on your local machine by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8081/dashboard">http://127.0.0.1:8081/dashboard</a>.

I report the design and implementation of a simple prediction market in Rust, how to build and deploy it, and finally how to use&nbsp;it.</p> Design <p>A classic example of realizing a smart contract is given by a prediction market. A prediction market is a virtual electronic market allowing to predict outcomes of future events by placing a monetary bet on a certain outcome. Such events could be sports events, political events, future prices of stocks, or other events with uncertain future outcomes. For instance, the outcome of a political election could be subject to predictions on a prediction market. A simple binary question to be answered by prediction market participants could be “Will candidate/team A win?” — with possible outcomes being “yes” or&nbsp;“no”.</p><p>Our design of a prediction market for demonstration purposes is simple. We omit a book maker and a pricing mechanism. Formally, we do not pose a question with predefined possible outcomes. Instead, market participants can bet basically on any outcome of an event with an arbitrary amount of tokens until the time for predictions is over. Afterwards, the winning outcome is determined and winning bets placed on the correct outcome receive back their share on the overall amount of tokens placed in bets. Assume, in total 700 tokens were bet on “no” and 300 tokens in total were bet on “yes”, and “yes” is the actual outcome. A single bet on “yes” with 100 tokens receives (100/300)*(700+300) = 333 tokens, making a win of 233&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Realizing this design as a smart contract in the IOTA network allows to deploy one contract per question to be answered. The account deploying the contract is in control and has to specify the time until when bets can be placed on outcomes. The actual question to be answered has to be communicated in third party channels. Any network participant can then look up the contract and call a function to place a bet on an outcome by sending some IOTA from their wallet. Finally, after the time for predictions and bets has passed, the deploying account has to call a function to close the prediction market and to provide the actual outcome of the event and correct answer to the question. This triggers the evaluation of all bets with regard to the correct answer. Accounts with the correct answer receive the winning amount of IOTAs in a transaction.</p><p>Note that in a real world and more production-like scenario, one might consider using an <a href="https://blog.iota.org/introducing-iota-oracles/">oracle</a> to provide the outcome of an event. Oracles can stream off-chain data (about events) into the Tangle, so smart contracts can use this data in their evaluations.</p> Implementation <p>Smart contracts for the IOTA network can be implemented in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and then compiled to a <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm">WebAssembly</a> file.</p><p>Our demonstration smart contract implemented in Rust can be viewed and cloned from this <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/prediction-market-smart-contract">repository</a>. The smart contract first exposes three functions for (1) initializing a prediction market, (2) placing a bet on an outcome, and (3) closing the prediction market for determining winners. When the contract is loaded, the mentioned functions’ implementations are made publicly available under the first string’s name, e.g., “initmarket”.</p><p>The first function should be called by the account deploying the contract for initialization. Optionally, the function can set an end time for betting using the parameter BETENDUTC, which is a date-and-time string in ISO format, assuming time in UTC. In case the parameter is omitted, bets can be placed at any time until the closemarket function is called (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>The second function allows to place a bet on a certain outcome value of an event, provided as parameter BETVALUE, e.g. “yes”. The amount to bet is the amount of IOTA sent with the function call. Bets must be placed in time before the betenddatetime has passed, which was set on initialization of the market. To save incoming bets for future evaluation to determine winners, I use two structs, defined in the beginning. That is, I define a hash map, mapping a betting account’s id to a Bet struct, which defines the amount of tokens and the outcome value of the bet. These custom structs are used instead of the built-in map offered by the context object of the function because only a proper hash map allows iterating over all keys and elements stored. As custom objects are not accommodated by the state stored in the context of the function, we need to jsonify it to produce a string, which can then be stored in the&nbsp;state.</p><p>The third function closes the prediction market and is to be called by the contract owner. Calls by other accounts will fail. The function can only be run after the specified end time has passed for predictions, and the function to close the market can be called successfully only once. The function requires a BETVALUE parameter, specifying the winning outcome, e.g., “yes”. The function runs through the stored bets, determines winning bets and the amount of IOTA coins they receive, and sends the IOTA to the wallets of the&nbsp;winners.</p> Build <p>To build the smart contract, one can pull the accompanying <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/prediction-market-smart-contract">repository</a> on github with the following structure:</p> * Cargo.toml <br>* src/lib.rs <br>* pkg/ <br>* target/ <p>The full Rust code of the smart contract is contained in a file called lib.rs. The structure and the naming of files follows standard conventions for Rust. To define dependencies of the smart contract code, the <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/prediction-market-smart-contract/blob/main/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml file</a> reads as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>The most important dependency is wasmlib, which is the IOTA’s smart contract library, allowing to produce smart contracts as compiled WebAssembly files. Furthermore, serde is used for serializing custom state objects to json strings for storage in the smart contract’s state. chrono brings some date and time related functionality required to control the end of a prediction market.</p><p>To build the smart contract, run wasm-pack build in the directory where Cargo.toml resides. The other directories like pkg and target are created automatically in the build process. The compiled WebAssembly file is located in the pkg directory and named predictionmarket_bg.wasm.</p> Preparation <p>We proceed by deploying our simple smart contract compiled as a WebAssembly wasm&nbsp;file.</p><p>Note: please adapt the path to the wasm file if required.</p><p>./wasp-cli chain deploy-contract wasmtime predictionmarket "Prediction Market SC"&nbsp;./prediction-market-smart-contract/pkg/predictionmarket_bg.wasm --chain=predmarketchain --upload-quorum=1 -d --address-index=0</p><p>outputing:</p> uploaded blob to chain -- hash: 6wVabTkRUUGrQzEj8s4yuPC8dfaHGLsoHLXsqvveSw4hPosted on-ledger transaction BChQcWEmMptqRM1z4C9ZffTQXPebg1MMiEYENuAnV7KV containing 1 request:<br>- Request 4RkBSF6BAHgfamyJnXFy4r1YoVU9wvZ9b6uvXUjt2VWAfF5<br>Waiting for tx requests to be processed...<br>Posted off-ledger request 2JdtBzxjP4Bc6Tj2SnZPSctoYDHxuCAvPWJwn6ufMShJ6Lw <p>Now, functions can be called on the contract. First, the same wasp-cli that deployed the contract needs to call the initmarket function. There are two possibilities:</p><p>a) do not specify a specific an end date for the prediction market to simplify testing and development by this call&nbsp;./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket initmarket --chain=predmarketchain</p><p>b) specify a specific end date and time for the prediction market. The iso format is used and UTC is assumed. In this way, all bets must be placed before this time and the market can be only closed after this time. Run&nbsp;./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket initmarket string BETENDUTC string "2021-09-08 23:00" --chain=predmarketchain</p><p>Before placing a bet, we check the wallet’s balance with&nbsp;./wasp-cli balance</p><p>returning</p> Address index 0<br>Address: 1BAgmaSN1RYk5rbbxMK21CZo8t2zQ3EFeMwDPnMhQdQbs<br>Balance:<br>IOTA: 28653<br>------<br>Total: 28653 <p>For the deployed prediction market, we assume two possible outcomes “yes” and “no” on which bets can be submitted.

Each participant requires another wasp wallet. Thus, we create four new subdirectories waspwallet2, waspwallet3, waspwallet4, waspwallet5 and copy wasp-cli and wasp-cli.json to those directories by repeating with regard to these directories</p><p>The last command initializes a new&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>In case the contract’s code is changed, it needs to be re-deployed using the first and main wasp-cli. You also need to re-deploy the chain on which the contract is deployed first. Due to the redeployment of the contract, the copied versions of wasp-cli.json (in waspwallet2 to waspwallet5 directories) miss the new address of the deployed predmarketchain chain. In this case, we need to get it back in there to be able to run bets on the same prediction market from another account. Either you noted the address of the chain when it was created, such&nbsp;as</p> activating chain nZBwoJi5q7KGk8D2cgm16PWrdM6aL2qTdCY27HHjZgrK.. OK. <p>or you perform a cat wasp-cli.json in the directory of your first wasp wallet, giving you some information like this (among other information):</p> {<br>  "chains": {<br>    "predmarketchain": "nZBwoJi5q7KGk8D2cgm16PWrdM6aL2qTdCY27HHjZgrK",<br>  }, <p>Now you need to provide this address of the predmarketchain to the new wasp wallets’ configuration files. To do this, you can run the following command for the new wallets in the respective directories (e.g. in waspwallet2 through waspwallet5 in our example).</p><p>./wasp-cli set chains.predmarketchain nZBwoJi5q7KGk8D2cgm16PWrdM6aL2qTdCY27HHjZgrK</p><p>Please adapt the chain’s actual address nZBwoJi5q7KGk8D2cgm16PWrdM6aL2qTdCY27HHjZgrK to&nbsp;yours.</p><p>Finally, all four new wasp wallets need to be funded. First, find out their address by running (for each new waspwallet subdirectory)</p><p>waspwallet2/wasp-cli address</p><p>Then, provide the funds using cli-wallet (in the directory where it resides on your computer) by&nbsp;running</p><p>./cli-wallet send-funds -amount 40000 -dest-addr 1Ah4cqMPdrDGx6Htapk7NZUxxcYHsP1C3oAugEYHVmACj</p><p>and replacing the address 1Ah4cqMPdrDGx6Htapk7NZUxxcYHsP1C3oAugEYHVmACj with the actual address found by running&nbsp;./wasp-cli balance before in the respective subdirectories (of waspwallet2 to waspwallet5).</p> Simulation of a Prediction Market <p>Now we are ready to place bets in the deployed contract’s prediction market on behalf of these four new participants. So, in the respective subdirectories we run&nbsp;say</p>  cd waspwallet2  ./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string yes --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:100  cd&nbsp;../waspwallet3  ./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string no --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:50  cd&nbsp;../waspwallet4  ./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string yes --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:200  cd&nbsp;../waspwallet5  ./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string yes --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:500  <p>Finally the contract owner (with the first wallet) can close the prediction market by running in the directory of the first&nbsp;wallet</p><p>./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket closemarket string BETVALUE string no --chain=predmarketchain</p><p>In this example, the actual outcome is specified to be “no”. When running this command from a different wasp wallet’s directory, we obtain a log output on the Wasp&nbsp;node</p> You are not authorised to close the prediction market - only contract creator is allowed to close the market. <p>When successfully closing the prediction market, the Wasp node’s log&nbsp;outputs</p> CLOSEMARKET is executed:<br>the winning value is: "no"<br>total amount of bets placed on "no" is 60 IOTA<br>total amount of bets placed on "yes" is 800 IOTA<br>total amount of bets over all values: 860 IOTA<br>1FbCCHv9if3xbnRg3wJ7SY1kBFSdhNFR6Ax6haw6PhYDL placed a bet on "no", which is a WIN<br>bet amount: 10 IOTA; won amount: 143 IOTA; of total amount placed a bet on 860; where total amount per winning value: 60<br>transferring won amount of IOTA to: 1FbCCHv9if3xbnRg3wJ7SY1kBFSdhNFR6Ax6haw6PhYDL<br>1FZtVTCi2GDuQ1oMGZqpT38akLpcMiMv6a8MVKNJYYdsr placed a bet on "yes", which is not a win<br>1F81pGLKLhPb5ANFSGWQ7UPMSnPdahNZaZkgrcyaFXvpu placed a bet on "no", which is a WIN<br>bet amount: 50 IOTA; won amount: 716 IOTA; of total amount placed a bet on 860; where total amount per winning value: 60<br>transferring won amount of IOTA to: 1F81pGLKLhPb5ANFSGWQ7UPMSnPdahNZaZkgrcyaFXvpu<br>17jdFbAhWwF79fBEia6A8AYMTmMYncipaFhDTjsqUbMfp placed a bet on "yes", which is not a win<br>1BAgmaSN1RYk5rbbxMK21CZo8t2zQ3EFeMwDPnMhQdQbs placed a bet on "yes", which is not a win<br>consensus/action.go:338 postTransaction: POSTED TRANSACTION: 4Aw6PzQGkk6MFzPVAXZkz8RGiPocYxuxhA9o7qgeDN7h, number of inputs: 2, outputs: 3<br>EVENT: state was synced to block index #11, approving output: [0]4Aw6PzQGkk6MFzPVAXZkz8RGiPocYxuxhA9o7qgeDN7h<br>STATE TRANSITION TO #11. requests: 1, chain output: [0]4Aw6PzQGkk6MFzPVAXZkz8RGiPocYxuxhA9o7qgeDN7h <p>Revisiting the bets, we had placed the following ones:</p><p>Bets number 1 and 3 were on “no” and the bet was on the actual outcome “no”. So the total amount of IOTA was 860, the bets on “no” were only 60 IOTA in total. The share of bet number 1 is 10/60 and share of bet number 2 is 50/60. So, wasp wallet 1 receives 1/6 of 860 IOTA, i.e, 143 IOTA. And wasp wallet 3 receives 5/6 of 860 IOTA, i.e, 716 IOTA. Note that when transferring funds, a minimum transaction of fee of 1 IOTA is deducted from the amount to be transferred.</p><p>Note that running the closemarket function of the smart contract a second time leads to an error message in the Wasp node’s&nbsp;log:</p> the prediction market was already closed  Limitations <p>There are some limitations of the presented prediction market</p>  Only one contract per chain can be deployed because the bets are not stored per contract identification in the chain’s&nbsp;state  All bets are stored on-chain, so they are&nbsp;public  Each account (given by a wasp wallet) can place only one bet per deployed prediction market&nbsp;contract  The actual question asked by the prediction market and the possible outcomes have to be conveyed informally  Bets are against other market participants — there is no market&nbsp;maker   Insights <p>Along the way of producing this article and experimenting with IOTA smart contracts, many small insights were gained. With the hope that these insights will be helpful, I share them in the following.</p> Transaction Time <p>Running transactions in the described setup on a laptop can take several seconds when waiting for the wasp-cli commands to finish. However, they can be run asynchronously when using the wasp-cli, i.e., commands can return immediately after issuing a command. Of course, transactions can run in parallel. When running scripted wasp-cli requests, one has to take care not to create too much load on the Wasp node because otherwise requests will fail with “time out”-errors. To evaluate transaction times in a production setup on the Devnet or Mainnet, further investigations are required.</p> Transaction Fees <p>In principle fees for transactions and deployments are configurable. However, there are some minimum fees that apply such as for deploying a chain (100 IOTA), deploying a smart contract, and posting state changing requests to a smart contract (1 IOTA). With default minimum fees in mind, transaction costs in the IOTA network should be very low compared to transaction fees in the Ethereum network. Note that chain owners could also increase transaction fees.</p> Production Readiness <p>On a first shot, nothing really worked when trying to set up a private IOTA network based on public documentation. That is, one has to find workable versions of the software, find a proper configuration and parameters, and find working ways for funding wallets and deploying contracts. The IOTA 2.0 software is under development and special notice has to be taken on which versions to run and which version of the different pieces (Wasp, GoShimmer, cli) to combine. The documentation in <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/">IOTA’s repositories</a> is lagging behind the development process. However, the IOTA community is very helpful and can be reached on <a href="https://discord.iota.org/">Discord</a>. So, getting the network up and running depended digging into material on the <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/">github</a> repositories, third party information (e.g., on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyzQwFp8SFUWHhim4PBhV75W3nLxBWZI6">youtube</a>), own experiments, and asking questions on IOTA’s <a href="https://discord.iota.org/">discord</a> server. Once the IOTA private network and the smart contract are up and running, you are ready for testing and experiments. Further steps taken by IOTA to bring the smart contract implementation and IOTA 2.0 to production readiness can be looked up in their&nbsp;<a href="https://roadmap.iota.org/">roadmap</a>.</p> Developing Smart Contracts <p>Using Rust as a language for developing smart contracts might help producing error-free and stable smart contracts because Rust is well-known for its strict and sophisticated compiler which together with the strong typing and the language design eliminates whole classes of errors common in other languages. Also, the compiler provides helpful error messages. Therefore, using <a href="https://www.innoq.com/de/articles/2020/08/smart-contracts-in-rust/">Rust can provide some advantages</a> over the Solidity language, which is usually used for developing Ethereum smart contracts. However, Rust might be unfamiliar for smart contract developers being used to Solidity.</p> Conclusion <p>This article discussed smart contracts as a new and upcoming feature in IOTA 2.0. Because IOTA has a different approach to conduct and store transactions in a more parallel way with fewer resources than Ethereum, a higher scalability and lower fees are promises that come with this approach. Our experimental setup of a private IOTA network and simple prediction market IOTA smart contract shows that it is already possible to use IOTA smart contracts for development and testing. As the process of setting up the IOTA network and running smart contracts was a bit challenging, I believe this article and example code can provide useful input and support for other developers and the community interested in IOTA smart contracts.</p><p>51nodes GmbH based in Stuttgart is a provider of crypto economy solutions. 51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://medium.com/@turfa">Majd Turfa</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@jpbu">Jan-Paul Buchwald</a> for their help in the course of developing this article, experiments, and the&nbsp;setup.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/exploring-iota-2-0-smart-contracts-in-a-private-network-developing-a-prediction-market-c2d81988f75e">Exploring IOTA 2.0 Smart Contracts in a Private Network: Developing a Prediction Market</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  We missed commemorating our first birthday because we were simply too busy.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>When we launched Indicio in May 2020, a global pandemic was disrupting the way we shared information. Lockdowns triggered a global migration from work to home, and centralized systems fragmented into millions of daily sign ons, access requests, and virtual meetings — many conducted on devices that were poorly protected. The curse of friction and the need to find efficient and effective ways of managing information in these new circumstances were an opportunity to rethink technology, processes, and ingrained habits—and jettison what wasn’t working.</p>
<p>Catastrophes have a way of resetting fundamentals, and the fundamental question we worked on was how can we trust digital data? This problem is now endemic to life because all our information is digital. The very efficiency of our communication has us trapped in a highly inefficient existential crisis. And it’s costing us a fortune in mitigation, poor user experience, fraud, and theft. Specifically, we saw four dimensions to the problem.</p>
<p>The first was how do you encode digital information with authenticity? You need to show, definitively, that it came from the source it says it did and that it hasn’t been altered. This is like the “Trinity” of trust. If St. Patrick came back as a technologist, he’d probably use a shamrock to explain how these all go together.</p>
<p>The second dimension is regulatory compliance. Yes, we see COVID health passes being used to effectively burglarize people’s private data but that just isn’t sustainable—or right. You may say, “hey, people don’t care about privacy when convenience is on offer,” but the Venn diagram of people who do care about privacy and those who detest predatory tech companies is large enough to power privacy regulation to infinity and beyond. We need to mitigate that risk—and the cost burden this compliance has created.</p>
<p>The third dimension is security. One trillion dollars. That’s the estimated cost of cyber insecurity. The cost of our collective failing here exhausts adjectives; the pressure to defend against threats is just exhausting. The stats are so grim the new paradigm in security is called “Zero Trust.” You can’t get more nada than zero. What this means is that everything must be verified as authentic and unaltered all the time. Trust nothing, verify everything.</p>
<p>The fourth dimension is resilience. A technology that solves all these problems cannot manifest in a single point of failure whether that is a single database or a single company.</p>
<p>No matter what way you slice and dice and spin current information systems, none deliver on all these dimensions. In fact, they barely deliver on any. And when they do, they do in ways that increase the risk in adjacent dimensions. Now, think about how many digital and non-digital devices and things the Internet of Things is going to drop into these systems in the next five years.</p>
<p>That’s why we missed our birthday.</p>
<p>We were working with global enterprises to build what we call “Trusted Data Ecosystems” to answer these challenges—and then some.</p>
 How does a Trusted Data Ecosystem solve all these problems? 
<p>First, it uses decentralized blockchain technology to create an authentic digital proof of someone or something or some claim. It uses machine-readable governance to establish who counts as a trusted source for this data within an ecosystem—the rules for trust. It has the software for people to create trusted data, hold and share it, and verify it.</p>
<p>Second, a trusted data ecosystem avoids the need for third parties to store personally identifiable information (PII) in order to manage verification. No more personal accounts, passwords, or logins. No more data processing compliance costs and headaches.</p>
<p>Third, if you eliminate the need for databases full of PII, you eliminate them as a security risk. They aren’t colloquially known as “honeypots” for nothing. But just as important, you now have an ecosystem system for authentic verification to meet the demands of Zero Trust. All your network assets can implement rigorous verification in a frictionless way — thanks to machine-readable governance.</p>
<p>Fourth, our trusted data ecosystems are supported by decentralized networks. You can use ours, which now has 23 nodes on five continents, you can use others, or you can have us build you your own private network. Either way, you remove that single-point-of-failure weakness. The open-source base for the technology also means that credentials can be interoperable across systems—vital when you think about using a health test proof issued in one country for travel to another.</p>
<p>On top of all this, we’ve designed our Trusted Data Ecosystems to be easily integratable into existing systems. Technological evolution should be sustainable and not a case of buying newer and shinier systems every couple of years, which only creates chaos for your employees and painful costs on your books. We believe that technology should be easy to integrate, easy to update, and easy to interoperate—and an open-source base enables this kind of continuous, sustainable improvement and innovation.</p>
<p>This multidimensional value—authenticity, compliance, integrity, and resilience—coupled with being easy to integrate is what separates the Indicio approach from the rest. Our growth in 16 months—with global enterprise customers and a global decentralized blockchain network supported by 23 companies on five continents is a sign that fundamental change is coming in the way we share information. And it will arrive just in time to navigate the vast expansion of connected devices.</p>
<p>Some tech companies look to the stars; we’re changing the digital universe.</p>

 In the fall of 2020, the Spring team released a new experimental Spring Native project that gave Spring developers hope for faster startup times. Spring Native is all about converting your Spring applications to native executables. It leverages GraalVM to make it happen. This announcement was huge because the new kids on the block, Micronaut and Quarkus, produced native executables by default.

<p>In the fall of 2020, the Spring team released a new experimental Spring Native project that gave Spring developers hope for faster startup times. Spring Native is all about converting your Spring applications to native executables. It leverages GraalVM to make it happen. This announcement was huge because the new kids on the block, Micronaut and Quarkus, produced native executables by default.</p>
 
 
<p>I was really excited about Spring Native when I first heard about it. Its first release (v0.8.3) was on Nov 23, 2020, but I started playing with it in September 2020, probably due to SpringOne. How do I know this? Because that’s when I first tried it, and <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/issues/192">entered an issue for the Okta Spring Boot starter</a>. I was able to get things working with Spring Security’s OAuth dependencies (instead of the Okta starter) in the waning weeks of 2020.</p>

 Branching out with Spring Native 
 
 
<p>According to VMWare Tanzu’s recent <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/ebooks/the-state-of-spring-2021">State of Spring 2021 report</a>, a lot of people know about Spring Native, but it’s still early.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>I wrote about <a>how to build native Java apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot</a> earlier this summer and included my learnings. Around the same time, I thought to myself, "it’d sure be nice if the Okta Spring Boot starter worked with Spring Native."</p>
 
 
<p>To solve this desire, I scheduled a Twitch stream with <a>Brian Demers</a> and <a href="https://joshlong.com/">Josh Long</a>. We spent 90+ minutes figuring things out. You can watch our struggles, collaborations, and ultimate joy in the <a href="https://youtu.be/8vY-9tXlCW4">video below</a>. I added a detailed table of contents to the video’s description on YouTube, so you can skip around if you like.</p>
 
 

 
 
<p>This stream originally aired on June 22, 2021. Since then, there have been a few Spring Boot releases and several Spring Native releases. And don’t forget, there was another <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1433072410182357000">SpringOne</a>!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Okta Spring Boot Starter v2.1.1+ Supports Spring Native! 
 
 
<p>Today, I’m happy to announce that we’ve added our learnings to <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/releases/tag/okta-spring-boot-parent-2.1.1">Okta Spring Boot v2.1.1</a>; now, it only takes a couple of lines to add native support to a Spring Boot application that uses Okta.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint;
@NativeHint(options = "--enable-https")</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Or, if you’d prefer a full example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint;

@NativeHint(options = "--enable-https")
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d like to see what it takes to migrate my previously mentioned native Java + Spring Boot example from using Spring Security OAuth to the Okta starter, look no further than <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples/pull/5">@oktadev/native-java-examples#5</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>You can also try it out yourself with the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a>. Install it and follow along below for a quick Okta + Spring Native example.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a Native Spring Boot App 
 
 
<p>To create a secure Spring Boot app with Okta, run <code>okta start spring-boot</code>. You’ll need to verify your email and set a password as part of this.</p>
 
 






If you already have an Okta account, you can run <code>okta login</code> first.



 
 
<p>This command will download our <a href="https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-spring-boot-sample">Okta Spring Boot sample</a>, register your app on Okta, and configure it by adding your Okta settings to <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Add <code>@NativeHint(options = "--enable-https")</code> to the main <code>Application</code> class as specified above.</p>
 
 
<p>Next, edit your <code>pom.xml</code> and add the Spring Native version and classifier to the <code>&lt;properties&gt;</code> section:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;spring-native.version&gt;0.10.4&lt;/spring-native.version&gt;
&lt;repackage.classifier/&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, replace the <code>&lt;build&gt;</code> section with the XML below:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;defaultGoal&gt;spring-boot:run&lt;/defaultGoal&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                &lt;classifier&gt;${repackage.classifier}&lt;/classifier&gt;

                    &lt;/env&gt;
                &lt;/image&gt;

   Right after our first webinar, we caught up with Joseph Thompson, the CEO of AID:Tech to get his thoughts on the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) space and its impact on our society over the next few&nbsp;years.  Here are some questions we asked&nbsp;him.  What’s exciting about verifiable credentials?  Not many people today understand the importance of taking ownership of their data.

<p>Right after our first <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-decentralised-identity-and-financial-services-webinar-a-recap-f5cecfb8b45c">webinar</a>, we caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephthompson11/">Joseph Thompson</a>, the CEO of <a href="https://www.aid.technology/">AID:Tech</a> to get his thoughts on the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI) space and its impact on our society over the next few&nbsp;years.</p><p>Here are some questions we asked&nbsp;him.</p> What’s exciting about verifiable credentials? <p>Not many people today understand the importance of taking ownership of their data. But that could change over the next decade, as privacy would be the most important commodity.</p><p>As people travel more, they tend to use their data across borders, and it becomes necessary to be able to use it safely and securely.</p><p>In the EU, we have the eIDAS, which is a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">regulation</a> for verifying the identity of individuals online through electronic documents.</p><p>So, I was born and brought up in Ireland and when I go to Italy or Spain or any other country that’s a part of the EU, I don’t have to bring my health data, tax credits, passport, or any other document as my identity, thanks to eIDAS. Imagine the convenience that comes with it! And that’s just from the consumer&nbsp;side.</p><p>As for Enterprises, when their consumers bring in data from other organizations in a secure way, it saves them time and money, besides increasing transparency.</p><p>This means <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> would make it easy for entities to trust data even on anonymous profiles and it can be massive for economies moving forward because an organization doesn’t necessarily have to know a person, just his or her data for processing. This is possible through verifiable credentials and that’s what makes it so exciting.</p><p>There are undoubtedly a lot of opportunities, provided we can resolve a couple of issues&nbsp;first.</p><p>One issue is there must be many applications for end-users. Having an identity on a network is kind of useless unless there are a ton of applications that can be accessed with that identity. So, we should be watching this space, especially blockchain, decentralized identity, and verifiable credentials for any developments that can be leveraged.</p><p>That said, there’s no doubt that there is a massive upside to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">using verifiable credentials</a> and it’s only a matter of time before we start leveraging it.</p> What’s the best way to get the word out on verifiable credentials, privacy, and decentralized identity, and their benefits? <p>It’s a lot of marketing, and it becomes easy when you can demonstrate the benefits through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">real-world use&nbsp;cases</a>.</p><p>First of all, the decision to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b">share your data</a> with someone must be a personal choice that an individual must make based on the benefit of a&nbsp;service.</p><p>Take the example of the microinsurance application that we’re building now. If an individual has a trusted verifiable credential, then the same can be sent to an insurance company. For insurance companies and healthcare organizations, these credentials mitigate their risks because they can determine whether the individual can make the copayments and premiums.</p><p>For individuals, they could decide if they wanted to share their data with an insurance company to get health insurance, and if yes, which company. In other words, the end user would have complete control over their data and could determine where and how it was&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Many people who weren’t convinced first have slowly adopted it due to their personal experiences.</p><p>To create more such experiences, companies in this space have to be more solution-focused. Currently, there’s a lot of focus on the tech side of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">VC implementation</a>, but this should extend to a solution-centric approach to increase adoption.</p><p>While this is already happening in pockets, there has to be a holistic approach to solving a particular problem through verifiable credentials, and I believe it will happen&nbsp;soon.</p> How do you see VCs and SSI evolving in the next five years or&nbsp;so? <p>A convergence of technologies such as mobile smartphones, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">identity wallets</a>, cryptos, and more would drive the need for trusted identities that can be shared seamlessly across different entities and use-cases.</p><p>It will also present huge opportunities for people to monetize their own data and this can drive adoption as&nbsp;well.</p><p>In all, yes, we can expect more awareness and adoption in five years because of the enormous upsides for both individuals and organizations.</p> So, what do you think are the impediments that can hamper this adoption? <p>Regulations definitely. Currently, we see a lack of clarity among lawmakers, so more awareness about VCs and their benefits could bring in more positive laws that can, in turn, foster innovation.</p> Shifting gears a bit here, what really brought you to SSI and decentralized identity? <p>Well, it all began in 2009 when I ran a marathon for a charity, but the money didn’t reach the intended recipients. I realized there was a lack of transparency in how the funds were collected and used. That was my first tryst with transparency or the lack of&nbsp;it.</p><p>In 2015, I was doing my Master’s degree in Digital Currencies and during this time, it occurred to me that the Google search engine must be converted into a transparency engine. What I mean by that is that there must be a layer of transparency in the information, so people are able to trust it&nbsp;better.</p><p>With such thoughts, I did some pilots in this space, and it soon became clear that this was a need for today’s world from government aid to welfare payments. And that’s how the whole idea was&nbsp;born.</p> Can you share some insights into the social projects you’re working&nbsp;on? <p>We’re working with the Women’s World Banking to distribute microinsurance to women in Uganda and Nigeria. We’re also partnering with the Asian Development Bank, Microsoft, and Save The Children to build verifiable credentials for parents, so they can access financial aid, education, and other benefits, and pass it to their children. We have now completed the pilot phase and we’re scaling it massively with the help of our partners.</p> What is Affinidi’s Role in the work you&nbsp;do? <p>Makes our life a lot easier as we don’t have to build the entire verifiable credentials from the base&nbsp;level!</p><p>Learn more about AID:Tech and Affinidi’s <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-partners-with-aid-tech-exploring-new-horizons-in-digital-identity-and-verifiable-661c9e61f7e8">partnership</a>.</p><p>While this brings us to the end of this interview, we have many interesting content and events lined up.

Fintech’s biggest hivemind, <a href="https://www.money2020.com/">Money 20/20</a> is back this year from 21 to 23 of September in Amsterdam.




 




This year the event is back to a in-person event and with an immersive agenda bringing 8 groups of nearly 30 industry speakers, called Think Tanks, to discuss Fintech’s biggest challenges of today.




 “The future is trustless. What do we need instead?” 





 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco</a> will be present, with our CEO and Founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a> joining the Think Tank titled<a href="https://europe.money2020.com/whatshappening/agenda#/agenda/event/the-future-is-trustless-what-do-we-need-instead-e102-45023"> “The future is trustless. What do we need instead?”</a> on Tuesday 21, 16:00 – 17:00 CET.




 




<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgwbirch/">Dave Birch</a> will be moderating. David is an author, advisor and commentator on digital&nbsp;financial services. He’s one of the global top 15 favourite sources of business information (Wired magazine) and one of the top ten most influential voices in banking (Financial Brand); was found to be one of the top ten Twitter accounts followed by innovators. He leads 15Mb Ltd (his advisory practice), is Global&nbsp;Ambassador for&nbsp;Consult Hyperion&nbsp;(the secure electronic transactions consultancy that he helped to found), Non-Executive Chairman of Digiseq Ltd, Ambassador for Jersey for Fintech, a member of the Governing Council of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation (the London-based think tank) and holds number of&nbsp;board-level advistory roles. He is an Honorary President of EEMA, the European e-ID Association.




 




Joining Katryna in this panel discussion are the following speakers:




 




• <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felixgerlach/">Felix Gerlach</a>, CPO &amp; Co-founder, Passbase Inc.




 




• <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rdasxy/">Riddhiman Das</a>,  Co-founder &amp; CEO, TripleBlind




 




• <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmalindley/">Emma Lindley</a>,  Co-founder, Women In Identity




 




• <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-maynard-atem-848b2117/">Louise Maynard-Atem</a>, Research Lead,  Women In Identity




 





 




Trust is an outdated concept. We should not need trust to be able to do trade and share. Trust should be an implicit hallmark, not an explicit task. What do we need to develop to remove the need to achieve it? And what do we need instead? We need to build an environment that is safe by default. We need to shift from transactions based on the identification of the counter parties to transactions based on the strongly-authenticated credentials of the counter parties. How do we get there?




 




This and other thought provoking conversations will take place at Money 20/20. Book by Friday the 16th (CET) for early bird prices and save 500€.

<p>Since <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/intro-to-dids-for-people-5ebe620b5a15">the beginning</a> of our journey here at MATTR, decentralization and digital identity have been central to our approach to building products. As part of this, we’ve supported Decentralized Identifiers (or <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/docs/platform/core/dids/overview">DIDs</a>) since the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">earliest launch of our platform</a>. We’ve also considered how we might give you more options to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/did-extensibility-on-the-mattr-platform-14c73c7a798e">expand the utility</a> of these identities over&nbsp;time.</p> An important milestone <p>The W3C working group responsible for Decentralized Identifiers <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9179">recently published</a> the DID v1.0 specification under “Proposed Recommendation” status. This is a significant milestone as DIDs approach global standardization with the pending approval of the W3C Advisory Committee.</p><p>DIDs are maturing, but so is the environment and context in which they were originally designed. With a complex ecosystem consisting of dozens of different methodologies and new ones emerging on a regular basis, it’s important to balance the potential of this decentralized approach with a realistic approach for defining the real utility and value of each <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID method</a>. For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-did-rubric-20210826/">DID Method Rubric</a> provides a good frame of reference for comparing different approaches.</p><p>Different types of DIDs can be registered and anchored using unique rules specific to the set of infrastructure where they’re stored. Since DIDs provide provenance for keys which are controlled by DID owners, the rules and systems that govern each kind of DID method have a significant impact on the trust and maintenance model for these identifiers. This is the key thing to remember when choosing a DID method that makes sense for your&nbsp;needs.</p> Our supported DID&nbsp;methods <p>In MATTR VII, by supporting a variety of DID methods — deterministic or key-based DIDs, domain-based DIDs, and ledger-based DIDs — we are able to provide tools which can be customized to fit the needs of individual people and organizations.</p>  Key-based DIDs — Largely static, easy to create, and locally controlled. This makes them a natural choice for applications where there’s a need to manage connections and interactions with users directly.  DIDs anchored to web domains — These have a different trust model, where control over the domain can bootstrap a connection to a DID. This makes a lot of sense for organizations with existing domain names that already transact and do business online, and can extend their brand and reputation to the domain of&nbsp;DIDs.  Ledger-based DIDs — These offer a distributed system of public key infrastructure which is not centrally managed or controlled by a single party. While ledgers differ in their governance and consensus models, they ultimately provide a backbone for anchoring digital addresses in a way which allows them to be discovered and used by other parties. This can be a useful feature where a persistent identifier is needed, such as in online communication and collaboration.  <p>There is no single DID method or type of DID (which at the moment) should be universally applied to every situation. However, by using the strengths of each approach we can allow for a diverse ecosystem of digital identifiers enabling connections between complex networks of people, organizations and machines.</p><p>To date, we’ve provided support for three main DID methods in our platform: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a>, and <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">DID Sovrin</a>. These align with three of the central types of infrastructure outlined&nbsp;above.</p> Introducing DID&nbsp;ION <p>We’re proud to announce that as of today we’ve added support for <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">DID ION</a>, a DID method which is anchored to IPFS and Bitcoin. We’ve <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1-9b565cf92db3">supported the development of the Sidetree protocol</a> that underpins DID ION for some time as it has matured in collaboration with working group members at the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p><p>With contributions from organizations such as Microsoft, Transmute, and SecureKey, <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> and DID ION have emerged as a scalable and enterprise-ready solution for anchoring DIDs. The <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">core idea</a> behind the Sidetree protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger system. DID ION is an implementation of that protocol which backs onto the Bitcoin blockchain, one of the largest and most used public ledger networks in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Sidetree possesses some unique advantages not readily present in other DID methods, such as low cost, high throughput, and built-in portability of the identifier. This provides a number of benefits to people and organizations, especially in supporting a large volume of different kinds of connections with the ability to manage and rotate keys as needed. We have added end-to-end capabilities for creating and resolving DIDs on the ION network across our platform and wallet products.</p><p>Although DID ION is just one implementation of the Sidetree protocol, we see promise in other DID methods using Sidetree and will consider adding support for these over time as and when it makes sense. We’ll also continue to develop Sidetree in collaboration with the global standards community to ensure that this protocol and the ION Network have sustainable futures for a long time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>At the same time, the community around DID Sovrin is developing a new kind of interoperability by designing a <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">DID method</a> that can work for vast networks of Indy ledgers, rather than focusing on the Sovrin-specific method that’s been used to date. As DID Sovrin gets phased out of adoption, we’re simultaneously deprecating standard support for DID Sovrin within MATTR VII. We’ll be phasing this out shortly with upcoming announcements for customers building on our existing platform.</p><p>If you’ve got any use cases that utilize DID Sovrin or want to discuss extensibility options, please reach out to us on any of our social channels or at info@mattr.global and we’ll be happy to work with&nbsp;you.</p> Looking ahead <p>We believe this a big step forward in providing a better set of choices when it comes to digital identity for our customers. From the start, we have designed our platform with flexibility and extensibility in mind, and will continue to support different DID methods as the market&nbsp;evolves.</p><p>We look forward to seeing how these new tools can be used to solve problems in the real world and will keep working to identify better ways to encourage responsible use of digital identity on the&nbsp;web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-did-ion-to-mattr-vii-d56bdb7a2fde">Adding DID ION to MATTR VII</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>September 15, 2021</p>
<p>Toronto, Canada</p>
<p>The partnership between Northern Block and kompany provides organizations and users of the NB Orbit platform access to the leading global corporate register network and in turn, audit-proof company information from commercial registers, financial authorities and tax offices around the world.</p>
<p>The purpose of this partnership is to enable trust network operators to increase the authenticity of legal entities that join their ecosystem. This provides the ability to engage in business with peers with confidence, while mitigating fraud risks. Through the instant access to this primary source information, the KYC/KYB process is greatly enhanced by including official information on over 115 million companies across more than 200 countries and jurisdictions.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see an increasing demand from clients to validate legal entity data at source. So in automating access to original corporate register records, via our partnership with kompany, we are providing an additional layer of KYC &amp; KYB security.”, says Mathieu Glaude, CEO of Northern Block.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before conducting business, companies should perform sufficient due diligence to get to better know the other entity that they’re about to transact with. However, this is easier said than done. For example, in global digital commerce, in many cases companies don’t know or meet the other entity they’re going to transact with. Therefore, enabling companies to verify whether the other party unequivocally meets their policies adds a layer of trust and comfort. Increasing the authenticity of the organizations that get onboarded to trust ecosystems inherently increases the network value and aids companies.</p>
<p>Onboarding in a self-sovereign manner to digital trust ecosystems is different than in federated models. When network operators manage a trust network and an entity connects into the network and begins transacting, it’s important to ensure that you’re getting credentials from the source issuer. This is what kompany provides via its global register network: official data and documents retrieved in real-time form their original source.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Russell E. Perry, CEO and Co-Founder of kompany: “With increasing compliance and AML requirements, the veracity and source of company data have become a central point in combating money laundering and other frauds. We are, therefore, proud to provide Northern Block clients with our unparalleled access to real-time audit-proof company information, ensuring access to company information across multiple jurisdictions and helping their clients achieve improved business efficiency.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Canada is becoming a nation of digital identity. Recently, the Government of Ontario announced their <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-digital-id-technology-and-standards">technology and standard choices</a> for their Digital ID Ecosystem. Digital ID is critical to the economy. The Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) estimates that the potential value that trusted digital identity could bring to the Canadian economy is at least 1 percent of Canada’s GDP, or CAD 20 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Mathieu Glaude adds, “Onboarding small businesses in a frictionless manner must be made easy. We’ve asked small businesses to do so much during Covid; and now that we’re asking them to use new digital tools, we must ensure we don’t create more friction, but instead find ways to add value to their businesses. The first step is ensuring trusted interactions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>…</p>

<p>Governments are always going to be concerned about national security.</p>



<p>China’s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/">passing</a>&nbsp;of its Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) is an example of a national government recognizing that the amount of personal data collected by non-government online services and mobile apps is at the point where it can be a rich data source for a national security adversary.</p>



<p>The risk focus has moved to private enterprise and the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">internet economy</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>&nbsp;sector of that makes national security more challenging. China recognizes this in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2021/08/pipl-a-game-changer-for-companies-in-china/">PIPL</a>, which comes into effect on November 1, 2021. President Biden recognized it in his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/biden-administration-initiatives-national-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity announcements</a>&nbsp;in July.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What this tells us is we’re all moving in the same direction. It’s not only us here at&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;but national governments around the globe that clearly see the national security risks of personal data storage, transfer and processing by private enterprise.</p>



<p>Surveillance capitalism is the root of the problem for every country. We’re fighting the same enemy, just in different wars.</p>



<p>Postscript: We’ll be closely following commentary and analysis of China’s new PIPL. At time of writing the full English translation had not been released. We&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/analyzing-chinas-pipl-and-how-it-compares-to-the-eus-gdpr/">know</a>&nbsp;the PIPL is broad-ranging, comprehensive, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/china-s-new-data-privacy-law-sweeping-and-serious-avoid-high-cost-noncompliance">described</a>&nbsp;as “the world’s harshest data privacy law.” It’s modelled on the&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>&nbsp;but will be stricter in its standards and penalties. The PIPL deals with personal data from national security and public interest perspectives. Together with China’s Data Security Law and Cybersecurity Law, the PIPL forms an overarching data protection&nbsp;<a href="https://fpf.org/blog/chinas-new-comprehensive-data-protection-law-context-stated-objectives-key-provisions/">framework</a>.&nbsp;</p>

We encourage the $OCEAN ecosystem to apply or reapply AND to vote! Thank you to all of the participants, voters, and proposers.</p> OceanDAO Round 10 Announcements and Guidelines  Round 10 Information <p>There is $530,000 USD in grant funding available in Round 10. The max request limit per proposal has now changed. Please find more details&nbsp;below:</p><p>Please Note: The amount requested is in USD, but the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline (October 5th at midnight GMT). This determines how many OCEAN will be awarded if a proposal is voted to receive a&nbsp;grant.</p><p>A total of $100,000, or approx. 19%, of “Total Round Funding Available” is earmarked for New Projects. Earmarked proposals are eligible for entire “Total Round Funding Available”; returning (general) grants are eligible for the remaining $430,000, or approx.&nbsp;81%.</p><p>As a builder, submit your project proposal on the <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-10/69">Round 10 Ocean Port Forum</a>. As a voter, this is where you can see all the expanded proposal details to make an informed vote decision.</p><p>Additionally, you can check out the OceanDAO <a href="https://bit.ly/Round10Proposals">Round 10 Proposal Submission Dashboard</a> to see all the proposals in one place as they are submitted.</p><p>The grant proposals from the <a href="http://vote.oceanprotocol.com">snapshot ballot</a> that meet these criteria are selected to receive their Funding Amount Requested (in OCEAN) to foster positive value creation for the overall Ocean Protocol ecosystem.</p> Project Levels &amp; Funding&nbsp;Tiers <p>To improve funding effectiveness, OceanDAO continues to increase access to funding. After the introduction of the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a>, teams have been working to reconcile their grant deliverables, and complete their proposals.</p><p>To continue incentivising completion and outcomes, we are introducing Project Levels, which can be acquired by Teams delivering on their grant promises. Below are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects for OceanDAO Grants Round&nbsp;10.</p>  Teams applying for their first time — $20,000&nbsp;USD  Teams who have completed 1–2 proposals — $20,000&nbsp;USD  Teams who have completed 3+ proposals — $50,000&nbsp;USD  <p>Make sure to update your Project Deliverables to remain in a good standing, and to continue accessing larger grant amounts. Important note: existing Projects will only be able to participate in the Voting process if their project is in a “Completed” or “Funds Returned” standing.</p> Project Standings &gt; 1Team-1Proposal <p>A key focus in OceanDAO is improving ROI Transparency. With the introduction of [<a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standings</a>], each project reconciles their grant deliverables and outcomes with the DAO to access greater funding.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> Introducing DREAM (Dynamic Resource Entitlement and Access Management) 
<p>Paradigm for managing all access of everyone and everything to all resources consistently in a multi-cloud multi-hybrid environment. Policy-based, automated, consuming the current state of services &amp; infrastructure. Shifting from identity &amp; security siloes to a holistic, integrated concept. Start tactically now with CIEM, PAM, etc., but go on to strategic measures.</p>
<p>Managing identities, managing entitlements, and managing access has become way more complex than ever before, in dynamic, multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environments. In the past, servers and applications were rather static, and entitlements too were static. But this has changed. Entitlements and access in today’s cloud environments are dynamic, just like workloads.</p>
<p>Additionally, most organizations must deal with a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT. Different clouds, such as Microsoft Azure, AWS, or GCP, are very different in the way they deal with and manage identities, resources, access, and entitlements. With private clouds, managed IT, Edge Computing, and on-premises IT, different approaches on delivering IT are there to be managed, all different in the technology as well as the split between provider and tenant responsibilities.</p>
 Security as Code Can’t Be the Answer 
<p>However, the answer can’t be in security as code, because this would require developers to care for security (and infrastructure management), instead of setting the focus on their specialized skills and letting them work on what they are best in. The answer also can’t be in having specialized solutions for different parts of the IT environment, such as cloud-only approaches. Organizations need a comprehensive approach, covering the breadth and depth of their multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT reality.</p>
<p>DREAM takes this broader approach, beyond just cloud-focused management of entitlements and access, looking at all types of identities, workloads, and all elements of IT. Additionally, DREAM is well-integrated with SODAS and BASIS, delivering a comprehensive set of methods and models for moving to agile delivery of secure services in multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: DREAM integrates security &amp; identity across all parts of multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environments, closely aligned and integrated with service development, delivery &amp; operations as well as infrastructure management &amp; operations (KuppingerCole SODAS).</p>
 Cloud-First Approach Will not Lead to a Uniform Environment 
<p>As outlined, most organizations today have a mix of different types of IT. While “cloud first” is a valid strategy, it will not lead to a uniform environment. While the ratio of cloud workloads will (and must) grow over time, it will be multi-cloud and thus not uniform. Edge Computing appeared as a response to the need to shift workloads back closer to the on-premise environment. However, there was a reason for private clouds to appear, as well as for keeping parts of IT on-premises.</p>
<p>In manufacturing and other industries, on-premises IT will never disappear. Multi-cloud, multi-hybrid is the reality, here to stay. It will differ in the ratios of what is done where, but it will not disappear for many organizations, and the shift will be slow (slower than frequently expected) and gradual for most organizations.</p>
<p>This requires, as described in KuppingerCole SODAS (Secure Operations &amp; Development of Agile Services), an integrated approach to development, infrastructure management, operations, and security &amp; identity. DREAM focuses on the Security &amp; Identity layer within that concept and how to manage identities, entitlements, and access uniformly across the entire IT, powered by policy-based automation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: DREAM focuses on IAM, including CIEM, Access Governance, and PAM, as well as Cybersecurity and SOAR, and aligns with the other elements of a modern IT stack for delivering agile, secure services.</p>
 Managing Identities and Entitlements with the DREAM Approach 
<p>DREAM is an approach for managing all types of identities, both human and non-human. Human identities span everyone from the consumer to the employee, while non-human identities cover devices, things, services, resources, etc., as well as the complex relationships between the various types of identities.</p>
<p>DREAM focuses on managing entitlements and unifying this management across different environments such as the various public clouds, private clouds, VM (virtual machine) environments, and servers in traditional IT.</p>
<p>Based on a comprehensive , uniform approach, it puts identity and security in one responsibility and a unified technical solution, also enabling consistent governance across the entire IT environment. This also includes supporting modern concepts such as SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) that build on SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), and monitoring what happens in terms of security across all of IT as well as reacting to this.</p>
 DREAM Integrates CIEM, IGA, IAM, and PAM 
<p>DREAM also integrates concepts such as the evolving concept of CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management), IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration) as part of IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management), and PAM (Privileged Access Management) for supporting every identity, every entitlement, and the access across the entire breadth and depth of IT.</p>
<p>This requires utilizing information about the state of services, applications, resources, identities, etc. It builds on virtual repositories that gather and expose that information so that it can be analyzed – this is where AI &amp; ML come into play – and policy-based automation of the entire management of identities and security then build on these repositories.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 3: The key actions to take in delivering to the DREAM model.</p>
<p>To move forward with DREAM, the first step is – if not already done – the de-siloing of IT. Don’t treat cloud differently from on-premises or private clouds. Don’t split responsibilities. Workloads might run here or there, they will shift. For application and service delivers, you need a unified approach. You need it even more for comprehensive, strong security and efficient management of identities and access, and, last but not least, for (access) governance, complying with regulations, and mitigating risks. This initial step also requires a portfolio assessment and gap analysis, to understand what you have, what you need in addition, and what you should best retire.</p>
<p>From there, based on a vision involving the KuppingerCole models for Identity Fabrics and Security Fabrics, you need to define the target architecture, a roadmap that evolves over time, the guardrails, and the policies and processes.</p>
 Running DREAM Environments 
<p>Roll-out should be tactical and phased, focusing on fixing the critical challenges first. This might include opting for a specialized CIEM solution first (even while most already go well beyond cloud only, and beyond infrastructure entitlements only) to fix the pressing challenges of managing entitlements and access in the dynamic, volatile cloud environments.</p>
<p>But all should be done with the vision and target architecture in mind, not as tactical, isolated, non-integrated activities. DREAM will evolve continually. For more efficient management, and again being part of unification as described in KuppingerCole BASIS, this also involves shifting delivery of traditional workloads to a service model – making your traditional IT work as if it were another cloud.</p>
<p>In running DREAM environments, policy-based automation is at the core. It is about shifting to well-defined policies (proposed and optimized by AI and ML) that work on the dynamic data, instead of manual administration. This limits errors and increases speed in responding to permanent changes in the agile IT of today. It is also the foundation for governance and consistent security operations, and automated response across the IT environments.</p>
<p>Guiding principles for DREAM:</p>
 
 Business requests IT Services 
 Unified view on IT Services – one IT, across multi-hybrid, multi-cloud environments 
 Policy-based automation instead of manual administration or coding 
 Development is agile, consuming identity &amp; security APIs, delivering status/requirements back to central repositories, and to the operations management to be ready supporting new and changing applications and services 
 Automation of identity, security and infrastructure setup &amp; management 
 
<p>Our recommendation is to think beyond solutions that cover just multi-cloud, but integrate across multi-cloud multi-hybrid IT. Focus also on integration with the IAM and PAM (Privileged Access Management) infrastructure you have in place. Look at the overarching DevSecOps (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/devsecops-sodas-secure-operations-development-of-agile-services">KuppingerCole SODAS</a>) model; and the model for agile service delivery in a modern, multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/it-for-the-digital-age-introducing-basis-business-driven-agile-secure-it-as-a-service">KuppingerCole BASIS</a>) for a comprehensive approach.</p>

We’ve all heard the refrain….no-one cares about privacy anymore. I confess, that sometimes I feel the same way, particularly when I see my own family members oblivious to what they are sharing. I’ve even done it myself. Then I realise that it’s not that they don’t care about data privacy, it’s just they don’t have any agency to do anything about it.




 




I recently gave a talk at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021">Kuppinger Cole European Identity Conference 2021</a> so had cause to dig into this question afresh. If the newspaper and magazine headlines are anything to go by then data privacy is still very much a live issue.




 





  





 




But what about real people? Surely there must be some examples that would help. I looked at two recent events that could act as a litmus test of public sentiment. The first was Apple’s decision as part of its update to iOS 14.5 that allowed users, for the first time, to control whether or not to allow apps to track their data.




 





  





 




Pretty convincing data but maybe it was skewed towards Apple users. Maybe if I looked at something more serious like helping to fight the Covid pandemic, I’d see a completely different picture?




 





  





 




According to the latest Edelman Trust Barometer, even fighting a Global pandemic is not sufficient reason to share data. The willingness to share data to Governments to help contain Covid has actually decreased over the last 12 months. Perhaps not surprising given how some Governments have not been too adept in handling privacy concerns<a>[1]</a>.&nbsp; Finally, I was convinced by some latest research by KPMG – <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2021/bridging-the-trust-chasm.html">Corporate Data Responsibility</a> – in August 2021. The research was conducted in the US but I suspect can be translated across the world. One set of statistics stood out:




 





  





 




The compelling data and research suggest that my original question now needs to be reframed. People most certainly do care about their data privacy. The question now is: how are organisations going to bridge this data privacy chasm?




 




This a real opportunity for organisations to step up and take a lead. An opportunity for organisations to action rebuilding trust and becoming data sustainable for the future. There are some immediate steps every organisation should start with:




 




• Analyse your own ethics around data collection and use. Consider implementing a code of data ethics.




 




•  Be transparent and explicit around data collection and use and do it in a way that is upfront, easy and clear for everyone to understand.




 




•  Consider using privacy enhancing technologies to anonymise data or make use of synthetic data.




 




•  Give people access and control over their data empowering them to gain value and equity by sharing.




 




People openly admit they don’t know how to protect their personal data and they are rightly peeved that organisations aren’t doing much to help.




 




Take the lead now in establishing corporate data responsibility.

<p>AERGONAUTS And KLAYswap: The Great Listing: What Does This Mean For AERGONAUTS?</p><p>AERGO, one of the largest hybrid blockchains based out of South Korea, is going to be listed on KLAYswap, a decentralized crypto asset finance protocol that enables users to provide liquidity and garner rewards. KLAYswap is a complete and automated on-chain swap protocol that operates and leverages on-chain liquidity pools. Liquidity is guaranteed through automated market making mechanisms. KLAYswap enables on-chain swap services for any KLAY or KCT-type token cryptocurrency to become a liquid provider and earn passive income from transaction fee commissions. For AERGOnauts, this enables AERGO token holders to participate in a passive income paradigm simply by utilizing the KLAYswap platform. Now how does this on-chain swap work, it is enabled through a specific innovation, known as the Orbit&nbsp;Bridge.</p><p>On KLAYswap, ERC-20 tokens can be transferred throughout the Klaytn ecosystem via a technological innovation known as the Orbit Bridge, a transparent and immutable bridge built on Orbit Chain which in return offers yield farming with assets that were previously disconnected and unable to communicate with one another before the inception of such an innovation. KLAYswap is built on one of the most prominent and secure blockchain protocols within the realm of cryptocurrency, the Klaytn ecosystem, which was created by Kakao. Kakao is one of the most publicly traded Fin-Tech companies in South Korea and has a market capitalization of approximately 30 billion dollars. KakaoTalk is utilized by over 90% of the South Korean populace and KakaoTaxi is the most widely used transportation service throughout the country. AERGO, with a massive foothold within South Korea, has been successfully able to partner with Klaytn and through this partnership, AERGO will have increased liquidity, immutability and the ability for investors to garner passive income by participating in liquidity pools on the&nbsp;network.</p>AERGO And KLAYswap: The Specifics Of The&nbsp;Event<p>The AERGO Listing: What This Means For AERGONAUTS and The Klay Community: The Great&nbsp;Airdrop</p><p>AERGO is one of the largest blockchains within South Korea, with an extremely development team that has been actively been working with KLAYswap and Orbit Bridge. Today, we’re excited to announce that AERGO will be listed on KLAYswap and an airdrop event will occur as a result of this enhancement of liquidity on KLAYswap! The KAERGO-KLAY LP will airdrop over 300,000 KAERGO tokens to all liquidity providers of the KAERGO-KLAY LP. Wallets that provide liquidity to the KAERGO-KLAY pools will be distributed KAERGO on the basis of the share ratio of that specific wallet. AERGONAUTS will notice that KAERGO is linked to the Orbit Bridge chain that enhances interoperability and communication between chains that have been integrated into the platform; this includes AERGO.

<p>This summer, we’ve been iterating through an article intended to talk
about the success that Blockchain Commons has had working with the Wyoming
legislature to help to define a first-in-the-country legal definition
of digital identity.</p>

<p>The Digital Identity Working Group for the Wyoming Select Committee on
Blockchain meets again next week, on September 21-22, 2021. I will be
providing testimony there at 2pm MST. As a result, we’ve decided to
release the current draft of this article on digital identity and how
Wyoming has defined it using Principal Authority, with the goal of
helping to shape the agenda for digital identity for the next year,
both in Wyoming and elsewhere.</p>

<p>—Christopher Allen</p>

 

<p>In 2016, I wrote <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign
Identity”</a>
to talk about the historic evolution from centralized identity to
user-centric identity and to define the next step: a self-sovereign
digital identity that was controlled by the user, not some third party.
In it I also offered <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md">10 Self-Sovereign Identity
Principles</a>
which have been widely accepted by the decentralized identity community.</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity has matured and grown considerably since, as I
chronicled in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">“Self-Sovereign Identity: Five Years
On”</a>.
There are now specifications, products, and entire companies supporting
the concept. However, recent legal efforts to define self-sovereign
identity may be just as important for catapulting it into the mass
market.</p>

 Defining Identity 

<p>Defining identity is by no means easy. That core topic could encompass a
paper much longer than this. The following are some various definitions
of identity drawn from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/glossary-primer.md">RWOT
Glossary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Identifier: A label that refers to an entity and can be used to establish or maintain an identity. For example, a name or UID.</p>

  <p>Identity: A conceptual construct that enables the differentiation between distinct entities that are individually considered to be unique, but which may possess class or group characteristics. An identity gives these entities the ability to interact as peers in collaborative or competitive ways. It is not the entity that it represents.</p>

  <p>Identity, Digital: A digital representation of an entity, managed by digital tools, over which that entity has personal or delegated control.</p>

  <p>Identity, Functional: How we recognize, remember and respond to specific people and things.</p>

  <p>SSI: Self-sovereign identity. A decentralized digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and whose information is portable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Digital identity is just one aspect of a complex, interconnected web of
different digital models. It’s not the same thing as identification
(where you prove you are a distinct entity with unique characteristics),
authentication (where you prove you were the same entity as before), or
personal data (which is information related to an identified or
identifiable entity).</p>

<p>Those other elements all need to be considered, but it’s digital
identity, and now self-sovereign identity, that gives us the linchpin to
do so.</p>

 Turning Digital Identity into Law 

<p>For self-sovereign identity to truly achieve international success, I
feel that it needs to not just be embraced by the technological sector,
but also to have a basis in law. In recent years, I’ve been progressing
toward that goal through work with various state and national
legislatures.</p>

<p>Collaborating with the Wyoming legislature has borne the first fruit.
This year they passed
<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">SF0039</a> on digital
identity, which the Governor signed into law and which went into effect
on July 1, 2021. It defines digital identity as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(xviii) “Personal digital identity” means the intangible digital
representation of, by and for a natural person, over which he has
principal authority and through which he intentionally communicates or
acts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So where’s the self-sovereign identity in that?</p>

<p>As with much legislation, it’s all about the careful selection of words.</p>

 Defining Principal Authority 

<p>To understand how Principal Authority relates to self-sovereign identity
requires insight into what Principal Authority is. The concept comes out
of English Common law. It appears in most Commonwealth countries but has
also found its way into the laws of other countries, including the
United States. It’s primarily used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency">Laws of
Agency</a>, an area of
commercial law where an agent is empowered to take on certain tasks.</p>

<p>As the name would suggest, Principal Authority first requires a
Principal: a person or entity. It then requires that entity have
Authority: some power. Principal Authority is thus the power derived
from a person or entity, which they can use or which they can delegate
out to others. When applied to digital identity, Principal Authority
says that a Principal has Authority over his identity — which is a clear
restatement of self-sovereign principles.</p>

<p>In fact, the recognition of a Principal is itself a statement of the
first of the principles of self-sovereign identity: existence. It
asserts that digital identity is always a representation of an actual
entity, who predates any digital representation, and who is also the
first and foremost beneficiary of that representation.</p>

<p>However, in drawing on the Laws of Agency, the concepts of Principal and
Principal Authority go beyond that. Because the person at the heart of
an identity has the ultimate power to control the self-sovereign digital
representation that they’ve created (and/or that they use), this means
that any others who exert Principal Authority over that identity data
are doing so only as agents of the Principal.</p>

<p>By focusing on Agency, the concept of Principal Authority also ensures
that the Principal always has the ability to revoke their delegation to
the agents whom they have temporarily offered Authority regarding their
identity. This is a requirement for other self-sovereign principles such
as portability, and it’s a real necessity in the digital world, where
we might need to delete personal data or to cancel Terms &amp; Conditions
that we signed without real, informed consent.</p>

<p>Altogether, this new definition of Principal Authority adds a lot of
nuance to self-sovereign identity, and much of that comes thanks to the
implicit incorporation of Agency.</p>

 Defining Control 

<p>In saying that a Principal has the ultimate authority to control their
digital identity, care also needs to be taken to define what that
control means. It means that a Principal has (or can delegate) the
Principal Authority to identify as that identity; to authenticate as
that identity; and to know the contents of the data held by that
identity.</p>

<p>However, any digital identity also exists as part of a larger ecosystem,
and the Principal does not have control over the larger ecosystem. They
cannot control how other entities rate, rank, or note the reputation
of their identity; and they cannot control comments, flags, or other
notes that other entities might attach to their identity.</p>

<p>Further, a Principal cannot necessarily prevent other entities from
creating new digital identities related to them, which may or may not
link to an existing identity. (Though states are increasingly
recognizing the limits of voluntary disclosure of information, digital
identity laws will ultimately never prevent a police station from
creating their own identity record related to a criminal, or a civic
authority from creating government-related identity records.)</p>

<p>In other words, self-sovereign identity, and the establishment of
Principal Authority over it, lays down boundaries for what the Principal
controls — boundaries that are much wider than those established for
digital identities controlled by third parties. However, those
boundaries still exist.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, control of a digital identity means that the Principal
can expect to maintain the continuity of that identity for as long as
they see fit, but in doing so must accept the battle scars inflicted by
interactions in a larger ecosystem that are implicit to the identity
itself.</p>

 Agents &amp; Their Duty 

<p>The ability to delegate Principal Authority, as revealed by the Laws of
Agency, may be as crucial to self-sovereign identity as the concept of a
Principal itself. It allows the empowerment of agents by a Principal —
who might be physical agents or, in the increasingly digital world,
virtual agents. But, it also institutes the core requirement that those
agents be working for the good of the Principal when they are exerting
Principal Authority over the identity holder’s identity data.</p>

<p>This concept of “duty” is crucial to the Laws of Agency. Duty requires
that an Agent only use their delegated Principal Authority as the
Principal requests, in a way that benefits the Principal, and with care
and due diligence, while frequently reporting back what they’ve done.</p>

<p>This is a notable change from the way that digital identities have been
treated traditionally. Compare that to banks, who represent you in
financial transactions, and then sell your spending data; compare that
to Facebook, who collects as much personally identifiable data and other
information as you’re willing to give them, then sells that to
advertisers; or compare it to Google, who infers personally identifiable
and demographic data based on the information you input into their tools
and the choices you make. In large part, you don’t even know what these
identity representatives and data holders are doing. In the world before
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">Europe’s GDPR</a> or <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California’s
CCPA</a>, you had little input into their
actions. Even now, with those early and rough attempts to protect
digital self-sovereignty, you’re typically opting-out, not opting-in —
which is barely agency at all —&nbsp;and you’re still not protected against
people who are self-serving nor those who are inferring information from
scattered pieces of data.</p>

<p>That’s because any duties currently required of the entities to whom you
grant agency over your data are quite minimal. Maybe there’s a duty of
privacy, maybe there’s a duty of safety, but in general they don’t need
to work in your best interest. That’s why we need to ensure that new
definitions of digital identity, particularly self-sovereign identity,
follow the Laws of Agency in ways that our current systems do not.</p>

<p>This sort of agent agreement needs to be part of delegation. To date,
this has been true to a limited extent with federation protocols such as
SAML and Oauth, but that needs to be extended to every person. Wyoming’s
digital-identity law is the first example of legislation that focuses on
Agency in this way, and that’s much of its power.</p>

<p>However, this isn’t a simple issue. Even with Agency-focused
legislation, we need to determine a source for duties. This article will
try to outline some of them, using not just the traditional duties of
agents, but also the self-sovereign principles themselves. However, it’s
a mere starting point, with a stronger legal foundation required.</p>

 Principal Authority &amp; The State 

<p>Before defining duties, it’s important to note one other interesting
element of Principal Authority and its foundation in Agency: it focuses
not just on a single person’s authority, but also on their ability to
delegate to and require duties from other entities. In other words, it’s
a peer-to-peer relationship; this relationship works within the context
of a state who recognizes the concept of Principal Authority, respects
its ability to enable Agency, and enforces its established duties.</p>

<p>However, though the state is involved, this peer-to-peer relationship
still lies in stark contrast to traditional property law, where property
is always in some way beholden to the state: the state might be the
original source for property, they might be able to reclaim it by
eminent domain, and they might be able to seize it through asset
forfeiture. Those ideas all run counter to the idea of self-sovereignty
— which is yet another reason that we choose to focus on the Agency of
Principal Authority, not property law, as the core legal metaphor for
self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Restating the Self-Sovereign Principles 

<p>The use of Principal Authority to empower self-sovereign identity
provides a legal foothold for many of my original 10 principles.</p>

<p>What follows is a restatement of the self-sovereign principles that
reorganizes the original ten as rights and duties that are suggested by
customs, expectations, and best practices, but which need to be better
codified to become true duties. It also proposes five additional duties
that could come from customs implicit in the Laws of Agency.</p>

<p>Together, these ideas may allow us to both better understand how to turn
the self-sovereign principles into concrete usage and also to more
easily translate them into duties bound by legislation.</p>

 The Rights of Self-Sovereign Authority 

<p>Some principles of self-sovereign identity are implicit in the idea of
a Principal.</p>

 
   Existence. The definition of Principal requires that there be a real entity at an identity’s heart. 
   Control. The definition of Principal Authority says that the Principal always retains control of an identity, within specifically defined boundaries, no matter who is holding it at a particular time. 
   Persistence. Because of their uncontested Principal Authority, a Principal may decide to have an identity last for as long as they see fit. 
   Consent. Anything that happens within the defined boundaries of the digital identity is implicitly with the consent of the Principal, who may delegate or revoke Principal Authority at any time. 
 

<p>Self-sovereign rights recognize that an identity exists to benefit its
Principal. These core principles likely derive explicitly from a
definition of digital identity such as that created by the Wyoming
legislature.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>The remaining principles of self-sovereign identity can be stated as
duties owed to a Principal by an agent who has been granted Principal
Authority over an identity for certain purposes.</p>

 
   Access. An agent must provide the Principal with access to data related to their digital identity. 
   Transparency. An agent must be open about how they will administer a digital identity. 
   Portability. An agent must make a digital identity portable upon the request of the Principal. 
   Interoperability. An agent must use standard, interoperable protocols when making an identity portable, and should also use those interoperable protocols when interacting with other identity systems. 
   Minimization. An agent must minimize the data collected, stored, transmitted, and shared regarding an identity so that it only includes data that is strictly necessary in the context of a request made by the Principal. 
   Protection. An agent must place the protection of the identity above their own needs or desires. 
 

<p>Identity duties says that agents will tell you how they’re using your
identity, use it in the most minimalist way possible, and make it easy
for you to reclaim the identity. However, legislation may be required to
turn these best practices into duties bound by law.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Agents 

<p>The idea of Principal Authority itself suggests additional duties that
were not included on the original list of principles of self-sovereign
identity, but which are generally defined in the Laws of Agency to be
due from agents to Principals.</p>

 
   Specificity. An Agent will use Principal Authority to serve specific tasks as instructed by the Principal, or as required by Custom, and do nothing more with an identity. 
   Responsibility. An agent will serve those tasks with reasonable care and skill, with due diligence, and without further delegation. 
   Representation. An agent will act in the best interests of the Principal, without secret profit, and will not take on other responsibilities that might conflict with that. 
   Fidelity. An agent will serve those tasks in good faith. 
   Disclosure. An agent will maintain accounts and report their actions back to the Principal. 
 

<p>Agent duties say that agents will be trustworthy in their use of your
identity. These duties are more likely to implicitly be a part of any
legislation that was built atop the Laws of Agency.</p>

 Taking the Next Steps 

<p>Wyoming’s definition of personal digital identity helps us to lay more
foundation for self-sovereign identity, but it’s still just a starting
point.</p>

<p>There’s more to do.</p>

 Laws of Custom 

<p>To start with, the Laws of Agency are largely built on Laws of Custom,
which are as likely to be common law as any formally codified
legislation. When creating new laws related to self-sovereign identity,
we’ll be creating new Laws of Customs for the digital frontier, an area
that’s so fresh that the tradition of customs has been limited.</p>

<p>This creates real challenges, as we must decide what customs we want to
create and then we must develop them from common law to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_law">legal
customs</a> to (eventually)
codified duties. We can integrate these with the Laws of Agency, and we
can figure out how that interrelates with old common laws such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_(law)">Use Laws</a>. We may even need
special courts to set these common laws and achieve remedies, such as
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Chancery">Court of
Chancery</a>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, there’s a lot of work to be done here; recognizing the
existence of a Principal and the use of delegatable Principal Authority
bound by the Laws of Agency is just a starting place. New customs, even
though understood as best practices, will not automatically become legal
duties.</p>

 Open Questions 

<p>Beyond that, I’m not a lawyer. There may be other legal elements that
can support our definition of digital identity. Are there additional
duties that we could bring in? Are there fiduciary or agency laws that
we could leverage? Are there other legal models of interest we can draw
from, such as the UNCITRAL Model Law of Electronic Commerce approach,
which says that “The actions, promises, rights and obligations of a
person shall not be denied legal validity on the sole ground they are
effectuated through their digital identity”? These possibilities need to
be studied, preferably with the help of legal experts.</p>

<p>Even once we’ve fully defined digital identity, we still must consider
how digital identity may need to be more carefully protected. Are there
ways we can give specific protection to private keys used for signatures
and to express authority? Can we protect against the theft of private
keys that might allow impersonation or false witness? Can we prevent the
misuse of digital biometric or genetic information? Can we protect
against other “crimes of authority”?</p>

<p>There’s also a flipside: digital identity should give us some new
advantages not found in traditional identity. For example, there have
always been problems with individuals with low market power being at a
disadvantage when negotiating with larger parties. Can new digital
identity laws help start to resolve that imbalance?</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>One of the most important steps going forward will be to continue
working with the Digital Identity subcommittee in the Wyoming
legislature. However, I’d also welcome discussions with other states and
nations, to ensure that we have great definitions of digital identity
that support self-sovereign identity everywhere.</p>

<p>If this is important to you too, consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">supporting Blockchain
Commons</a> to make this a
reality.</p>

  <p>Our approach to security across all aspects of our lives has changed considerably over the last 20 years. From firewalls to the cloud, Max Faun explores how security technology has evolved since the start of the millennium.</p>
<p>One size no longer fits all but everything does come down to trust, or lack of it! Is Zero Trust the way forward for an identity-centric secure future?&nbsp;Max looks at four pillars that businesses and individuals can apply to gain trust back and reap the benefits.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Hybrid IT environments are full of secrets, like tokens, passwords, certificates and encryption keys that open access to mission-critical information. The emergence of concepts like Zero Trust authentication, Just-in-Time access and Zero Standing Privileges suggests that these access secrets don’t need to be permanent. Instead they can be created on the fly and made to expire automatically, paving way for the future where secrets or passwords no longer need to be managed and vaulted at all.</p>
<p>SSH.COM's CTO, Miikka Sainio, explores how reducing the number of permanent secrets enterprises manage in dynamic environments improves security, operational velocity cost-efficiency. He also discusses why managing and vaulting secrets is still a necessary phase in many cases when companies adopt modern and future-proof methods.</p>
