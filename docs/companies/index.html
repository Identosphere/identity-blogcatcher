   Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies. The engine is able to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering, and construction.

  <p>Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_Technologies">Unity Technologies</a>. The engine is able to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering, and construction.</p>

<p>Identity security is a key concept that is mostly missing in Unity. In fact, most engines today do not provide solutions for securing identity, authenticating users, and authorizing users. The industry has instead traditionally relied on custom-built solutions and/or delegated auth from other products, like game stores. As the industry advances beyond anonymous consumption of video games, into massively interconnected online projects, or professional XR use cases such as ArchViz and simulation, new requirements have appeared for authentication and authorization.</p>

<p>In gaming, use cases tend to depend on the project itself. A single-player game really only needs to focus on protecting its own intellectual property from theft. Using a game store’s authorization—as is common today—is more than enough for this use case. Even the introduction of microtransactions can stay secure with just a store if these transactions are being handled by that store. However, once the project gets to a point where a user’s client needs to authenticate a user and authorize that user to one or multiple servers, the solutions provided by stores fall short. It gets even more complicated when users are actually making purchases or entering personal information into your game client directly. Once the game gets to a more complex level of interconnectivity, and once users are trusting you with private information and financial information, proper identity security is paramount.</p>

<p>With XR use cases, the concept is similar to what is described above for gaming—especially if the project is a VR game—however professional XR projects open up a whole new area of interest. Professional projects such as ArchViz, or simulations done for security or scientific application, need to protect the intellectual property within the project itself, and the user identity, just like games. However, more is potentially needed to handle authorization to specific aspects of the project results, as well as professional requirements to integrate or federate with other technologies used by these professionals.</p>

<p>The level of effort to build identity security from scratch is massive. Just to build a secure store for identity, authentication with basic username/password, authorization via OAuth, and basic security policy, it takes a large team months. When you account for keeping the tech up to date with new standards, compliance with standards such as PCI, compliance with GDPR, complex multi-factor authentication, and complex authorization rules, it becomes apparent that the work is not a one-time effort and it is not easy. Rather than spend countless development cycles focusing on identity security—when the team should be focused on the core project itself—it is much easier and more secure to leave it to the experts. Okta is the most advanced identity platform on the market today and represents the best of class solution for developers, including Game/XR developers creating within Unity.</p>

 Core Concepts 

<p>Before we jump into Unity, it is important to understand what options exist to handle authentication and authorization of users within your project. The most common designs are in engine with native UI, in engine with OAuth via browser, external with native UI, and external with OAuth via browser. The other option, as previously mentioned, is to trust authorization from another product such as a game store.</p>

<p>The decision that needs to be addressed first is the balancing act that every security team must make between what is most secure and what has the best user experience. If the decision is that the project is not storing sensitive user data, then it is reasonable to focus on user experience. However, if there is even a slight risk that a data breach would negatively affect individual consumers, security must take the front seat.</p>

<p>When a project accepts authorization from another product, one that is not a security product like Okta, there is a huge risk with that trust. Risk that users are not being challenged properly with MFA, risk that standards and technology get out of date from what is standard in the security industry, and risk that user data is not being secured and passed correctly and safely. This is the risk represented by delegating security to a game store.</p>

<p>The most secure option would be to leverage OAuth2/OIDC either in the engine or externally in the project’s launcher. OAuth2/OIDC is the industry standard best practice for authorization/authentication. OAuth specification defines multiple different flows, or grants, but the most recommended for security is Auth Code with PKCE. You can read more about OAuth2 <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-overview/">here</a>. The complaint typically with OAuth, especially within a game engine directly, is that it traditionally leverages a browser and a hosted login experience. Okta provides a hosted login experience that is fully customizable via HTML/CSS and Unity is able to pop up a browser and receive tokens from it after authentication. How to do this will be described in this blog. What needs to be considered is if that user experience is acceptable for the project. The browser can also be embedded with different Unity browser plugins, found in the asset store, which might make the experience better because the user will not need to leave the game to interact with an external browser. OAuth is considered more secure because users are putting their credentials into a trusted browser and a trusted, secure, login page. Furthermore, the access token that is returned at the end of the authorization process is retrieved by code not running in a browser which means intercepting it is difficult to impossible.</p>

<p>Okta also supports a native UI experience both in engine or externally. This is a better user experience but considered potentially less secure because the project’s code is now required to accept a password from a user, properly handle it in a secure way from start to finish, and be secure enough that it can’t be exploited by bad actors or rogue software. Essentially you take all of the risk onto yourself to handle the information from the user with care. This concept also requires a bit more work in UI development because the UI will be entirely built in engine and Okta would be interacted with via API only. This option will be reviewed in this blog as well.</p>

<p>In order to help visualize the difference between these concepts, this blog will show you how to build for Native UI and OAuth via browser in engine. These same concepts can also be applied to external solutions, such as a launcher. developer.okta.com contains countless guides and blogs that can assist further with the external use case.</p>

 Create the Project 

<p>Get started by creating a new project in Unity Hub. Select 3D and give the project a name.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Unity will take a moment to set everything up and open the project. Once open, click Assets &gt; Import Package and select the <code>OktaSDK.unitypackage</code> file. The Okta Auth SDK will be used for the Native UI design. The SDK is not required for OAuth. A <a href="https://okta.box.com/s/m5q2ucervn03cbzu5dpgzx2vxmeg3xph">Okta SDK Unity Package</a> has been provided with this guide to simplify this process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-dotnet">Okta SDK for .NET</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-dotnet">Okta Auth SDK for .NET</a> can be found on GitHub and NuGet. However, Unity does not work well with NuGet and compiling from source should not be necessary. If manual installation is desired, there are numerous dependencies that NuGet would normally add to a project with the SDK. These dependencies will need to be manually downloaded and added to Unity. <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet Gallery</a> is recommended for this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Make sure all libraries are selected and click Import. This will create a Plugins folder inside the Assets folder which is how Unity knows to import the .NET libraries as <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingDLL.html">managed plugins</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click on the Asset Store tab in the editor and search for <code>Unity Samples: UI.</code> This example asset was created by Unity Technologies as a learning asset, teaching best practices for building UI’s inside of Unity. For this guide, we will leverage this UI to build our login experience.</p>

<p>Click Import and import all of the assets in the package.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once the import process is complete, click on the Scenes folder and open the <code>Menu 3D</code> scene. Click Play to run the project and make sure that the UI is properly functioning.</p>

<p>Save 2 copies of this scene, one for <code>Native</code>, and one for <code>OAuth</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 Native: Build the Auth Menu 

<p>Open the example scene saved for the Native experience.</p>

<p>The UI sample asset does not come with any type of input field. We will need input fields for a <code>Username</code> box and a <code>Password</code> box. To create a new Input Field object:</p>

 
   Open the <code>Prefabs</code> folder 
   Duplicate the SF Button object (Ctrl + D) 
   Rename the duplicate object SF InputField 
   Delete the label element out of the object 
   Click the GameObject menu &gt; UI &gt; InputField 
   Position the new InputField where the label element was 
   Switch the gizmo to scale and resize the InputField to fill out the box 
 

<p></p>

<p>Next, a new menu will be needed for the Auth Menu. The simplest way to create this is to duplicate the existing <code>MainMenu</code> object and customize it. To create the Auth Menu:</p>

 
   Select <code>MainMenu</code> and duplicate it (Ctrl + D). 
   With <code>MainMenu</code> still selected, click the checkbox in the inspector to disable it. This will make the <code>MainMenu</code> object disappear. 
   Rename the duplicated menu to <code>AuthMenu</code>. 
   Delete the <code>Continue</code> and <code>New Game</code> objects 
   Rename the <code>Settings</code> object to <code>Next</code> 
   Drag in 2 of the InputField prefabs and rename them to <code>Username</code> and <code>Password</code> respectively. 
   Expand the <code>Password</code> object and click on the InputField object. In the Inspector, scroll down to Content Type and change to Password. 
   Change <code>Username's</code> position PosY to 70, and change <code>Password's</code> PosY to 0. 
   Expand the <code>Username</code> object, expand the InputField, select Placeholder, and change the text to <code>Username</code>. Do this for the <code>Password</code> object next. 
   With <code>AuthMenu</code> still selected, click the checkbox in the inspector to disable it. This will make the <code>AuthMenu</code> disappear. 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click <code>MenuManager</code> and make sure it is enabled in the inspector. Find the <code>PanelManager</code> script component attached to the <code>MenuManager</code> object and double click to edit. This will open up the primary IDE configured in Unity.</p>

 Native: Authenticate with Okta 

<p>Reference the <code>Okta Auth SDK</code> by adding the following to the end of the using statements.</p>

   <code>using Okta.Auth.Sdk;
using Okta.Sdk.Abstractions.Configuration;
</code>   

<p>The login code will need to understand some of the elements in the menu to be able to interact with them. Expose public variables so that these elements can be configured in the editor. After the initiallyOpen Animator on line 11, add:</p>

   <code>public Animator authMenu;
public static bool isAuthenticated;

public InputField Username;
public InputField Password;
public string OktaDomain;
</code>   

<p><code>authMenu</code> will hold the <code>AuthMenu</code> object that was created earlier. <code>IsAuthenticated</code> will allow the UI to determine what to display. The two InputFields will hold the <code>Username</code> and <code>Password</code> InputField objects that were added to the Auth Menu. The <code>OktaDomain</code> string will hold the <code>Okta Developer Org URL</code>.</p>

<p>At line 38, inside the <code>OpenPanel</code> method, add:</p>

   <code>if (!isAuthenticated)
{
   anim = authMenu;
}
</code>   

<p>In <code>OpenPanel</code>, anim is the variable holding what UI panel to open. If authentication is required or has not been completed, we always want to override whatever panel is in the process of opening and open the Auth Menu instead. This forces the user to log in when needed.</p>

<p>Next, create the <code>Login()</code> function that the <code>Next</code> button will call on click. At line 86 add:</p>

   <code>public async void Login()
{
   var client = new AuthenticationClient(new OktaClientConfiguration
   {
      OktaDomain = OktaDomain,
   });

   var authnOptions = new AuthenticateOptions()
   {
      Username = Username.text.ToString(),
      Password = Password.text.ToString(),
   };

   try
   {
      var authnResponse = await client.AuthenticateAsync(authnOptions);

      Debug.Log("Authentication Status: " + authnResponse.AuthenticationStatus);
      if (authnResponse.AuthenticationStatus == "SUCCESS")
      {
         //Store the token
         Debug.Log(authnResponse.SessionToken);
         isAuthenticated = true;

         OpenPanel(initiallyOpen);
      }
      else
      {
         //Handle Errors
         Debug.Log("Authentication Failed...");
      }
   }
   catch (System.Exception ex)
    {
      Debug.Log(ex.Message);
     }
 }
</code>   

<p>Save <code>PanelManager.cs</code> and switch back to Unity.</p>

<p>Make sure <code>MenuManager</code> is selected and notice the new properties in the <code>PanelManager</code> component attached to the <code>MenuManager</code> object. To configure the PanelManager, do the following:</p>

 
   Drag the <code>AuthMenu</code> object from the project hierarchy to the <code>authMenu</code> property in the inspector. 
   Drag the InputField from the <code>Username</code> object in the project hierarchy to the <code>Username</code> property in the inspector. 
   Drag the InputField from the <code>Password</code> object in the project hierarchy to the <code>Password</code> property in the inspector. 
   Enter the Okta domain from the Okta developer org “{yourOktaDomain}”. 
 

<p></p>

<p>Now, wire the <code>Next</code> button’s OnClick event to the <code>Login()</code> method in <code>PanelManager.cs</code>. Click the <code>Next</code> button object in the hierarchy window, find the On Click () section in the inspector windows and change the dropdown to PanelManager &gt; Login().</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Play to run the project and log in using user credentials for a user in the associated Okta Developer Org.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If Authentication was successful, a session token will appear along with the <code>SUCCESS</code> result coming from the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/">Okta AuthN API</a>.</p>

<p>Now that the client is able to authenticate users via basic auth, more advanced concepts can be added such as support for MFA and user account/profile management. This is done by adding logic to the code described in this guide that handles other authentication states within the Okta <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/">AuthN</a> API. The SDK is already able to handle these concepts which means that the additional code is needed only for the UI in Unity. This code is outside the scope of this blog but the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/">AuthN</a> API leveraged for this experience is documented on developer.okta.com</p>

 OAuth: Authenticate with Okta 

<p>Open the scene that was saved for the <code>OAuth</code> experience.</p>

<p>To protect the scene with OAuth, a simple GameObject is all that is needed. Create one by clicking GameObject and then Create New. Name this GameObject <code>OktaOAuth2</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>Assets</code> &gt; <code>Scripts</code> does not exist in the project, create a folder called <code>Assets</code> and a folder inside Assets called <code>Scripts</code>. Create a new cs script within the <code>Scripts</code> folder and name this script <code>OktaOAuth2.cs</code>. This script will be added to the GameObject and will force unauthorized users to authorize before interacting with the scene.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Edit <code>OktaOAuth2.cs</code>.</p>

<p>This example makes use of multiple libraries, all of which are included with .Net with the exception of Newtonsoft.Json. Start by adding the following references:</p>

   <code>using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.IO;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Sockets;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
</code>   

<p>Newtonsoft.Json is already included with the Okta SDK unity package. If this is already imported into the project, and a Plugins folder already exists with a Newtonsoft.Json.dll file inside, skip the next steps describing the manual installation of Newtonsoft.Json.</p>

<p>Next, go back to Unity and create a folder inside <code>Assets</code> called <code>Plugins</code>.</p>

<p>The easiest way to add Newtonsoft.Json to the Unity project is to manually download it and add it to the project. This is because Unity does not support Nuget directly.</p>

<p>Go to <code>nuget.org</code> and search <code>Newtonsoft</code>. <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/</a> Download the package and open it as a zip file. Open lib &gt; net20 and extract Newtonsoft.Json.dll to the <code>Plugins</code> folder in the Unity project.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go back to editing <code>OktaOAuth2.cs</code>.</p>

<p>Within the default class generated by Unity, create public variables to hold our Okta configuration information.</p>

   <code>// client configuration
public string clientID;
public string clientSecret;
public string authorizationEndpoint;
public string tokenEndpoint;
public string userInfoEndpoint;
</code>   

<p>In the <code>Start()</code> method, call <code>doOAuth()</code>, which is where we will process the OAuth logic.</p>

   <code>// Start is called before the first frame update
void Start()
{
   // Add logic to check current auth state and only doOAuth() when needed.
   doOAuth();
}
</code>   

<p><code>doOAuth()</code> will need to handle popping up a browser, redirecting the user for authentication, and receiving/validating access tokens upon return. How to design code in .Net for OAuth2 is a large topic and outside the scope of this blog. You can read more about OAuth2 <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-overview/">here</a> on developer.okta.com. For this example, I am providing code that I am using in my own project to help explain the concept.</p>

   <code>private async void doOAuth()

</code>   

<p>While the OAuth2 code can vary, so long as it follows spec, the part that is relevant for Unity is how to get the browser to appear and redirect the user to login.</p>

   <code>// Opens request in the browser.
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(authorizationRequest);
</code>   

<p>Passing a URL to <code>System.Diagnostics.Process.Start()</code> in Unity will launch a browser that can be used to log a user in. This part could be replaced with an <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/embedded-browser-55459">embedded browser</a> solution from the asset store to improve the user experience by keeping the user in the engine. However, the interaction with Okta would be the same.</p>

<p>The OAuth2 code provided does rely on a few helper methods around base64 encoding, cryptology, and logging.</p>

   <code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Appends the given string to the on-screen log, and the debug console.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="output"&gt;string to be appended&lt;/param&gt;
public void output(string output)
{
   Debug.Log(output);
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns URI-safe data with a given input length.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="length"&gt;Input length (nb. output will be longer)&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static string randomDataBase64url(uint length)
{
   RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
    byte[] bytes = new byte[length];
   rng.GetBytes(bytes);
   return base64urlencodeNoPadding(bytes);
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns the SHA256 hash of the input string.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="inputString"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static byte[] sha256(string inputString)
{
   byte[] bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(inputString);
   SHA256Managed sha256 = new SHA256Managed();
   return sha256.ComputeHash(bytes);
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Base64url no-padding encodes the given input buffer.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="buffer"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static string base64urlencodeNoPadding(byte[] buffer)
{
   string base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(buffer);

   // Converts base64 to base64url.
   base64 = base64.Replace("+", "-");
   base64 = base64.Replace("/", "_");
   // Strips padding.
   base64 = base64.Replace("=", "");

    return base64;
}
</code>   

<p>The most important logic still needed is calling out to UserInfo. UserInfo is an Open ID Connect defined endpoint that returns data on a user in exchange for a valid access token. Okta has the ability to add new data as claims to the access token itself so this may not be required, but if the goal is to keep the access token as light as possible, this type of introspection might be desired.</p>

   <code>async void userinfoCall(string access_token)
{
   output("Making API Call to Userinfo...");

   // sends the request
   HttpWebRequest userinfoRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(userInfoEndpoint);
   userinfoRequest.Method = "GET";
   userinfoRequest.Headers.Add(string.Format("Authorization: Bearer {0}", access_token));
   userinfoRequest.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
   //userinfoRequest.Accept = "Accept=text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8";

   // gets the response
   WebResponse userinfoResponse = await userinfoRequest.GetResponseAsync();
   using (StreamReader userinfoResponseReader = new StreamReader(userinfoResponse.GetResponseStream()))
   {
      // reads response body
      string userinfoResponseText = await userinfoResponseReader.ReadToEndAsync();
      output(userinfoResponseText);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Save the script and go back to Unity.</p>

<p>Click the <code>OktaOAuth2</code> GameObject and notice the public variables from the <code>OktaOAuth2.cs</code> script in the inspector.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, go to an Okta tenant, or create a new dev tenant at <code>developer.okta.com</code>, and log in.</p>

<p>Click on Applications &gt; Add Application and choose Web.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>This application is the representation of your OAuth2 client within Okta. Give the application a name and trust the local IP/Port that your client will be using to interact with Okta. By default, the sample code is set to <code>http://127.0.0.1:51772</code> where the IP is the client’s local IP address.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Done.</p>

<p>The next menu will be the General tab for the application’s settings menu. At the bottom of General, there is a section containing a <code>Client ID</code> and <code>Client Secret</code>. Copy these and paste them into the inspector for the <code>OktaOAuth2</code> GameObject in Unity.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>For the three endpoint URL’s, go back to Okta. In the top menu click API &gt; Authorization Servers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click default to open the default authorization server. Click the Metadata URI link.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Find the <code>authorization endpoint</code>, <code>token endpoint</code>, and <code>userinfo endpoint</code> urls, copy and paste into the <code>OktaOAuth2</code> GameObject inspector in Unity.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Fully log out of Okta and close the browser if possible before testing. Make sure the project is saved and run it. When the browser appears, log in. Close the browser when prompted and return to Unity. The console will contain tokens and claims for the user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The great thing about authenticating via OAuth2 and Okta’s hosted login widget is that the level of effort to build out the UI to support complex concepts like MFA is no longer required. Okta handles every aspect of authentication freeing up developers to focus on the project itself. Best of all, this hosted login experience can be fully customized. Everything from the domain of the page to its HTML and CSS is exposed within Okta so that users stay within your branded echo system.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To further enhance the example, code could be added to check a user’s authentication state on start of every scene or before secure actions are allowed. This is easily done by calling the <code>userinfoCall()</code> method from the example code. Simply save the access token on the user’s first login to a secure location, such as a vault, and check if there is a token on <code>Start()</code>. If a token exists, send it to the <code>userinfoCall()</code> method from the sample code and act on the results. If there is no token, or if the existing token is not valid, call <code>doOAuth()</code>.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Identity security is a very complex, but increasingly required, aspect of most game/XR projects today. The resource commitment required to build out all of the functionality needed, and then maintain and grow that functionality, is massive. When it’s done incorrectly it can be devastating. Leaving identity security to the experts and leveraging the best of breed Okta Identity Platform for all identity security needs in your project will save countless hours and ensure that intellectual property and customer accounts are properly secured.</p>

<p>To expand on the ideas discussed in this blog, I recommend further reading on securely storing access tokens using vaults, such as <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">HashiCorp Vault</a>, and authorizing users to Network Engines such as <a href="https://www.photonengine.com/pun">Photon</a>. Stay tuned to developer.okta.com/blog for further discussions on these topics and more.</p>

					 <p>The easiest way to explain <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) is to pull out an item that people carry on a daily basis—a wallet.¹ It’s strange to use a leather pouch to explain such a complex, nascent technology as SSI, but it works! And it works because most of the magic of SSI happens within and between digital wallets.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Going from leather to digital 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Apart from money, the leather wallet you carry in your pocket or purse stores important identifying cards (i.e., your driver’s license, health insurance card, employee badge, etc.). We show these cards to people and organizations on a daily basis to receive access to services by proving we are who we say we are. A wallet makes it easy to access these cards when we need them, and it keeps the cards from being lost or stolen.²</p><p><br>Just like a leather wallet stores a variety of important physical cards, an SSI digital wallet stores your <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a>, making it easy for you to show those credentials to others in a secure, private way. As the name implies, a digital wallet is digital and can exist locally (ie., on your mobile device or desktop) or in the cloud. A more formal definition of digital wallets is below:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				A digital wallet, in the context of self-sovereign identity, is a software application and encrypted database that stores credentials, keys, and other secrets necessary for self-sovereign identity.³			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Each participant in the SSI ecosystem (the issuer, the holder, and the verifier) needs a digital wallet in order to issue, hold, and verify verifiable credentials.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 What can you do with an SSI digital wallet? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Collect credentials 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Just like the leather pouch in your pocket stores important documents, your digital wallet stores your verifiable credentials. When you are issued a credential, it will be stored in your wallet. The wallet makes it so that the credentials are:<br><br></p>  Easily accessible: With a click of a button, you have access to all of your credentials which you can seamlessly share with others.  Secure: Your credentials are stored only on your device. No one else has access to them—not even the wallet provider (e.g., Trinsic).  Private: You are in full control of who you send the credential to and what pieces of information on the credential you show them.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Share verifiable information 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Here’s where the rubber meets the road. When you have a digital wallet, anybody can request information from you. The information is entirely under your control, so you can choose to share the information or reject their request. If you decide to respond, the wallet finds credentials with the relevant data and shares just what they need to know, without sharing everything. For example, you might share your address from your driver’s license credential without sharing your name or birthdate.

 	 Drummond Reed, an SSI expert, is famous for pulling out his wallet during presentations on SSI. Timothy Ruff, wrote about this tactic in his blog “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">When Explaining SSI, Start with the Wallet</a>“. 
 	 Of course wallets are not foolproof. They can be stolen or lost, but overall, they do a pretty good job of keeping all of our cards in one place that we can keep on us most times throughout the day. SSI digital wallets have their own security protections that are not listed out in detail here as this is an intro post. 
 	 For simplicity’s sake, at Trinsic, we call it all a “wallet” although in more technical circles, you’ll find the term “agent” used for the application that routes messages and decrypts the wallet, and “wallet” used for the storage layer of the agent.

   Redefining Identity: ForgeRock Autonomous Identity&nbsp; 

<p>IT and Security teams are experiencing identity governance fatigue because they are exhausted from manually reviewing and approving access requests and rubber-stamping certifications. To address this weariness, ForgeRock is providing a new modern approach to identity. ForgeRock Autonomous Identity is an artificial intelligence <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">(AI)-driven identity analytics solution</a>, that allows you to overcome <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/what-identity-governance-fatigue"> fatigue</a>.</p>

<p>ForgeRock Autonomous Identity provides real-time, continuous enterprise-wide user access visibility, control, and remediation. By leveraging AI and machine learning techniques, Autonomous Identity collects and analyzes all identity data—such as accounts, roles, assignments, user activity, and entitlements—to identify security access and risk blind spots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The solution provides you with wider and deeper insight into the risks associated with user access by providing enterprise-wide contextual insights, high-risk user access awareness, and remediation recommendations. Autonomous Identity can be overlaid onto legacy IGA solutions, enabling your organization to increase operational efficiencies, accelerate decision making and maximize existing identity investments.</p>

 Leverage Your Existing Identity Investments&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>ForgeRock Autonomous Identity works with your existing identity infrastructure to develop a complete view of the user access landscape. This includes identity management, Microsoft Active Directory, identity governance, databases, LDAP systems, and other identity data sources in your organization. The landscape provides highly accurate models, showing what good access should and shouldn’t look like.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike legacy IGA solutions that are based on leveraging static rules, roles, and peer group analysis, Autonomous Identity relies strictly on the data in your organization to develop an analysis that is free from any bias coming from human-derived rules and roles that exist in your identity management or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a> solution.</p>

 How It Works&nbsp; 

<p>Autonomous Identity links users to entitlements at the lowest attribute level. The solution uses profile data to determine the likelihood an individual will need an entitlement, based on how entitlements are currently distributed across the organization.</p>

   Why ForgeRock Autonomous Identity?&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>Autonomous Identity addresses identity governance fatigue with unique and highly differentiated capabilities, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  Global visibility: By leveraging AI-driven identity analytics, you can collect and analyze identity data (examples: accounts, roles, user activity, entitlements, and more) from diverse identity, governance, and infrastructure solutions in order to provide enterprise-wide visibility of all identities and what they have access to across the entire enterprise. This approach provides your security and risk teams with contextual insights into low-, medium-, and high-risk user access at scale. 
	 Highly scalable: As new identity data is collected and old data is purged, the AI and machine learning model evolves and learns the dynamic changes within the enterprise. By leveraging predefined machine learning techniques and algorithms, you can quickly predict, recommend, and identify outliers. This intelligence-based approach allows your security and risk professionals to automatically analyze and model high volumes of identity data to identify high-risk user access and unauthorized or unknown user access across the entire organization. 
	 Data driven: With Autonomous Identity, you can contextually examine all identity-related data and identify and recommend the right level of user access rights. This approach provides the ability to identify and apply appropriate birthright or leaver user access rights to accounts, applications, systems, roles, entitlements, and more. This process reduces the overall request volume by predicting appropriate user access at the right time to the right resources. 
	 Transparent AI: Unlike “black box” identity analytics solutions, Autonomous Identity allows you to fully comprehend how and why risk confidence scores are determined. By visually presenting low-, medium-, and high-risk confidence scores together, your security and risk professionals can contextually understand which key risk indicators were met. This AI-driven approach recommends risk-based identity and governance remediation updates based on enterprise-wide confidence scores. 
	 Dynamic analysis: With intelligent data stream processing, you can leverage existing and diverse identity, governance, and infrastructure data sources to continuously collect and process high-velocity, high-volume data (examples: roles, entitlements, attributes assignments, and more) from across the enterprise. Combined with a highly scalable and distributed microservices architecture, enterprises can process and analyze tens of millions of data points quickly to predict and recommend user access rights and highlight potential risks. This intelligence-based approach enables security and risk professionals to accelerate their decision-making process. 
 <p>Autonomous Identity provides you the unprecedented ability to reduce costs while simultaneously lowering risks across your organization. It is a game-changing solution that is redefining identity by providing organizations with the following key business benefits:&nbsp;</p>

 Crypto Stablecoin Report 14: The increase of Ethereum Gas Fee makes the transfers of stablecoin transactions on the blockchain <p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1181625280">https://bihu.com/article/1181625280</a></p><p>Original publish time: August 18,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   Last week, the market capitalization of major stablecoins increased by $815 million to $15.202&nbsp;billion.  Last week, Tether has additionally issued USDT twice on Ethereum, totaling 620&nbsp;million.  On August 13, Ethereum set a record for an average gas fee of $7.12 per transaction.  Starting from the end of April, the proportion of the circulation of TRC20 USDT is increasing and now TRC20 USDT has accounted for 30.6% of the total&nbsp;USDT.  Beginning in June, the proportion of the number of transactions of stablecoins on Ethereum has continued to decrease. At present, the number of transactions of stablecoins on Ethereum accounts for 20.73% of the total transactions on Ethereum. The increase of gas fees on Ethereum has shifted the transactions of stablecoins to other&nbsp;places.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past week(August 8, 2020 ~ August 14, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market circulation of major stablecoins has increased by $815 million to $15.202&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Last week, Tether has additionally issued twice on Ethereum, totaling 620 million USDT. The circulation of USDC, BUSD, TUSD, and DAI increased by 94.81 million, 27.21 million, 49.1 million, and 32.83 million. TUSD and BUSD have a higher proportion of additional issuance. The circulation of PAX, HUSD, and GUSD decreased by 3.92 million, 2.87 million, and 2.3&nbsp;million.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last week, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all increased and increased by&nbsp;153,078.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of USDT, USDC, PAX, TUSD, and DAI increased by 139,838, 7,309, 481, 822, and&nbsp;4,628.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last week decreased by an average of 6.43% compared to the previous&nbsp;week.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of&nbsp;3.26%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last week increased by an average of&nbsp;4.74%.</p> 2. The impact of Ethereum Gas Fee on the use of stablecoins <p>With the prosperity of the Ethereum ecosystem, TPS has become an important factor restricting the development of Ethereum. Transactions on Ethereum are gradually becoming congested, and gas fees are getting higher and higher. The high gas fee excludes users with low net worth. As an important type of asset on Ethereum, stablecoins may be affected by gas fees. According to data from DeBank, the current total market capitalization of stablecoins on Ethereum is $10.047 billion, which is 20.66% of the market capitalization on Ethereum. In this report, we will explore the impact of Ethereum gas fee on the use of stablecoins.</p><p>According to data from <a href="http://messari.io/">messari.io</a>, since April this year, Ethereum miner fees have increasing. Beginning in June, Ethereum miner fees surpassed Bitcoin miner fees, setting a record for an average gas fee of $7.12 per transaction on August 13. The green line in the figure below represents Ethereum miner fee, and the white line represents Bitcoin miner&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://messari.io/">messari.io</a></p><p>Since the end of April, Tether may have been aware of the increase of gas fees on Ethereum, and began to issue a large number of USDT on Tron. The proportion of the circulation of TRC20 USDT is increasing and now TRC20 USDT has accounted for 30.6% of the total USDT, and Omni USDT and ERC20 USDT account for 10.5% and&nbsp;58.9%.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The same situation has also occurred in the number of transactions. Since June this year, the proportion of TRC20 USDT in the number of transactions of USDT has also increasing, and has now increased to 35.9%. At the beginning of the year, the number of transactions of TRC20 USDT accounts for 5.34% of the number of transactions of ERC20 USDT, and now this proportion has increased to&nbsp;58.04%.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Before June this year, there was a general upward trend in the number of transactions of stablecoins on Ethereum. After June, the proportion of stablecoin transactions gradually decreased. Now, the sum of the number of transactions of the major stablecoins accounts for 20.73% of the number of transactions on Ethereum. This may be due to the rising gas fees on Ethereum and the popularity of TRC20 USDT. It can be seen that the increase of gas fees on Ethereum has shifted the transactions of stablecoins to other&nbsp;places.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the number of transactions of ERC20 USDT accounts for 83.8% of the number of transactions of stablecoin on Ethereum, and the transactions of stablecoins on the blockchain are still mainly based on USDT. The ERC20 USDT held by the top ten addresses accounted for only 14.09% of the total ERC20 USDT. More than a month ago, the ERC20 USDT held by the top ten addresses accounted for 22.49%. ERC20 USDT holdings are becoming more and more scattered.</p><p>Among the ten addresses holding the most TRC20 USDT, 7 are marked as Exchanges, the other is the official Tether address, and two are anonymous. Among them, the address in the fourth place on the rich list has had large transactions with Huobi. 93.15% of the total TRC20 USDT are held by the top ten addresses on the rich list. Binance occupies three of the top ten on the rich list, and 55.46% of the total TRC20 USDT are held by these three addresses. TRC20 USDT is largely concentrated on centralized Exchanges.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Tether, Tokenview</p><p>While the transactions of stablecoins on the blockchain are gradually turning to Tron, the DeFi Dapps on Tron may also become better. We selected seven representative DeFi Dapps: 200TRON, Bank of TRON, TronTrade, Poloni DEX, Forsagetron Smartway, Zethyr Finance, and Oikos cash to judge the development of DeFi on Tron. In the past 10 days, the number of daily transactions on 200TRON increased from 0 to 112,600. In the past month, the number of daily transactions of Bank of TRON increased by 283% to 205,400, and the number of transactions of Zethyr Finance increased by 116%. Only TronTrade and Oikos cash have little change in the number of daily transactions, while the number of daily transactions in the other 5 Dapps has increased significantly. It can be seen that many DeFi Dapps on Tron have also made great progress recently.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, DappReview</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

   Do you remember the days when people used tables to arrange content on websites? HTML tables were ideal for arranging content in a grid-style layout. But they had a serious problem. They mixed content with style, prohibited semantic markup, and made it hard for screen readers to sort the information in a meaningful way.

  <p>Do you remember the days when people used tables to arrange content on websites? HTML tables were ideal for arranging content in a grid-style layout. But they had a serious problem. They mixed content with style, prohibited semantic markup, and made it hard for screen readers to sort the information in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>After dropping the use of tables, the first solution was to use the CSS <code>float</code> to position elements on a web page. But floats are clumsy, fragile, and generally hard to work with. CSS frameworks—like Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation—sprung up to help with the difficulties of creating a responsive grid layout. But these frameworks have their own learning curve and often introduce significant overhead in unused CSS code.</p>

<p>Along came flexbox to help with some of these problems. It made it a lot easier to create a responsive row or column-based layouts. While flexbox is a huge step forward, it doesn’t adequately address all the needs of front-end designers. Designers for print media usually work with a grid system that organizes content on a page. And the need for a method of arranging content in a 2-dimensional space that uses the same concepts that have been used by print designers for many years was recognized.</p>

<p>The CSS grid layout allows you to specify a grid system on your web page and place content inside the grid cells in a responsive manner. Elements inside the grid can span multiple rows or columns while maintaining the correct row heights and gutter spacings. The CSS grid is not supposed to replace flexbox but to work alongside it to create truly professional layouts.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a single page application that uses CSS grids to create a responsive layout without using media queries. The application will be a simple Unicode character browser implemented with React.</p>

 Create a Unicode Browser App with React 

<p>I will assume that you have some familiarity with JavaScript and that you have a recent version of Node installed on your computer. You will first create a React project using the <code>npx</code> command that comes with the Node installation. In a terminal, navigate into a directory of your choice and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app react-grid-unicode
</code>   

<p>This will create a new folder <code>react-grid-unicode</code> and install a skeleton React application into it. Before you start implementing the application, you need to obtain the data files that you will be using for the Unicode look-up. The raw data is available at <a href="https://www.unicode.org">https://www.unicode.org</a> but, to make your life easier, I have created two JSON files that you will be using for this project. In the terminal, navigate into your new project folder and then into the <code>src/</code> folder. Now create a new folder called <code>unicode</code> inside the <code>src</code> folder and download and save the following files into it.</p>

 
   <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/license.txt">license.txt</a> 
   <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/blocks.json">blocks.json</a> 
   <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/unicode.json">unicode.json</a> 
 

<p>If you have <code>wget</code> installed on your system, you can grab these files with the following commands:</p>

   <code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/license.txt
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/blocks.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/unicode.json
</code>   

<p>Next, open your favorite IDE in the project folder and create a new file <code>src/Unicode.js</code> and paste the following content into it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import unicode from './unicode/unicode';
import blocks from './unicode/blocks';

class Unicode extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super();
    this.state = { results: this.search('') };
  }

  search(query) {
    return unicode
      .filter((entry) =&gt; entry.name.toUpperCase().includes(query.toUpperCase()))
      .slice(0, 100);
  }

  selectChar(entry) {
    const codeInt = parseInt(entry.code, 16);
    const block = this.findBlock(codeInt);
    this.setState({
      selected: {
        ...entry,
        html: String.fromCharCode(codeInt),
        block: block &amp;&amp; block.name
      }
    });
  }

  findBlock(code) {
    return blocks.filter((b) =&gt; (b.from&lt;=code &amp;&amp; b.to&gt;=code))[0];
  }

  render() {
    const handleSelect = (entry) =&gt; () =&gt; {
      this.selectChar(entry);
    };

    const handleSearch = (event) =&gt; {
      this.setState({
        results: this.search(event.target.value)
      });
    };

    const resultList = this.state.results.map((entry) =&gt;
      &lt;li key={entry.code}
          onClick={handleSelect(entry)}
          className={(this.state.selected &amp;&amp; entry.code===this.state.selected.code) ? 'active' : ''}&gt;
          {entry.name}
      &lt;/li&gt;
    );
    const charInfo = this.state.selected
      ? &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;p className="char-name"&gt;{ this.state.selected.name }&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p className="char-block"&gt;{ this.state.selected.block }&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p className="char-code"&gt;&amp;#x{ this.state.selected.code };&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      : undefined;

    return (
      &lt;div className="app-ui"&gt;
        &lt;div className="search-input" onChange={handleSearch}&gt;&lt;input type="text" placeholder="Search"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div className="search-results"&gt;
          &lt;ul&gt;{resultList}&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div className="char-display"&gt;{ this.state.selected &amp;&amp; this.state.selected.html }&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div className="char-info"&gt;{ charInfo }&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default Unicode;
</code>   

<p>In the code above, the top part includes the import of <code>./unicode/unicode</code> and <code>./unicode/blocks</code>. These lines import the JSON files that you downloaded earlier and make them available for the module. The <code>Unicode</code> class is a React component that will render the Unicode browser UI. It implements a number of functions:</p>

 
   <code>search()</code> will search for entries in the Unicode character table based on a search string. 
   <code>selectChar()</code> is called when an entry is selected, and the character information should be displayed. 
   <code>findBlock()</code> finds the Unicode character block for a given Unicode. 
   <code>render()</code> is the React function that renders the component. 
 

<p>In the return statement of the <code>render()</code>  function, you can see that the component has four main parts, a search input, the search results, an area that displays the chosen character, and a panel that shows some additional information about that character.</p>

<p>Now you can add this component to your application. Open <code>src/App.js</code> in your editor and replace its content with the code below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Unicode from './Unicode';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div className="App"&gt;
        &lt;header&gt;
          Unicode Chart
        &lt;/header&gt;
        &lt;div className="page"&gt;
          &lt;div className="content"&gt;
              &lt;Unicode /&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>Notice how the <code>&lt;Unicode /&gt;</code> tag is used to place your Unicode component onto the screen. Next, you can give the page some styling by opening <code>src/App.css</code> and replacing the contents with the following.</p>

   <code>.App header {
  background-color: #282c34;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  color: white;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.page {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.content {
  text-align: left;
  display: inline-block;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1232px;
  padding: 16px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code>   

<p>At this point, you can try out your application. In a terminal, run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>Once the application has finished compiling, it should automatically open your browser to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You will see something like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The layout of the user interface is not very nice, of course, because you have not yet applied any styling to it.</p>

 Add a Responsive Layout with CSS Grid 

<p>In this section, I will show you how to create a responsive layout using a CSS Grid Layout. In your IDE, create a new file <code>src/Unicode.css</code> and paste the following style into it.</p>

   <code>.app-ui {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(384px, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 16px;
}

.search-input {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: -1;
}

.search-input input {
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.search-results {
  grid-column-end: span 2;
  grid-row-end: span 2;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  overflow: auto;
  max-height: 500px;
}

.search-results ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 8px;
  margin: 0;
}

.search-results li.active {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

.char-info {
  text-align: center;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  padding: 16px;
}

.char-display {
  text-align: center;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  padding: 16px;
  font-family:serif !important;
  font-size: 120px;
}
</code>   

<p>The line <code>display: grid;</code> in the CSS code above, instructs the browser to layout the contents of the <code>.app-ui</code> container as a grid. The <code>grid-template-columns</code> property specifies the columns of the grid. Using <code>auto-fit</code>, the code above tells the browser to create as many columns as possible but maintaining that each column should have a minimum width of 384 pixels. Specifying <code>1fr</code> for the maximum width allows columns to span the whole width of the container if required. The line <code>grid-gap: 16px;</code> creates a consistent gutter of 16 pixels between grid cells.</p>

<p>Each child element of the grid container can be positioned individually. Take a look at the styling of the search input.</p>

   <code>.search-input {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: -1;
}
</code>   

<p>This forces the search input to always start in the first column and end in the last column of the grid. This means that the search input will always span the full width of the container. You can also force elements to span a fixed number of rows or columns. Have a look at the following lines.</p>

   <code>.search-results {
  grid-column-end: span 2;
  grid-row-end: span 2;
}
</code>   

<p>These ensure that the search results will always span at least two columns and two rows. Elements that don’t specify any specific CSS grid properties will, by default, always be placed into a cell spanning a single row and columns.</p>

<p>To make sure that the styles are applied to the <code>Unicode</code> component, open <code>src/Unicode.js</code> again and add the following import to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import './Unicode.css'
</code>   

<p>Now you can run <code>npm start</code> again to test the application. In your browser, you should see something as shown in the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On smaller screens, the number of columns in the grid decreases, and the two cells on the right will automatically be placed below the search results.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note that this behavior has been achieved without the use of media queries.</p>

 Add Authentication with Okta 

<p>When developing web applications, you will at some point be faced with the need to provide user authentication. There are ways to implement this yourself, but they are difficult and require a lot of experience in order to ensure they are safe. With Okta, you can avoid these problems and you can set up authentication with just a few lines of code. In addition, Okta provides a single sign-on service, which means that a single user account can be used for multiple applications.</p>

<p>You need to register for a free account at <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">developer.okta.com</a>. Simply select Create Free Account and complete the registration process. Once complete, you will be directed to your Okta developer dashboard. Here you can register your application by navigating to Applications &gt; Add Application. On the next screen, choose Single Page App and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The following screen lets you edit the application’s settings. Make sure that the port number is 3000 and also change the base URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>. Then set the Login Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code>. Port 3000 is used by the React development server to serve your application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Done and you should see a Client ID, which you will need to paste into your JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Next, open the terminal in your project’s base directory and install the Okta React SDK and React Router by running the following commands.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-react@3.0.4 react-router-dom@5.2.0
</code>   

<p>Now, open <code>src/App.js</code> and add the following two imports to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
</code>   

<p>In the <code>render()</code> function, replace the <code>&lt;Unicode /&gt;</code> component with the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;Router&gt;
  &lt;Security issuer='https://{YourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default'
            clientId='{ClientId}'
            redirectUri={window.location.origin + '/callback'}
            pkce={true}&gt;
    &lt;SecureRoute path='/' exact={true} component={Unicode}/&gt;
    &lt;Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
  &lt;/Security&gt;
&lt;/Router&gt;
</code>   

<p>Here <code>{YourOktaDomain}</code> is your Okta domain that you can find on the Okta dashboard (in the top right), and <code>{ClientId}</code> is the client ID that you created earlier when you registered the application.</p>

<p>That’s it! You have secured your application. Now, if you stop your application and restart it  (with <code>npm start</code>) you will have to log in to your Okta account before you will be able to access the Unicode browser.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you don’t see a login form, it’s because you’re already logged in. Using a private window will cause a redirect to Okta for authentication. If you’d rather have the login form in your application, you can use <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/react/okta_react_sign-in_widget/">Okta’s Sign-In Widget with React</a>.</p>

 Learn More About Styling Your Single-Page Applications 

<p>In this tutorial, I have shown you how to use CSS grid to style your single page application. The grid allows you to create a responsive layout without the use of media queries. This new CSS feature is not intended to replace the currently popular flexbox but should be used alongside giving you control and flexibility over the design on your website.</p>

 The GiD Report #123 — Balkanization and what that means for the future of the&nbsp;internet <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-122-what-will-replace-wechat-and-how-facebook-fueled-tiktoks-rise-ce34d1dc9ef0">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Hello, hello!</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Why a more balkanized internet is a sign that we’re entering a new chapter of decentralization (according to Peter&nbsp;Thiel)  Real demand for new solutions from mega corporations and individuals alike  It’s full circle for Apple circa 1984–2020  The EU version of a balkanized internet and the unintended consequences  An open question about moderation  Closing remarks from Peter Thiel on the state of innovation and progress in the&nbsp;U.S.   1. The biggest fear of a balkanized internet is that it means we’ll be more closed off and less connected. But the fear itself doesn’t mean it will become a&nbsp;reality. Image: University of&nbsp;Chicago<p>Because one reason we have this fear is because we’re looking at today’s events through the lens of today’s frameworks — which are grounded in a centralized approach.</p><p>China wants control so it won’t let in centralized Big Tech. The U.S. doesn’t trust China so ditto state-connected enterprises like ByteDance and&nbsp;Tencent.</p><p>But hey, email still&nbsp;works.</p><p>What that means is that a balkanized internet will only accelerate the transition toward new approaches so that we can continue to connect even as the rules of the game&nbsp;shift.</p><p>Anyway, that’s what Peter Thiel is betting on. (Always the contrarian and often controversial, but never disappoints with his insights.)</p><p>Here’s Peter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufm85wHJk5A">speaking at the Discovery Institute’s technology summit in&nbsp;July</a>:</p><blockquote>If we’d been assembled in 1969, the future of computers was going to be massive centralization. It was giant databases, giant AI-like computer intelligences that would run everything. IBM was HAL transposed in the movie The Space Odyssey, one letter off. It was one of the early Star Trek episodes. They come to the planet Beta, where thousands of years earlier, somebody had unified the planet and left a computer program that ran the whole planet and all the people were peaceful, but very docile — nothing ever happened. But the future of the computer age circa 1969 was centralization — a few large companies, a few large governments, a few large computers that controlled everything.</blockquote><blockquote>Fast forward to 1999, the future of the computer age was going to be massive decentralization. It was sort of libertarian and anarchist. It was the corollary to the end of the Soviet Union, that information had this decentralizing tendency, and the internet was going to fragment things and it was going to be this anarchic libertarian place.</blockquote><blockquote>If we fast forward to 2019, the consensus view of the future today, I would submit, is that the pendulum has somehow swung back all the way to 1969. And the consensus view again is that it is about large centralization — Google like governments that control all of the world’s information in this super centralized way.</blockquote><blockquote>The Life After Google thesis that I agree with and endorse is that if we look at this past — and people got it terribly wrong in ‘69 — and things were going to go to decentralization in ’99, it actually started going back the other way from the point of view of 2019. Even if I’m hesitant to talk about the absolute future and where this all ends, ultimately, perhaps the contrarian thing is to say maybe the pendulum can swing back towards more decentralization, more privacy, and things like that. This is what seems to be at least contrarian and at least something we should always take more seriously.</blockquote><blockquote>If you want to frame it in terms of the buzzwords of the day, if it were in terms of crypto and AI, it is easily understood by people. It’s always understood that crypto is somehow vaguely libertarian, but we never are willing to say the opposite, which is that AI is communist. It’s because it’s centralized. The computer knows more about you than you know about yourself. It’s totalitarian.</blockquote><blockquote>Communist China loves AI and dislikes crypto. We should at least consider the possibility that Silicon Valley is probably way too enamored of AI, not just for technological reasons, but also because it expresses this sort of left wing centralized zeitgeist.</blockquote><blockquote>The first sort of contrarian idea I have is that perhaps it’s time for the pendulum to swing back and Life After Google, at its core, means that we are going to go back from this very centralized world today towards a more decentralized one. That seems to me to be the correct thing to bet&nbsp;on.</blockquote><p>Going by Peter’s timeline, 1999 might have felt like the height of the decentralization movement but it was also the beginning of the cycle for the rise of Google, Amazon, Apple (again), and later Facebook.</p><p>Those companies are now among the most valuable on&nbsp;earth.</p><p>So even if today feels like peak centralization, it’s reasonable — particularly if you’re feeling contrarian — that this only means that the pendulum is about the swing the other way. The forces are already in&nbsp;motion.</p>  <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/13/1006631/wechat-ban-severs-a-hundred-million-ties/">The human cost of a WeChat ban: severing a hundred million&nbsp;ties</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/internet-freedom-nationalism-authoritarianism-767da13b-b6bf-4aac-8f05-78f0a6353f08.html">Nationalism and authoritarianism threaten the internet’s universality</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/mg">/mg</a>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogBjqQbuiHw">Who wields the power online? | DW Documentary</a>  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/competition-bureau/news/2020/08/competition-bureau-seeks-input-from-market-participants-to-inform-an-ongoing-investigation-of-amazon.html">Competition Bureau seeks input from market participants to inform an ongoing investigation of Amazon — Canada.ca</a>  <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-alibaba/trump-says-looking-at-pressuring-other-chinese-companies-after-bytedance-idUKKCN25B11B">Trump says looking at pressuring other Chinese companies after Bytedance</a>  <a href="https://www.state.gov/the-clean-network/">The Clean Network — United States Department of&nbsp;State</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/wechat-ban-decentralized">A WeChat Ban Should Be the Moment for Decentralized Tech. But It’s Not. — CoinDesk</a>   2. It’s unclear that things will play out as cleanly as Peter Thiel’s proposed logic. What’s clear is that there’s suddenly ample demand for new solutions. <p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-america-worries-wechat-ban-could-be-bad-for-business-11597311003">WSJ&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>More than a dozen major U.S. multinational companies raised concerns in a call with White House officials Tuesday about the potentially broad scope and impact of Mr. Trump’s executive order targeting WeChat, set to take effect late next&nbsp;month.</blockquote><blockquote>Apple Inc., Ford Motor Co., Walmart Inc. and Walt Disney Co. were among those participating in the call, according to people familiar with the situation.</blockquote><blockquote>“For those who don’t live in China, they don’t understand how vast the implications are if American companies aren’t allowed to use it,” said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “They are going to be held at a severe disadvantage to every competitor,” he&nbsp;added.</blockquote><blockquote>Other participants in the call Tuesday included Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Intel Corp., MetLife Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, United Parcel Service Inc., Merck &amp; Co. Inc. and Cargill Inc., according to the&nbsp;people.</blockquote><p>That’s the long&nbsp;game.</p><p>There’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-98146fea-684f-411e-b873-40fd00171f93.html">ample demand from individuals, too,&nbsp;BTW</a>:</p><blockquote>Americans using digital services would gladly switch to companies that are more committed to data privacy, according to survey results shared exclusively with Axios’ Kyle&nbsp;Daly.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: It’s the latest sign people are frustrated with the digital status quo, even as companies make efforts to give users more control over how their data gets collected, stored and&nbsp;used.</blockquote><blockquote>Details: The survey of 1,018 Americans, conducted in June, found people want more control over what happens with their personal information and think existing tools seem outdated and should be easier to&nbsp;use.</blockquote><blockquote>93% of Americans would switch to a company that prioritizes their data&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>91% would prefer to buy from companies that always guarantee them access to their&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>88% are frustrated that they don’t have more control over their&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>73% reported finding the process of downloading their data from a company “outdated”; 32%, “hard”; 32%, “confusing.”</blockquote><blockquote>About two-thirds said they want to be able to choose what data companies can and can’t&nbsp;collect.</blockquote><p>They’re also just waiting for an alternative.</p> 3. And just to point out the swings of the pendulum — there’s Apple, complaining about the WeChat ban. Back in 1984, Apple released that iconic Super Bowl ad about IBM referencing George&nbsp;Orwell. <p>Now they’re getting a taste of their own medicine <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1294006412931223552">with Riot’s Fortnite&nbsp;spoof</a>.</p><p>Of course, Facebook <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-apple-app-store-22774656-4221-40e7-b6b6-307a1a2de4d5.html">sees an opportunity</a>:</p><blockquote>Between the lines: Facebook is trying to position itself as friendlier to small businesses than Apple, which also faces a lawsuit from Fortnite maker Epic Games over its commission and in-app payment restrictions.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: Facebook said Friday that it will launch “Paid Online Events” for small businesses in 20 countries around the world to charge Facebook users to attend their classes, instructions and other&nbsp;events.</blockquote><blockquote>The feature could be useful for any small business or individual offering a service, such a preacher, musician, yoga teacher or cooking instructor.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook asked Apple to either waive its 30% cut or let Facebook go around it and process event payments via Facebook Pay, in either case letting event hosts keep all the revenue they generate. Apple declined, according to Facebook.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/epic-sues-apple-google-as-fortnite-is-pulled-from-app-stores-9ebea67e-83b7-46ac-82c6-cfc25ccae04d.html">Epic sues Apple, Google as Fortnite is pulled from app&nbsp;stores</a>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/">Apple, Epic, and the App&nbsp;Store</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/facebook-backed-group-american-edge-to-launch-its-first-ad.html">Pro-tech advocacy group backed by Facebook and other silent investors releases its first&nbsp;ad</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/ales">/ales</a>— <a href="https://gizmodo.com/fortnite-may-have-just-laid-the-perfect-antitrust-trap-1844714297?rev=1597347199045">Fortnite May Have Just Laid the Perfect Antitrust Trap for Apple — and They Fell For It [Another Update: Google Just Kicked Fortnite Out of Its App Store,&nbsp;Too]</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-apple-app-store-22774656-4221-40e7-b6b6-307a1a2de4d5.html">Facebook goes after Apple’s in-app purchases fee in wake of Epic&nbsp;lawsuit</a>   4. The other thing about technological balkanization is that it’s not always going to be black and white. A lot of the time it’s gray. That’s a good way to describe what’s been happening in Europe in terms of how they’ve dealt with the influence of American Big Tech. Rather than ban anything outright, they just force companies to play by their&nbsp;rules. <p>That’s well and good in theory. In practice, it’s really messy with a lot of unintended consequences.</p><p>For instance:</p><blockquote>Some businesses fear growing liability while others worry that small and mid-sized firms will get hurt as the U.S. and Europe begin work to replace Privacy Shield, the pact that let thousands of firms transfer data across the Atlantic without breaking EU privacy rules, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Without a replacement in place after the EU’s high court struck Privacy Shield down last month, thousands of businesses will be stuck complying with an agreement that no longer applies in the EU while scrambling to figure out how to get data over from Europe without exposing themselves to legal&nbsp;risks.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s new: This week, the Department of Commerce and European Commission announced they have started discussions to come up with a new framework to govern data transfers between the EU and the&nbsp;U.S.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://link.axios.com/click/21182755.18680/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29tbWVyY2UuZ292L25ld3MvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC8wOC9qb2ludC1wcmVzcy1zdGF0ZW1lbnQtdXMtc2VjcmV0YXJ5LWNvbW1lcmNlLXdpbGJ1ci1yb3NzLWFuZC1ldXJvcGVhbj91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2xvZ2luJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5873ef138cc2b2045d8b45dcB191b30f7">Joint Press Statement from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and European Commissioner for Justice Didier&nbsp;Reynders</a>  <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/889kyv/a-princess-is-making-google-to-forget-her-drunken-rant-about-killing-muslims">A Princess Is Making Google Forget Her Drunken Rant About Killing&nbsp;Muslims</a>  <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/08/165131-strong-customer-authentication-a-requirement-to-combat-payments-fraud-might-lead-to-many-customers-abandoning-purchases-at-checkout/">Strong Customer Authentication, a Requirement to Combat Payments Fraud, Might Lead to Many Customers Abandoning Purchases at&nbsp;Checkout</a>   5. We’ve talked about balkanization. We’ve touched on regulation. One of the missing pieces that’s become a pivotal question of the day is moderation, which is understandably a controversial topic of the day. If you listened at all to the recent antitrust hearings, then you know that Republicans have their collective pitchforks out about platform censorship. <p>And it’s easy to think about moderation negatively particularly with what’s going on in&nbsp;China.</p><p>But just as not every habit needs to be labeled an addiction — there are good habits, after all — not all moderation should be labeled censorship.</p><p>Good moderation is helpful in creating the right incentives that align with a community’s core values — whether that’s a small group of friends or an entire&nbsp;country.</p><p>And good moderation will mean different things for different people.</p><p>A big part of why there’s such a negative slant to the idea of moderation with today’s status quo isn’t moderation itself, it’s the issue of centralized power and the lack of transparency and accountability.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/trump-twitter-facebook-and-the-future-of-online-speech">the New Yorker</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>In a 2018 article published in the Harvard Law Review, “The New Governors: The People, Rules, and Processes Governing Online Speech,” Kate Klonick, who is now a professor at St. John’s University Law School, tallies the sometimes conflicting factors that have shaped the moderation policies at Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. The companies, she writes, have been influenced by a fundamental belief in American “free speech norms,” a sense of corporate responsibility, and user expectations. They’ve also reacted to government requests, media scrutiny, pressure from users or public figures, and the demands of third-party civil-society groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League. They have sometimes instituted new rules in response to individual incidents. There are downsides to this kind of improvisational responsiveness: a lack of transparency and accountability creates conditions ripe for preferential treatment and double standards.</blockquote><p>It’s also the type of problem inherent to huge centralized organizations and platforms. The more decentralized, transparent, and flexible moderation is, the less oppressive moderation feels.</p><p>I mean I get it. Why should Mark Zuckerberg decide the rules for billions of people? Who made him king? (And I get Mark’s side — when you have your own employees protesting because you won’t take stuff down because they don’t like&nbsp;it.)</p><p>It’s like that thing that Aristotle said: That dude that has a lotta friends basically has no&nbsp;friends.</p><p>Mark gets it, too. That’s why he created an independent (supposedly) subcommittee to decide that&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>As a solution, though, it’s still kind of a bandaid. When you’re as big and as powerful as Facebook, any solution to the problem will be a bit cumbersome.</p><p>When you don’t have a system built on real trust and real identities, it’s impossible to delegate that responsibility to your users or your communities. If you never trusted them in the first place, how can you provide them&nbsp;agency.</p><p>It’s a point that we touched upon a couple weeks&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Vitalik Buterin:</p><blockquote>If you don’t have any notion of persistent identity, then you can’t have positive incentives because there’s no persistent thing for those incentives to hook onto. There’re a lot of ways you can have persistent identity, persistent reputation — even in ways that are very strongly privacy preserving.</blockquote><p>Anyway, this was more of an open question. Something to think&nbsp;about.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/08/07/google-documents-show-taboo-words-antitrust">To Head Off Regulators, Google Makes Certain Words Taboo — The&nbsp;Markup</a>   6. OK. I’ll leave you with a little more Peter Thiel on the state of innovation and progress in the U.S. from that same talk. (Sorry, Chamath is pushed back&nbsp;again.) <blockquote>If we look at the rate of progress in Silicon Valley, it was charismatic because it was the one place where things were still happening relative to the rest of the U.S., and it’s become a lot less charismatic in the last five&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>We think about the vibe in 2014, it was this place where the future was being built. In 2019, the big tech companies are probably as self hating in some ways as the big banks were in&nbsp;2009.</blockquote><blockquote>There’s a sense of, “uh, it’s not quite working.”</blockquote><blockquote>If you pick on Google a little bit here, the Google propaganda of the future was that it was all going to be more automation. The story in 2014 were things like Google Glass so you could identify anybody you looked at at any time. It was the self-driving car. I would say these aren’t that big of a set of innovations — a self-driving car is a step from a car but not as big a step as a far from a&nbsp;horse.</blockquote><blockquote>So we can debate quite how big these things are and how to quantify them. But that was still the narrative that was very intact in&nbsp;2014.</blockquote><blockquote>When you fast forward to 2019, it’s striking how there’s absolutely no narrative of the future left. Google doesn’t even talk about the self-driving car very much. There’s a sense that it may still happen, but it’s further in the future. The expected time seems to be getting further&nbsp;away.</blockquote><blockquote>So there’s sort of the sense that perhaps there’s this danger that we have slowed progress even in tech, even in the world of information technology.</blockquote><blockquote>….</blockquote><blockquote>Somehow Silicon Valley has consolidated into larger companies. It’s gotten harder for new companies to break through, and it’s gotten harder because new companies or small companies are good at doing new things and people are doing fewer new things. Then the big companies are more dominant.</blockquote><blockquote>….</blockquote><blockquote>The stagnation idea is that at the end of the day, technology is about people. It’s not about inanimate forces. It’s not some kind of Marxist historicism about the way things are inevitably going to happen. The stress is always on individuals, small teams that start companies, new projects that do new&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s a question of human agency. It’s not deterministic. We have every possibility to do these things, but at the end of the day, it is up to us to make it happen.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Informatica has <a href="https://www.informatica.com/about-us/news/news-releases/2020/08/20200818-informatica-acquires-greenbay-technologies-to-advance-ai-and-machine-learning-capabilities.html">just announced</a> that they have made another acquisition this summer: GreenBay Technologies, a startup focused on AI and machine learning. Read about their July 2020 acquisition <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/big-data-informatica-announces-acquisition-of-compact-solutions">here</a>.</p>
<p>GreenBay Technologies brings CloudMatcher to Informatica’s Intelligent Data Platform (IDP). CloudMatcher uses machine learning to automate entity matching and schema matching tasks with high accuracy. This impacts several key data management capabilities such as master data management, data cataloging, data quality, governance, and data integration.</p>
<p>This acquisition adds to the core capabilities of Informatica’s CLAIRE® engine. Informatica has previously collaborated with and invested in GreenBay Technologies, with some elements of CloudMatcher technology already embedded in Informatica products. Founders and team members of GreenBay Technologies will join Informatica as full-time employees. The collaboration, investment, and mutual aim to provide a more complete view and understanding of enterprise data foreshadows a successful acquisition.</p>
<p>Empowering the Business User with AI-Powered Data Management Tools</p>
<p>CloudMatcher further strengthens Informatica’s approach to no-code data management. It brings innovations to both schema matching and entity matching. While schema matching determines that two columns in two tables, such as “ename” and “emp name”, are semantically the same, entity matching determines that two records, such as (David Smith, Acme Company) and (Dave M. Smith, Acme), are the same real-world entity.</p>
<p>Historically, entity matching has remained a complex problem because the solutions are rule-based that require skilled developers and a significant amount of time. GreenBay Technologies has created a blend of “declarative rules” and “AI rules” for match classification. Many existing solutions to schema and entity matching use hand-crafted rules. With this acquisition, Informatica adds a powerful machine learning model that can capture complex and powerful matching rules, the kind of rules that users cannot create manually. The supervised learning used in this approach requires relatively little effort from the user to train the system. The active learning stage presents the business user with interactive labeling exercises for tuple pairs from two separate tables. Simultaneously, the system learns from more user feedback and curation to continuously improve over time. This workflow goes through multiple iterations and yields a high degree of accuracy. CloudMatcher is also highly amenable to distributed and parallel processing, allowing the solution to scale to very large data sets and dramatically reduce manual data stewardship required.</p>
<p>This opens the door for many data management services to be “hands-off”, meaning easily usable by business users without the need for coding or a developer background. As data sets are getting larger and larger, the improved match rate offered by CloudMatcher will help reduce the false positives. By applying a crowdsourcing approach with business users labeling training data, Informatica can configure a sophisticated data matching system that adapts to an organization’s data landscape in a few hours as opposed to days or weeks. This technology also helps in extending matching beyond identity data by matching product, supplier, location, and other types of data domains with even higher accuracy.</p>
<p>AI on Demand: A Continuation of the Platform Economy</p>
<p>We see the trend of harnessing AI to make complex tasks more accessible to non-technical users rising in many different fields. <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80384/conversational-ai-building-platforms/#article-slice-14228">Conversational AI Building Platforms</a> is one such area with many vendors providing the general technology and language capabilities, with support to train the chatbot on a customer’s specific industry and corporate knowledge. Other areas include <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb70278/artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a>, with AI capabilities already integrated into the cybersecurity solution and able to be trained in a context-specific environment rather than a “build it yourself” approach. This may shift in the future though, as methodologies for presenting the AI development process (data preparation, model selection, training, validating, implementation, maintenance, and retirement) to non-AI experts improve. Some tech companies (read about some examples <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80232/ibm-watson/">here</a> and <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80233/microsoft-azure-ai-platform/">here</a>) are offering AI capabilities irrespective of industry; they aim to provide the infrastructure, data pipeline management, automated support to determine appropriate learning models, and governance for the AI lifecycle.</p>
<p>The data management use cases that we see Informatica addressing have the potential to unlock more data-based insights at a lower cost – be it through reducing time-to-value or by enabling subject matter experts to work with their data as a data scientist or developer would. Enabling more data-driven business will shape the processes, internal decisions, production goals, and much more. But this is only possible with strong data management practice, including the correct labeling of entities. User-friendly AI to manage this step is key to seeing more value from data management products.</p>

					 <p>“Portable” is one of the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 principles</a> of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). In order to achieve portability or self-sovereignty, an individual must be able to control where their identity information and credentials are stored. They must be able to leave their current provider and move to a new provider and never be trapped in vendor lock-in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wallet portability for individuals has always been an aspiration of wallet providers, but until today, has never been successful. We’re proud to announce that Trinsic has achieved interoperable wallet portability with two other SSI wallet vendors—<a href="https://lissi.id">Lissi</a> and <a href="https://esatus.com">esatus AG</a>. For the first time, an individual can “fire their wallet”¹ and use a new one.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 What is wallet portability? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>When we talk about wallet portability with other vendors, we mean you can seamlessly transfer your SSI wallet between these different applications by exporting from one wallet and importing into another (“import/export”). With import/export functionality, you are no longer tied to or reliant on a single technology provider.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Portability between Aries wallets is a long time coming. It’s a huge win for the vision of SSI,” said Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes. “Import/export should be standard in any SSI wallet—because if a wallet doesn’t support portability, it’s not really self-sovereign.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This first implementation amongst 3 vendors is a first step in what we hope will be a larger community effort to converge on best practices for interoperability of SSI wallets.</p>

					 <p>Transfer credentials from the Trinsic Wallet to the Lissi app:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  In the Trinsic Wallet, go to Settings and click the Export Wallet tab.  Copy down the recovery phrase.  Click on the Export Wallet button.  Save the wallet to wherever you’d like to store it.  Open the Lissi app (this can be done with the esatus Wallet as well), go to Settings, and click on the Recover Account tab.  Click on Open File and choose the Trinsic Wallet file.  Paste in the recovery phrase that was copied from the Trinsic Wallet and click Recover Backup.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Transfer credentials from the Lissi app to the Trinsic Wallet:<br><br></p>  In the Lissi app, go to Settings and click on the Create Export/Backup tab.  Write down the recovery phrase and click Continue.  Verify the recovery phrase by clicking on the words in the correct order.  Name your backup file and click Export.  Unzip the exported file.  Open the Trinsic Wallet, click on Settings, and click on the Backup and Restore tab.  Click on the Restore Wallet button, select Local Backup, and choose the Lissi wallet file.  Type in the recovery phrase and click the Recover Wallet button.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>“We celebrate with the community in the achievement of SSI wallet portability and are proud that Lissi Mobile Wallet is one of the first truly portable wallets,” said Helge Michael, the Program Manager at Main Incubator who runs Lissi. “Self-sovereign identity has made incredible progress in the last couple of years, and we can now add wallet portability to the list.”</p>

					 <p>Our approach to wallet portability shouldn’t be viewed as the end-all be-all. Further iterations and evolution will happen over time as the SSI community continues to converge on standards and protocols relating to wallet portability. We do commit, however, to being involved in that effort. If you’d like to get involved, here are some things we’d love your contributions on:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Currently connections are lost through the import/export process. Connections are a persistent 1:1 relationship between two parties and rely on endpoints provided by mediator agents to ensure messages are routed to the correct wallet. Because the approach to mediator agents aren’t completely standardized between vendors, connections do not transfer seamlessly across different vendors.  The export function creates an encrypted, duplicate wallet which you can use as a backup. This is extremely useful if you lose your device and want to restore your wallet. But it also enables you to upload your wallet to multiple devices. This is useful if you want a tablet &amp; mobile wallet to be in sync, but can be problematic if you duplicated your wallet onto other people’s devices, allowing them to present your credentials. Ensuring the integrity of credentials across the import/export process is the subject of future work.  All the mobile wallets that support portability are based on the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a>. Further testing will be required to determine whether the exported wallet can be opened seamlessly in other Aries frameworks or whether additional limitations will arise.  The import/export implementation is specifically geared toward local wallets and applications (ie., mobile wallets). Enterprise wallets and cloud wallets are out of scope.

<p>Poly Network will permit interoperability between multiple chains, offering a range of new advantages</p><p>In a bid to lay the groundwork for a more collaborative and transparent decentralized ecosystem, three leading global blockchain projects, <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, <a href="https://neo.org/">Neo</a>, and <a href="https://www.switcheo.network/">Switcheo</a>, have announced the launch of <a href="https://www.poly.network/">Poly Network</a>, a heterogeneous interoperability protocol alliance.</p><p>In what is a major milestone for the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) industry, Poly Network will permit cross-platform interoperability, greatly increasing transparency and accessibility. Enterprises leveraging diverging systems can connect to Poly Network, and collaborate and interact with each other through an open, transparent admission mechanism.</p><p>Andy Ji, Co-founder of Ontology, the high performance, open source blockchain specializing in digital identity and data said, “By combining the highest standards of expertise and platform capabilities, Poly Network will have unprecedented benefits for blockchain developers, propelling the building of the decentralized ecosystem through a range of platform offerings that make the user experience easier.</p><p>“For a time now, the Ontology community has enjoyed the benefits of cross-chain functionalities with Ethereum. Now, through Poly Network, an enterprise leveraging the Ontology blockchain will be able to seamlessly interact with an enterprise leveraging Ethereum, Cosmos, or Neo, helping these platforms overcome challenges to scalability, mainstream adoption, and collaboration. To make it happen, Ontology has invested high levels of technical research, development, and financial support.”</p><p>Prioritizing key characteristics of efficiency, value transfer, privacy, and security, PolyNetwork’s core function is to enable cross-platform interoperability and atomic cross chain transactions, such as the swapping of digital currency for other tokenized assets. PolyNetwork will:</p>  Provide DeFi developers with new infrastructure for creating cross-chain compatible dApps  Support both heterogeneous and homogeneous chains including Ethereum, Neo, Ontology, and Cosmos, along with each platform’s homogenous chain forks, with future plans to support the Bitcoin&nbsp;network  Permit easy, eco-friendly access to cross-chain transactions, by requiring less smart contracts  Increase scalability of cross chain transactions by enabling the transfer of both assets and information  <p>Da Hongfei, Founder of Neo, an open-source, community driven platform, said, “I firmly believe that interoperability is the future of the blockchain industry. Within our current paradigm, both traditional and blockchain platforms exist as effectively isolated data silos — users and developers alike are restricted by each platform’s capabilities and limitations. With PolyNetwork, we are linking disparate and heterogeneous platforms to build a global cross-chain platform with the aim of realizing blockchain’s potential while overcoming its challenges — together. Moving forward, I encourage all interested projects and companies to join us in building the foundation for&nbsp;NGI.”</p><p>Ji concluded, “Cross-chain interoperability is becoming increasingly important as we focus on moving away from a siloed way of working. Ontology is committed to fostering an open and transparent blockchain ecosystem and we are proud to partner with Neo and Switcheo to deliver true cross-blockchain interoperability. We look forward to playing our part through this groundbreaking alliance.”</p><p>For more information on Poly Network and how to join, visit <a href="https://www.poly.network/">https://www.poly.network/</a></p><p>About Poly&nbsp;Network</p><p><a href="https://www.poly.network/">PolyNetwork</a> is built to implement interoperability between multiple chains in order to build the next generation internet infrastructure.

  <p>In most cities in China, citizens and visitors must download Health Code — an app that indicates COVID-19 status — to access many public and private spaces and services. A green screen means the person is free to travel, yellow indicates required quarantine and red means a confirmed infection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies is a unique Hype Cycle that distills more than 1,700 unique technologies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In India, the Aarogya Setu app indicates which travelers are “safe” to use rail and air travel. The United Arab Emirates recently launched ALHOSN UAE, which also indicates via color if a person is okay, infected or need to be quarantined, but also has an option for “hasn’t been tested.” ALHOSN UAE is currently being used to grant access to air travel.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36598"]</p>
<p>All of these apps, called health passports, are examples of a pandemic/epidemic response technology and one of the new additions to the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle#:~:text=Gartner%20Hype%20Cycle%20methodology%20gives,of%20your%20specific%20business%20goals.">Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2020</a>. The sheer populations in India and China using health passports pushed this technology to a 5% to 20% market penetration, an unprecedented number for a technology just entering the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/hype-cycle">Hype Cycle.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;“This Hype Cycle highlights technologies that will significantly affect business, society and people over the next five to 10 years,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/26081/Brian-Burke">Brian Burke</a>, Research VP, Gartner. “It includes technologies that enable a composable enterprise, aspire to regain society’s trust in technology and alter the state of your brain.”</p>
<p>The Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies is a unique Hype Cycle that distills more than 1,700 unique technologies into a list of must-know technologies and trends. This year’s list highlights five unique trends:</p>
 
 
<p>Composite architectures</p>
 
 
<p>Algorithmic trust</p>
 
 
<p>Beyond silicon</p>
 
 
<p>Formative artificial intelligence (AI)</p>
 
 
<p>Digital me</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz1lNWZiNWRjMmRlNWIxMWVhYjFjMjBlNjhjZDJlOWEzMw=="></a></p>
 Trend No. 1: Composite architectures 
<p>In the face of rapid changes and decentralization, organizations need to shift to more agile, responsive architectures. A composite architecture is made up of packaged business capabilities built on a flexible data fabric. This allows the enterprise to respond to rapidly changing business needs.</p>
<p>For example, a “composable enterprise” supported by a composite architecture offers increased business resilience. This modular design enables organizations to “recompose” when needed, like during a global pandemic or economic recession. The composable enterprise has four core principles: Modularity, efficiency, continuous improvement and adaptive innovation. Although many organizations apply these principles in a piecemeal fashion, a composable enterprise applies all four across all parts of its organization — from business models to how employees work.</p>
<p>This modular business model enables organizations to move from rigid, traditional planning to active agility. Composable enterprise thinking creates more innovation, reduced costs and better partnerships.</p>
<p>Other technologies under this trend include packaged business capabilities, data fabric, private 5G and embedded AI.</p>
 Trend No. 2: Algorithmic trust 
<p>Increased amounts of consumer data exposure, fake news and videos, and biased AI, have caused organizations to shift from trusting central authorities (government registrars, clearing houses) to trusting algorithms. Algorithmic trust models ensure the privacy and security of data, provenance of assets, and the identities of people and things.</p>
<p>For example, "authenticated provenance" is a way to authenticate assets on the blockchain and ensure they’re not fake or counterfeit. While blockchain can be used to authenticate goods, it can only track the information that it is given.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-blockchain/">The CIO's Guide to Blockchain&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>To adequately track assets, they must be tracked from their source. For example, if a counterfeit item is added to the blockchain as a genuine version, the blockchain will continue to verify its authenticity based on the bad original data input. Due to the nature of the immutable ledger, it can never be modified or deleted.</p>
<p>Gartner believes increased interest in <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-reality-of-blockchain/">blockchain </a>will create increased digital authentication and verification options.</p>
<p>Other technologies in the algorithmic trust trend include differential privacy, responsible AI and explainable AI.</p>
 Trend No. 3: Beyond silicon 
<p>Moore’s Law predicts that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit would double every two years, but technology is quickly reaching the physical limits of silicon. This has led to the evolution of new advanced materials with enhanced capabilities designed to support smaller, faster technologies.</p>
<p>For example, "DNA computing and storage" use DNA and biochemistry in place of silicon or quantum architectures to perform computation or store data. The data is encoded into synthetic DNA strands for storage and enzymes provide the processing capabilities through chemical reactions.</p>
<p>Despite two successful prototypes, the technology is currently rudimentary and expensive with significant technical barriers to mainstream use. However, the impact of a successful DNA computing and storage option would transform data storage, processing parallelism and computing efficiency.</p>
<p>Other technologies in this trend include biodegradable sensors and carbon-based transistors.</p>
 Trend No. 4: Formative AI 
<p>Formative<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/"> AI </a>is a type of AI capable of dynamically changing to respond to a situation. There are a variety of types, ranging from AI that can dynamically adapt over time to technologies that can generate novel models to solve specific problems.</p>
<p>For example, generative AI is a type of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-prevent-ai-dangers-with-ethical-ai/">AI</a> that can create new novel content (images, video etc.) or alter existing content. The new artifacts are similar to, but not exactly the same as, the original. This technology is responsible for deep fakes content, which can cause serious disinformation and reputational risk, and is expected to increase in numbers over the next five years. However, less nefarious uses like drug discovery and synthetic data generation — and even AI-generated artwork — are also increasing in popularity.</p>
<p>Other technologies in this trend include composite AI, differential privacy, small data and self-supervising learning.</p>
 Trend No. 5: Digital me 
<p>From health passports to digital twins, as technology integrates with people, there are more opportunities to create digital versions of ourselves. These digital models represent humans in both the real and virtual worlds.</p>
<p>For example, bidirectional brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), are brain-altering wearables that enable two-way communication between a human brain and a computer or machine interface. BMIs can be either wearables or implants that monitor EEGs (electrical activity in the brain) and individuals’ mental states. The difference between regular monitoring BMIs and bidirectional BMI is that the latter can use electrostimulation to modify the mental state of the person.</p>
<p>In the business world, potential applications include <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-security-areas-to-focus-on-during-covid-19/">authentication</a>, access and payment, immersive analytics and exoskeletons. But other applications, which have their own social and ethical concerns, might include using stimulation to boost alertness in a fatigued employee or changing the mood of an irritable teacher by applying currents to the brain. While there are many potential use cases, BMIs also introduce an additional avenue of vulnerability for would-be attackers to exploit.</p>

<p>As far as tech industry standards go, it has been a slow burn <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">finding out exactly how</a> 130 Verified Twitter Accounts, and thousands of unverified accounts, came to suddenly begin promoting fake charities or Bitcoin giveaways last month. Piece by piece security experts have gleaned information directly from hackers, found tidbits on the dark web, and learned more from Twitter - the company has been updating their <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">blog post</a> about the incident almost every day since it was first posted on July 18, 2020.</p><p>However, this type of hack can happen to any company that has an administration panel or dashboard for their app that’s protected by a username and password. Even taking the time and effort to fully integrate back end systems, enable two-factor authentication, and take other precautionary measures can still lead to a similar breach thanks to clever social engineering tricks and hacks that have become increasingly common. </p><p>One way to really lock down your administration panel, possibly the best method as of today, is to use a decentralized identity platform for authentication. For example, faking a BloomID is almost impossible -- only one BloomID can be created using an email address, it’s secured by a private key that cannot be duplicated or spoofed, and accessing the accompanying Bloom app requires physical access to someone’s iOS or Android device, or taking full control of their Apple ID or Google account and restoring everything to a new device, which would cause multiple emails and alarms to go off for the affected party. Your Apple ID has been used to sign in to a new device! Your Google account has a new device associated with it! It’s kind of hard to ignore, and the most security conscious of us have locked down our wireless carrier and Apple/Google accounts, leaving only the usernames and passwords we use left to secure, or rather abandon passwords entirely, which is a movement already <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">supported</a> across all the most popular platforms but not implemented widely. </p><p>So how do you lock down your administration panel, ensuring your God Mode or Super Admin mode is only accessed by those who are truly authorized to have it? Let’s dive in.</p> Server Side <p>We’re not going to use anything like Verify Kit this time, there’s no need. All we want to do is ensure that the person trying to access the administration panel has the appropriate rights, and that can be correlated by the email address they share via Bloom’s mobile app to an existing database that contains role-based access control permissions and rights. </p><p>We will assume you have a back end that can handle some JavaScript in the form of an Express-based app, or that can be passed a payload from an Express library. This is largely true for many administration apps since JavaScript is so flexible.</p> Let’s Use Bloom Starter for Auth <p>There are two parts to the Bloom Starter app; the server-side (Express) and client-side (React).</p><p>Getting Started</p><p>First we’re going to start the Express server, start ngrok to proxy the Express server so that the mobile app can POST share-kit data to the url, and then start the React app. </p><p>Follow these steps to make it happen:</p>  Run <code>git clone https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter.git</code>  And then <code>cd bloom-starter/bloom-starter-auth</code>  Then run <code>npm run deps</code> (this installs any dependencies for both the server and client)  Before starting up the dev server, you will need a .env file with these variables set:     <code>PORT</code>  <code>NODE_ENV</code>, and   <code>SESSION_SECRET</code>   <p>Please see the .env.sample file in the repository for an example of where your .env should be located, and what it should look like. There’s no need to go in blind. </p><p>And finally run <code>npm run dev</code>.</p><p>If all went well, and the <code>REACT_APP_SERVER_URL</code> env var is set to the ngrok url, then we can move on to the client.</p> Time for the Client Setup <p>Share Kit is the front end library needed to generate a data sharing request. </p><p>Since the administration app is a web app, we can continue leveraging the same Bloom Starter repository. </p><p>For this demonstration, we don’t need much. The only Verifiable Credential we’re going to use is <code>email</code>, which we can tie back to our existing database to ensure it’s someone that should have access to the admin panel.</p><p>You can use the <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/share-kit/demo">Share Kit demo</a> to generate the code needed to place the QR code on the login page. For the DatingApp administration panel login, we end up with:</p> <code>import React from 'react'
import {RequestElement, Action} from '@bloomprotocol/share-kit-react'

const requestData = {
  action: Action.attestation,
  token: 'e1b865a6-7eb6-4347-9a03-e1e6342ef85e',
  org_name: 'DatingApp Admin',
  url: 'https://receive-kit.datingapp.co/api/receive',
  org_logo_url: 'https://datingapp.co/images/DatingApp-Logo.png',
  org_usage_policy_url: 'https://datingapp.co/legal/terms',
  org_privacy_policy_url: 'https://datingapp.co/legal/privacy',
  types: ['email']
}

const MyComponent: React.SFC = props =&gt; (
  &lt;RequestElement
    requestData={requestData}
    buttonCallbackUrl="https://datingapp.co/admin?token=e1b865a6-7eb6-4347-9a03-e1e6342ef85e"
    qrOptions={{
      size: 256,
      hideLogo: false,
      fgColor: '#16325b'
    }}
  /&gt;
)
</code> 
<p>That token above is unique to your app. It is not a token provided by Bloom. You choose your own token as a unique identifier for your app, allowing you to distinguish data sharing requests from multiple sources. This also ensures you are receiving data from your app, and not someone else’s.</p><p>Also note that the <code>Action</code> in this request, unlike others, is <code>Action.authentication</code>. This ensures that Verify Kit knows that... </p><p>Once we have placed that on the login view, it should render like this:</p>DatingApp Admin Portal Login Page with Bloom QR Code Embedded<p>After scanning the QR code using Bloom's mobile app, this is what you would see:</p>The Data Sharing Request someone trying to log in to the adminstration panel will see.<p>Completing the ‘Slide to Share’ action will share the data with your Verify Kit instance, allowing you to ingest the data and verify it against your database. Assuming it’s successful, you can let the user in to the admin panel!</p><p>Your employees can use Bloom’s mobile app to log in to your administration panel instead of using a username and password. </p><p>To really beef up the security here, and ensure it is the same person with the same device (or a new device where they have restored a backup) each time, you could also ask for the following Verifiable Credentials:</p>  <code>phone</code>  <code>email</code>  <code>linkedin</code>  <code>full-name</code>  <code>birth-date</code>  <code>sanction-screen</code>  <code>pep-screen</code>  <p>Of course we don’t want to recommend you intrude into your staff’s personal lives, but you must consider the sensitivity of the data and the power the administration app they are accessing grants them. This is also all data you likely know about your employees already, and therefore you can verify the data received via Bloom.</p><p>This is just one of the many use cases where you can use Bloom’s open source technology to enhance trust and security within your own internal platforms while maintaining data security. Verify the data provided, delete it from your Verify Kit service, and allow your compliance and security teams to rest assured they have taken a concrete step towards better internal controls.</p> More Resources:   <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter">Bloom Starter GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/share-kit/overview">Share Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/share-kit#TAttestationTypeNames">Share Kit Attestation Types</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/verify-kit/overview">Verify Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/verify-kit">Verify Kit GitHub Repository</a>    Bloom: Your Data, Your Credit, Your Privacy <p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all in one simple app. No more centralized data storage.

<p>Nothing felt strange when former president Barack Obama began his speech about the importance of taking a critical look at what we see on the internet. That is until he started making some, shall we say, uncharacteristic statements. The now-famous deepfake was one of the first of its kind to go viral, showing both how easy it is to be fooled and the dangers of not looking more closely.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“This is a dangerous time, moving forward we need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet. It’s a time we need to rely on trusted news sources,” </p>– Peele through Obama</blockquote>



 

 



<p>The word <a href="https://medium.com/@songda/a-short-history-of-deepfakes-604ac7be6016">deepfake was coined by a Reddit user back in 2017</a> and is a portmanteau of the words deep learning and fake. Today, it is a blanket term for artificial intelligence (AI) powered face swapping, i.e. when one person is replaced by another in a photo or video footage. On Reddit it began as a way to make fake adult videos of famous celebrities, and while that “trend” continues, deepfakes have become a way to create and disseminate misinformation and fake news. Peele’s decision to use Obama illustrates just how easy it is to manipulate politicians’ words, which is particularly worrisome as the 2020 election approaches. And while some can be fun to watch, like Bill Hader transforming into<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWrhRBb-1Ig"> Tom Cruise</a> or<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhUhypV27w"> Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, they all come with a warning bell.&nbsp;</p>



 How’d They Do That? 



<p>Deep learning is an AI technique that uses huge data sets to create standard models and formats. Inspired by artificial neural networks, a function of the biological brain, it is considered to be the breakthrough within the field of AI. By leveraging neural network powered AI and machine learning, images and video footage can be fed into an algorithm that creates a “mask” which can be used to replace or manipulate original faces or and voices by using lookalike data. The algorithms train themselves to improve over time. If Peele hadn’t appeared in the video next to Obama, the manipulation would have been difficult for many humans to even detect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much of the software involved in creating deepfakes is open-sourced like Google’s TensorFlow or uses widely available tools like Adobe’s After Effects. That doesn’t mean it’s easy, however. Peele’s skilled production team spent 56 hours to create the one-minute Obama video.</p>



 What Does This Mean for KYC?&nbsp; 



<p>The rise and advancement of deepfakes does pose a threat in that many organizations have found themselves wondering if these techniques could be used to create false identities not easily detectable within their onboarding processes. For sophisticated KYC and verification tools like <a href="https://authenteq.com/">Authenteq’s</a>, however, deepfakes can be thwarted at several entry points.</p>



<p>Authenticating one’s identity within a fully automated, robust KYC solution means that a person has to scan and upload a copy of their government-issued ID. The next step is to take a selfie and using facial recognition technology, the customer’s identity can only be verified once the biometrics of the selfie match those of the photo ID. The liveness check done with the real-time selfie also determines whether the customer is a real person, and so anything pre-recorded or played through a screen wouldn’t pass. Biometric authentication that doesn’t include a liveness check is only doing half the job as far as KYC efforts go.</p>



<p>Once verified within Authenteq’s system, spot ID checks can also be implemented if suspicious behavior is detected. If the identity does match the ID used in the onboarding process, the account could be flagged or even deactivated.</p>



<p>There has also been a series of legislation introduced to help tackle this problem. In 2019, the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3230"> DEEPFAKES Accountability Act</a> was introduced in the House of Representatives, and California passed<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902884/california-deepfake-political-ban-election-2020"> legislation</a> making it illegal to produce deepfakes of politicians. In the United Kingdom, producers of deepfakes can be<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/what-is-deep-fake-pornography-and-is-it-illegal-in-the-uk_uk_5bf4197ce4b0376c9e68f8c5?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANO465UhdTIOSqTKHRjw0X8c-MSstQyicQRLFRn2icdH1SuNC7u3R-zoqNfcARCzR-WeClmyXYgxvjChZ3zayJqECu8v_8LA3r5rdDhaz_-c5a3Sz2Y5oZkxi43chLqjGphrH5i9EUIiBHhEE13RXZkNQXCRBa01XfrK4OZomQWJ"> prosecuted</a> for harassment.</p>



 Looking Ahead 



<p>Much of the very warranted concern over deepfakes revolves around prominent public figures like politicians and celebrities, but what about the average consumer or businesses? Identity theft and fraud are a growing concern for people in every country and business in every sector. Like all technology, we can’t predict with any certainty what will be possible with deepfakes in the coming years but when it comes to identity verification, one thing is certain. As deepfake technology gets more sophisticated, so too will our KYC and identity verification tools.<br></p>

 MYKEY and IRISnet Established a Strategic Partnership <p>MYKEY has established a strategic partnership with IRISnet. MYKEY’s technologies, including the cutting-edge Smart Wallet and digital identity, and also MYKEY’s ecosystem is brought to IRISnet’s internet of blockchains, further facilitating the construction of next generation distributed applications and application blockchains. Meanwhile, IRISnet will also provide MYKEY cross-chain services through their practical and reliable cross-chain technologies, not only protecting the security of users’ private data but also enabling users to easily experience smooth and convenient blockchain applications like DeFi. MYKEY and IRISnet will continue to innovate through close collaboration, and jointly contribute to the prosperity and development of the blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>The two parties will carry out in-depth collaboration in many aspects such as technical support and market development:</p> Digital identity: <p>MYKEY will provide industry-leading digital identity and Smart Wallet solutions and technology in this collaboration. At the same time, IRISnet plans to bring KEYID products and technology into the IRISnet and Cosmos ecosystems through developing on-chain distributed identity(DID) modules to further protect user data and privacy in the cross-chain ecosystem.</p><blockquote>MYKEY’s founder, Gulu, expresses that “ IRISnet is the first self-evolutionary BPoS network built with Cosmos SDK. MYKEY is happy to collaborate with IRISnet and has the opportunity to expand our technical products to IRISnet and Cosmos network ecosystem, address customer concerns about losing their accounts, and provide data security support.&nbsp;”</blockquote> Cross-chain services: <p>IRISnet will provide cross-chain services for MYKEY Smart Wallet and other products: through IRISnet’s interchain service hub, MYKEY network will be able to connect to blockchains supported by IRISnet, and jointly provide end-users with smooth and convenient cross-chain DeFi and asset management experience.</p><blockquote>Harriet Cao, the co-founder of IRISnet, remarks that “as a multi-chain smart wallet, MYKEY lowered the barrier for users to experience the digital life, and on the other hand, the cross-chain capability of IRISnet lowered the entrance barrier for service providers and consumers. I believe that, through in-depth collaborations with MYKEY and taking advantage of our strengths, cross-chain service experiences and private data and asset management will be greatly facilitated, pushing forward the practical and pervasive applications of blockchains.”</blockquote> About MYKEY <p>MYKEY (<a href="http://mykey.org">mykey.org</a>) is a smart wallet implemented on multiple public blockchains. It is dedicated to providing foundational infrastructure for the large-scale implementation of blockchains. Through cryptocurrency storage, trading, wealth management, gaming, and community, MYKEY constructs a one-stop digital life platform for its users. On MYKEY, users can gain free accounts as well as resources for internet usage. Users are also able to freeze and restore accounts when private keys get lost. MYKEY is also a building block of Web of Trust. Furthermore, in the context of Web 3.0, MYKEY turns data ownership back to users, protecting user privacy from the ground&nbsp;up.</p> About IRISnet <p>IRIS Network (a.k.a.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>NIST, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology, recently released <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf" title="Zero Trust Architecture">SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture</a>. The NIST special publication examines the principles of and motivations for ZTA, as well as implementation considerations, security concerns, and suggestions for improvements to architecture. NIST SPs are authored primarily for consumption by other US government agencies. In practice, however, their documents often become de facto standards and guidelines used more broadly in industry. In this post I’ll review the strengths of the SP and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p>The NIST document serves as a good introduction for ZTA. The authors correctly describe the fundamental principles of ZTA, which are a combination of traditional security tenets of Least Privilege and Defense-in-Depth. In practice, Least Privilege means only granting sufficient permissions to accomplish specific actions and not more than that; Defense-in-Depth means inserting layers and gates of security at all relevant control points in a use case. Wide open networks behind firewalls are easy targets. These ideas have become more commonly accepted in modern security architectures, as organizations realize that firewalls and other perimeter-based designs are porous and not sufficient for protecting against proliferating threats.</p>
<p>We have often heard about “Zero Trust Networking” at trade shows and conferences. SP 800-207 does a good job of explaining that ZTA is not limited to networks. In fact, ZTA must transcend network-layer thinking in order to be successful. ZTA requires proper authentication and authorization for each session involving users, applications, networks (including clouds), and data. Other key components of ZTA are continuous risk-adaptive authentication and dynamic policy evaluation.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 references OASIS XACML 2.0 architecture, including Policy Administration Points (PAPs), Policy Decision Points (PDPs), and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). The document should have referenced the updated <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html" title="XACML 3.0">XACML 3.0</a>, which contains the elements of Obligations and Advice that can be used in ZTA scenarios where risk-adaptive authentication and authorization may be required by policies. There are also rule and policy combining algorithm optimizations in v. 3 that fit better with the description of Trust Algorithms in the NIST SP (p. 17).</p>
<p>SP 800-207 defines conceptual components that go beyond the standard XACML PAP/PDP/PEP reference architecture. In my view, the breakdown of PDP into Policy Engine and Policy Administrator doesn’t add value and can create confusion. The XACML 3.0 reference architecture is still valid today, and is used in authorization and access control solutions even where explicit support for the XACML language is missing.</p>
<p>The illustration and definition of contributing components in Figure 2 (p. 9), namely CDM System, Industry Compliance, Activity Logs, SIEM System, etc. adhere to other US federal program definitions, but do not exactly match common usage. For example, Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigations (CDM) roughly translate to asset, vulnerability, and configuration management. Industry Compliance is not a set of functions localized to one product or platform. Activity logs are consumed by SIEM, SOAR, and forensics tools. Some extrapolation and normalization of terminology and illustration may make this section applicable outside the US government.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 claims that threat intelligence “is the only component that will most likely be under the control of a service rather than the enterprise” (p. 19). Such a view discounts the prevalence and use of Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) and other kinds of 3rd-party services, including discrete authentication services, and fraud risk services. At KuppingerCole, expect to see more usage and development of additional modular functional services that can enhance the ZTA authentication and authorization experiences for enterprises, covering all permutations of user-device-app-data interactions.</p>
<p>Section 4 of the new doc addresses use cases and deployment scenarios:</p>
 
 Enterprises with satellite offices (includes teleworkers) 
 Multi-cloud/cloud-to-cloud enterprises 
 Contractors and non-employee access 
 Cross domain collaboration 
 Public and/or consumer facing organizations 
 
<p>There are some variations to these use cases that could use additional detail, such as more about remote workforces and cloud-native enterprises. Section 4 is good starting point for planning how to migrate to ZTA.</p>
<p>Most discussions of ZTA tend to highlight the security advantages, of which there are several. Section 5 of SP 800-207 provides a list of possible threats specific to ZTA that industry needs to consider and begin mitigating against. Of special note here are DoS attacks on PDPs, the need for full enterprise monitoring (not just endpoint or network), and potential weaknesses in proprietary/non-standard APIs.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 also lists the use of non-person entities in ZTA administration as a possible threat. It is true that innovative IAM and IGA solutions increasingly employ non-person agents/processes to reduce the workload on human admins. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to:</p>
 
 assign roles and permissions to users at on-boarding based on attributes and entitlements that their peers have 
 perform User Behavioral Analysis (UBA) and provide confidence scores per session 
 analyze device intelligence to determine if the sources of access requests are originating from authorized locations, properly patched, free of malware, etc. 
 process the output of UBA, device intel, and other types of threat intelligence to generate risk scores per session. 
 
<p>It is possible that ML detection models can be manipulated (or gamed) to produce both false positives and negatives, and these outcomes can then be exploited by malicious actors. Even though these types of attacks require sophistication, such attacks have migrated from the theoretical to the real world. Vendors and implementers must take knowledge of these scenarios into consideration when performing threat modeling.</p>
<p>NIST correctly surmises the need for standardization in ZTA, especially in the areas of APIs. Most identity and security products expose APIs for other applications to use, therefore securing these APIs must be a top priority. The proprietary nature of APIs is itself a source of security concern.</p>
<p>In summary, NIST SP 800-207 is a good primer on ZTA which includes some high-level, practical design advice. The authors clearly state that there is no single ZTA solution, and that the road to fully instrumented ZTA is a long one.</p>

<p>Micronaut is a new framework for developing JVM applications, including APIs and microservices. It uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to compute the information that your application needs before runtime, removing the need for reflection. The result is a significant decrease in runtime overhead and startup time, and a substantial increase in application throughput. Micronaut is a direct competitor to Spring Boot from the folks that invented Grails. Its design and runtime efficiency make it ideal for deployment in modern, resource-constrained environments (like serverless).</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster is a full-stack development platform for generating, developing, and deploying modern web applications and microservice architectures. Its first version used AngularJS for the frontend; its latest version uses Angular 10. JHipster traditionally only had a Spring Boot backend implementation. However, other backend implementations have recently been added, including Micronaut!</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster has a concept called blueprints. Blueprints allow you to override default behavior in its application generator. Popular JHipster blueprints include <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-vuejs">Vue.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin">Kotlin</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’d like to show you how to use the new and shiny <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-micronaut">Micronaut blueprint for JHipster</a>. It supports Micronaut 2.0 and deploying to Heroku, plus adding Okta in one command. I figured it’d make for an excellent blog post!</p>

 Build a Micronaut app with JHipster 
 
 
<p>JHipster has its own domain language called JDL (JHipster Domain Language). JDL can be used to describe an app, entities, relationships between entities, and even deployments. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to build a simple app that allows you to record space launches and add images to the event. It will look similar to NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/launchschedule/">Launches and Landings</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11</a>+</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node 12</a>+</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Install JHipster and the Micronaut blueprint using npm:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster@6.10.1 generator-jhipster-micronaut@0.3.8</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Design a Micronaut data model with JHipster’s JDL 
 
 
<p>JHipster has defaults for all of its options. You can create a new app using the <code>jhipster</code> command—hold down the enter key when prompted with choices, and your app will be created with the defaults. <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/">JDL</a> allows you to create an application definition where you only override the defaults. For example, you could create an app with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication using the following JDL:</p>
 
 
 
 application {
  config {
    baseName rockets
    authenticationType oauth2
  }
} 
 
 
 
<p>Create a new directory called <code>spacefan</code>. Add an <code>app.jdl</code> file to it and populate it with the following code.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 application { (1)
  config {
    baseName space
    applicationType monolith
    authenticationType oauth2
    packageName org.jhipster.space
    prodDatabaseType postgresql
    testFrameworks [protractor]
  }
  entities *
}

(2)
entity SpaceEvent {
  name String required
  date LocalDate required
  description TextBlob required
  photo ImageBlob required
  type SpaceEventType required
}

entity Mission {
  name String required
  description String
}

enum SpaceEventType {
  LAUNCH,
  LANDING
}

(3)
relationship OneToOne {
  SpaceEvent{mission(name)} to Mission
}

(4)
paginate SpaceEvent with infinite-scroll
paginate Mission with pagination 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>The app definition overrides the name, authentication type, production database, and test frameworks.</p>
 
 
<p>Entity definitions with validation rules.</p>
 
 
<p>Relationships between entities.</p>
 
 
<p>Pagination rules can be defined for each entity.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 






You can find additional JDL samples on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples">jdl-samples repository</a>.



 
 
 
 
 Generate a Micronaut app with Angular 
 
 
<p>Open a terminal and navigate to the <code>spacefan</code> directory you created. Run the following command to create an Angular app with a Micronaut backend.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mhipster import-jdl app.jdl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This process will create a plethora of files for your application and run <code>npm install</code>. When it’s finished, you’ll need to start Keycloak.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d</code> 
 
 
 






If you’re an Oh My Zsh fan, you can install the <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/oh-my-zsh/">Oh My Zsh JHipster plugin</a> and just type <code>jhkeycloakup</code>.



 
 
<p>Keycloak is the default OIDC engine that’s used by JHipster, and you can run it in a Docker container. In your project’s <code>src/main/docker</code> folder, there’s a Docker Compose file for Keycloak, as well as default users, realms, and applications. Keycloak imports these on startup.</p>
 
 
 What about React and Vue.js? 
 
<p>You might have noticed I didn’t specify a client framework. I didn’t need to because Angular is the default. If you want to use React instead, you simply need to add a <code>clientFramework react</code> line to the application definition in your JDL. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 application {
  config {
    baseName space
    applicationType monolith
    authenticationType oauth2
    clientFramework react
    packageName org.jhipster.space
    prodDatabaseType postgresql
    testFrameworks [protractor]
  }
  entities *
} 
 
 
 






You can see all the default options in <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/applications#available-application-configuration-options">JHipster’s documentation</a>.



 
 
<p>If you want to use Vue.js instead of React, it’s a little more complicated. The Micronaut blueprint modifies Angular and React templates. These modifications will likely be needed for Vue as well. Since Vue will be integrated into JHipster in v7.0, it’s probably best to wait until it’s released before you try Micronaut and Vue.</p>
 
 
<p>If you really want to try Vue with Micronaut, you can. You might need to modify the Vue files to work with Micronaut after you generate your project.</p>
 
 
<p>First, you’ll need to install the Vue.js blueprint:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster-vuejs</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then you’ll need to import the JDL and specify both Micronaut and Vue.js as blueprints.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster import-jdl app.jdl --blueprints micronaut,vuejs</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Confirm Authentication with Keycloak works 
 
<p>With Keycloak up and running, you should be able to log in. Start your app using Maven:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw</code> 
 
 
 
<p>When it finishes launching, go to <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code> in your favorite browser and click the sign in link.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Your app will redirect you to Keycloak to log in. Use <code>admin/admin</code> to log in as an administrator.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can browse through the Administration section by clicking on the Administration menu.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Go to Entities &gt; Space Events to add new events and missions.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 






You might notice how both space events and missions have existing data. This is from <a href="https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/">Faker.js</a> and <a href="https://www.liquibase.org/">Liquibase</a>. Liquibase is used to create your database tables, and Faker.js is used to create fake data in development. If you want to turn off fake data, you can open <code>src/main/resources/application-dev.yml</code> and search for <code>faker</code>. Remove it from the list of active profiles for Liquibase.



 
 
 
 <code>liquibase:
  datasources:
    default:
      async: true
      change-log: classpath:config/liquibase/master.xml
      contexts: dev</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Since you chose Protractor for testing, you can ensure all the client code works by running the following command in a second terminal window. (Your JHipster app should still be running in the first.)</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run e2e</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should see a message saying that all tests have passed.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>14 passing (34s)</code> 
 
 
 






The pauses for alerts when running end-to-end tests is a <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/11766">known issue</a>.



 
 
 
 
 
 Prepare Micronaut for production 
 
 
<p>JHipster ships with profiles for development and production. In development, everything is designed to be fast for the developer. In production, everything should be quick for your users. When you build your app with the <code>prod</code> profile enabled, Micronaut is optimized with less logging and PostgreSQL. On the client side, scripts are optimized, CSS is minimized, and HTML is streamlined.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Deploy Micronaut to Heroku 
 
 
<p>Since JHipster has production optimizations built in, you’re ready to deploy your app to Heroku!</p>
 
 
<p>To begin, you must install the <a href="https://cli.heroku.com/">Heroku CLI</a>, and have created a Heroku account. You will need to verify your Heroku account with a credit card as a security measure. JHipster won’t add any add-ons that cost money, but Heroku requires a credit card on file to provision some add-ons.</p>
 
 
<p>Stop your app. Then, run the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mhipster heroku</code> 
 
 
 
<p>When prompted for type of deployment, choose Git. Use 11 for the Java version and select Yes to provision the Okta add-on. Enter your email for the JHipster Admin user and an initial password. When prompted to overwrite <code>pom.xml</code>, type <code>a</code> to overwrite it.</p>
 
 
<p>This process can take a while to complete. When I tried it, it took seven minutes.</p>
 
 
<p>When the deployment process finishes, open your favorite browser to the URL in your console or run <code>heroku open</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You should be able to log in using the email and password you provided. Okta will prompt you to change your password and set a security question (for password recovery).</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can also deploy your JHipster app as a Docker container! In <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/06/17/angular-docker-spring-boot#heroku-spring-boot-docker">Angular + Docker with a Big Hug from Spring Boot</a>, I showed you how to deploy Spring Boot to Heroku as a container. I also showed how you can deploy that same image to Knative on Google Cloud and Cloud Foundry. Once you have a JHipster + Micronaut image built, you can use those same instructions to deploy to those platforms.</p>
 
 
<p>In the next section, I’ll show how to deploy your container to Heroku.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Micronaut + Docker on Heroku 
 
 
<p>JHipster uses <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib">Jib</a> to build Docker images for your application. Run the following command to create a Docker image.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can test it out locally using Docker Compose.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml down
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>To make Keycloak work, you need to add the following line to your hosts file (<code>/etc/hosts</code> on Mac/Linux, <code>c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</code> on Windows).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>127.0.0.1	keycloak</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This is because you will access your application with a browser on your machine (which is named localhost, or <code>127.0.0.1</code>), but inside Docker, it will run in its own container, which is named <code>keycloak</code>.</p>
 



 
 
<p>Once you’ve confirmed everything works, create a new app on Heroku, and add it as a remote.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku apps:create
git remote add docker https://git.heroku.com/&lt;your-new-app&gt;.git</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then run the commands below to deploy your Micronaut app as a Docker image. Be sure to replace the <code>&lt;…​&gt;</code> placeholders with your Heroku app name. If you don’t know your app name, run <code>heroku apps</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku container:login
docker tag space registry.heroku.com/&lt;heroku-app&gt;/web
docker push registry.heroku.com/&lt;heroku-app&gt;/web</code> 
 
 
 
<p>For example, I used:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku container:login
docker tag space registry.heroku.com/infinite-crag-99454/web
docker push registry.heroku.com/infinite-crag-99454/web</code> 
 
 
 
<p>At this point, you can use the PostgreSQL and Okta add-ons you’ve already configured. Run the following command to get the identifiers of the add-ons from the <code>heroku</code> remote that you first deployed to.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku addons --remote heroku</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then you can attach these instances to your new application.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku addons:attach &lt;postgresql-addon-name&gt; --remote docker
heroku addons:attach &lt;okta-addon-name&gt; --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>When you use <code>mhipster heroku</code> to deploy your application, it properly configures the database for you. However, when deploying it as a Docker container, none of that happens. Therefore, you need to set a few configuration variables so your Docker container can talk to PostgreSQL. First, run the following command to get the PostgreSQL URL.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku config:get DATABASE_URL --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command will retrieve a value with the following syntax:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>postgres://username:password@address</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, set the database environment variables to match the keys that are in <code>application-heroku.yml</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku config:set JDBC_DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://&lt;address&gt; --remote docker
heroku config:set JDBC_DATABASE_USERNAME=&lt;username&gt; --remote docker
heroku config:set JDBC_DATABASE_PASSWORD=&lt;password&gt; --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Set the max amount of Java memory to use and specify the Micronaut environments.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku config:set JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx128m --remote docker
heroku config:set MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS=prod,heroku --remote docker
heroku config:set MICRONAUT_ENV_DEDUCTION=false --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now you should be able to release your container and start the app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku container:release web --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can watch the logs to see if your container started successfully.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku logs --tail --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now you should be able to open your app, click the sign in link, and authenticate!</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku open --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you test your Dockerized Angular + Micronaut app on <a href="https://securityheaders.com">securityheaders.com</a>, you’ll see it scores an A!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you want to log in to this app, you’ll need to add login and logout redirect URIs to your Okta Web app. To access it, open <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com">dashboard.heroku.com</a> in a private window. Log in and go to $docker-app-name &gt; Resources &gt; okta. After you’re redirected to Okta, you should see your developer dashboard. If you don’t, log out of Okta and try again. Then, go to Applications &gt; Web &gt; General &gt; Edit.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, I added the following to mine:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Login redirect URI: <code>https://infinite-crag-99454.herokuapp.com/oauth2/callback/oidc</code></p>
 
 
<p>Logout redirect URI: <code>https://infinite-crag-99454.herokuapp.com/logout</code></p>
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you make save these changes and try to log in to your app again, you’ll likely receive an error message:</p>
 
 
 
 Internal Server Error: Unable to sync user with idp. 
 
 
 
<p>This happens when you try to log in with the super admin that the Okta add-on creates. Try logging in using a private window and it should work as expected.</p>
 
 
<p>Deploying a Micronaut app to Heroku in a Docker container is a little more difficult because JHipster doesn’t configure PostgreSQL and Okta for you. However, setting a few environment variables is all you need to get things up and running.</p>

					 <p>We’re continuing our COVID-19 blog series interviews with Leah Houston, MD. Leah is an emergency doctor that has practiced medicine across the United States for nearly 10 years. She is currently working on an identity project around physician and later patient identities using <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We asked Leah to share her thoughts on how SSI can not only play a role in the medical industry but also impact the world during COVID-19. Check out the interview below!</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Tells us some more about your company. What is it called? What is its purpose? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The project is called <a href="https://hpec.io">HPEC</a>. HPEC stands for humanitarian, physicians, empowerment, community. For those of you who’ve been involved in the identity discussion, you understand that it’s all about community, and it’s about connecting with others. Your identity is used to interact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We as physicians have to constantly interact with each other in order to coordinate care for patients. But right now, there’s no way for us to do that in a streamlined way. As with every other form of digital communication, the process is centralized. So if you’re working in a hospital, you only are able to communicate with doctors in that hospital. If you work for an insurance network, you’re only able to send patients to other doctors in that insurance network if you want the patient’s care to be covered. HPEC decentralizes all of that and allows everyone to interact with each other regardless of policy, practice, location, or specialty, so doctors can get their patients the best care.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 How does HPEC use SSI? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>When we document things as physicians, we’re really recording what happened in the patient encounter, so we can call upon the information in the future when needed. If the patient comes back in six months, we can look at the records and answer questions such as: Why did we give that medication, or what surgery did they have and when? But documenting the interaction is also important when communicating with other medical professionals. If I’m sending my private practice patient to an orthopedic surgeon, I want to be able to send the surgeon the patient’s relevant medical history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, physicians record their documentation on electronic health records (EHRs). And similar to any digital documentation, especially over the internet, we have the same problem where physicians have to choose one EHR, and then the information is all trapped there. The EHRs don’t talk to each other, and there’s no standards for interoperability. So there’s a lot of friction with being able to share that information among physicians and with patients being able to access that information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because of that we are building a self-sovereign identity solution for the practicing physician, so they can log in, document, and share this information in a streamlined and standardized way.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 What was the catalyst for you to begin using SSI technology? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Something happened to me that made me really wake up to this problem and then this potential solution—a hospital that I was previously working for stole my identity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They were using my professional brand, NPI numbers, and license numbers to bill under my name when I wasn’t even in that hospital anymore. That kind of turned on a light bulb. I had learned about identity (self-sovereign identity was very, very early in that stage), but I had read about identity solutions around voting and around resource allocation, especially in emerging economies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I realized that SSI would have not only prevented what happened to me but could be used to alleviate a lot of the friction in our current healthcare system.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 In the healthcare industry, what are the COVID-19 related use cases where SSI and verifiable credentials would be most helpful? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Self-sovereign identity brings privacy, security, and trust to the individual, without the individual having to reveal all of their identifying information. When it comes to COVID-19 and safety in businesses (especially in healthcare facilities like nursing homes), there might be some rules that employers create or that governments start mandating where you might need to have a recent negative COVID-19 test in order to go to work or enter the facility. But do you really need to show a piece of paper that contains a lot of personal information such as your name, phone number, and other lab tests you did that day? No. SSI makes it so you don’t have to.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 What do you think it will take for the healthcare industry to begin adopting SSI as a viable solution to combat the risks of COVID-19 in the use cases you mentioned above? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Well, unfortunately as with everything else, show me the money. It has to demonstrate that it’s going to save money somewhere. If I am not allowed to go to work unless I prove that I’ve had a recent COVID-19 test, and I don’t have a solution for that, then that hits me in my wallet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if there’s an app that I can easily download, store my negative COVID-19 test result in it as a verifiable credential, and be able to show that to my employer, then we have a solution. So it’s going to have to be public, private partnerships and individuals who demand to use it. Those individuals may be CEOs of companies who want to get people back to work or they may be the individuals who want to be able to go back to work, board an airplane, go on a cruise, go to the movies, or send their children back to school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a bit of a leap when it comes to understanding how SSI is a solution, which I think is also somewhat of a barrier, but I think these kinds of conversations are going to help open that up.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 What advice would you give to physicians and other healthcare professionals who would like to learn about SSI but don't know where to start? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>What people really need are developers who can build these platforms and make them user friendly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if people want to just learn about SSI in general and understand what it means, <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/">SSI Meetup</a> has a lot of really good webinars on SSI. The people who’ve been doing this for a long time—Drummond Reed, Kaliyah Young, Christopher Allen, Kim Hamilton Duffy—these individuals have written a lot on the topic. The information and leadership is out there. It just takes a little time to understand it.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Is there anything else that you would like to add to this interview?

<p>Renaissance 2.0 will boost the development of Ontology’s DeFi ecosystem</p><p>Decentralized finance, better known as “DeFi”, has become a buzzword in the cryptocurrency industry in recent weeks. According to <a href="https://defipulse.com/">Defi Pulse</a>, the total value locked in the DeFi sector hit an all-time high of $5.21 billion as of August 14,&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Many developers have already been exchanging ideas and developing DeFi dApps in Ontology’s ecosystem. In the coming months, a range of new decentralized finance applications will be launched, as DeFi capabilities expand to reach more mainstream audiences.</p><p>In order to encourage pioneering DeFi developers to build on the Ontology blockchain, we’ve updated our Ontology dApp Incentive Plan to the new “Renaissance 2.0”, with the aim of boosting the DeFi ecosystem on the Ontology network. The Ontology Foundation will give the plan a 3-month trial period — from August 15th, 2020 to October 15th,&nbsp;2020.</p><p>A summary of the DeFi-exclusive Renaissance 2.0 plan is as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>1. Active DeFi transaction fee rebate. 100% of all transaction fees (ONG) generated by dApps listed in the Top 10 Ontology dApps on <a href="https://dappradar.com/search/ontology">DappRadar</a> on <a href="https://dapp.review/">Dappreview</a> will be returned to developers.</p><p>2. Developers can get DOUBLE the transaction fees returned if they integrate and use ONT ID in their&nbsp;dApp.</p><p>3. High performing developers will be provided with technical, marketing, and operations support from the Ontology&nbsp;team.</p><p>Following evaluation processes, accepted applications will receive coaching from experts to help chosen dApps with marketing and development.</p> Example <p>John and his team developed a DeFi dApp on the Ontology blockchain that utilizes ONT ID. They submitted their dApp to DappRadar and it became very popular, rising into the Top 10 Ontology dApps&nbsp;list.</p><p>With the new Renaissance 2.0 plan, John and his team will&nbsp;receive</p>  200% of all transaction fees (ONG) generated by the dApp. That&nbsp;is,  <blockquote>1) 100% of all transaction fees (ONG) generated by the dApp for being a DeFi&nbsp;dApp.</blockquote><blockquote>2) Another 100% of all transaction fees as a reward for integrating and using ONT ID in the&nbsp;dApp</blockquote>  Technical support and guidance on protocols, SDK, coding support, and auditing of smart contracts.  Marketing support on all Ontology’s social media platforms and 29 communities, as well as event planning (such as an AMA in Ontology’s community telegram groups), graphic designs, news releases and proofreading, real-time community maintenance, and feedback.  <p>Don’t miss out! The earlier you apply, the earlier you can start to earn rewards. The application review normally takes around 1 to 2 business&nbsp;days.</p> How to&nbsp;apply? <p>Develop a DeFi dApp on the Ontology blockchain first and then submit your dApp to either <a href="https://dappradar.com/submit-dapp">DappRadar</a> or <a href="https://dapp.review/login?next=/dapp/submit">DappReview</a>. The Ontology team will check the dApp ranking and announce the rewards distribution status on Twitter on the last week of each&nbsp;month.</p><p>Are you a developer?

 Ontology Completes DID Smart Contract Development on Ethereum to Boost the Decentralized Identity Ecosystem <p>This week, Ontology successfully completed the development of the next stage of its open-source DID smart contract on the Ethereum network, significantly expanding the purview of the platform’s decentralized identity ecosystem. Having defined the DID specification, submitted the required W3C registration, and concluded the DID smart contract development, Ontology’s bespoke Decentralized Identity Solutions now boast even greater chain interoperability and heightened technological capabilities.</p><p>The announcement means that Ontology’s Decentralized Identity Solutions, defined in this instance by the addition of a new smart contract method <a href="https://github.com/ontology-tech/DID-solidity/tree/etho-did">did:etho:</a>, can now be used not only across the expansive Ethereum network, including a range of popular DeFi applications, but also most chains that run EVM virtual machines. Ontology aims to make its Decentralized Identity solutions available across any chain, as part of its ongoing effort to achieve full cross-chain functionality.</p><p>LI JUN, Founder of Ontology, said, “In line with Ontology’s defined objective to transform key processes pertaining to the management of individuals’ data, we are delighted to build on the significant progress that has been made with respect to our ever-expanding decentralized identity ecosystem. Successfully completing the open-source decentralized identifier smart contract development on the caliber of Ethereum is another milestone in what has been an incredibly successful Q3 for our platform.”<br> <br>This completion is the latest in a string of high-profile announcements for the company that specializes in digital identity and data.

  <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) software comes in many forms. Some are heavy with software components (the thick client model) while others are leaner (the thin client model). Since we at SSH.COM are firm believers in the thin client model, I wanted to present five solid reasons why this is the case.</p>
<p></p>
 1. No constant cycle of installing, patching and configuring agents 
<p>Thick clients require that you have to install agents on the client - and usually on the server as well. Moreover, you need to ensure that those agents are always up-to-date, patched and compatible with the operating system, and installed on every client necessary.</p>
<p>That’s not only a lot of steps but it’s a process that often requires the help of specialist staff which increases costs. On top of that, when access is no longer valid, you should ensure that the agent is actually removed from the client.</p>
<p>With a thin client, there is no need to install, remove or patch any agents at any point. We prefer a model where access is granted, managed and revoked using a standard browser - the only ‘software agent’ you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Less complexity means easier endpoint security management 
<p>Every piece of software component added to the environment adds complexity to the mix. The installation and configuration needs easily add up when people join the company, switch roles and leave. This is particularly true for 3rd parties whose access needs are often temporary.</p>
<p>Moreover, PAM solutions grant primarily admin-level access. Installing a required PAM agent requires (local) admin rights which in turn are often under the control of other solutions since they are privileged accounts.</p>
<p>Client installations might also require application black or whitelisting – which adds yet another management layer to the equation. In some cases, you might need to give local admin rights to 3rd parties to get them onboarded which might not always be a good idea or even against corporate policies.</p>
<p>All in all, having privileged software agents on clients adds up to surprisingly complex endpoint security management.</p>
<p>With a thin client model, you simply skip the PAM agent installation phase which saves a lot of time, effort and money and makes access management leaner. It also means that you can have an identical installation image for all clients intended for privileged users, and you can manage software and hardware upgrades, security policies, application changes virtually and remotely using that same image.</p>
<p>You can also ensure that the clients have only the bare minimum setup for the required tasks, so there is nothing to steal if the client is compromised.</p>
<p>Last but not least, this model reduces the number of misconfigurations. Since privileged users or 3rd parties don’t need to – and can’t - install anything to use the client, unauthorized software installations or installing viruses becomes unlikely.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href="https://blog.ssh.com/make_remote_work_secure_for_admins">making secure remote work fast &amp; secure for admins, devs and IT subcontractors here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Standard, plugin-free browser for minimized management 
<p>There are access management tools that work using browsers but require plugins for privileged user access to work. This is just points 1 and 2 wrapped inside a browser: are all the plugins up-to-date, who maintains them, who has the rights to install them, are they always compatible with the latest browser versions, is the browser set up correctly per client…</p>
<p>We believe in an approach where your standard browser is your only access management tool that you need to update. The official browser releases are always rigorously tested, and patches are fast and automatic which is not often the case with plugins or other software components. Once again, this model is straightforward and minimizes the number of configurations and reduces complexity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Thin in bloat, rich in features and usability 
<p>This point is almost ideological: many widely used applications – IT or otherwise - exist in the cloud and are based on thin clients, like Citrix Virtual Apps, Office 365 or Netflix just to name a few. With thin client PAM software, your developers get the same, consistent and secure experience across clients and your admins manage all access through a single pane of glass. Thin can be very rich in features: the features simply exist behind a clean looking UI.</p>
<p>This model is also very fast for onboarding: the developer just logs in to the centralized authority through a UI without anyone having to configure anything on the client. Switching clients becomes effortless. The number of access ticket requests is significantly smaller and training needs are radically reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Respect your environment, minimize all changes 
<p>If you are not familiar with the concept of immutable infrastructure, here’s a small breakdown of the idea. Once you have a particular environment set up and servers deployed, you don’t make any run-time changes to it. If you change something, you decommission the entire environment and spin up an entirely new instance instead. The benefit is more consistency, predictability and reliability in your infrastructure.</p>
<p>Again, thin is key. Don’t install anything on the client or the server for that matter. When granting privileged access, you don’t even need to create any one-time passwords or temporary accounts on the server side either. All these processes require constant run-time changes and add unwanted complexity and unnecessary processes. We are suggesting that privileged access can be granted without permanent credentials with what we call <a href="https://www.ssh.com/iam/ephemeral_access/">ephemeral certificates</a>, in a <a href="https://blog.ssh.com/zoom-and-who-data-breaches-prove-need-passwordless-it-solution">passwordless</a> fashion and without making any kind of changes to your environment.</p>
<p>This might sound radical and we are fine with that reaction. Not all PAMs need to be the same: we built ours with a strong focus in the future which is mostly multi-cloud and hybrid driven. The fact that our solution, PrivX, is based on just-in-time authentication without a need for any type of permanent credentials for privileged users was just one of the reasons KuppingerCole credited us with one of the Overall Product Leaders in their <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80088/privileged-access-management/">Leadership Compass 2020: Privileged Access Management</a>, as evidenced by the following quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s an innovative approach but one that does bring functional and security advantages – access is faster, onboarding and offboarding of privileged users is quick and there are no passwords to issue or lose, since there are no permanent leave-behind credentials”</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>The CEO of a startup gaming company is in the middle of developing its next big hit for gamers. Between ensuring the product is perfect for release, examining the workflow of the business and keeping employees engaged, the amount of to-dos and questions quickly becomes overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEO makes the decision to build an advisory board for the company. As a first step, they identify and record all the gaps in the business, as well as specific questions that have come up in recent meetings that need unbiased answers. But the success of the company depends on choosing the right people to answer those questions and give advice on the gaps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building an effective board means CEOs must be open to accepting coaching and guidance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While advisory boards are not mandatory within an organization, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/technology-ceos-create-valuable-buyer-urgency-for-shorter-sales-cycles/">tech CEOs </a>can benefit greatly from the presence of a board, as each member can offer insights, ideas and strategic advice outside of the CEO’s expertise. For startups, establishing an advisory board can play a pivotal role in their corporate development.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36547"]</p>
 Understand the business needs 
<p>CEOs often begin the search for advisory board members prior to understanding the needs of the organization and the critical matters the board will be looking to solve. As a first step, tech CEOs need to identify goals and a clear path to accomplishing those goals. This in turn will offer insight into the type of individuals and skills needed on the board. Think about areas of the business that need improvement and find the gaps in knowledge, skill and experience.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-must-haves-in-the-ceo-chro-culture-conversation/">3 Must-Haves in the CEO-CHRO Culture Conversation</a></p>
 Welcome challenges 
<p>Although advisory board members are chosen by the CEO, they lack the legal liability and corporate power for decision making and strategic direction of the organization. Because of this, individuals are often selected based on relationships, a tech CEO’s network or on specific expertise, likely making them more hesitant to offer a counterargument to the CEO.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that building an effective board means CEOs must be open to accepting coaching and guidance, welcome challenging thoughts, and be willing to allow outsiders to help structure and build their organization.</p>
 Know what good looks like 
<p>The advisory board should consist of executives who have an interest in the company and are willing to contribute time to its development. Review backgrounds and experience to identify the skills that each individual has to offer. CEOs should keep the number of members small enough to make the group manageable, but large enough to get the talent needed. The larger the advisory board, the more attention and resources it will require.</p>
<p>Each advisor should be able to offer some of these attributes:</p>
 
 Industry knowledge 
 Customer contacts 
 Access to capital 
 Access to potential management team members and advisors 
 Partnership contracts 
 M&amp;A experience 
 General management experience 
 
 Avoid conflicts 
<p>CEOs will want to determine any conflicts of interest early on and have necessary agreements in place, including nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) and conflict of interest agreements, as advisors will have access to confidential business plans, intellectual property and the organization’s overall strategy.</p>
<p>To prevent conflicts in positions, a set term limit and mandatory performance reviews should be put in place. This will also enable the board to remain fluid as the business needs of the organization change and new skills and experience are required.</p>
 Don’t rush the process 
<p>While it’s important to staff the board as soon as possible, it’s not necessary to choose the entire board at once. Begin with one or two strong candidates and fill each seat as you find the right individuals.</p>
 Motivate your members&nbsp; 
<p>Lastly, advisors should be incentivized via correct compensation when possible, through equity, cash or other expenses, to ensure members stay engaged. When deciding on compensation, take into account a prospect’s potential role, current position, strengths and what they bring to the table overall.</p>
<p>CEOs who prepare their company properly for the existence of an advisory board will set it up to play a key role in dealing with many issues, including finance, sales, marketing, expansion, production, funding and infrastructure. Ultimately, an effective advisory board can assist in many aspects of running a business, help lead strategic changes and actively contribute to the organization’s success.</p>

  <p>Spring Cloud Gateway is the Reactive API Gateway of the Spring Ecosystem, built on Spring Boot, WebFlux, and Project Reactor. Its job is to proxy and route requests to services and to provide cross-cutting concerns such as security, monitoring, and resilience. As Reactive models gain popularity, there is a chance that your microservices architecture becomes a mix of Spring MVC blocking applications and Spring WebFlux non-blocking applications.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will use Spring Cloud Gateway for routing to traditional Servlet API microservices, and you will learn the required configuration for these three common OAuth2 patterns, using Okta as authorization server:</p>

 
   OpenID Connect Authentication - the pattern used for end-user authentication. 
   Token Relay - when an OAuth2 consumer service or application, like the API gateway, acts as a client and forwards the incoming token to outgoing resource requests. 
   Client Credentials Grant - the pattern to use when the authorized requestor is another service. In this case, we talk about machine to machine, m2m, or service to service authorization.

 Pattern 1: OpenID Connect Authentication 

<p>OpenID Connect defines a mechanism for End-User authentication based on the OAuth2 authorization code flow. In this pattern, the Authorization Server returns an Authorization Code to the application, which can then exchange it for an ID Token and an Access Token directly. The Authorization Server authenticates the application with a ClientId and ClientSecret before the exchange happens. As you can see in the diagram below, OpenID and OAuth2 patterns make extensive use of HTTP redirections, some of which have been omitted for clarity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For testing this OAuth2 pattern, create the API Gateway with service discovery.
First, create a base folder for all the projects:</p>

   <code>mkdir oauth2-patterns
cd oauth2-patterns
</code>   

 Create a Eureka Discovery Service 

<p>With <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a>, create an Eureka server:</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip -d dependencies=cloud-eureka-server \
-d groupId=com.okta.developer \
-d artifactId=discovery-service  \
-d name="Eureka Service" \
-d description="Discovery service" \
-d packageName=com.okta.developer.discovery \
-d javaVersion=11 \
-o eureka.zip
</code>   

<p>Unzip the file:</p>

   <code>unzip eureka.zip -d eureka
cd eureka
</code>   
<p>As described in <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-netflix.adoc#jdk-11-support">Spring Cloud Netflix documentation</a>, the JAXB modules, which the Eureka server depends upon, were removed in JDK 11. If you are running Eureka server with JDK 11, edit the <code>pom.xml</code> and add the following dependency:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.jaxb&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jaxb-runtime&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>EurekaServiceApplication</code> to add <code>@EnableEurekaServer</code> annotation:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.discovery;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.server.EnableEurekaServer;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class EurekaServiceApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EurekaServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and add the following content:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: localhost
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false
    fetchRegistry: false
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${server.port}/eureka/
</code>   

<p>Start the service:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8761</code> and you should see the Eureka home.</p>

 Create a Spring Cloud Gateway Application 

<p>Now let’s create an API Gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway, using Spring Initializr again.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
-d dependencies=cloud-eureka,cloud-gateway,webflux,okta,cloud-security,thymeleaf \
-d groupId=com.okta.developer \
-d artifactId=api-gateway  \
-d name="Spring Cloud Gateway Application" \
-d description="Demo project of a Spring Cloud Gateway application and OAuth flows" \
-d packageName=com.okta.developer.gateway \
-d javaVersion=11 \
-o api-gateway.zip
</code>   
<p>Unzip the project:</p>

   <code>unzip api-gateway.zip -d api-gateway
cd api-gateway
</code>   
<p>Edit <code>SpringCloudGatewayApplication</code> to add <code>@EnableEurekaClient</code> annotation.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.EnableEurekaClient;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
public class SpringCloudGatewayApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringCloudGatewayApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a package <code>controller</code> and the controller class <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/gateway/controller/GreetingController.java</code>. The controller will allow us to test the login without having configured any routes yet.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway.controller;

import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.OAuth2AuthorizedClient;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.annotation.RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@Controller
public class GreetingController {

    @RequestMapping("/greeting")
    public String greeting(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser oidcUser, Model model,
                           @RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient("okta") OAuth2AuthorizedClient client) {
        model.addAttribute("username", oidcUser.getEmail());
        model.addAttribute("idToken", oidcUser.getIdToken());
        model.addAttribute("accessToken", client.getAccessToken());

        return "greeting";
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a greeting template <code>src/main/resources/templates/greeting.html</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html xmlns:th="https://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Greeting&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;p th:text="'Hello, ' + ${username} + '!'" /&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p th:text="'idToken: ' + ${idToken.tokenValue}" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p th:text="'accessToken: ' + ${accessToken.tokenValue}" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and add the following properties:</p>

   <code>spring:
  application:
    name: gateway
  cloud:
    gateway:
      discovery:
        locator:
          enabled: true
logging:
  level:
    org.springframework.cloud.gateway: DEBUG
    reactor.netty: DEBUG
</code>   

<p>Add <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/gateway/OktaOAuth2WebSecurity.java</code> to make the API Gateway a resource server with login enabled:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.reactive.EnableWebFluxSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.web.server.ServerHttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.server.SecurityWebFilterChain;

@Configuration
@EnableWebFluxSecurity
public class OktaOAuth2WebSecurity {

    @Bean
    public SecurityWebFilterChain securityWebFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
        http.csrf().disable()
                .authorizeExchange()
                .anyExchange()
                .authenticated()
                .and().oauth2Login()
                .and().oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
        return http.build();
    }
}
</code>   
<p>To keep things simple in this example, <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.0.x/reference/html/csrf.html">CSRF</a> is disabled.</p>

<p>Now we need to create an authorization client in Okta. Log in to your Okta Developer account (or <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">sign up</a> if you don’t have an account).</p>

 
   From the Applications page, choose Add Application. 
   On the Create New Application page, select Web. 
   Name your app Api Gateway, add <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> as a Login redirect URI, select Refresh Token (in addition to Authorization Code), and click Done. 
 

<p>Copy the issuer (found under API &gt; Authorization Servers), client ID, and client secret.</p>

<p>Start the gateway with:</p>
   <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuer} \
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID={yourOktaClientId} \
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET={yourOktaClientSecret} \
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080/greeting</code>. The gateway will redirect to Okta login page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>After the login, the idToken and accessToken will be displayed in the browser.</p>

   <code>idToken: eyJraWQiOiIw...

accessToken: eyJraWQiOi...
</code>   

 Pattern 2: Token Relay to Service 

<p>A Token Relay happens when an OAuth2 consumer, for example the API Gateway, acts as a Client and forwards the accessToken to the routed service.</p>

<p></p>

 Create a REST API Service 

<p>Let’s create a shopping cart service.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip -d dependencies=web,data-jpa,h2,cloud-eureka,okta,security,lombok \
-d groupId=com.okta.developer \
-d artifactId=cart-service  \
-d name="Cart Service" \
-d description="Demo cart microservice" \
-d packageName=com.okta.developer.cartservice \
-d javaVersion=11 \
-o cart-service.zip
</code>   
<p>Unzip the file:</p>

   <code>unzip cart-service.zip -d cart-service
cd cart-service
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>pom.xml</code> and add <a href="https://github.com/zalando/jackson-datatype-money">Jackson Datatype Money</a> dependency. For this tutorial, we will use <a href="https://javamoney.github.io/ri.html">JavaMoney</a> for currency.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.zalando&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-datatype-money&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Before creating the entities for the service, add a <code>MonetaryAmountConverter</code> for mapping the <code>MonetaryAmount</code> type to the database. The conversion to and from BigDecimal for persistence allows using the built-in Hibernate BigDecimal to JDBC numeric mapping.
Add <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/model/MonetaryAmountConverter.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.model;

import javax.money.CurrencyUnit;
import javax.money.Monetary;
import javax.money.MonetaryAmount;
import javax.persistence.AttributeConverter;
import java.math.BigDecimal;

public class MonetaryAmountConverter implements AttributeConverter&lt;MonetaryAmount, BigDecimal&gt; {

    private final CurrencyUnit USD = Monetary.getCurrency("USD");

    @Override
    public BigDecimal convertToDatabaseColumn(MonetaryAmount monetaryAmount) {
        if (monetaryAmount == null){
            return null;
        }
        return monetaryAmount.getNumber().numberValue(BigDecimal.class);
    }

    @Override
    public MonetaryAmount convertToEntityAttribute(BigDecimal bigDecimal) {
        if (bigDecimal == null){
            return null;
        }
        return Monetary.getDefaultAmountFactory()
                .setCurrency(USD)
                .setNumber(bigDecimal.doubleValue())
                .create();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the <code>Cart</code> and <code>LineItem</code> model classes under <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/model</code> package:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.model;


import lombok.Data;

import javax.money.MonetaryAmount;
import javax.persistence.*;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

@Entity
@Data
public class Cart {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy= GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Integer id;

    private String customerId;
    @Convert(converter=MonetaryAmountConverter.class)
    private MonetaryAmount total;

    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private List&lt;LineItem&gt; lineItems = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();


    public void addLineItem(LineItem lineItem) {
        this.lineItems.add(lineItem);
    }
}
</code>   

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.model;

import lombok.Data;

import javax.money.MonetaryAmount;
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
@Data
public class LineItem {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy= GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Integer id;

    private String productName;

    private Integer quantity;

    @Convert(converter=MonetaryAmountConverter.class)
    private MonetaryAmount price;
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>CartRepository</code> under <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/repository/CartRepository.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.repository;

import com.okta.developer.cartservice.model.Cart;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;

public interface CartRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Cart, Integer&gt; {
}
</code>   

<p>Create the <code>CartNotFoundException</code> under <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/controller/CartNotFoundException.java</code> for mapping the API 404 in the <code>CartController</code> we will create after:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.controller;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseStatus;

@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
public class CartNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {

    public CartNotFoundException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>CartController</code> under <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/controller/CartController.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.controller;

import com.okta.developer.cartservice.model.Cart;
import com.okta.developer.cartservice.repository.CartRepository;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
public class CartController {

    @Autowired
    private CartRepository repository;

    @GetMapping("/cart/{id}")
    public Cart getCart(@PathVariable Integer id){
        return repository.findById(id).orElseThrow(() -&gt; new CartNotFoundException("Cart not found:" + id));
    }

    @PostMapping("/cart")
    public Cart saveCart(@RequestBody  Cart cart){

        Cart saved = repository.save(cart);
        return saved;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Configure the Jackson Money Datatype module. Add a <code>WebConfig</code> class under <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.WebMvcConfigurer;
import org.zalando.jackson.datatype.money.MoneyModule;

@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Bean
    public MoneyModule moneyModule(){
        return new MoneyModule().withDefaultFormatting();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>CartServiceApplication</code> and add <code>@EnableEurekaClient</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.EnableEurekaClient;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
public class CartServiceApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CartServiceApplication.class, args);
    }

}
</code>   
<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.propeties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and add the following values:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8081

spring:
  application:
    name: cart

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: {yourOktaIssuer}
    audience: api://default
</code>   

<p>Start the <code>cart-service</code>:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

 Route the REST API Through Spring Cloud Gateway 

<p>Go to the <code>api-gateway</code> project and add a route for the cart service, edit <code>SpringCloudGatewayApplication</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteLocator;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.builder.RouteLocatorBuilder;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.EnableEurekaClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.security.oauth2.gateway.TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
public class SpringCloudGatewayApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringCloudGatewayApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public RouteLocator routeLocator(RouteLocatorBuilder builder, TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory filterFactory) {
        return builder.routes()
                .route("cart", r -&gt; r.path("/cart/**")
                        .filters(f -&gt; f.filter(filterFactory.apply()))
                        .uri("lb://cart"))
                .build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p><code>TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory</code> will find the accessToken from the registered OAuth2 client and include it in the outbound cart request.</p>

<p>Restart the gateway with:</p>
   <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuer} \
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID={clientId} \
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET={clientSecret} \
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080/greeting</code> and copy the accessToken. Then use the accessToken to make requests to the cart API through the gateway.</p>

   <code>export ACCESS_TOKEN={accessToken}

# Add an item to the cart
curl \
  -d '{"customerId": "uijoon@example.com", "lineItems": [{ "productName": "jeans", "quantity": 1}]}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  http://localhost:8080/cart

# Return the contents of the cart
curl \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  http://localhost:8080/cart/1
</code>   

 Pattern 3: Service-to-Service Client Credentials Grant 

<p>In this authorization pattern, the application requests an access token using only its own client credentials. This flow is suitable for machine-to-machine (M2M) or service-to-service authorizations.</p>

<p></p>

 Create a Micro Service 

<p>For service-to-service authorization, create a <code>pricing</code> Spring Boot service with Spring Initializr:</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip -d dependencies=web,cloud-eureka,okta,security,lombok \
-d groupId=com.okta.developer \
-d artifactId=pricing-service  \
-d name="Pricing Service" \
-d description="Demo pricing microservice" \
-d packageName=com.okta.developer.pricing \
-d javaVersion=11 \
-o pricing-service.zip
</code>   
<p>Unzip the file:</p>

   <code>unzip pricing-service.zip -d pricing-service
cd pricing-service
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>pom.xml</code> and add Jackson Datatype Money dependency again.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.zalando&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-datatype-money&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Create the <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/model/Cart.java</code> and <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/model/LineItem.java</code> model classes:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing.model;

import lombok.Data;
import javax.money.MonetaryAmount;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

@Data
public class Cart {

    private Integer id;
    private String customerId;
    private List&lt;LineItem&gt; lineItems = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    private MonetaryAmount total;

    public void addLineItem(LineItem lineItem){
        this.lineItems.add(lineItem);
    }
}
</code>   

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing.model;

import lombok.Data;
import javax.money.MonetaryAmount;

@Data
public class LineItem {

    private Integer id;
    private Integer quantity;
    private MonetaryAmount price;
    private String productName;

    public LineItem(){
    }

    public LineItem(Integer id, Integer quantity) {
        this.id = id;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/service/PricingService.java</code> interface and a <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/service/DefaultPricingService</code> implementation to calculate prices for the <code>LineItem</code>.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing.service;

import com.okta.developer.pricing.model.Cart;

public interface PricingService {

    Cart price(Cart cart);
}
</code>   

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing.service;

import com.okta.developer.pricing.model.Cart;
import com.okta.developer.pricing.model.LineItem;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import javax.money.CurrencyUnit;
import javax.money.Monetary;
import javax.money.MonetaryAmount;
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.math.RoundingMode;

@Service
public class DefaultPricingService implements PricingService {

    private final CurrencyUnit USD = Monetary.getCurrency("USD");

    @Override
    public Cart price(Cart cart) {

        MonetaryAmount total = Monetary.getDefaultAmountFactory()
                .setCurrency(USD)
                .setNumber(0)
                .create();

        for (LineItem li : cart.getLineItems()) {
            BigDecimal bigDecimal = new BigDecimal(Math.random() * 100)
                    .setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);

            MonetaryAmount amount = Monetary.getDefaultAmountFactory()
                    .setCurrency(USD)
                    .setNumber(bigDecimal)
                    .create();
            li.setPrice(amount);
            total = total.add(amount.multiply(li.getQuantity()));
        }

        cart.setTotal(total);
        return cart;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>PricingController</code> to handle the pricing request. Add the class  <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/controller/PricingController.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing.controller;

import com.okta.developer.pricing.model.Cart;

    @PostMapping("/pricing/price")
    public Cart price(@RequestBody Cart cart){

        Cart priced = pricingService.price(cart);
        return priced;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Configure the Jackson Money Module in a <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/WebConfig.java</code> class:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Bean
    public MoneyModule moneyModule(){
        return new MoneyModule().withDefaultFormatting();
    }
}
</code>   

 Secure the Micro Service using OAuth 2.0 Scopes 

<p>Protect the pricing endpoint by requiring a custom scope <code>pricing</code> in the accessToken. One way to do it is with <code>HttpSecurity</code> configuration. Add a <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/WebSecurity.java</code> class with the following:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing;

import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configurers.oauth2.server.resource.OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurity extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .authorizeRequests(authorizeRequests -&gt; authorizeRequests
                        .mvcMatchers("/pricing/**").hasAuthority("SCOPE_pricing")
                        .anyRequest().authenticated()
                )
                .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt);
    }
}

</code>   

<p>Add <code>@EnableEurekaClient</code> to <code>PricingServiceApplication</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.EnableEurekaClient;

@SpringBootApplication

public class PricingServiceApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(PricingServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and add the following:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8082

spring:
  application:
    name: pricing

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: {yourOktaIssuer}
    audience: api://default
</code>   

<p>Start the service:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Let’s try the pricing API without an accessToken:</p>

   <code>curl -v\
  -d '{"customerId": "uijoon@mail.com", "lineItems": [{ "productName": "jeans", "quantity": 1}]}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  http://localhost:8082/pricing/price
</code>   
<p>With the <code>-v</code> verbose flag, you should see the request is rejected with 401 (Unauthorized).</p>

 Update the REST API to Call the Micro Service 

<p>Now we are going to configure <code>cart-service</code> to use the client credentials grant flow to request pricing.</p>

<p>First create a new authorization client in Okta.</p>

 
   From the Applications page, choose Add Application 
   On the Create New Application page, select Service 
   Name your app Cart Service and click Done 
 

<p>Copy the new client ID, and client secret.</p>

<p>Create a custom scope to restrict what the <code>cart-service</code> accessToken can access. From the menu bar select API -&gt; Authorization Servers. Edit the authorization server by clicking on the edit pencil, then click Scopes -&gt; Add Scope. Fill out the name field with <code>pricing</code> and press Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We need to configure the OAuth2 client in the <code>cart-service</code> application, for calling the <code>pricing-service</code>. <code>OAuth2RestTemplate</code> is not available in Spring Security 5.3.x. According to Spring Security OAuth <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/wiki/OAuth-2.0-Migration-Guide">migration guides</a>, the way to do this is by using RestTemplate interceptors or WebClient exchange filter functions. Since Spring 5, <code>RestTemplate</code> is in <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.7.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html">maintenance mode</a>, using WebClient (which supports sync, async, and streaming scenarios) is the suggested approach. So let’s configure a <code>WebClient</code> for the pricing call.</p>

<p>First, add the <code>spring-webflux</code> starter dependency to the <code>cart-service</code> <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-webflux&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>IMPORTANT: Adding both <code>spring-boot-starter-web</code> and <code>spring-boot-starter-webflux</code> modules results in Spring Boot auto-configuring Spring MVC, not WebFlux. This allows Spring MVC applications to use the reactive WebClient.</p>

<p>Create <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/WebClientConfig.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.loadbalancer.reactive.ReactorLoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.http.codec.json.Jackson2JsonDecoder;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.registration.ClientRegistrationRepository;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.web.OAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.web.reactive.function.client.ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.ExchangeStrategies;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;

@Configuration
public class WebClientConfig {

    @Autowired
    private ReactorLoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction lbFunction;

    @Autowired
    private ObjectMapper objectMapper;

    @Bean
    public WebClient webClient(ClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrations,
                               OAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository auth2AuthorizedClients){

        ExchangeStrategies exchangeStrategies = ExchangeStrategies.builder()
                .codecs(configurer -&gt;
                        configurer.defaultCodecs().jackson2JsonDecoder(new Jackson2JsonDecoder(objectMapper)))
                .build();

        ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction oauth2 =
                new ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction(clientRegistrations, auth2AuthorizedClients);

        oauth2.setDefaultClientRegistrationId("pricing-client");

        return WebClient.builder().apply(oauth2.oauth2Configuration())
                .exchangeStrategies(exchangeStrategies)
                .filter(lbFunction).baseUrl("http://pricing/pricing/price").build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the code above, we set a custom json decoder, from the <code>objectMapper</code> that includes the <code>MoneyModule</code>, so the monetary amounts are correctly serialized and deserialized. Also, we set  <code>pricing-client</code> as the default OAuth 2.0 <code>registrationId</code>. For service discovery, a <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-commons/reference/html/#webflux-with-reactive-loadbalancer"><code>ReactorLoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction</code></a> must be added to the <code>WebClient</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s now configure the OAuth 2.0 client registration. Edit the cart-service <code>application.yml</code> and add security.oauth2 properties. The <code>cart-service</code> is a resource server and an OAuth 2.0 client at the same time. The final configuration must be:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8081

spring:
  application:
    name: cart
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: {yourOktaIssuer}
      client:
        registration:
          pricing-client:
            provider: okta
            authorization-grant-type: client_credentials
            scope: pricing
            client-id: {clientId}
            client-secret: {clientSecret}
        provider:
          okta:
            issuer-uri: {yourOktaIssuer}
  cloud:
    loadbalancer:
      ribbon:
        enabled: false

logging:
  level:
    com.okta.developer: DEBUG
    org.springframework.web: DEBUG

</code>   
<p>Note the <code>Ribbon</code> loadbalancer has been disabled, otherwise the <code>ReactorLoadBalancer</code> auto-configuration will fail.</p>

<p>Also, note the requested scope for the client_credentials grant is <code>pricing</code>, the custom scope. Then, the accessTokens for this client will only have access to the <code>pricing-service</code>. Adding a custom scope for the client_credentials flow is a best practice.</p>

<p>Spring Boot will auto-configure the application as an OAuth2 client because of the <code>client.registration</code> presence in the YAML. Add a <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/WebSecurity.java</code> class to override the auto-configuration, and configure the application as an OAuth 2.0 resource server:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configurers.oauth2.server.resource.OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer;

@Configuration
public class WebSecurity extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .authorizeRequests(authorize -&gt; authorize
                        .anyRequest().authenticated()
                )
                .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the class <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/service/PricingException.java</code> to return <code>HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR</code> (HTTP status 500) when the cart cannot be priced due to an unexpected error.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.service;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseStatus;

@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
public class PricingException extends RuntimeException {

    public PricingException(Exception e) {
        super(e);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a PricingService for the pricing implementation. Create the class <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/service/PricingService.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.service;

import com.okta.developer.cartservice.model.Cart;
import com.okta.developer.cartservice.model.LineItem;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@Service
public class PricingService {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(PricingService.class);

    @Autowired
    private WebClient webClient;

    public Cart price(Cart cart){
        try {

            Mono&lt;Cart&gt; response = webClient
                    .post()
                    .bodyValue(cart)
                    .retrieve().bodyToMono(Cart.class);

            Cart priced = response.block();

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; priced.getLineItems().size(); i++) {
                LineItem pricedLineItem = priced.getLineItems().get(i);
                LineItem lineItem = cart.getLineItems().get(i);
                lineItem.setPrice(pricedLineItem.getPrice());
            }

            cart.setTotal(priced.getTotal());


            return cart;
        } catch (Exception e){
            logger.error("Could not price cart:", e);
            throw new PricingException(e);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Note that the ‘WebClient’ is making a synchronous call, as we invoke <code>response.block()</code> to get the pricing result. This is the expected approach for non-reactive applications.</p>

<p>Modify the <code>CartController</code> to request pricing when creating a cart:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.controller;

import com.okta.developer.cartservice.model.Cart;
import com.okta.developer.cartservice.repository.CartRepository;
import com.okta.developer.cartservice.service.PricingService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
public class CartController {

    @Autowired
    private CartRepository repository;

    @Autowired
    private PricingService pricingService;


    @GetMapping("/cart/{id}")
    public Cart getCart(@PathVariable Integer id){
        return repository.findById(id).orElseThrow(() -&gt; new CartNotFoundException("Cart not found:" + id));
    }

    @PostMapping("/cart")
    public Cart saveCart(@RequestBody  Cart cart){

        Cart priced = pricingService.price(cart);
        Cart saved = repository.save(priced);
        return saved;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Restart the cart-service:</p>

   <code>SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_PRICINGCLIENT_CLIENTID={serviceClientId} \
SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_PRICINGCLIENT_CLIENTSECRET={serviceClientSecret} \
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

 Putting it All Together 

<p>Create a cart through the API Gateway again, make sure to have a valid accessToken from <code>http://localhost:8080/greeting</code>:</p>

   <code>export ACCESS_TOKEN={accessToken}

curl -v\
  -d '{"customerId": "uijoon@mail.com", "lineItems": [{ "productName": "jeans", "quantity": 1}]}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  http://localhost:8080/cart
</code>   

<p>You should get a priced cart as response:</p>

   <code>{
   "id":1,
   "customerId":"uijoon@example.com",
   "total":{
      "amount":86.20,
      "currency":"USD",
      "formatted":"USD86.20"
   },
   "lineItems":[
      {
         "id":2,
         "productName":"jeans",
         "quantity":1,
         "price":{
            "amount":86.20,
            "currency":"USD",
            "formatted":"USD86.20"
         }
      }
   ]
}
</code>   

<p>Take a look at the System Log in the Okta Dashboard and you will see an entry indicating the Cart Service requested an access token:</p>

 The merits of Rust for SSI and IAM software 



<p>Security is a top priority for network infrastructure, software solutions, and end-user applications that support interactions involving sensitive user data or personal information about real people and organizations.</p>



<p>Decentralized or not, any system which handles, transports, stores, or serves high value (digital) assets —&nbsp;especially solutions for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and Identity and Access Management (IAM) — warrants rigorous scrutiny toward any vulnerability or oversight that may infringe on a user’s rights as a data subject.</p>



<p>That’s where <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> really shines: the programming language is distinctive for its comprehensive focus on safety, security, correctness, and efficiency. All of these areas resonate extremely well with the dimensions and properties most important when developing digital identity solutions.</p>



<p>What’s more, the design of the language itself offers crucial advantages for security by effectively addressing a wide range of common, long-standing vulnerabilities affecting code written in other popular languages. To top it off, Rust provides markedly high performance, and opens up possibilities for embedded use cases.</p>



<p>It’s a promising sign, then, to see folks familiar with blockchain and other DLT technologies are showing embrace of Rust in their development work. Already at this early stage of adoption there is a sizeable array of tools and applications written in Rust that could well be implemented in IAM solutions based on SSI. This toolset nicely complements the core set of design-driven advantages for development previously mentioned.</p>



<p>Rust’s security guarantees are proving to be particularly desirable for the implementation of highly secure systems, like those used to manage user identities, access rights, and digital assets. Since SSI infrastructure must be capable of handling complex flows of value, the underlying technical infrastructure must be designed to sustain and secure that value. The distinctive features of Rust are particularly advantageous for these reasons.</p>



 Developing for SSI in Rust 



<p>As the SSI ecosystem is still maturing, only a limited number of production-ready solutions enjoy active deployment in real use cases, and even fewer are implemented in Rust.</p>



<p>That said, here are a couple ways we use Rust at Jolocom:</p>



  Certain core components of <a href="https://github.com/jolocom/wallet-rs">our open source library for SSI-based digital identity management</a> are implemented in Rust (available on GitHub). In particular, we migrated all plaintext private-key operations (e.g. signing, decryption) into Rust code in order to minimize risk posed by malicious dependency attacks in JS runtimes, as well as to provide a safe, portable, consistent, and well-understood set of crypto tools with an easy-to-use API.  



  A Rust implementation of the “KERI” Core Library — KERIOX — is well underway. <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI (“Key Event Receipt Infrastructure”)</a> is an event-based Distributed Key Management Infrastructure which provides the same security and verifiability properties for transactions as a blockchain or distributed ledger, without the overhead of requiring an absolute global ordering of transactions. The system is designed to provide a secure identifier-based “trust spanning layer” for any stack. The open source project is under active development in collaboration with <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF — the Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, where we’ve been a member-organization <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/self-sovereign-identity-the-next-generation-of-digital-life/">since early 2018</a>.   



<p>With such tremendous potential in cross-industry collaboration, we want to help catalyze and coordinate any opportunities for mutual enrichment and growth by building up the common ground shared by Rust and SSI communities.</p>



<p>In fact, we are actively seeking an experienced software engineer with knowledge in Rust —&nbsp;here’s <a href="https://jolocom.io/hiring-rust-software-engineer/">more on the open position</a> in case you or someone you know may be interested in joining the Jolocom team!</p>



  



<p>As a 12-person, purpose-driven organization stewarding an open source project to create a common infrastructure for digital identity and rehash our society’s relationship to personal data — we at Jolocom definitely place an emphasis on community engagement as a core value. For that reason we are always looking for ways to contribute back to the people and communities which help make a positive impact on and off the Web.</p>



 That is why for this year’s <a href="https://rustconf.com">RustConf</a>, Jolocom is supporting the conference as an official sponsor! 



<p>We can’t wait to meet more of the community and explore the intersection of Rust and SSI alongside dedicated stakeholders, veterans, and enthusiasts.</p>



<p>Hope to see you on Thursday (Aug. 20) for the virtual conference.</p>



<p>Want to connect, but unable to attend next week? We’re always available to chat on <a href="https://gitter.im/jolocom/home">Gitter</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity security is driving exceptional customer experiences 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day when you enter your username and password into your favorite website, you’re generating data. The average customer generates an eye-watering volume of data over the course of their digital day. When someone registers for a new website or app and creates a user profile, they’re creating a new dataset that can be analyzed by a new firm. When that phenomenon multiplies across cities, countries, and continents, the amount of information being created by customers across the globe is downright staggering. But managing that data properly and adhering to regional, national, and international guidelines can be a difficult task for even the most seasoned executive. It’s an organizational risk that more companies are coming to terms with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But all that data is also an opportunity, one that allows companies to personalize their products and services and give their customers and clients incredible, engaging experiences—such as the ability to login without using a password. Personalization is key to success, but it has to happen in a way that makes data security simultaneously integral and invisible.</p>

   The Traditional Identity Journey 

<p>Over the past decade, organizations have gone through many different stages of the identity journey. Depending on the size and maturity of your organization, you are probably in one of six identity maturity categories (see diagram below). Your progress through the stages of maturity may be stalled—but not necessarily because of limited resources or for lack of trying. Your lack of progress is likely due to the limitations of your existing identity governance solution.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why? These legacy solutions fail to deliver on your <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a> requirements. Large enterprises need a model that provides visibility into who has access into what and why, eliminating manual access requests, approvals and certification rubberstamping. And, the identity model should grow dynamically as your organization changes over time.&nbsp;</p>

 Why Legacy Identity Governance Solutions are Destined to Fail&nbsp; 

<p>Legacy identity governance and administration (IGA) solutions are failing organizations today for&nbsp;several reasons:&nbsp;</p>

  Identity silos: Many IGA solutions are only integrated with a few authoritative identity sources, like Microsoft Active Directory, or your company's HR system, like Workday. The limited integrations result in poor user access visibility and a lack of consistent access visibility across the entire enterprise. As a result, you have many islands of identity sprinkled across your organization. 
	 Operational inefficiencies: IGA solutions are meant to automate access requests, approvals and certification reviews. The reality is quite different. Instead, your teams are so overwhelmed with access requests, approvals and certification reviews that they end up manually approving access requests and rubber-stamping certifications. This results in the overprovisioning of user access privileges across your entire enterprise.&nbsp; 
	 No context: While IGA solutions are good at providing visibility into a single authoritative source, they don’t provide visibility and context across multiple authoritative sources. As a result, organizations struggle to determine what users need access to, what access they have, and why that access is needed. Without universal visibility and context across the entire enterprise, your organization is blind to inappropriate user access privileges and potential unauthorized user access.&nbsp; 
	 Static data: IGA solutions provide tools—like role modeling—to help organizations achieve better operational efficiencies and compliance. While role modeling helps to better align users with the right access rights, the organizational role model rapidly becomes stale and outdated. Your organization changes dynamically every hour, every day, every week, and every month. With outdated access rights, privileges, roles and entitlements of an IGA solution, your organization is more open to security risks and potential data breaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 <p>These are the reasons why IT and Security teams are experiencing identity governance fatigue. They are exhausted from manually reviewing and approving access requests and rubber-stamping certifications.&nbsp;</p>

 Don’t Run Your Business with a Crystal Ball 

<p>Is this how you want to run your business? With a crystal ball that provides predictions based on limited data. Of course not! That is why you implemented an IGA solution.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Your existing IGA solution has provided you with an initial set of capabilities to manage and control the entire identity lifecycle. From a user’s birthright access to the removal of their access when they leave the organization. The point here is, access requests, access approvals, certifications and role modeling capabilities have gotten you to where you are today. You have made progress in managing and controlling user’s access. That’s the good news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bad news is legacy IGA solutions have created a new set of barriers to your organization’s growth and future success. Existing IGA solutions have stalled your progress because they have not addressed the core problem: “How do I develop a model to solve my access problem?”&nbsp; Until that question is addressed with a solution that meets today’s challenges and acknowledges the dynamic nature of your organization, you’ll continue to be in a “holding pattern” when it comes to managing and controlling user access across the entire enterprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Grow the Business with AI-Driven Identity Analytics&nbsp; 

<p>How do you evolve past the holding pattern?&nbsp; The answer is artificial intelligence (AI)-driven identity analytics, which address legacy IGA solution gaps.</p>

<p>Using AI and machine learning techniques to consume and analyze large data volumes, AI-driven identity analytics can detect user access patterns and inappropriate access privileges across the entire enterprise. By automating high-confidence and low-risk user access rights, your security and risk teams will have more time and resources to focus on higher priority tasks and projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In my next blog, I’ll explain how organizations can overcome identity governance fatigue with ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Autonomous Identity</a>. Be sure to watch the “<a href="https://go.forgerock.com/eliminate-risk-and-cut-cost-with-ai-driven-identity-analytics-reg.html">Identity Redefined: Eliminate Risks and Cut Costs with AI-Powered Identity Analytics</a>” webinar with ForgeRock and Accenture to learn more. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>In their race towards digital transformation, organizations are using cloud services to accelerate the development of new apps and improve efficiency. They allow new applications to be rapidly developed, existing applications to be modernized and deployed without additional capital spend. This provides important business benefits but also increases the challenges for the cloud customer to ensure cyber-security and regulatory compliance. It is in this light that the recent announcements from GCP (Google Cloud Platform) need to be understood.</p>
 
 Trust but Verify 
 
<p>Initially, cloud service users were concerned that they had no control over the way in which the services themselves were managed and secured. The major CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) now go to great lengths to secure the infrastructure of their environments and it has become clear that many of the cloud security challenges lie with the customers’ own use of these services. For example, security and compliance are often outside the skills of DevOps teams or are overlooked and this can lead to the existence of critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber adversaries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An additional concern is the risk of government interference in the operation of the service or demands for access to the data it holds. This concern was recently rekindled with the EU <a href="https://noyb.eu/files/CJEU/judgment.pdf">Court of Justice Ruling</a> on the EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>The onus is on the CSP to gain customers' trust in all of these areas.</p>
<p>GCP publish an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-clouds-semi-annual-transparency-report-now-available">Enterprise Data Transparency Report</a> that identifies the number of government requests received for Google Cloud Platform and G Suite Enterprise Cloud customer. This report claims that a very small percentage of requests were for enterprise data and that Google did not produce any GCP Enterprise Cloud customer data in response to government requests.</p>
<p>The customer always needs to verify the claims of the CSP. SLAs provide some reassurance but usually with limited recourse if they are missed. Contracts are usually written by the CSP and are not negotiable. Independent certification of compliance is useful to provide a snapshot in time. The best verification is proof that the service was designed, implemented, and is run with security and compliance built-in.</p>
 
 Securing Data and Access 
 
<p>When an organization uses a cloud service the responsibility for security and compliance is shared (see graphic). It is always up to the customer to classify the data that they hold in the service and to control access to this data according to the risks and their compliance obligations. The CSP must secure the infrastructure and should provide the capabilities for the customer to assess and control their use of the service.</p>
<p>One critical control for this is data encryption – however, customers need to consider which form of encryption is appropriate for their risks. For example, while data may be encrypted during transit on the network and at rest in the database and - this will protect against interception and media loss, but it does not protect against application-level attacks such as SQL Injection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GCP already provides the customer with the capabilities to encrypt their data and to manage their own encryption keys. This includes a cloud-hosted key management service that lets the customer manage their cryptographic keys for their cloud services the same way as on-premises. It also provides HSM as a service to provide hardware protection of the keys. Additionally, in beta is Key Access Justifications a capability that gives the customer visibility into every request for an encryption key, a justification for that request, and a mechanism to approve or deny decryption in the context of that request.</p>
 
 Confidential Computing 
 
<p>While data is being processed in the customer’s applications it needs to be decrypted. This creates a small but important risk to confidentiality through RAM scraping attacks for example. Intel SGX technology already enables applications to be written to process data within protected enclaves.&nbsp; However, this typically requires development changes to the application. GCP&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing">Confidential Computing</a>&nbsp;(in beta) is a technology that encrypts data in-use while it is being processed. Confidential Computing environments keep data encrypted in memory and elsewhere outside the central processing unit (CPU). Google claims that this can be implemented at a VM level without any need for code changes at the click of a button.</p>
 
 Assured Workloads for Government 
 
<p>Normally CSPs offer cloud services tailored to the specific compliance requirements of governments. Often, these are hosted in dedicated data centres and managed by government accredited staff to ensure compliance. However, this slows the deployment of new features and does not scale to support other highly regulated industries such as finance. In response to this GCP has announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/assured-workloads-for-government-compliance-without-compromise">Assured Workloads for Government</a>. Google claim that this will allow them to support US Government workloads to IL4 within their normal infrastructure by:</p>
 
 Automatic enforcement of data location: to meet U.S. government compliance requirements by choosing to store data at rest in U.S. regions. 
 Personnel access: to limit Google support personnel access based on predefined attributes such as citizenship, a particular geographical access location, and background checks. 
 Built-in security controls: to reduce the risk of accidental misconfigurations by choosing from available platform security configurations. 
 Automatic enforcement of product deployment location based on organizational policy. 
 
 
 Certificate Authority Service 
 
<p>Digital certificates underpin identity and authentication for many networked devices and services. This is not new technology but is becoming more important as a mechanism to securely identify IoT devices. However, it is difficult to set up a CA (Certificate Authority) and manage digital certificates at the scale required where there may be many millions of devices. Google has announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-cas-a-cloud-based-managed-ca-for-the-devops-and-iot-world">Certificate Authority Service</a>. This is in beta and will provide a scalable and available service that simplifies and automates the management and deployment of private CAs.</p>
 
 My Opinion 
 
<p>These announcements from GCP underpin the view that organizations are increasingly using cloud services for their business-critical applications as part of their digital transformation journey. This is leading to more scrutiny of the ways in which these services can help the organization to support their own specific security and compliance obligations. The customer still needs to map these controls back to their obligations and to ensure that the controls are effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While none of the announcements from GCP are for offerings that are completely unique they do provide useful differentiation that may sway some customers to choose GCP. However, most organizations will have a hybrid IT deployment model involving multiple CSPs as well as on services delivered on-premises and this will remain a significant challenge for the foreseeable future.</p>

 Crypto Stablecoin Report 13: The market capitalization of stablecoins reached $14.387 billion, Stablecoin pool&nbsp;Reserve <p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1559677956">https://bihu.com/article/1559677956</a></p><p>Original publish time: August 11,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   At present, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has reached $14.387 billion, an increase of $980 million compared with last&nbsp;week.  Last week, USDT was additionally issued 6 times and the circulation increased by 930 million. Among them, four additional issuances occurred on Ethereum, totaling 480 million USDT and two additional issuances occurred on Tron, totaling 450 million USDT. The circulation of USDT has grown&nbsp;rapidly.  The circulation of USDC increased by 23.99 million to 1.107&nbsp;billion.  The circulation of DAI increased by 7.57% compared with a week ago, a decrease in growth&nbsp;rate.  Reserve is a flexible stablecoin pool that reduces the risk of stablecoins through asset diversity and decentralized governance.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past week(August 1, 2020, ~ August 7, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has reached $14.387 billion, an increase of $980 million compared with last&nbsp;week.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Last week, USDT was additionally issued 6 times and the circulation increased by 930 million. Among them, four additional issuances occurred on Ethereum, totaling 480 million USDT and two additional issuances occurred on Tron, totaling 450 million USDT. The circulation of USDC, PAX, BUSD, HUSD, DAI, and GUSD increased by 23.99 million, 8.09 million, 6.31 million, 3.91 million, 8.99 million, and 840,000. The circulation of TUSD decreased by 2.39 million.<br>The circulation of DAI increased by 7.57% compared with a week ago, a decrease in growth&nbsp;rate.</p> The Number of Holding Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last week, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all increased and increased by&nbsp;52,792.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of USDT, USDC, PAX, TUSD, and DAI increased by 38,624, 7,331, 269, 885, and&nbsp;5,683.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last week increased by an average of 9.65% compared to the previous&nbsp;week.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of&nbsp;13%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last week decreased an average of 2.2%. On July 27 of the previous week, the transfer amount of USDT on Ethereum was unusually high.</p> 2. Reserve&nbsp;Protocol <p>Among the digital assets that Coinbase recently listed as possible to launch, Reserve Rights in the stablecoin project is included. Reserve Rights Token (RSR) is a token used to promote the stability of the Reserve Token (RSV) in the Reserve Protocol. At present, the application of stablecoin RSV is still relatively few. We will introduce the Reserve Protocol in this&nbsp;report.</p><p>Reserve is a flexible stablecoin pool that reduces the risk of stablecoins through asset diversity and decentralized governance. The collateral assets of Reserve include USDC, PAX, TUSD, etc. Under normal circumstances, the price of RSV will be automatically adjusted by the open market to around $1. When demand falls, for example, the price of RSV on the open market is $0.98 and the redemption price is $1, arbitrageurs will be incentivized to purchase RSV on the secondary market and redeem $1 worth of reserves, pushing up the price of RSV. When demand rises, if the price of RSV is $1.02, arbitrageurs will be incentivized to pledge $1 worth of assets to mint RSV and sell them in the market, reducing the price of&nbsp;RSV.</p><p>Although Reserve chooses a portfolio with less downside risk, the value of collateral tokens may still fall. When this happens, the Reserve Protocol will sell the newly minted RSR tokens to supplement the collateral assets.</p><p>In extreme cases, if the collateral assets depreciate and no market participant is willing to purchase the newly minted RSR at the lowest auction price of the RSR, the collateral assets of the RSV may theoretically be less than 100%. In this case, the Reserve Protocol will enlarge the price range set to protect RSV. Under normal circumstances, the RSV range is close to $1. In the event of a crisis, such as a 5% depreciation of collateral tokens, the price range of RSV may be adjusted to $0.95-$1.05. This means that in the short term, the redemption of RSV can only get $0.95 worth of collateral assets, while newly minted RSV requires $1.05 worth of collateral assets. In this way, runs can be prevented, and the last person to redeem the collateral assets gets the same ratio as the first person to&nbsp;redeem.</p><p>At present, there are few RSV holders, and the Reserve is not widely used, with holders able to purchase Amazon gift cards through the Reserve App. As the variety of collateral assets increases, the stability of RSV will be enhanced and applications will likely increase.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

  <p>Fakes are everywhere. From olive oil to pharmaceuticals, to seafood, sneakers and even digital content, criminals make big money by tricking consumers into buying their counterfeit goods. In fact it’s estimated that over 60% of olive oil is fake, and, in some places, there’s an 87% chance that red snapper is actually a cheaper fish, like perch or tilapia.</p>
<p>For some companies the costs of combating mislabeling and fakes outweigh the risks, and others actually benefit from the fake creation. For example, many social media platforms realize it’s not worth spending money ferreting out disinformation when that type of sensational content is so effective at increasing engagement and therefore advertising revenue.</p>
<p>“As a consumer, you really do need to be skeptical of everything that you're consuming and looking at,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-blockchain/">Avivah Litan</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.<br>
</p>
<p>According to a report prepared for the <a href="https://iccwbo.org/">International Chamber of Commerce</a>, counterfeit and other piracy will grow to 2.81 trillion dollars by 2022.</p>
<p>In times of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-disruptions-you-might-not-see-coming/">disruption</a>, shortages and uncertainty, like a global pandemic or a divisive election season, counterfeiters become more active preying on people who have dropped their guard. It’s exactly these environments of desperation and distraction that cause people to become victims of counterfeits.</p>
<p>Here are three tools to spot and stop counterfeits. Gartner recommends that consumers look for at least one that has been used to verify that a product is what it says it is. But for organizations that must ensure products are 100% genuine, it’s best to rely on all three.</p>
 
 Human verification. This includes on-site auditing by regulators who conduct actual physical inspections, sampling and testing to deliver certificates of verification. In the digital space it may also include crowdsourced ratings of reputation, such as seller reviews online. 
 Algorithmic verification. Machine learning and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">AI models</a> are trained to analyze and recognize attributes, components and ingredients of the genuine article to provide verification. 
 Digital verification. Deployed for certification at the origin of a product or piece of content, these tools allow for quality control with digital techniques such as DNA analysis or spectral imaging to capture and record the original as a digital object. Then <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-blockchain/">blockchain</a> and digital tokenization enable tracking of this immutable object from origin to end user to provide certainty that nothing has been changed. 
 
<p>Because each tool by itself is not perfect, all three layered together provide the greatest verification. But the cost increases with each tool, so deciding which to use and when requires carefully weighing risks and benefits against cost. Whatever the level of need to assess the truth, these tools will help you spot fakes and protect yourself and your business from counterfeits.</p>

  <p>Organizations that hesitate to commit to a total migration to the public cloud model use a combination — or hybrid — of private-cloud-inspired and public cloud styles of computing. That is why, over the past three years, Gartner client requests to discuss hybrid cloud have grown 15%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Cloud computing promises that customers will gain advantages from several key propositions, for example by shifting the responsibility and work of running hardware and software infrastructure to cloud providers, leveraging the economics of cloud elasticity, benefiting from the pace of innovation in sync with public cloud providers, and more,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/6992/David-Smith">David Smith</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next generation of cloud computing, retains the advantages of cloud computing while extending the range and use cases for cloud</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, hybrid cloud breaks these very value propositions: One part of a hybrid cloud is architected, owned, controlled and operated by the customer and the other by the public cloud provider. The customer retains responsibility for their part of the operation but cannot leverage the capabilities (such as the skills, innovation pace, investments and techniques) of the public cloud provider.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>Newer generations of packaged hybrid cloud offerings can help reduce the impact of these shortcomings. Distributed cloud, the next generation of cloud computing, retains the advantages of cloud computing while extending the range and use cases for cloud. CIOs can use distributed cloud models to target location-dependent cloud use cases that will be required in the future.</p>

 What is distributed cloud? 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/distributed-cloud">Distributed cloud computing</a> is the first cloud model that incorporates physical location of cloud-delivered services as part of its definition. Historically, location has not been relevant to cloud computing definitions. In fact, location has been explicitly abstracted away from the service, which inspired the term “cloud computing” in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Distributed cloud has three origins: Public cloud, hybrid cloud and edge computing. Public cloud providers have supported multiple zones and regions for many years. With packaged hybrid offerings, public cloud services (often including necessary hardware and software) can now be distributed to different physical locations, for instance, the edge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 2024, most cloud service platforms will provide at least some distributed cloud services that execute at the point of need</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, ownership, operation, governance, updates and evolution of the services remain the responsibility of the originating public cloud provider. This is a significant shift from the virtually centralized model of most public cloud services and the model associated with the general cloud concept. It will lead to a new era in cloud computing.</p>
<p>Some might ask if distributed cloud is simply a case of edge computing, and the answer is both yes and no. All instances of distributed cloud are also instances of edge computing. But not all instances of edge computing are distributed cloud. This is because many uses of edge involve a public cloud provider that manages the evolution and ongoing control of the resulting environment.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-top-10-cloud-myths/">Top 10 Cloud Myths</a></p>
 The value of distributed cloud computing 
<p>Cloud services from public cloud providers become “distributed” out to specific and varied physical locations. Operations being physically closer to those who need the capabilities enable low-latency compute. This also ensures a consistent control plane to administer the cloud infrastructure from public to private cloud and extend consistently across both environments. Taken together, these items can deliver major improvements in performance due to the elimination of latency issues, as well as reduce the risk of global network-related outages or control plane inefficiencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Distributed cloud will evolve in two distinct phases. Phase One will consist of like-for-like hybrid</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Distributed cloud creates strategically placed substations of cloud compute, storage and networking that can act as shared cloud pseudoavailability zones. Gartner uses the term “substations” to evoke the image of subsidiary stations, for instance branch post offices, where people gather to use services.</p>
<p>Because distributed cloud substations are the responsibility of the originating public cloud provider, the key cloud value propositions of productivity, innovation and support remain intact. In fact, by 2024, most cloud service platforms will provide at least some distributed cloud services that execute at the point of need.</p>
<p>Other specific advantages of distributed cloud potentially include:</p>
 
 Increased compliance with regulatory requirements that data must be in a specific customer location 
 Reduced network failure risk because the cloud services can reside in local or semilocal subnets, allowing them to operate intermittently untethered 
 A dramatic increase in the number and availability of locations where cloud services can be hosted or from which they can be consumed (compute zones) 
 
 What’s next for distributed cloud? 
<p>In practical terms, distributed cloud will evolve in two distinct phases. Phase One will consist of like-for-like hybrid, where enterprise customers will buy cloud substations to mimic the promise of hybrid cloud and avoid latency-based problems.</p>
<p>These customers will not initially embrace the idea of opening their substations to near neighbors, whether geographical or industry-based, and will keep the substation on their premises to themselves. This will have the effect of enabling true hybrid cloud by having public cloud providers take responsibility for everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next-generation cloud will work based on an assumption that cloud substations are everywhere — much like Wi-Fi hot spots</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phase Two, or next-gen cloud, will consist of utilities, universities, city governments and telcos, among others, buying cloud substations and opening them for use by near neighbors. This will begin to establish the idea that distributed cloud represents the foundation of the next generation of cloud computing. This will also reflect the need for the continuum of distributed cloud. Next-generation cloud will work based on an assumption that cloud substations are everywhere — much like Wi-Fi hot spots.</p>
<p>“In both phases, location becomes more transparent again,” says Smith. “They allow customers to specify to a provider, ‘I need X to comply with policies Y and latencies Z,’ and then let the provider configure automatically and transparently. This could potentially represent future phases as well.”</p>
 Distributed cloud is not without its challenges 
<p>Within the distributed cloud model, some questions must be addressed before <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-lessons-learned-from-cloud-infrastructure-adopters/">the model can be widely adopted</a>. For example:</p>
 
 How much of the public cloud capabilities will be available on the distributed cloud substation? While this is not definitional to distributed cloud, it is a factor in deciding what flavor of distributed cloud will be necessary — fully distributed or partially distributed. 
 What custom scenarios for distributed cloud substations will emerge? 
 If distributed cloud substations are opened to near-neighbor companies, who pays for the increased bandwidth necessary for effective operation and how will it be paid? 
 How will revenue models play out for sharing substations across multiple companies? For example, do near-neighbor users of a substation pay the originating cloud provider or the enterprise that originally requested the substation be installed? 
 Must a distributed cloud substation always be connected, or can it operate with variable connectivity? 
 
 Considerations for CIOs 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/analysts-answer-what-do-cios-need-to-consider-for-cloud-strategy/">In the eyes of the CIO</a>, the distributed cloud concept will guide the roadmap for cloud evolution. It will specifically benefit CIOs seeking new opportunities to reach customers in dispersed environments and those who need location-specific services with reduced latency. Using Phase One like-for-like hybrids without sacrificing cloud value propositions will enable real hybrid cloud computing. Thus, distributed cloud not only ushers in a next generation of cloud in Phase Two, but it also helps build a firmer foundation for hybrid as it exists today.</p>

 The GiD Report#122 — What will replace WeChat? (And how Facebook fueled TikTok’s&nbsp;rise) <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-121-what-we-learned-from-the-big-tech-antitrust-hearing-645d98b1fc61">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Two things mattered this last week: the state of the economy and the state of our technology.</p><p>On the economy, we still can’t seem to agree on the next stimulus bill and so the Fed has taken matters into its own hands — with a now redefined purview on expanding inflation with whatever tools necessary.</p><p>On our technology, President Trump banned a bunch of Chinese apps including TikTok and WeChat. Make no mistake, China’s played this game since day one, keeping out platforms like Facebook and Google so they could build their own tightly controlled variants. But in fighting China’s fight, the U.S. is creating an internet that more and more resembles that of its primary geopolitical rival.</p><p>All of this had the vibe of inevitability. With all the tension building up from the status quo, it was only a matter of time before something had to&nbsp;give.</p><p>These are the ongoing battles that will rejigger the world as we know&nbsp;it.</p><p>And so this week, the economy feels a little less free. And the internet feels a little less&nbsp;open.</p><p>Here’s what we have for you&nbsp;today:</p>  What will fill the WeChat&nbsp;vacuum?  How Facebook fueled TikTok’s&nbsp;rise  The New Brandeis Movement of antitrust thinking  NYTimes contemplates the challenge of antitrust regulations  Chamath Palihapitiya on the economy and Bitcoin (next&nbsp;week)  Stuff happens   1. Everyone is talking about TikTok. Microsoft has 45 days to complete a deal. Twitter apparently threw its hat into the ring over the weekend, according to the WSJ (they’re calling it “Twik Twok”). But let’s talk about&nbsp;WeChat. <p>Where TikTok is about ephemeral fun and also significant long term cultural (and in turn political) influence — soft power, basically — WeChat is as hard as it&nbsp;comes.</p>Photo: Sean&nbsp;Foley<p>Sure, WeChat hasn’t had the same kind of international impact outside of China that TikTok has enjoyed (which, BTW, isn’t even available in China — they use an alternative called Douyin). But if I want to chat with my cousin in Shanghai about the new guy she’s dating, I open up WeChat. If my sister wants to order some obscure product that only a niche Chinese manufacturer makes, she logs onto&nbsp;WeChat.</p><p>If you wanted to connect with people in China, you opened up China’s #1&nbsp;app.</p><p>So even though pretty much no regular American uses WeChat for their normal day-to-day stuff, it remains the central vector for connecting with mainland China both socially and economically. By banning WeChat, Trump is burning a key&nbsp;bridge.</p><p>And because China banned U.S. platforms long ago, there’s really no real alternatives from either&nbsp;side.</p><p>That’s a huge vacuum that’s going to need to be filled. Tensions are high between the two governments, but people are still people. They are going to want to chat and they are going to want to do business with the outside&nbsp;world.</p><p>So the real question is what fills that&nbsp;gap.</p><p>It’s hard to see something from the old guard rising to the task. They want too much control. They need too much of your data. And they lack the structural flexibility to appease both sides. It will be a nonstarter for either government.</p><p>New bridges will need to be built with new approaches.</p><p>That’s the new&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Anyway, this is a big deal. It’s not just about me or my sister. It’s also about Apple. Here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-29d4148e-e21a-4b81-82c8-8e23fb4995d8.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Yes, but: WeChat is not only huge inside China but serves to connect users there with friends and family abroad, and shutting it down in the U.S. would be a major disruption to the Chinese diaspora. Beijing’s internet surveillance and censorship means most Chinese communication platforms stay domestic, and American tech platforms don’t extend into the&nbsp;country.</blockquote><blockquote>Unlike TikTok, which doesn’t operate in China, WeChat can’t be cleanly severed from China, so there’s no path to a domestic acquisition, and the executive order likely amounts to a&nbsp;ban.</blockquote><blockquote>And if American companies can’t do any commerce involving WeChat, which is widely used for a vast range of functions within China, that could demolish the Chinese business of companies like Apple, observers <a href="https://twitter.com/guan/status/1291698934155489281">note</a>.</blockquote> 2. OK! With that out of the way, now we can talk about TikTok (the success of which Facebook is apparently responsible for). <p>If you watched the antitrust hearings the other week — and even if you only watched parts as I did, it was clear that Mark Zuckerberg was positioning Facebook as a democratic foil to TikTok (and parent owner ByteDance).</p><p>In other words, Mark believes we need companies like Facebook to be as big as possible in order to compete on the global stage with an emergent China — Tech Cold War and all that&nbsp;jazz.</p><p>It’s a compelling argument with some (emphasis some) undeniable merit. Companies, tech or other, benefit from scale and network effects, improving reach and efficiency. And having global corporate behemoths expands American hegemony.</p><p>And we all want to expand American hegemony don’t we? (Apologies to all the non-American readers, I’m just trying to make a&nbsp;point.)</p><p>With billions of users, Facebook helps better connect people everywhere, expanding American soft power, and for a time, even helping to spark democratic movements (arguably). The Arab Spring comes to&nbsp;mind.</p><p>But what if Facebook (sheer size and monopolistic behavior in tow) is also one of the main drivers of TikTok’s&nbsp;success?</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://promarket.org/2020/08/07/tech-monopolies-are-the-reason-the-us-now-has-a-tiktok-problem/">Lucas Kunce</a> (via Matt Stoller’s newsletter BIG) for the University of Chicago’s Stigler Center ProMarket magazine:</p><blockquote>If you’re amused by the irony of Big Tech protecting us from an app that could be used for election meddling, given Facebook’s role in the 2016 election, the irony doesn’t stop there. Because TikTok, the app getting all the attention right now, owes its existence in large part to Facebook.</blockquote><blockquote>Once upon a time, America had a popular video-sharing app similar to TikTok. It was called Vine and, like TikTok, all the kids used to share silly videos on it. Facebook didn’t like the competition and flexed its monopoly power to strangle it. As revealed in leaked e-mails, Mark Zuckerberg pulled the trigger himself, denying Vine access to Facebook and eliminating its ability to access&nbsp;users.</blockquote><blockquote>Curiously, Facebook didn’t do that with TikTok. In fact, it did the opposite. During the spring and summer of 2018, when Facebook was still pushing to access China and trying to open a subsidiary office in Hangzhou, Facebook allowed the Chinese app to blitzkrieg its site with advertising. The ad buys were so overwhelming — more than a billion dollars — that between 15 percent and 22 percent of all ads shown through Facebook on IOS during this time were TikTok&nbsp;ads.</blockquote><blockquote>In 2019, however, things changed, and it had nothing to do with patriotism or protecting the West from a Chinese app. Zuckerberg appeared to finally realize that he would never get into China, political scrutiny on Facebook’s outsized power intensified on both sides of the aisle, and TikTok stopped pouring $3 million a day into big ad buys on Facebook.</blockquote><blockquote>In short, Facebook claims its size should be preserved in order to serve as a line of defense against adversarial companies and that it needs to be big to innovate. Yet the evidence indicates that the latest adversarial app owes its existence, in part, to Facebook’s pursuit of corporate goals like expanding into China and increasing ad revenue. The Vine story clearly illustrates how the large tech platforms are structurally unable to defend American interests and should never be trusted with that&nbsp;task.</blockquote><p>That’s the other side of the coin. Just because Big Tech is powerful doesn’t mean it’s good for America. Because ultimately, Big Tech is self interested. (Which in and of itself isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but you know what I mean.) How many potential American Tik Toks has Facebook squashed along the way by pushing its sheer weight around? (Like it did with SnapChat as well when Evan Spiegel refused to&nbsp;sell.)</p><p>In crushing American competition, Facebook created space (and even supported) the rise of Chinese competition.</p><p>The consequences only become fully clear in hindsight. It’s the type of negative externality that’s sometimes hard to quantify — diminishing competition and innovation (although the numbers are now starting to back it&nbsp;up).</p><p>Related:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/mg">/mg</a> — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qpwtU9uoI">The TikTok&nbsp;Ban</a>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/">Ben Thompson: Antitrust Politics</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-hearing-cicilline-facebook-apple-google-amazon-230cca9a-eadc-4293-ad73-fc9c41696d20.html">Podcast: Big Tech hearing chair on which companies should be broken&nbsp;up</a>  <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/banning-tiktok-are-we-reproducing?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzEzNiwicG9zdF9pZCI6ODI0MDM4LCJfIjoiOUd5RkYiLCJpYXQiOjE1OTY4MjMwOTcsImV4cCI6MTU5NjgyNjY5NywiaXNzIjoicHViLTExNTI0Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.RzCACSxUpx6CzohuN2uoIdIw-pVdbB6Fw-T0D7camuY">Banning TikTok: Are We Reproducing the Chinese Internet in&nbsp;America?</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-tiktok-have-held-preliminary-talks-about-possible-combination-11596925449">WSJ News Exclusive | Twitter, TikTok Have Held Preliminary Talks About Possible Combination</a>  <a href="https://promarket.org/2020/08/07/tech-monopolies-are-the-reason-the-us-now-has-a-tiktok-problem/">Tech Monopolies Are the Reason the US Now Has a TikTok Problem — Pro&nbsp;Market</a>  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2020/08/09/trumps-ban-on-tiktok-and-wechat-strengthens-cryptocurrencies/">Trump’s Ban On TikTok And WeChat Strengthens Cryptocurrencies</a>   3. So we’ve talked about Lina Khan here before, who wrote the seminal paper on antitrust (Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox), which helped spawn the New Brandeis Movement (Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis is heavily cited in Lina’s paper). The ethos of that movement got a nod by Chairman David Cicilline during the antitrust hearings (via Ben Thompson’s Stratechery): <blockquote>Because concentrated economic power also leads to concentrated political power, this investigation also goes to the heart of whether we as a people govern ourselves, or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies. American democracy has always been at war against monopoly power. Throughout our history, we’ve recognized that concentrated markets and concentrated political control are incompatible with democratic ideals. When the American people confronted monopolies in the past, be it the railroads or the oil tycoons or AT&amp;T and Microsoft, we took action to ensure no private corporation controls our economy or our democracy.</blockquote><p>Which touches upon our point about Facebook and the rise of TikTok. This isn’t just about keeping prices low, making platforms more useful, or optimizing for efficiency. It’s about upholding social, cultural, and political values and not allowing economic power undermine them.</p><p>In other words, we can’t lose sight of the big&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Those were Chairman Cicilline’s closing remarks to his opening statement. Ben has <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/">a more in depth take on the hearings as a whole</a>, which is worth your time. (Incidentally, he didn’t feel like the rest of the show lived up to the spirit of those initial remarks.)</p> 4. The issue is that it’s easy to spot the problem. Figuring out a solution is less straightforward—especially from a regulatory perspective. <p>Here’s <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20200804&amp;instance_id=20964&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=35187&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fd75f7c23-4919-5b0f-99e6-c340a549cde8&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">the NYTimes tech newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Shira: What’s been Europe’s approach to the American tech superpowers?</blockquote><blockquote>Adam: Europe started doing antitrust investigations several years ago. But the resulting lawsuits and regulation haven’t done&nbsp;much.</blockquote><blockquote>Google is the best example. Investigations into allegations of anti-competitive tactics took years. The European Union then fined Google several billion dollars for breaking the law. But critics say that Google wasn’t forced to change much, so this did little to restore competition.</blockquote><blockquote>What can American lawmakers and regulators learn from Europe’s mistakes?</blockquote><blockquote>Speed is crucial, otherwise regulators are fighting yesterday’s battles.</blockquote><blockquote>There was also a problem with enforcement. Europe passed a highly-touted privacy law called General Data Protection Regulation, but it’s been a flop at limiting data collection by the biggest tech companies. Much of the policing of the law was left to Ireland, which simply doesn’t have the resources to keep&nbsp;up.</blockquote><blockquote>It sounds as if the lesson is that you can believe there’s a problem with tech companies’ power, but it’s hard to craft an appropriate response.</blockquote><blockquote>Without a doubt. The authorities in Europe are changing their tactics now. They’re looking at rewriting laws to directly target the way big tech companies do business: How they use data or box out rivals, and ways they give their products preferential treatment.</blockquote><blockquote>But after a few years covering this in Europe, I have become much more suspect about these efforts at regulation. There’s a lot of potential for unintended consequences.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Does this mean we should be skeptical about any U.S. government action against Big&nbsp;Tech?</blockquote><blockquote>Maybe. But it’s still been interesting to watch this growing realization among the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic about the size of these companies and the influence they hold over their democratic societies and how they operate, including their communication systems, information flow and commerce.</blockquote><blockquote>You can sense this feeling that lawmakers think they must do something, but aren’t quite sure what that is yet. The next 12 to 18 months are going to be extraordinary.</blockquote><p>And because these are extraordinary times, things are moving faster than usual.&nbsp;Axios:</p><blockquote>After grilling the CEOs of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple last week, members of Congress are grappling with whether to accuse any of the firms of illegal anticompetitive behavior, to propose updating federal antitrust laws, or both, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: Congress is just one arm of government making the case against these <br>companies. Google is expected to be the first of the firms to face possible antitrust litigation from the Justice Department before summer’s end, but all four face a full-court press of investigations by DOJ, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s next: Following on from last week’s hearing, the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee is preparing a report of its probe’s findings, drawn from some 1.3 million documents and hours of calls and interviews. Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline told “Axios Re:Cap” he hopes to issue the report and recommendations by late August or September.</blockquote> 5. I was going to get to the economy next, referencing the interview with Chamath Palihapitiya I shared on Friday, but today’s newsletter has already gotten pretty long so I’ll save it for next&nbsp;week. <p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/goldman-sachs-eyes-token-bank-appoints-head-digital-assets">Goldman Sachs Eyes Own Token as Bank Appoints New Head of Digital Assets — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20200806a.htm?utm_campaign=20200806_FS_PR_FN_FRN%203%20Release_Broad&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Eloqua">Federal Reserve announces details of new 24x7x365 interbank settlement service with clearing functionality to support instant payments in the United&nbsp;States</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/the-history-present-and-future-of-central-banks-feat-george-selgin">The History, Present and Future of Central Banks, Feat.

					 <p>There is a single question that can go a very long way in helping determine whether you should build a solution in-house or buy a product to solve your need:</p>

					 <p>If you were developing a web app, you wouldn’t consider building your own RDBMS, front-end framework, or hosting service.

					 <p>At face value, the decision to build or buy seems like a relatively straightforward one; how much will it cost you to build and maintain an in-house system, and what’s the sticker price for the ready-built solution? But there are non-obvious and often hard-to-quantify considerations that you need to make sure to fully consider.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Reasons to buy</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Reasons to build</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Turnkey/speed</a>
					 
					 <p>A ready-made product should work off the shelf. Some products work better than others…but in principle, this is true.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Support</a>
					 
					 <p>If you’re building something in-house and you run into a roadblock, where will you turn? Consultants? Expensive. Forums? Unreliable, slow. Figure it out? Expensive (because it’s slow). The support that comes with a product, especially in an industry as nascent as self-sovereign identity, is extremely valuable.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Premium product</a>
					 
					 <p>When a vendor makes an update to a product you’re using, you inherit those features effortlessly. The product improves itself over time because there is a dedicated team working on it. Because of the nature of economies of scale, this always results in a premium product.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Scaling</a>
					 
					 <p>Open source reference implementations are meant to be a reference but are not ultimately meant to be a scalable solution. If you use a vendor, you’ll likely need to pay them more money as you scale; so they’re incentivized to ensure their product is scalable!</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Lower-cost</a>
					 
					 <p>It’ll always be lower-cost to buy than to build because the development costs of the product can be amortized across all their customers. If you build it in-house, you bear the brunt of 100% of the costs.</p> 
				 
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>  Control</a>
					 
					 <p>When you build the technology yourself, you have total ownership and control over the software. You’re not restricted by other software licenses, and you have full ability to change the codebase to accommodate your needs. You control where the data is hosted and don’t need to rely on legal agreements to control how it’s handled.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> In-house expertise</a>
					 
					 <p>Although it will be much more expensive and time consuming to build in-house, your team will build up an expertise. If this expertise is strategically important for your organization, this is an important consideration. You’ll need to make sure to retain the knowledgeable employees, however; I’ve seen key employees leave and wipe out their company’s SSI knowledge base.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Long-tail use case</a>
					 
					 <p>If your use case is uncommon or extraordinarily unique, you may be forced to build in-house. Ready-built platforms like Trinsic are built to accommodate all of the most common use cases, but there is a “long tail” of cases that aren’t economical for a vendor to cover. For these, you will likely need to go deep into the low level SDKs and build something custom.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Costs at scale</a>
					 
					 <p>Depending on the pricing model of the vendor you’re working with, it’s possible that it will be costlier at scale to use a vendor. For example, if a vendor charges per-issuance and your use case requires issuing millions of credentials, then you’ll either need to negotiate special pricing with the vendor or build your own solution to make it economical. This is rare, so it is a companion point to the “long-tail use case” point.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Avoid vendor lock-in</a>
					 
					 <p>Traditionally, enterprises would build in-house to avoid being locked in to a specific software vendor. Luckily, SSI protocols are open source and based on standards which means that Trinsic can’t lock you in even if we wanted to! So the value of this point is reduced in the context of self-sovereign identity.</p> 
				 
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Self-sovereign identity is unique 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>In addition to the common considerations above, SSI has some unique properties that you should be aware of.<br><br></p>  Rapidly-moving space: The open source and standards work in the SSI community are moving at the speed of light. If you opt to build yourself, you’ll need at least two full-time engineers working solely on SSI just for your system to tread water; one to stay abreast of the evolving work going on at DIF, ToIP, Hyperledger, Sovrin, W3C, etc. and one to implement and maintain your software in response to those changes. You’ll bear 100% of the cost of these engineers. And the interoperability devil is in the details—with a vengeance.  Identity is high-stakes: Many verifiable credentials use cases involve high-value, highly-regulated data. Identity breaches are <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ponemon-institutes-2015-global-cost-of-data-breach-study-reveals-average-cost-of-data-breach-reaches-record-levels-300089057.html">costly</a>, making key storage, wallet management (especially in the cloud), and other architectural considerations crucially important. Are you a world-class expert in securing these components? Even if you have the know-how, do you have the engineering capacity for the build-out and maintenance? Once it’s secured, how will it scale?  <p><br>Self-sovereign identity is who we are. It’s what we eat, breathe, and sleep, so you don’t have to. Our expert engineering team ensures the most recent standards and protocols are implemented in our platform, so you never have to worry about interoperability or standards compliance.

<p><a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a> has announced the release of a new decentralized identity solution, which will make it easier and more secure than ever for crypto holders and traders to manage and exchange digital assets. It is envisioned that the benefits of this new solution will bring benefits similar to what the EU’s Open Banking initiative is bringing to traditional finance, to crypto users around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>In what will have major benefits for users’ experience, through Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, digital asset holders can now access a 360° view of all of their holdings on one dashboard through the Ontology website or Ontology’s ONTO application. Users will have a clear view of their assets, no matter what wallets those assets are held in. In addition, users will also be able to view their OScore, Ontology’s credit scoring system, on any&nbsp;chain.</p><p>LI JUN, Founder of Ontology, said, “Ontology is on a mission to change the way data is managed and transferred, increasing security, protection, and value for all parties involved. It is inevitable that DeFi developments will be subject to strict regulations, just as is the case with traditional finance. Thus, ensuring that reliable mechanisms for the verification of user identity are in place is vital. Ontology is providing a solution that connects users’ assets to their identity, providing increased security and trust to all parties, connecting the missing pieces of decentralized finance’s ecosystem.</p><p>“Many crypto users hold digital assets in different wallets. Should a user wish to borrow crypto, for example, it can be difficult to verify their financial holdings easily. Through the use of ONT ID, Ontology’s OScore allows users to verify the full value of their holdings and view relevant financial history across their wallets, without showing a full list of those assets. In this way, user data privacy is protected, and information that does not need to be shared is not shared. For lenders, the risk is vastly reduced as transparency and trust are greatly increased, and correct due diligence can take&nbsp;place.”</p><p>In line with the release of the new decentralized identity solution, Ontology has also published a graphic outlining exactly how the solution works. Integration of the solution into BTC, ETH, etc is already under construction, as Ontology plans to cater for increased demand for the cross-chain interoperability.</p><p>For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://ont.io/">ont.io</a>.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-releases-new-decentralized-identity-solution-to-benefit-defi-users-e75d3f9551bb">Ontology Releases New Decentralized Identity Solution To Benefit DeFi Users</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>It’s a commonplace nowadays that we live in an information age where society and the economy is increasingly driven by data. All you need for evidence of this is to look at the likes of Google and Facebook, companies that have embedded themselves into billions of peoples’ everyday lives. Or take a look at the increasingly fractious debate about who should be allowed to collect what data, how, for what purposes and whose&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>But actually we’re just at the beginning. At the very earliest stage. Why? Because the way that data is currently collected and used suffocates its true potential.</p><p>The unique and special thing about data is that it doesn’t get ‘used up’ when it is used. It can be used again and again. And it can be used by different people for different purposes. Your health data may be used by a doctor to help treat an illness for example, and by an insurance company to calculate your insurance premiums. You may use the data in your driving licence to prove that you are entitled to drive. A separate organisation may use it to help verify your identity.</p><p>Currently our entire data economy is organised around the assumptions of ‘OUOU’: that there is only One User of any piece of data that has been collected (the first ‘OU”) and there is only One Use for this data — the purpose they collected the data for (the second ‘OU’ of ‘one use’). This data system is almost 100% organisation-centric. It is organisations that collect and use data and they only use this data for their own purposes, jealousy guarding the data they collect, partly because for legal reasons if it is personal data, but also because they see this data as keys to their competitive edge and ability to make&nbsp;money.</p> From ‘OUOU’ to&nbsp;‘MUMU’ <p>Increasingly however, a new realisation is dawning: that data that was originally collected and used by a specific data controller for a specific purpose could be used by many other parties for many other purposes. As long as we live in an OUOU world the full potential of data can never be unleashed, because most users, and uses, of this data can never&nbsp;happen.</p><p>To unleash this potential, we need to move from OUOU to MUMU — many users, many&nbsp;uses.</p><p>Like the chick in the egg at a certain point the OUOU structures and assumptions that originally protected and nurtured data collection and use begin to constrain and suffocate it. For the data chick’s potential to be unleashed it has to break out of the OUOU shell to embrace MUMU&nbsp;instead.</p><p>You can see the MUMU trend everywhere we look, in issues relating to both personal and non-personal data. For example, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-european-strategy-data-19feb2020_en.pdf">new European Strategy for Data</a> has provisions to improve and increase data sharing between the public sector and business (government-to-business or G2B data sharing), between companies (business-to-business or B2B data-sharing), between businesses and government authorities (business-to-government or B2G data sharing), and between public authorities. It is developing strategies for increased data sharing in targeted industries such as automotive, financial services, health and Internet of&nbsp;Things.</p><p>Of course, citizen’s right to data portability is now enshrined in law via GDPR. Data sharing in one form or another is also an essential element of multiple initiatives including those to promote availability of Open Data, attempts to promote Open Banking and hot topics including so-called ‘Big Data’, AI, internet of things, smart cities and smart&nbsp;homes.</p><p>This shift from OUOU to MUMU represents a tectonic shift in the data economy. Its unfolding may be slow but it is also fundamental, structural, remorseless, relentless and unstoppable. the potential uses of data. And the more the idea ‘clicks’ in peoples’ minds (e.g. policy makers, regulators, innovators, entrepreneurs, opinion-formers as well as people like ourselves) the more unstoppable the pressure for MUMU&nbsp;becomes.</p><p>Looking back, once MUMU ways of collecting and using data have become the new normal, what we currently call ‘the ‘information age’ will seem extremely restricted, distorted and partial indeed, just as the age of steam seems extremely limited once viewed from the vantage point of an electrified society.</p><p>In their time, steam engines were dazzling and awe-inspiring in their operation, scale and impact; widely seen as harbingers, symbols and catalysts of dramatic and far-reaching change. But ultimately, steam was a dead-end. When it was replaced by electricity — a far richer, more flexible, versatile, efficient, distributed way of accessing and using energy, economic growth really took&nbsp;off.</p><p>Companies like Google and Facebook are the steam engines of the information age. They, too, are dazzling and awe-inspiring in their operation, scale and impact. But their OUOU nature means they don’t represent the MUMU&nbsp;future.</p> Multiple effects <p>MUMU will (is already having) multiple effects. Here are some of&nbsp;them.</p>  A growing increasing realisation that data storage needs to be separated from data use, with specialist organisations and institutions enabling the gathering, aggregation and storing data and helping specialist service providers access and use it for specific purposes. A central plank of the EU’s new data strategy for example is to “increase its pools of quality data available for use and re- use.” This is part of what it calls “a new data paradigm where less data will be stored in data centres, and more data will be spread in a pervasive way closer to the user ‘at the edge’ ”. Mydex is one of these specialist organisations.  The increasing importance of new mechanisms and enablers of safe, efficient data sharing. Well-formed APIs are an obvious example. They can help to turn a system of isolated data castles into a vibrant, pulsating nervous system driven by data sharing. But the development of new standards for the creation and use of metadata is also critically important along with data directories that act as signposts to where the data is held, and data inventories explaining what data is held by each&nbsp;party.  New forms of value and business model to go with these new approaches.  The collapse current notions of ‘private property’ which are of absolutist, binary, where something is either mine or yours. In its place: increased recognition of the importance of shared and divided rights and responsibilities with negotiated boundaries and&nbsp;limits.  Changes in value equations. Currently, in consumer/citizen facing services, the only value that matters relates to the content and quality of the service offered by a service provider. With the rise of MUMU, organisations will be increasingly expected to offer an added dimension of value: data. Citizens/customers will increasingly ask “what data has the service provider collected, generated or minted that I could use for other purposes elsewhere, outside of this relationship, with other parties?”   New dangers <p>The shift to MUMU won’t automatically usher in a new golden age of data sharing and use. Far from it. Predatory, parasitic and profiteering motives and strategies are likely to be inflamed even further, triggering new data land grabs that are even bigger, more vicious and more cynical than those we have yet seen. Sharks and opportunists will adopt ‘caring, sharing’ words to cover the real intentions. One example: Look at how new health data sets are being collated supposedly for the purpose of helping society tackle Covid-19, but actually represent power grabs and data monetisation. Beware also the new fashion for ‘data trusts’ which are already being eyed by some as a data land grab opportunity.</p> But also new opportunities <p>The existence of such threats makes Mydex’s work work even more important. We saw MUMU coming when we first launched 13 years ago. Everything we have done since has been designed to enable data sharing — to help MUMU happen in the realms of personal data — but only if it is safe and ethical, empowers citizens and ensures they realise the value of their own data. (That was our original slogan on formation: “helping individuals realise the value of their own&nbsp;data”.)</p><p>We’re getting closer to making it happen. With the work we have done for the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/03/06/what-are-smart-entitlements/">Scottish Government on its ‘Smart Entitlement’ strategy</a> we believe we have found a practical, doable way forward that achieves the goals of safety, efficiency and equity, and that helps unleash the full value of personal data for both individuals and the broader society and&nbsp;economy.</p><p>More on that&nbsp;soon.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">From OUOU to MUMU: why the real information age hasn’t even started yet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarzyna-mrowinska/">Katarzyna Kazimierczak-Mrowińska</a>, or Kasia to her friends and colleagues, is the COO of Authenteq. Not only does she oversee the day to day operations and operational functions of the business, but she’s also a new mom to two beautiful twins. We spoke to Kasia about juggling work and motherhood, what’s changed, and what she learned so far.<br></p>



<p></p>



 What led you to Authenteq and made you want to work in the KYC and identity verification space? 



<p>I worked indirectly with Authenteq through the company I worked with beforehand. I have a law degree but I never actively pursued any academic knowledge in the tech sector. I had been working in the tech industry for a few years, so when the GDPR passed in Europe and made <a href="https://authenteq.com/10-reasons-you-should-verify-identities/">privacy a much bigger topic to everyone</a>, I was able to get involved hands-on combing my skills.</p>



<p>The identity verification space has a lot to do with the law, new regulation and compliance, so for me, it was a way to build on the skills I already had and use my expertise, while continuing to learn. I’ve been able to watch as the law catches up, or tries to, to technology.</p>



 What do you like most about working at Authenteq? 



<p>It’s such an interesting industry and being a part of it as it evolves has been great. I have a lot of responsibilities, that are paired with a great level of autonomy to plan my own days and my schedule. Plus, the people at Authenteq are really incredible.&nbsp;</p>



 How would you describe the work culture at Authenteq? 



<p>I was always a fan of Scandinavian work culture and their seemingly perfect work-life balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authenteq was established in Iceland, which is arguably one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Iceland#:~:text=Iceland%20is%20arguably%20one%20of%20the%20world's%20most%20gender%2Dequal,pay%20gap%20index%20since%202009.">world’s most gender-equal countries</a> in the world. It was listed as the number one best place to work by The Economist’s women index in 2016, has been named the most feminist country in the world, and has been listed number one on the World Economic Forum gender pay gap index since 2009.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So having Scandinavian culture and women equality was the core of the culture, and we tried to translate that in the Berlin office as well. We are honest, transparent, and most importantly, we respect each other. Those are the most important principles within the team. Of course, a company is like a living body, it evolves and changes, people leave while new people join, so sometimes we struggle to keep that same level of culture, but I can say for sure that this is the best company I’ve ever worked with.&nbsp;</p>



 You are the mother of two beautiful twins. How did you manage your work while pregnant and what does your schedule look like today?&nbsp; 



<p>I was super supported when I was pregnant. My colleagues, many of whom I consider friends, brought me food, helped solve computer and software-related issues as I tried to work more from home. I left the office in August but continued working remotely, a few hours a day. I took September off and the twins were born in October.</p>



<p>The team has been as supportive of me coming back – that’s why I can efficiently juggle work and motherhood. Currently, I have set hours that align with my nanny’s schedule. It’s never an issue if I have to come in late or leave early, and meetings are scheduled around me, which is why I wanted fixed hours so that expectations could be set in both ways. It’s helpful for my teammates to know when I’ll be in and available and that it doesn’t change from week to week. The kids will be in Kita (Kindertagesstätte, or a nursery school for pre-school children) as of January so I’ll be back part-time as of February.&nbsp;</p>



 How do you balance motherhood and acting as the COO of a thriving startup in a fast-paced city?&nbsp; 



<p>A friend told me that if you work part-time, it will require the same amount of effort and energy as working full time, and I have found that to be helpful and true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have to be super focused at work because I know once I’m back at home with the kids, I can’t do any work until the babies are asleep. I also make sure I take time for myself. Every day I do some sort of sports or pilates. I took an online business course with <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/courses/core/">Harvard Business School</a> back in May so I would go from checking in at the office, back home to take care of the kids, put them to bed, exercise, and then study or do homework until midnight. It was crazy!</p>



 Has your leadership style changed since becoming a mother? 



<p>Now that I’m juggling more, I’m definitely more careful with my time. I plan better, attend fewer meetings, and I’m more organized in terms of my own agenda.&nbsp;</p>



 What’s been the most surprising thing about motherhood so far?&nbsp; 



<p>How patient I can be, and how little sleep I need to operate!</p>



 What are some tips or advice that you’d share with new moms going back to work after maternity leave?&nbsp; 



<p>Don’t try to be the best right away, just take your time and take time for yourself. No one is going to expect you to be operating at 100 percent as soon as you’re back, so don’t stress yourself out. Stress can have such negative impacts on your productivity and your mood, which is only going to make things harder at work, and harder at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would recommend taking fewer responsibilities at the beginning, starting with just one or two projects that you can manage on your own, with realistic deadlines. You’ll find your own rhythm as you ease back into your routine. It was really hard for me to focus the first four weeks after I had the twins, my mind was somewhere else, but slowly it got better and better. Never forget that work-life balance is key – that’s what makes juggling work and motherhood possible. Once you start building a family, your priorities will shift, and I promise you that you won’t regret a single day spent outside of the office to focus on them.&nbsp;<br></p>

The term “verifiable credentials” can seem a bit technical and overwhelming at first glance. But in reality, verifiable credentials are simpler than you think.</p>

					 <p>Let’s begin with the word “credential.” When we use the word credential, we are talking about any document, card, certificate, etc. that contains information about something. We use credentials every day, including driver’s licenses, passports, diplomas, insurance cards, medical test results, employee badges, and more.<br><br>All of these examples are physical, paper, or plastic credentials that you can hold in your hand. However, a credential becomes a verifiable credential once it is in a standard, digital format which you keep in your phone or the cloud. And that leads to our simple definition of verifiable credentials:</p> 
				 
				 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				Verifiable credentials are standardized, digital certificates that make it easy to share information online in a private and secure way.			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
				 
				 
					 <p>We say “standardized” because the way verifiable credentials should be built&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">has been standardized</a>&nbsp;by the internet’s leading standards body. That means there is a correct way to create a verifiable credential, and at Trinsic, we make it easy for you to do so.<br></p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 The verifiable credential model 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>When it comes to using verifiable credentials, it important to know these three roles:<br><br></p>  Issuer: The issuer is the person or organization that creates the verifiable credential and gives (“issues”) it to a person, organization, or thing. (e.g., a DMV)  Holder: The holder is the person or organization that holds the verifiable credential in their digital wallet. (e.g., a person who receives a digital driver’s license from the DMV)  Verifier: The verifier is the person or organization that gets information shared with them. They can authenticate the information they receive instantaneously. (e.g., a security agent at the airport checking your license)  <p><br>Often called the “Trust Triangle,” the image below is a classic diagram used to help conceptualize the verifiable credential model.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>An important thing to note is that while the integrity of the information can be verified, the truthfulness of it cannot. So although the verifier needs to trust the source of the credential (ie., the issuer) it doesn’t need to contact the issuer directly in order to verify the information.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 The unique properties 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Verifiable credentials are unique from other kinds of digital documents because they are:<br><br></p>  Portable: With just a few clicks, you can send the credential online to anyone you please. You can also move wallets between different providers if you’d like.  Verifiable: The reason why they are called verifiable credentials is because they allow you to verify the following things: 1) who issued the credential, 2) who the credential was issued to, 3) if the information within the credential has been tampered with, and 4) whether the credential has been revoked.  Private: Through <a href="https://trinsic.id/zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, you can pick and choose what information you want to share on a credential (you don’t have to share all of it).  Tamperproof: Verifiable credentials can’t be altered or forged.

 Ontology Collaborates with NEAR Protocol to Accelerate Proliferation of Secure Decentralized ID Solutions <blockquote>Announcement reinforces Ontology’s commitment to advancing decentralized identity solutions</blockquote><p>Ontology has joined forces with the <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnear.org&amp;esheet=52214256&amp;newsitemid=20200504005546&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NEAR+Protocol&amp;index=1&amp;md5=4004f21027e0ae85f9100eb9600ed09f">NEAR Protocol</a> in an effort to expedite the development and deployment of secure decentralized identity solutions.</p><p>The purview of the collaboration will see Ontology provide technical support for NEAR’s Decentralized Identifier (DID) from a regulatory perspective, and to enable smart contract implementation and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/">W3C</a> registration.</p><p>NEAR is a decentralized application platform that is secure enough to manage high-value assets like money or identity and performant enough to make them useful for everyday people, putting the power of the Open Web in their hands. The platform recently announced the completion of a $21.6 million funding round backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Electric Capital, and others, as well as the launch of their&nbsp;MainNet.</p><p>Erick Pinos, Ontology Americas Ecosystem Lead,&nbsp;said,</p><blockquote>“Teaming up with NEAR broadens our remit considerably when it comes to delivering state of the art decentralized identity protocols. NEAR has quickly emerged as a leading dApp platform, attracting wide interest from backers and high profile enterprise partners. We share common objectives in terms of broadening the accessibility of enterprise-grade blockchain applications and decentralized identity solutions and look forward to working together.”</blockquote><p>With a primary focus on delivering a fast, user-friendly platform with a unique infrastructure that supports robust cross-chain collaboration, Ontology provides businesses with the tools to design their own blockchain solutions securely. Powered by the Ontology Token (ONT), the distributed collaboration platform allows businesses to enjoy the benefits of smart contracts and tokenization while retaining control of their sensitive data.</p><p>Erik Trautman, CEO of NEAR Foundation said,</p><blockquote>“We are tremendously excited to leverage the technical acumen of the Ontology team, particularly in relation to their bespoke ONT ID 2.0, a very robust decentralized identity solution designed for streamlined cross-chain interoperability. Following our successful MainNet launch, we are keen to strengthen our partner network, and look forward to extending the power of Ontology’s solutions to our growing customer&nbsp;base.”</blockquote><p>The news follows last month’s launch of a new version of ONTO, Ontology’s self-sovereign data wallet, designed to give users the power to control the value of their data, as well as a new upgraded version of ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><blockquote>“At Ontology, we are firmly committed to promoting tangible, real-world DID applications and educating the world on the far-reaching benefits. We look forward to making further contributions to what will become a thriving DID ecosystem globally, and continue showcasing Ontology’s unique DID capabilities,” concluded Pinos.</blockquote> About the NEAR&nbsp;Protocol <p>NEAR’s mission is to enable community-driven innovation to benefit people around the world. NEAR’s platform provides decentralized storage and compute that is secure enough to manage high-value assets like money or identity and performant enough to make them useful for everyday people, putting the power of the Open Web in their&nbsp;hands.</p><p>Technically speaking, NEAR Protocol is a brand new public, proof-of-stake blockchain which is built using a novel consensus mechanism called Doomslug. NEAR Protocol uses a technique called “sharding” which splits the network into multiple pieces so that the computation is done in parallel. Parallelism radically increases throughput and allows the network to scale up as the number of nodes on it increases. With NEAR, there isn’t a theoretical limit on the network’s capacity.</p><p>NEAR core contributors have won multiple world championships in competitive programming and worked at major tech companies such as Google, Facebook, and Niantic.

   The topic of validating an OAuth 2.0 access tokens comes up frequently on this blog. Often we talk about how to validate JSON Web Token (JWT) based access tokens; however, this is NOT part of the OAuth 2.0 specification. JWTs are so commonly used that Spring Security supported them before adding support for remotely validating tokens (which is part of the OAuth 2.0 specification.)

  <p>The topic of validating an OAuth 2.0 access tokens comes up frequently on this blog. Often we talk about how to validate JSON Web Token (JWT) based access tokens; however, this is NOT part of the OAuth 2.0 specification. JWTs are so commonly used that Spring Security supported them before adding support for remotely validating tokens (which is part of the OAuth 2.0 specification.)</p>

<p>In this post, you will build a simple application that takes advantage of both types of validation.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>
 
   <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 8+</a> 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">A free Okta Developer account</a> 
 

 Should I Validate Access Tokens Locally or Remote? 

<p>Whether you should validate access tokens locally (e.g., a JWT) or remotely (per spec) is a question of how much security you need. Often, people jump to, “I need all of the securities!” This statement simply isn’t true—how much security you need should be balanced with other factors like ease of use, cost, and performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no such thing as perfect security, only varying levels of insecurity.</p>
   
     Salman Rushdie 
   
</blockquote>

<p>The biggest downside to validating a token locally is that your token is, by definition, stale. It is a snapshot of the moment in time when your identity provider (IdP) created the token. The further away you get from that moment, the more likely that token is no longer valid: it could have been revoked, the user could have logged out, or the application that created the token disabled.</p>

<p>Remotely validating tokens are not always ideal, either. Remote validation comes with the cost of adding latency in your application, as you need to add an HTTP request to a remote server every time you need to validate the token.</p>

<p>One way to reduce these concerns is to keep the lifetime of an access token short (say 5 minutes) and validate them locally; this limits the risk of using a revoked token.</p>

<p>There is another option: do both!</p>

 Validate Access Tokens Locally and Remotely! 

<p>By default, Spring Boot applications can be configured to use JWT validation OR opaque validation, simply by <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security-oauth2-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#specifying-a-token-verification-strategy">configuring a few properties</a>. Using both types of validation in the same application requires a few extra lines of code.</p>

<p>Obviously, you wouldn’t do both on each request; you could validate more sensitive operations remotely and all other requests locally. For example, when updating a user’s contact information, you may want to validate the token remotely, but when viewing the user’s profile information, validate locally. This pattern keeps your application fast, as updating an address or an email happens less frequently than just viewing contact information.</p>

<p>To get started, you will need an OAuth Web application in Okta.</p>

<p>Login in to your Okta admin console, if you just <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">created a new account</a>, and have not logged in yet, follow the activation link in your inbox.</p>

<p>Make a note of the Org URL on the top right; I’ll refer to this as <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> in the next section.</p>

<p>Once you are logged in, navigate to the top menu and select Applications -&gt; Add Application. Select Web -&gt; Next.</p>

<p>Give your application a name: “Spring Tokens Example”</p>

<p>Set the Login redirect URIs to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code></p>

<p>Check Implicit (Hybrid)</p>

<p>Click Done</p>

<p></p>

<p>Head over to <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.2.6.RELEASE&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=1.8&amp;groupId=com.okta.example&amp;artifactId=spring-token-example&amp;name=spring-token-example&amp;description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&amp;packageName=com.okta.example&amp;dependencies=security,web">start.spring.io</a> and click the Generate button.</p>

<p>Note: The above link populates the following settings:</p>

 
   Group: com.okta.example 
   Artifact: spring-token-example 
   Package name: com.okta.example 
   Dependencies:
     
       Spring Security (security) 
       Spring Web (web) 
     
   
 

<p>Unzip the project and open it in your favorite IDE.</p>

<p>Add two more dependencies to the Maven <code>pom.xml</code> file:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.nimbusds&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;oauth2-oidc-sdk&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;7.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Add an <code>OAuth2ClientProperties</code> bean to the <code>SpringTokenExampleApplication</code> class to reuse the standard Spring Security OAuth properties.</p>

   <code>@Bean
OAuth2ClientProperties oAuth2ClientProperties() {
    return new OAuth2ClientProperties();
}
</code>   

<p>Add a simple REST controller with a GET and a POST handler, in <code>src/main/java/com/okta/example/SimpleController.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.okta.example;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class SimpleController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    String hello() {
        return "Hello!";
    }

    @PostMapping("/")
    String helloPost(@RequestParam("message") String message) {
        return "hello: " + message;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create a new class that will map a <code>RequestMatcher</code> to the <code>AuthenticationManager</code> (more on this below) <code>src/main/java/com/okta/example/RequestMatchingAuthenticationManagerResolver.java</code></p>

<p>NOTE: This class may be part of a future version of <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/pull/7366">Spring Security</a>.</p>

 Configure Spring Security to Validate JWTs and Opaque Tokens 

<p>Everything up until now has been boilerplate, now we get to the fun part!</p>

<p>Create a new <code>ExampleWebSecurityConfigurer</code> class which uses local JWT validation for <code>GET</code> requests, and remote “opaque” validation for all other requests (be sure to read the inline comments):</p>

   <code>package com.okta.example;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.client.OAuth2ClientProperties;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationManager;
import org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationManagerResolver;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.jwt.JwtDecoder;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.jwt.NimbusJwtDecoder;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.resource.authentication.JwtAuthenticationProvider;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.resource.authentication.JwtBearerTokenAuthenticationConverter;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.resource.authentication.OpaqueTokenAuthenticationProvider;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.resource.introspection.NimbusOpaqueTokenIntrospector;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.resource.introspection.OpaqueTokenIntrospector;
import org.springframework.security.web.util.matcher.RequestMatcher;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;
import java.util.List;

@Configuration
public class ExampleWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    // Inject the `OAuth2ClientProperties` we configured in the previous step
    @Autowired
    private OAuth2ClientProperties oAuth2ClientProperties;

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {

        // All routes require authentication
        http.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated();

        // Configure a custom `AuthenticationManager` to determine 
        // if JWT or opaque token validation should be used
        http.oauth2ResourceServer().authenticationManagerResolver(customAuthenticationManager());
    }

    AuthenticationManagerResolver&lt;HttpServletRequest&gt; customAuthenticationManager() {
        LinkedHashMap&lt;RequestMatcher, AuthenticationManager&gt; authenticationManagers = new LinkedHashMap&lt;&gt;();

        // USE JWT tokens (locally validated) to validate HEAD, GET, and OPTIONS requests
        List&lt;String&gt; readMethod = Arrays.asList("HEAD", "GET", "OPTIONS");
        RequestMatcher readMethodRequestMatcher = request -&gt; readMethod.contains(request.getMethod());
        authenticationManagers.put(readMethodRequestMatcher, jwt());

        // all other requests will use opaque tokens (remotely validated)
        RequestMatchingAuthenticationManagerResolver authenticationManagerResolver 
            = new RequestMatchingAuthenticationManagerResolver(authenticationManagers);

        // Use opaque tokens (remotely validated) for all other requests
        authenticationManagerResolver.setDefaultAuthenticationManager(opaque());
        return authenticationManagerResolver;
    }

    // Mimic the default configuration for JWT validation.
    AuthenticationManager jwt() {
        // this is the keys endpoint for okta
        String issuer = oAuth2ClientProperties.getProvider().get("okta").getIssuerUri();
        String jwkSetUri = issuer + "/v1/keys";

        // This is basically the default jwt logic
        JwtDecoder jwtDecoder = NimbusJwtDecoder.withJwkSetUri(jwkSetUri).build();
        JwtAuthenticationProvider authenticationProvider = new JwtAuthenticationProvider(jwtDecoder);
        authenticationProvider.setJwtAuthenticationConverter(new JwtBearerTokenAuthenticationConverter());
        return authenticationProvider::authenticate;
    }

    // Mimic the default configuration for opaque token validation
    AuthenticationManager opaque() {
        String issuer = oAuth2ClientProperties.getProvider().get("okta").getIssuerUri();
        String introspectionUri = issuer + "/v1/introspect";

        // The default opaque token logic
        OAuth2ClientProperties.Registration oktaRegistration = oAuth2ClientProperties.getRegistration().get("okta");
        OpaqueTokenIntrospector introspectionClient = new NimbusOpaqueTokenIntrospector(
                introspectionUri,
                oktaRegistration.getClientId(),
                oktaRegistration.getClientSecret());
        return new OpaqueTokenAuthenticationProvider(introspectionClient)::authenticate;
    }
}
</code>   

 Better JWT Validation 

<p>Out of the box, Spring Security does minimal validation of the JWT because this is a vendor-specific detail. In addition to the standard JWT validation, Okta recommends validating the issuer and audience claims: <code>iss</code> and <code>aud</code>.</p>

<p>Update the above <code>jwt()</code> method to look like the following:</p>

   <code>AuthenticationManager jwt() {
    // this is the keys endpoint for okta
    String issuer = oAuth2ClientProperties.getProvider().get("okta").getIssuerUri();
    String jwkSetUri = issuer + "/v1/keys";

    NimbusJwtDecoder jwtDecoder = NimbusJwtDecoder.withJwkSetUri(jwkSetUri).build();

    // okta recommends validating the `iss` and `aud` claims
    // see: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/validate-access-tokens/java/overview/
    List&lt;OAuth2TokenValidator&lt;Jwt&gt;&gt; validators = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    validators.add(new JwtTimestampValidator());
    // Add validation of the issuer claim
    validators.add(new JwtIssuerValidator(issuer));
    validators.add(token -&gt; {
        Set&lt;String&gt; expectedAudience = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
        // Add validation of the audience claim
        expectedAudience.add("api://default");
        // For new Okta orgs, the default audience is `api://default`, 
        // if you have changed this from the default update this value
        return !Collections.disjoint(token.getAudience(), expectedAudience)
            ? OAuth2TokenValidatorResult.success()
            : OAuth2TokenValidatorResult.failure(new OAuth2Error(
                OAuth2ErrorCodes.INVALID_REQUEST,
                "This aud claim is not equal to the configured audience",
                "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-3.1"));
    });
    OAuth2TokenValidator&lt;Jwt&gt; validator = new DelegatingOAuth2TokenValidator&lt;&gt;(validators);
    jwtDecoder.setJwtValidator(validator);

    JwtAuthenticationProvider authenticationProvider = new JwtAuthenticationProvider(jwtDecoder);
    authenticationProvider.setJwtAuthenticationConverter(new JwtBearerTokenAuthenticationConverter());
    return authenticationProvider::authenticate;
}
</code>   

 Configure and Run Your OAuth 2.0 Application 

<p>We are in the home stretch; the last thing needed for our application is a little configuration.</p>

<p>Update your <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file to include the properties from the previous steps.</p>

   <code>spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.issuer-uri = {yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-id = {clientId}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-secret = {clientSecret}
</code>   

<p>Run the application on the command line:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Make a curl request to the server:</p>

   <code>curl localhost:8080/ -v
</code>   

<p>This will return something like:</p>

 <code>HTTP/1.1 401
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
</code> 

<p>A 401 is expected here as we did not provide an access token to the request. There are a few ways to get an access token—which option is right for you depends on where and how you access your REST application. Usually, another application is calling your REST API and that application already has an access token. For testing purposes, we will set up the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OIDC Debugger</a>.</p>

 Get a Token with the OIDC Debugger 

<p>Head over to <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">https://oidcdebugger.com/</a> and populate the form with the following values:</p>

 
   Authorize URI - <code>{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> 
   Client ID - <code>{clientId}</code> from the previous step 
   State - <code>this is a test</code> (this can be any value) 
   Response type - select token 
   Use defaults for all other fields 
 

<p>Press the Send Request button.</p>

<p>If you are using an incognito/private browser, this may prompt you to login again. Once the Success page loads, copy the Access token and create an environment variable:</p>

   <code>export TOKEN="&lt;your-access-token-here&gt;"
</code>   

<p>Now that you have a token, you can make another request to your REST API:</p>

   <code>curl localhost:8080/ -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

&gt; Hello!
</code>   

<p>Similarly, we can call the POST endpoint:</p>

   <code>curl -X POST -F 'message=there' localhost:8080/ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"

&gt; hello: there
</code>   

<p>We can perform a simple (unscientific) performance test using the <code>time</code> utility, by prefixing the above commands with <code>time</code>:</p>

   <code>time curl localhost:8080/ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
time curl -X POST -F 'message=there' localhost:8080/ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
</code>   

<p>This data isn’t a great benchmark as both the client and server are running on the same machine, but you can see the first one returned faster.</p>

 <code>0.00s user 0.01s system 65% cpu 0.013 total
0.00s user 0.01s system 4% cpu 0.210 total
</code> 

<p>NOTE: The increased CPU usage is caused by the JWT signature validation.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has supported Self-Sovereign Identity technologies such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials for several years. Now, a number of companies have been selected to work with DHS on implementing digital versions of identity documents such as the Permanent Resident Card (Green Card). In this use case, the issuer of Verifiable Credentials is USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services), and the verifier is TSA (Transportation Security Administration).</p>
 
 
<p>The overall objective is to make use of SSI technologies in order to increase security and efficiency as well as user control and transparency. Another key parameter of the project is that all technical components must be interoperable and based on standardized interfaces.</p>

<p>Enterprise wants to focus on the value identity can bring beyond verified access.</p>
<p>Whilst reducing identity management compliance risk and storage costs, more organizations are giving customers their identity ownership back. They are using intelligent agents, real-time data updates and new conferred trust verification methods to leverage (consented-for) identity data insights for cross-sell and up-sell - and to better service customers, employees and partners.</p>
 
 
<p>Distributed graph technology is enabling this. It guarantees privacy, anonymity and security – ensuring no unauthorized access to any user data. And it solves blockchain scalability, compliance and speed limitations – offering data compliance for both organizations and their stakeholders. A million graph vaults for a million customers – not one database or ledger block holding a million customer records.</p>
<p>We'll explain why intelligence-driven identity verification, sovereign identity ownership and compliant identity security built from the bottom up can offer enterprise the value-add they seek.</p>

 Crypto Stablecoin Report 12: USDT is additionally issued 690 million The use of stablecoins outside the cryptocurrency market <p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1415009638">https://bihu.com/article/1415009638</a></p><p>Original publish time: August 4,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   Last week, the market capitalization of major stablecoins increased by $723 million to $13.408&nbsp;billion.  The circulation of USDT increased by 690 million, with an additional issuance of 240 million on Ethereum and an additional issuance of 450 million on&nbsp;Tron.  The circulation of DAI increased by 30.85% from 286 million to 374&nbsp;million.  The data on the number of holding addresses, the number of active addresses, the number of transactions on the public blockchains, and the volume of transactions on the public blockchains are overall improving.  There is a downward trend in the proportion of the volume of transactions of USDT on the public blockchains.  Research by IMF believes that consumers will gradually switch to new payment methods that are more useful than existing payment&nbsp;methods.  Coinbase pointed out in the report that 41 of the best 50 universities have offered blockchain-related courses.  The G7 working group mentioned in an investigation report that stablecoins, regardless of their size, face legal and regulatory risks. Only by addressing these risks can the potential benefits of stablecoins be realized.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past week(July 25, 2020, ~ July 31, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market circulation of major stablecoins has reached $13.408 billion, and the market capitalization continues to&nbsp;grow.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>In the past week, the circulation of major stablecoins increased by 723 million. USDT was additionally issued four times, and the circulation increased by 690 million. Among them, two additional issuances occurs on Ethereum, totaling 240 million USDT, and two additional issuances occurs on Tron, totaling 450 million USDT. The circulation of PAX, HUSD and DAI increased by 7.46 million, 10.85 million and 88.08 million. The circulation of USDC, BUSD, TUSD, and GUSD decreased by 19.74 million, 18.85 million, 33.35 million, and&nbsp;690,000.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>With USDC accounting for half of the circulation of other major stablecoins other than USDT, and the proportion of DAI has increased significantly recently. In the past week, the circulation of DAI has increased by 30.85% from 286 million to 374 million. The proportion of DAI in stablecoins other than USDT increased from 13% to&nbsp;16.8%.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The proportion of USDT on Omni is getting lower and lower, and the proportion of USDT on Tron is getting higher. At present, the circulation of USDT on Omni, ETH, and Tron are 1.34 billion, 6.4 billion, and 3.45 billion, and their proportions are 11.93%, 57.19%, and&nbsp;30.87%.</p> The Number of Holding Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last week, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all increased and increased by&nbsp;31,774.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of USDT, USDC, PAX, TUSD, and DAI increased by 24,627, 3,555, 693, 321, and&nbsp;2,578.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last week increased by an average of 14.5% compared to the previous&nbsp;week.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of&nbsp;11.1%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last week increased by an average of 55.4%. On July 27th and 28th, the transfer amount of USDT on Ethereum was relatively high. In the past two days, USDT was additionally issued 120 million on Ethereum each day. There is a downward trend in the proportion of the volume of transactions of USDT on the public blockchains.</p> 2. The use of stablecoins outside the cryptocurrency market <p>Stablecoin is an effective medium of exchange for cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have very high volatility, and investors can use stablecoins to hedge. Holding a certain percentage of stablecoins in the investment portfolio can effectively reduce the overall risk. The role of stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market is getting bigger and bigger, and their proportion in the volume of transactions of cryptocurrency is also getting higher. At the same time, stablecoins are being used more and more outside the cryptocurrency market. In this report, we will introduce the use of stablecoins outside the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Research by IMF believes that consumers will gradually switch to new payment methods that are more useful than existing payment methods.<br>The key to the use of stablecoins outside the cryptocurrency market is still to be reflected in ‘usefulness’. For example, it can reduce payment fees, improve payment efficiency, and eliminate payment friction. To this end, we have summarized the following points of demand for stablecoins from people outside the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Cross-border transfers. Traditional banks often need a few days to process cross-border transfers. Stablecoins have broadened global remittance channels. Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in the Bitcoin white paper that Bitcoin is a point-to-point payment tool. In the past few years, some companies did use Bitcoin for cross-border transfers. But now, this usage scenario has been replaced by stablecoins, and the property of value stability make stablecoins more suitable for transfers.</p><p>Settlement tool. JPM Coin issued by JP Morgan Chase is a representative of stablecoin for settlement. Customers deposit funds in the designated account of JPMorgan Chase and receive the same amount of JPM Coin. JPM Coin is a DDR generated by JPMorgan Chase for fund settlement. It is just a settlement tool and can only be used within the JPMorgan Chase banking&nbsp;system.</p><p>Payment instrument. Fees are lower when using stablecoins to pay, Terra is a relatively well-known stablecoin payment project with more than 1.8 million users. Terra is more advantageous for large payments.</p><p>Global uncertainty drives up the demand for stablecoins. In April of this year, Coinbase issued a document stating that the transfer activities on the stablecoin blockchains have increased and the market capitalization has increased. The stablecoin is rising rapidly, and global businesses may soon require the intervention of stablecoins. When the world is facing an economic crisis, it needs a haven, and the stablecoins anchored to the US dollar is a&nbsp;choice.</p><p>Hedging the risk of legal currency. In some countries where there is a greater risk of devaluation of legal currency, it is necessary to hold a certain proportion of foreign exchange, and stablecoin is a tool that is easier to obtain and easier to&nbsp;keep.</p><p>Low barriers to use. It is relatively simple to buy USDT from OTC channels, while payment with PayPal requires a VISA/Master credit card. As of the third quarter of 2018, China has 5.31 bank cards per capita and 0.47 credit cards per capita nationwide. People who hold credit cards often have multiple credit cards. Most Chinese people do not have a credit card and cannot use&nbsp;PayPal.</p><p>Gray and illegal transactions. Due to lack of supervision, various illegal websites support the use of cryptocurrencies including stablecoins for payment. The smart contract address 0x8a91c9a16cd62693649d80afa85a09dbbdcb8508 is marked as MMM BSC on Etherscan. MMM is a famous MLM fraud organization in the world. In MMM BSC, the core gameplay is to invite the following users, and you can get benefits from the following 1st-51st following users. In May, the number of daily transactions of PAX for this contract address accounted for 40–50% of the total number of transactions of&nbsp;PAX.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin Metrics, Etherscan</p><p>The concept of ‘stablecoin’, in addition to being known to everyone in the cryptocurrency market, has also been spread wildly outside the cryptocurrency market through certain iconic events in the past two&nbsp;years.</p><p>Facebook announced the launch of Libra. In December 2019, the monthly active users of Facebook family products (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp) were 2.9 billion, and 2.3 billion people used them every day. The influence of Libra is so great that Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, also attended a Hearing in the United States Congress. As a Facebook user, you may know that there are products such as stablecoins.</p><p>The development of CBDC. China, Japan, and the EU are all studying CBDC, and they will inevitably popularize digital currencies with people before they are officially put into use. For example, at the end of last year, Chinese state leaders mentioned CBDC many times in their speeches and Mu Changchun gave a lecture on CBDC and Libra. CBDC is a kind of stablecoin. The popularity of CBDC will make some ordinary people know about stablecoin.</p><p>The popularization of blockchain knowledge. According to the Coinbase report, 41 of the best 50 universities have offered blockchain-related courses. People of Generation Z may learn about Bitcoin directly from the school. Blockchain courses will talk about Bitcoin and it is possible to recognize stablecoins from this. After speaking on October 24 last year, many people began to take the initiative to learn about blockchain. Besides, the attention of some celebrities outside the cryptocurrency market has also led to the spread of blockchain knowledge. For example, J.K. Rowling retweeted a tweet and asked ‘I don’t understand Bitcoin, please explain it to me’ so that her fans outside the cryptocurrency market will learn about Bitcoin and the blockchain.</p><p>Source: Coincase&nbsp;reports</p><p>For merchants, there is no high threshold for using stablecoins to deposit and withdraw funds. Almost all Exchanges support USDT, and more and more OTC transactions are opened. Even if the source is not completely legal, it usually does not attract much attention, and privacy can also be achieved through tokens mixing operations. If you want to withdraw through Exchanges completely legally, you can also exchange USDT for assets supported by compliant Exchanges such as BTC in other places, and sell them on compliant Exchanges that supports the legal currency.</p><p>The G7 working group mentioned in Investigating the impact of global stabecoins report that only by addressing the risks can the potential benefits of stablecoins be realized. Regardless of the size of stablecoins, they face the following legal and regulatory risks:</p>  Certainty of&nbsp;law  Sound governance mechanisms, including investment rules and price stability mechanisms  Money laundering, terrorist financing and other forms of illegal financing  Security, efficiency and integrity of payment&nbsp;systems  Network security and resilient operations  Data privacy, protection, and portability  Protection of consumers/investors  Tax compliance  <p>It can be seen that stablecoin is indeed a useful payment tool, and its use outside the cryptocurrency market is increasing. It is believed that with the improvement of laws and regulations, the use of stablecoins will be popularized.</p> 3. Questions of&nbsp;Readers <p>Question 1. The market capitalization of stablecoins increased by $2.4 billion in the first quarter and $3.8 billion in the second quarter. Why is the stablecoin market developing so fast? Where does the market demand mainly come&nbsp;from?</p><p>Answer: In both centralized and decentralized markets, the demand for stablecoins is growing across the board. USDT and DAI are representatives of stablecoins in the centralized market and the decentralized market. Their premium and additional issuance can reflect the current growth in demand for stablecoins. After March 1, the legal currency premium of USDT on Huobi OTC reached 10%, and then stabilized at 5% for a period of time. Since this time node, USDT has been additionally issued in large numbers, and these tokens have mainly flowed to centralized Exchanges. When the amount of additional issuance of USDT is large enough, USDT begins to experience a negative premium in the legal currency area. In recent months, with the popularity of DeFi, stablecoins have been used more and more in DeFi, and Maker has also added USDC as collateral for DAI. DAI is the stablecoin most commonly used in DeFi. From the beginning of May to the present, the circulating market capitalization of DAI has increased from $100 million to $380 million. We can also see the recent increase in the proportion of the volume of transactions of DAI in stablecoins.</p><p>Question 2. DAI represents the infrastructure of DeFi and USDT represents the infrastructure of CeFi. Does the world need DAI or USDT? In other words: Does the world need DeFi or&nbsp;CeFi?</p><p>Answer: The world needs both the centralized infrastructure and the decentralized infrastructure, and both have their own advantages. At the current stage, decentralization may mean innovation, and may have higher efficiency, allowing users to better control their own property, data and other rights. However, the current centralized infrastructure has not been popularized. Even though DeFi is very popular now, there are not many people actually participating in DeFi. The barriers for users to participate in decentralized infrastructure are still high. However, centralized infrastructure can provide protection for our lives, such as banking, insurance, etc. These centralized institutions may exist at any&nbsp;stage.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

  <p>Many B2B technology and service providers approach go-to-market strategy in silos. First, they develop the product and identify the market segmentation, then they create sales and marketing strategies. But buyers increasingly expect more. They seek providers that offer the product they want through their desired purchase experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand and meet these needs, sales, product marketing and product management must work together to take a more complete view of their go-to-market strategies. Product marketing is in the right spot to take the lead on this process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36456"]</p>
<p>“Greater integration places a premium on internal collaboration, customer experience and data-driven decision making,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/80790">Mark Stanyer</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner. “These are all disciplines that play to the strengths of experienced product marketers.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, according to Stanyer, many providers take baby steps when it comes to taking a unified approach. What’s getting in the way?</p>

 Understand the role of product marketing in technology-centric and sales-centric cultures 
<p>Culture is often the single biggest factor in determining the actual roles and responsibilities of product marketing, which can vary widely between providers. This makes it difficult to align sales, marketing and product management and execute a common go-to-market strategy, especially when company culture favors a specific role.&nbsp;</p>
 Technology-centric culture 
<p>Here, the center of power is the product development organization. Product marketers are often viewed as tactical rather than strategic, mandated to focus on creating collateral, presentations, and sales enablement tools, and staffing booths at tradeshows. They have limited input into enhancements, roadmaps, creating new solutions and launches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sales models are often product-led, where positioning and differentiation are based on technological superiority. This approach tends to work better when selling to IT as opposed to line-of-business buyers because the requirements are generally much more technical.</p>
 Sales-centric culture 
<p>Product marketing may have an even more limited role in a sales-centric culture. In this model, product marketing focuses on demand and lead generation, and creates some sales enablement tools. Because salespeople are the primary interface to the market, customer needs drive the product strategy. However, the market-led sales model often fails to be truly customer-centric, delivering what customers ask for rather than what they need.</p>
<p>As product marketing roles center on generating demand, they end up being filled by individuals without critical product marketing skills like storytelling, market analysis and customer engagement. There also tends to be a fairly frequent pivoting of storyline and product developments as sales chases big deals with specific requirements, thus confusing the message to the market.</p>
<p>Gartner has observed that this lack of expertise around messaging and positioning causes significant issues. Buyers can easily look elsewhere for alternatives more clearly targeted to their specific needs.</p>

<p>To tackle these issues, make product marketing more strategic and expand its responsibility. Here are four actions product marketers can take to coordinate across teams and facilitate buyer-centricity into the go-to-market strategy.</p>
 1. Create consistent, compelling stories to drive high-performing content 
<p>It takes more than writing expertise or intimate knowledge of the product to develop effective messaging.</p>
<p>“The most compelling marketing stories are often the ones that are driven by product marketers, particularly those practitioners who have access to customers, prospects and salespeople,” Stanyer says.</p>
<p>Leverage your acute understanding of the market, the products, the customers and the competition to create a clear marketing story and a unique value proposition.&nbsp;</p>
 2. Focus on down-the-funnel conversions 
<p>Do more than drive activity at the top of the sales funnel. Ensure that leads are likely to convert into revenue and happy customers. By handing off responsibility for demand and lead generation, you can focus your expertise and knowledge on <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/use-multichannel-marketing-to-generate-more-demand/">driving conversions</a>.</p>
 3. Become a key contributor to product strategy 
<p>Get more involved in gathering and prioritizing feature and enhancement requests. But don’t simply provide a laundry list of feedback to product management and product development. Frame the argument in terms of how it advances market leadership, offers competitive advantage and provides significant revenue opportunity.</p>
 4. Coordinate cross-team participation in key activities 
<p>Sales, marketing and product management should all be involved in segmentation, win/loss analysis and sales enablement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, although product marketing might have direct responsibility for win/loss analysis, sales has to be involved in the design and implementation of the process, and product management has to be committed to using the data to inform roadmap decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s very tempting to revert to cultural norms. Product marketing can use data to drive consensus and smart decision making, but cannot impose itself on others. It must demonstrate how it will create value across teams by, for example, becoming a “trusted” advisor to product management. Additionally, clear organizational ownership of specific objectives must be defined so each team knows each other’s responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Arm processors have been in the news lately, and it’s causing confusion and worries about processor performance for some folks. After Apple announced its plan to switch to Arm-based processors, I heard people (incorrectly!) speculating the performance would be similar to a Raspberry Pi. Java on Arm is nothing new, but we are seeing increased Arm investment from cloud vendors. Amazon recently updated its Arm offerings, and Microsoft is working on porting the JVM to Arm64 for Windows (no doubt for future Azure support).</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll share the Java benchmarks I took on various AWS EC2 instances, and, just for fun, on my laptop.</p>
 
   Amazon a1.large (ARMv8 Cortex-A72, 2 Cores, 4GB RAM) 
   Amazon m6g.medium (ARMv8 Neoverse-N1, 1 Core, 4GB RAM) 
   Amazon t3.medium (Intel Xeon Platinum 8259CL, 1 Core / 2 Threads, 4GB RAM) 
   Apple MacBook Pro (Intel i9 2.4GHz, 8 Core / 16 Threads, 64GB RAM) 
 

<p>NOTE: The Arm trademark was previously written in all caps, “ARM”, but is now referred to as “Arm”.</p>

 A Note About Benchmarks 

<p>Benchmarks are just numbers. They serve as a starting point when you are figuring out the compute power you need for your own application. All applications are different, your workload will likely have different characteristics than these benchmarks. The only way to figure out how your application will perform on a different system is to try to test it out!</p>

<p>For these tests, I tried to compare three different AWS offerings that are similar and have comparable on-demand pricing. There are some differences though. The a1.large instance is from Amazon’s first-generation ARM processors, whereas the m6g.medium is the current Arm series, and the t3.medium is an Intel x86_64 processor.</p>

<p>To keep things consistent, all of these benchmarks used Amazon Corretto 11.0.7.10.1 JVM, with the default GC configuration, and with the tests run through <a href="https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/">Phoronix Test Suite</a>.</p>

 The Benchmarks! 

<p>In almost all cases the a1.large instance performed the worst, and my MacBook the best. This isn’t particularly interesting, so I’m going to focus my analysis on the differences between the t3.medium and the m6g.medium instances.</p>

 Machine Learning 

<p>First up, we have a test based on Apache Spark’s MLlib which uses a random forest algorithm.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this test, the t3.medium is 15% faster than the m6g.medium.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Spark alternating least squares (ALS) benchmark is one of the few tests where both the Arm servers outpaced the t3.medium.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the Spark Naive Bayes algorithm test, the m6g.medium was 8% faster than the t3.</p>

<p>Winner: m6g.medium. This was almost too close to call, but in the words of Meat Loaf, “Two Out of Three Ain’t Bad.”</p>

 

 

 Processing Power 

<p>This batch of benchmarks focus on compute-heavy operations. The first two use functional “actors” programing from the <a href="https://shamsimam.github.io/papers/2014-agere-savina.pdf">Savina Actors Benchmark Suite</a>, and the rest focus on math-based operations.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This first test shows the t3.medium has a 20% lead over the m6g.medium.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Interestingly, in this test, both the m6g and the t3 perform about the same.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Spark PageRank test shows the m6g performs 65% faster than the t3.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The m6g also outperformed the t3 by 22% when calculating Fourier transforms.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The t3.medium narrowly wins the sparse matrix multiplication tests by 3%.</p>

<p>Winner: m6g.medium</p>

 Threads and Concurrency 
<p>For many of us building web applications, concurrency is critical as your web server handles many different requests at once. This set of tests highlights the differences between the number of vCPUs in each system—the m6g.medium only has one, the a1.large and the t3.medium both have two, and the MacBook Pro has 16.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This first test uses two threads, so naturally, the t3 is about 34% faster than the m6g.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Twitter HTTP Finagle test starts a small HTTP server and creates a number of clients equal to the number of vCPU cores plus one. The HTTP server has the number of CPUs*2.  This is going to create a bit of thread contention, which likely explains these results.</p>

<p>Winner: t3.medium (This one was not a fair fight.)</p>

 Pricing 

<p>At the end of the day, which system you pick may come down to a balance of price and performance. The on-demand pricing for an m6g instance (medium, large, xlarge, 2xlarge) was about 8.5% cheaper than the corresponding t3 instance.</p>

<p>Winner: m6g.medium</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>The overall winner of these benchmarks is my MacBook Pro! Joking aside, the difference between Amazon’s second-generation Arm processors and the equivalent Intel processor wasn’t what I expected when I started writing this post. If I had to pick between t3.medium and the m6g.medium, I’d say the overall winner of this showdown is the Arm m6g.medium.</p>

<p>As I mentioned at the start of this post, all of this info needs to be taken with a grain of salt.  Your Java applications will perform differently than these benchmarks, you will need to make your own conclusion to figure out if switching to Arm is right for you. The biggest challenge in switching from x86_64 to Arm64 is making sure your native dependencies are available—but this is much less of an issue nowadays as both Java and Linux distros have been supporting Arm for years.</p>

As everyone already knows by now, the big news of the week was the antitrust hearing in DC, attended by the Big 4 tech CEOs of Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple. As is typical, these hearings are hardly conclusive. YouTube: House Judiciary<p>What’s atypical especially in our current political environment is to have something both sides can actually get together on and while they often came from different angles, there’s a general consensus that this conversation is super necessary.</p><p>And it’s the type of conversation that will help define competition, innovation, and even consumer preferences in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>Let’s be clear. None of these companies are going anywhere. That was made readily apparent by <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-624bc8f7-fb1f-4c4e-9d39-5cf041af45a1.html">their earnings report the day after</a> (Google’s lackluster showing notwithstanding).</p><p>And frankly, they shouldn’t.</p><p>But this is certainly the beginning of a long term reorganization of a technological landscape. It might happen because of regulators taking bold action. It might happen because of consumers shifting their expectations and preferences. It might happen because of innovation emerging elsewhere. Whatever the case, it’s happening. It’s also necessary. We’ve learned plenty from this last cycle of Big Tech. We’ve gotten a lot out of it. And we’ve also learned some important lessons about the double edged sword that is progress.</p><p>So we also know we can do a little bit&nbsp;better.</p><p>Anyway, here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-e24f4690-028f-4f39-9ba3-af1019b33b54.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>House lawmakers aired an enormous array of grievances with the CEOs of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple Wednesday, throwing everything in their arsenal at four of the most powerful men in the world for six hours, Axios’ Kyle Daly&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Quick take: The antitrust hearing, which wandered far afield at times, didn’t nail a case that these companies are harmful monopolies. But the representatives succeeded in wringing some surprising admissions from the executives about how they wield their market power, providing ammunition for regulators now conducting investigations — and possibly a spur for Congress to strengthen antitrust law for the digital&nbsp;era.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook: Panel Democrats said the social network’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were plainly anticompetitive — that the company made the deals to stop Instagram from becoming a competitor to its main platform and WhatsApp from becoming a competitor to its messaging service. (CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook had no idea the two would become such juggernauts when it bought&nbsp;them.)</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>All the companies, subcommittee chair David Cicilline said, have become bottlenecks for distribution, using their chokehold over data to surveil potential competitors and their control over technologies to extend their&nbsp;power.</blockquote><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/scoring-the-tech-ceos-the-informations-tech-briefing">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>Perhaps the most damning episodes of the hearing involved disclosure of internal company emails that appeared to support the politicians’ contention that the big tech companies used their size to squash competitors. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who represents the Seattle area, said Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom confided in an investor that he was worried Facebook would go into “destroy mode” if Instagram didn’t sell. — Martin&nbsp;Peers</blockquote><p>Cool NYU guy Scott Galloway provided <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/fire-fawning">a preview of events that outlined the sheer size of the entities that we’re dealing with</a> while also providing (much better) hypothetical questions to grill our favorite tech&nbsp;bosses.</p><p>Check out these&nbsp;charts:</p><p>Likewise, new efforts to take on the titans has&nbsp;waned:</p><p>Of course, on the surface, it’s pretty clear that Tech has gotten monstrously Big, while crowding out new entrants with their sheer scale — sometimes underhandedly.</p><p>But maybe the positive slant is also just how much tech has transformed our economy and our lives in the last few decades — that seismic shift from the physical to the digital, data now overtaking Oil as the greatest modern value proposition.</p><p>To put it plainly, this is well and truly the tech&nbsp;era.</p><p>The difference here though — say, compared to a time when the biggest companies were sucking petroleum out of the ground is that tech is malleable. There are constraints in the physical world that govern how things are played. In the digital one, there’s a lot more room to define the rules of the&nbsp;game.</p><p>That’s what this next chapter will be all about. How do we rewrite those rules in a way that optimizes incentives and balances power for individuals and communities — from both a regulatory and platform perspective.

					 <p>In response to COVID-19, businesses and industries around the world have had to reduce spending and cut costs in order to continue operating. This has led to businesses being reluctant to hire new employees and unfortunately having to lay off employees. Recent college graduates and youth are having to navigate this difficult economic situation as they search for employment.</p><p><br>In Africa, these difficulties are magnified by the pre-existing high unemployment rate among African youth. <a href="https://www.yoma.africa">Yoma</a> is a platform that uses verifiable credentials to help African youth build up their digital CV and find employment that matches their skills. Although Yoma and its benefits were relevant and needed before the pandemic, the economic impacts of COVID-19 have only increased the platform’s effectiveness for African youth.</p><p><br>Below is the interview we had with Lohan Spies, the individual responsible for integrating verifiable credentials into the Yoma platform using the Trinsic platform.</p>

					 <p>I have been a co-founder of various cybersecurity and blockchain-based ventures in digital identity and personal data protection. I am also the Chair of the Sovrin Steward Council and an ex-officio Board of Trustees member at the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>. My passion and motivation are to leverage the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a> stack to develop solutions that will have a profound and lasting impact on humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My latest venture, <a href="http://www.didx.co.za/">DIDx</a>, focuses on SSI and is a <a href="https://sovrin.org/stewards/">Founding Steward</a> of the Sovrin Network and a <a href="https://trustoverip.org/members/">Founding Contributing Member</a> of the Trust over IP Foundation.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 What is Yoma? What is its purpose? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Globally, one out of five young people between the ages of 15-24 live in Africa and are largely underemployed or at worst, are unemployed. According to the African Development Bank, youth unemployment occurs at a rate that is more than twice of that for adults in most African countries. Many of these individuals are unable to secure jobs due to a lack of education, experience, and financial means. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of decent job opportunities that could use employees to their full potential in most African countries. Skills needed in Sub-Saharan Africa are shifting, and the region’s educational system is underprepared, resulting in a skills mismatch between the skills being acquired and those required by companies.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Our aim is to unlock the youth’s potential across the African continent and beyond by integrating privacy-preserving personalized learning pathways across the <a href="https://www.yoma.africa/">Yoma platform</a>. Yoma, a youthagency marketplace, aims to use AI to match youth with individualized learning pathways, impact tasks to positively contribute to their community, and jobs based on their aspirations and psychometric profile. Youth are incentivized to participate via a digital token that can be redeemed in a physical or intellectual marketplace. Each individual youth has a digital identity wallet that contains their engagement and certificates, thus building a digital CV that is verifiable through blockchain technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The Yoma marketplace brings together youth, NGOs/grassroots organizations, governmental youth agencies, social impact investors, corporate, SMEs, educational providers, and more. Yoma is supported by a strong group of collaborators such as <a href="https://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a>, <a href="https://www.didx.co.za/">DIDx</a>, <a href="https://rlabs.org/">Rlabs</a> and <a href="https://app.cartedo.com/">Cartedo</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A brief explainer video of Yoma can be found below.</p>

					 <p>The Yoma concept was relevant prior to the COVID-19 crisis but given the disproportionate impact on young people’s learning and employment, there is an even greater need for a solution like Yoma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the pathways into the Yoma platform was via a COVID-19 <a href="https://app.cartedo.com/project/8/covid-19-challenge">UNICEF innovation challenge</a> implemented by <a href="https://app.cartedo.com/sign_in">Cartedo</a>, an online design thinking platform. Users who completed the challenge were redirected to the Yoma platform to acquire their certificate of completion. This UNICEF innovation challenge aimed to support youth agency during the COVID-19 pandemic through critical soft-skill development and by identifying high potential individuals whose ideas could be supported and developed further. The core goals for the challenge were to: 1) Give youth a voice, 2) Provide access to credible information, 3) Drive awareness around COVID-19, 4) Develop critical soft skills and future-readiness, and 5) Enhance employability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge was well received with 85,000 youth showing interest, 35,000 starting the challenge, and 9,500 who completed the challenge. For all youth that completed the challenge, Yoma issued a verifiable credential as a proof of completion and as the first verifiable credential added to their verifiable, digital CV.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An explainer video of the UNICEF COVID-19 challenge can be found below.</p>

					 <p>Trinsic provides a full-stack self-sovereign identity platform leveraged by Yoma. Yoma currently makes use of the cloud wallet and credentialing APIs to provide youth with digital identity wallets into which Yoma issues verifiable credentials to develop their verifiable, digital CVs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The speed of implementation required by Yoma made Trinsic a preferred choice as most of the hard work is already done and ready for consumption. Future iterations of the Yoma ToIP stack implementation will be focused on a blended approach where Trinsic and open-source SSI components will be made available to Yoma ecosystem partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We decided to develop on the Sovrin Network as it was purpose-built to solve the pressing problem of SSI. DIDx has a long history of working with Sovrin, and it was the obvious and preferred choice of technology for us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That said, Yoma might spin up its own Indy network in the future, and ongoing analysis will contribute to our long-term strategy and decision-making. For the foreseeable future, Trinsic and the Sovrin Network are a part of our technology stack.</p>

					 <p>In addition to our success with the UNICEF COVID-19 challenge, Yoma recently won the joint <a href="https://toolkit-digitalisierung.de/en/smartdevelopmenthack/winners/">EU/BMZ #SmartDevelopmentHack</a> to accelerate the development and adoption of Yoma with <a href="https://www.atingi.org/">atingi</a> as an ecosystem partner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Future challenges are already planned and will soon launch on Yoma, spanning multiple countries with increased access to opportunities for youth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Given the COVID-19 crisis, the concept and value of the Yoma platform is more relevant than ever, and implementation must be accelerated. Therefore, as part of the #SmartDevelopmentHack, the Yoma initiative has committed to reaching 1.5M youth within 24 months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(End of interview)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are an African youth interested in building your digital CV through the Yoma platform, <a href="https://app.yoma.africa/auth/create-account">get started</a> by creating a Yoma account.

<p>When e-cigarettes first hit the market, they were touted as a less nicotine intensive alternative to cigarettes and as a way to help those struggling to quit to make the leap. As with any new popular innovation, opportunist players entered the field, bringing along with them counterfeit products and youth-targeted marketing tactics. <br><br>According to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44295336">BBC and Euromonitor</a>, the number of vapers increased from seven million in 2011 to 41 million by 2018. They project that this number will grow to 55 million globally by next year. As the world leader in the tobacco sector, every major tobacco company utilizes <a href="https://www.hauni.com/de/home/">Hauni</a> equipment, and as they watched the market’s exponential growth materialize before their eyes, they chose to use their position within the industry to push for stricter guidelines and safer products to protect minors.</p>



 Hauni for consumer safety 



<p>The Hauni Vaping Technologies team saw a few key issues happening in the space, including the refilling of pods with illegal liquids, the use of flavors that appealed to younger people, and the teen vaping epidemic in the US. Dangerous open tank systems and faulty devices were the cause of over 2,000 hospitalizations last year, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>



<p>“The industry’s big players are serious about consumer safety but because it’s a regulated product, it’s difficult to solve the problem,” says Dr. Joseph Capone, the Digital Program Manager. “We said ‘Look, if we’re going to do e-cigarettes then we’re going to do right.’ That’s when we reached out to Authenteq about integrating into the app, to give users the ability to not only control their vaping experience but also to give us the ability to secure the whole experience.”</p>



 Nicotine industry, innovation, and age verification 



<p>Nicotine is classified as a tobacco substance meaning that e-cigarette manufacturers have to go through the whole battery of tests, both lengthy and expensive, that pharmaceutical companies do because nicotine is technically a pharmaceutical product.</p>



<blockquote><p>“That’s one reason why there’s been little innovation in the sector since 2014. The products on the market today are pretty much all the same because they base themselves on an approved product. It’s very difficult to get approval for a new product and it’s very expensive bringing this kind of product to market because you need approval in every country.” </p>– Dr. Joseph Capone, Digital Program Manager at Hauni&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>In addition to building an automatable, fully digital, and less harmful product, the Vaping Technologies team has been leveraging data to create in-depth profiles. They analyze 40 different data points per puff. Some of these data points, including preheat time, energy time, and total voltage are designed to enhance the user’s vaping experience. Other data points like pressure and puff duration are crucial to restricting minors from using the products. A female, or younger user, inhales less deeply than a heavy smoker or a healthy man, according to their data. By comparing and analyzing these different interdependent data points, unique user profiles are created as are generational unique profiles.</p>



<p>“Teenagers are really smoking because they think it’s cool, not because they need a nicotine hit,” says Capone. “Teenagers vape much differently than somebody who was a smoker and has switched to vaping. They are doing what is called grazing. Their puff count or frequency is very high, and the puff volume is very small.”</p>



<p>“A smoker who has switched and is an adult will puff five to seven seconds, take a 30-second break, and then take another five to seven second inhale,” he continues. “This puff topography is very unique to each person but also unique for different segments. Of course, it’s all statistical but if we’re 92 percent accurate, it’s better to turn off a device when we suspect it’s a teenager then to allow a teenager to vape.”</p>



 Leading the change to protect minors 



<p>The legislation that has been enacted thus far focuses solely on the purchasing of e-cigarettes, but Capone and his team think that usage must be monitored and legislated in order to truly protect minors. As more consumers look to purchase these devices online, imbuing age, and identity at the very beginning of the process is the only way to ensure this. <a href="https://authenteq.com/authenteq-identity-verification/">Authenteq’s age and identity verification</a> are integrated into their app for precisely this reason, meaning that a user must verify themselves before a device can even be activated. Once verified, if the device usage deviates from the user’s profile, a spot ID check is mandated. If the identity does not match the ID used to activate the device, it is disabled.</p>



<p>Authenteq and Hauni’s Vaping Technologies team are also looking at further protection measures, including the possibility of incorporating lip imprints into the user profile.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“A lip print is just like a fingerprint. It’s unique to every person and it never changes throughout your entire life. If we could manage to map a groove pattern, a lip signature could be created so that only that person who activates it can ever use it.” </p>– Dr. Joseph Capone, Digital Program Manager at Hauni&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>Capone sees the progress they’ve made as applicable to other industries as well. The technology they’ve built is not exclusive to vaping liquids and could be implemented for asthma inhalers and CBD or THC devices used for therapeutic purposes. Identity verification can validate users, but also match users to the proper prescriptions. In addition to protecting minors and preventing misuse, there is also general risk mitigation in these methods.</p>



<blockquote><p>“A lot of organizations have no idea what is possible today in the areas of identity and age verification, they don’t realize what is possible with data now to identify early indicators of substance abuse or addiction. The whole vice sector needs more information about technologies that are available.”</p>– Dr. Joseph Capone, Digital Program Manager at Hauni&nbsp;</blockquote>

   To better protect employees, an organization decides to distribute wearables among workers when they return to the office following COVID-19. The devices measure proximity to other wearables and emit a small audio signal as a reminder to social distance.

  <p>To better protect employees, an organization decides to distribute wearables among workers when they return to the office following COVID-19. The devices measure proximity to other wearables and emit a small audio signal as a reminder to social distance.</p>
<p>The wearables don’t collect or process any data, and they don’t track where the wearer has been. The result is a wearable that enables the employer to provide employees both safety and privacy without having to trade one for the other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trade-off would be, how much do we invade privacy to offer a certain level of safety?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While balancing safety, productivity and privacy — three goals seemingly at odds — creates dilemmas for employers, there are ways to achieve all three without trade-offs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Take privacy versus safety for example,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/61755">Bart Willemsen</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “The trade-off would be, how much do we invade privacy to offer a certain level of safety? It's making a concession between both values. It would actually be better to try and fulfill both values.”</p>

<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>As employees return to work, employers are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-for-ethical-data-collection-during-pandemics/">collecting more data</a> to ensure both safety and productivity. By taking a risk-based approach, which considers what data is being collected and how it’s being used, organizations can<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-technology-can-curb-the-spread-of-covid-19/"> protect employees</a> while managing privacy risk.</p>
<p>“The higher the risk, the more important it is to justify that a particular solution is indeed balanced and proportional to the risk we are assessing,” says Willemsen.</p>
<p>Here are six principles to guide risk-based employee data collection.</p>
 No. 1: Purposeful processing 
<p>If you do decide to collect data, make sure it has a predefined purpose. Once data has fulfilled its purpose, there’s no reason to keep collecting and storing it. Removing data can also lead to significant cost savings for the organization when it comes to storage.</p>
 No. 2: Proportionality 
<p>Default to the least invasive measure possible to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-security-areas-to-focus-on-during-covid-19/">satisfy your goals</a>. Once a measure becomes disproportional to the risk or the purpose can be achieved in a different way, remove it.</p>
 No. 3: Subsidiarity 
<p>Ask yourself, what amount of data is enough? Can you achieve the same purpose with less personal data or without processing personal data at all? Only collect the minimum amount necessary.&nbsp;</p>

 No. 4: Transparency 
<p>Don't do anything in the dark. Be abundantly clear to staff what data you collect, for what purposes and who has access to it.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/are-your-new-remote-workers-visible-to-security-operations/">Are Your New Remote Workers Visible to Security Operations?</a></p>
 No. 5: Mandatory or not 
<p>Apply measures equally for all staff to prevent discrimination and protect autonomy.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 6: Risk-based 
<p>Make decisions in light of the risks you are trying to mitigate, and acknowledge that decisions are subject to change. Don’t hesitate to retrace steps taken early and adjust accordingly as things change.</p>
<p>When it comes to returning to the workplace, every decision leads to a certain risk. Following these principles equips employers to assess and mitigate privacy risk by making decisions based on the current situation and continue to measure the relevance of decisions as conditions change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>MITRE recently published the detailed results of their second round of tests. This test pitted APT29 malware and methods against <a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/evaluations.html?round=APT29" title="Cybersecurity Vendors">21 cybersecurity vendors</a>. The MITRE testing is an excellent benchmark for comprehensively exercising Endpoint Protection (EPP) and Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR) tools in real-world scenarios where organizations find themselves under attack by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). MITRE describes the environments, methodology, and operation flow of their testing regime in great detail <a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/APT29/" title="Mitre testing regime">here</a>. The raw results are available for review, and they have created a <a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/data_analysis_tool.html" title="data analysis">tool to help with data analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the participating vendors have analyzed and posted their interpretations of this latest round of testing. In general, each vendor’s internal analysis tends to focus on their areas in which they do well. In this article, we will call out the most serious of the commonly missed detections of specific procedures in the framework.</p>
<p>There was a wide range in the success rates experienced by vendors, with higher success rates equating to low values for missed detections. As expected, there is a fairly strong correlation between a vendor’s product having specific techniques for detection of procedures and steps in the ATT&amp;CK framework and catching a would-be malicious actor utilizing those actions.</p>
<p>The ATT&amp;CK framework features a matrix of 11 tactics and 171 techniques that adversaries use to conduct a cyber-attack. MITRE has just released an <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/" title="MITRE update">updated version</a> of the ATT&amp;CK framework which contains sub-techniques. The techniques and sub-techniques depicted generally relate to application or system level API and/or procedure calls. Legitimate software including operating systems use these API and system calls to accomplish tasks on behalf of users. This is what makes the job of anti-malware and other security tools difficult: they must distinguish the “intent” of the calling code. For example, encrypting files is most often a legitimate operation to protect data. However, ransomware also attempts to encrypt files. How does anti-malware decide to allow some operations to proceed and stop others?</p>
 What is the code’s intent? 
<p>Intent can be discerned by context. Context can be probabilistically inferred by looking at the calling process: which user account launched it, how long has it been running, have other processes injected it, what other calls precede or follow it in the queue, etc. Security vendors build detection models using analysis of code and memory enhanced by Machine Learning (ML) to make these kinds of determinations. Security tools are also informed by collections of threat intelligence and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).</p>
<p>The following list of techniques are those which many vendor products were not able to detect in the latest round of MITRE testing, and those which we consider the most consequential if exploited.</p>
 Missed detections 
 
 Sandbox evasion techniques such as checking BIOS, manufacturer, model, version 
 Attempts to use PowerShell to get system, domain, logged-on username, running processes, anti-malware presence, and endpoint firewall status 
 Reconnaissance of lateral assets using PowerShell 
 Manipulation of access token for PowerShell 
 Enumerating files in directories commonly used for user data; enumerating media files 
 Enumerating registry keys 
 Capturing screenshots and clipboard contents (lesser instances of keylogging) 
 Decryption of Chrome browser username and password databases 
 Creation of pre-exfiltration staging directories 
 Simple attempts to encrypt C2 traffic using standard crypto techniques 
 Reading user files, while connected to C2 
 Encryption of user data files 
 Exfiltration over non-standard TCP ports 
 Exfiltration over HTTPS 
 Establishment of persistence via javavmtsup 
 
 Recommendations for vendors 
<p>Threat actors are constantly improving and adapting to innovations in security products. Thus, security products with deficiencies in detecting items on the preceding list should focus on:</p>
 
 Anti-evasion: malware detonation sandboxes are standard features in EPP and NDR products, but they can’t help if malware is designed to lay dormant if it can figure out that it’s in a sandbox. Sandbox evasion used to be limited to the most sophisticated malware, but it has become more of a commodity feature. 
 PowerShell scrutiny: PowerShell is a powerful and useful tool, as its name implies. However, given the massive proliferation of file-less malware that uses PowerShell (as a means to avoid detection by signature-based and static file scanners), security solutions must scrutinize every invocation by pulling more context for deeper examination. 
 Recon and lateral movement: APT actors learned to go low and slow to avoid setting off SIEM alerts. Extending data retention periods can make it easier to group what may seem to be outliers into suspicious incidents. For example, seemingly random enumeration requests over long periods may point to a concerted effort to map resources. 
 Secure the browser username/password database. Users often rely on browsers for generating, storing, and protecting credentials. Besides data exfiltration by APTs, insecure browser password databases can lead to Account Takeovers (ATOs) for users’ personal information. 
 Stop staging: Users don’t often move and rename data files, then package it all up to be sent elsewhere. 
 Lock down comms: Applications sending traffic on non-standard ports and/or to suspicious IPs should send up red flags, even if the traffic volume is very low. Continuously updated high quality threat intelligence can mitigate this risk. 
 Encryption scrutiny: Ransomware is still rampant. While many garden varieties can be interdicted by most security tools, ransomware authors are also evolving their tools to defeat ransomware protection. For example, some ransomware groups use APT tactics of making an initial silent compromise, surveying enterprise assets, staging the malicious payloads in various places around the target environment, then simultaneously detonating them to limit the effectiveness of anti-ransomware prevention and detection techniques. Some security tools need to view ransomware in the same way as APTs and combine detection and prevention methods to help at-risk clients. 
 
<p>The good news is that several endpoint and network security vendors did very well in this run of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK evaluation. We have noted this in our latest research: <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80508/endpoint-protection-detection-and-response/" title="Market Compass Endpoint Protection">Market Compass Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response</a>. While the MITRE test is significant in that it covers EPP and EDR, it is only a single test. There are other independent test regimes that should be considered when evaluating endpoint security solutions. If your organization is considering upgrading or replacing EPP or EDR, or adding Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR), KuppingerCole can assist with reviewing your requirements and crafting an RFP based on our up-to-date research. Also, for cybersecurity vendors that need help in prioritizing their product or service roadmaps, we can provide tailored advisory services as well.

<p>Over the past few months, I have been working on a side project that I am really excited about. If you know me well, you probably know I enjoy using my side projects to help other teams meet their goals (and if you don’t, I am a Senior Security H@X0R at Okta. Check out my blog posts <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/authors/micah-silverman">here</a>.)</p>

<p>So, when the Okta certification team asked me to help them build a cool developer certification experience, I did not hesitate to say yes.</p>

<p>Before I tell you more about the new exam and the role I played, I want to remind you about the three well-known certifications Okta already has. The Okta Certified Professional, Administrator, and Consultant certifications have been around for almost four years. You can learn more about these three certifications at <a href="https://www.okta.com/certification">https://www.okta.com/certification</a>. They’ve gained quite a bit of attention in four short years from employers and identity experts around the globe. In fact, all three of these certifications are ranked 1st, 2nd, and 6th highest-paying IT certifications worldwide according to <a href="http://certmag.com/salary-survey-2020-new-salary-survey-75/">Certification Magazine’s 2020 Highest Paying IT Certification</a>.</p>

<p>Today, Okta is releasing its first-ever certification for developers who use Okta, the <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/developer-exam-study-guide/">Okta Developer Certification</a>.</p>

<p>The new Okta Developer Certification was designed and built by developers for developers. It is a two-part exam.</p>

<p>In Part I, exam takers are presented with 45 discrete option multiple-choice (DOMC) questions. Those questions focus on knowledge a developer should have in respect to Okta Customer Identity products.</p>

<p>Part II is a web app that guides you through the practical application of Okta’s APIs. If you’ve ever sat for a developer certification exam, you may have had the experience of having to dredge up reference material from memory. This is not that. Instead, you complete use cases and tasks in the form of API calls against an Okta org that’s created just for you during the exam. This is why I was eager to build the app for the certification team. I wanted developers to have an experience that would make the exam delightful and not just a box to check on a resume.</p>

<p>A use case begins with some general instructions that apply to all the tasks in that use case.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Each task within a use case should be completed in the order presented as tasks build on each other.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You have 60 minutes to complete Part I and 90 minutes to complete Part II. When you finish Part II, you are presented with feedback about how you did on the exam (pass/fail).</p>

<p>NOTE: Once you submit Part II, any additional changes you make to your Okta org will not be counted in the grading of your exam.</p>

<p>The release of the new Okta Developer Exam is timely. For Okta, providing developers with the right tools and services is a strong priority. The Developer Exam experience is topnotch. But, don’t take my word for it. Take the exam and use the feedback feature to let us know what you think.</p>

<p>If you are a developer who uses Okta on a regular basis, I encourage you to pursue the Okta Developer Certification. You’re already building these skills and using them for your work—why not make it official on your resume and LinkedIn profile? The developer exam covers real-world relevant topics. Learn more about the new Okta Developer Exam <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/developer-exam-study-guide/">here</a>, and contact the Okta Certification team at certification@okta.com if you have any questions.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/">Xamarin</a> is a framework from Microsoft for building cross-platform mobile apps from one shared source code, written in C#, and compiled to each platform’s runtime. Xamarin.Forms is an abstraction on that, enabling developers to share the UI code as well. Xamarin.Essentials is a NuGet package providing cross-platform APIs for accessing and using native platform capabilities. In this article I will show you how to build a simple Xamarin.Forms app and add authentication to it.</p>

<p>Xamarin.Forms is now included in Visual Studio! Create a new project by clicking File&gt;New Project in Visual Studio, select Mobile App (Xamarin.Forms), and click Next. Name the app OktaAuth and click Create. On the next window, select Blank and click OK.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Visual Studio will automatically create a solution with three projects: <code>OktaAuth.Android</code> for Android, <code>OktaAuth.iOS</code> for iOS, and <code>OktaAuth</code> for shared code and user interface. The projects already include Xamarin.Essentials out of the box - however, the included version doesn’t have the <code>WebAuthenticator</code> class, so you will need to update it to the latest available version which, as of the publish date of this post, is 1.5.3.2</p>

<p>Now, run the app on your attached mobile device (or in the simulator) and you should see a screen like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, it’s time to secure your users login!</p>

 Xamarin.Essentials Auth Flow with an External Identity Provider 

<p>I will use Okta to easily and securely implement user authentication so that I don’t have to implement it from scratch or roll my own identity management. Okta supports user authentication, multi-factor authentication, social authentication as well as all OpenID connect flows out of the box—so it can take care of all the scenarios you might ever need.</p>

<p>In the sample app, I will use Okta’s browser-based OpenID Connect flow to securely authenticate the user via the native browser installed on the device. Using an external browser is the most secure way to authenticate and allows you to log in automatically if you are already signed in the browser. Also, you won’t need to store the ‘client secret’` in your mobile app. When you log in, the browser will redirect you back to your Xamarin app using the redirect URI and pass the requested token as a parameter.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The <code>WebAuthenticator</code> class from Xamarin.Essentials library simplifies implementing this flow and takes care of launching the browser, handling redirect, and parsing received parameters for you.</p>

 Add Authentication with Xamarin.Essentials and Okta 

<p>To get started, log in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> via the URL you are emailed after signing up, to access your org’s portal dashboard. Once you log in, make sure to note your Org URL from the upper right corner of the screen:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now create a new application. Click Applications in the top menu and then Add Application. Select Native and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter a name (I will use OktaAuth again), check Implicit (Hybrid) at the bottom of the screen, and click Done.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Switch back to Visual Studio and add a login and logout button to the app. In the shared <code>OktaAuth</code> project, double-click the <code>MainPage.xaml</code> file and replace its content with this:</p>

   <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;

&lt;ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
xmlns:d="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms/design" xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006" mc:Ignorable="d" x:Class="OktaAuth.MainPage"&gt;
  &lt;StackLayout VerticalOptions="Center"&gt;
    &lt;Label Text="Welcome to Xamarin.Forms!" x:Name="WelcomeLabel"
      HorizontalOptions="Center" VerticalOptions="CenterAndExpand" /&gt;
    &lt;Button x:Name="LoginButton" Text="Log in with Okta"
      HorizontalOptions="Center" Clicked="LoginButtonClicked"/&gt;
    &lt;Button x:Name="LogoutButton" Text="Log out"  IsVisible="False"
      HorizontalOptions="Center" Clicked="LogoutButtonClicked"/&gt;
  &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
&lt;/ContentPage&gt;
</code>   

<p>In the <code>MainPage.xaml.cs</code> file add empty event handlers for the login and logout buttons:</p>

   <code>private async void LoginButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
}

private void LogoutButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add a class to the project and name it <code>OktaConfiguration</code>. This class will hold configuration data that you need to pass to Okta and should look like this:</p>

   <code>public class OktaConfiguration
{
  public const string ClientId = "{clientId}";

  public const string OrganizationUrl = "";

  public const string Callback = "com.okta.{yourOktaAccountNameOnly i.e. 'dev-12345'}:/callback";

  public const string CallbackScheme = "com.okta.{yourOktaAccountNameOnly i.e. 'dev-12345'}";
}
</code>   

<p>Copy the Login redirect URI from your app configuration to the <code>Callback</code> field and paste it into the <code>CallbackScheme</code> (excluding the <code>:/callback</code> part). Copy ClientId value to the <code>ClientId</code> field too.</p>

 IOS and Android Setup for Xamarin WebAuthenticator 

<p>Before you use the <code>WebAuthenticator</code> class, you need to perform each platform-specific setup. For Android, add the following class to the <code>OktaAuth.Android</code> project:</p>

   <code>[Activity(NoHistory = true, LaunchMode = LaunchModeSingleTop)]
[IntentFilter(new[] { Android.Content.Intent.ActionView ,
  Categories = new[] { Android.Content.IntentCategoryDefault, Android.Content.IntentCategoryBrowsable },
  DataScheme = OktaConfiguration.CallbackScheme)]
public class WebAuthenticationCallbackActivity : XamarinEssentials.WebAuthenticatorCallbackActivity
{
  protected override void OnResume()
  {
    base.OnResume();
    Xamarin.Essentials.Platform.OnResume();
  }
}
</code>   

<p>For iOS, open the <code>Info.plist</code> file, go to the Advanced tab, click Add Url Type, and enter <code>CallbackScheme</code> value in the URL Schemes field.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You also need to override the <code>OpenUrl</code> method in the <code>AppDelegate</code> class:</p>

   <code>public override bool OpenUrl(UIApplication app, NSUrl url, NSDictionary options)
{
  if (Xamarin.Essentials.Platform.OpenUrl(app, url, options))
  {
    return true;
  }
  return base.OpenUrl(app, url, options);
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>LoginService</code> class that will build the url with required parameters and also parse the ID token returned by Okta. Paste this code in the <code>LoginService</code> class:</p>

   <code>class LoginService
{
  private string codeVerifier;
  private const string IDToken = "id_token";
  private const string CodeChallengeMethod = "S256";

  public string BuildAuthenticationUrl()
  {
    var state = CreateCryptoGuid();
    var nonce = CreateCryptoGuid();
    var codeChallenge = CreateCodeChallenge();

    return $"{OktaConfiguration.OrganizationUrl}/oauth2/default/v1/authorizeresponse_type={IDToken}ope=openid%20profile&amp;redirect_uri={OktaConfigurationCallback}&amp;client_id={OktaConfiguration.ClientId}state=tate}&amp;code_challenge{codeChallenge}&amp;code_challenge_method={CodeChallengeMethod}&amp;nonce={nonce}";
  }
  
  private string CreateCryptoGuid()
  {
    using (var generator = RandomNumberGenerator.Create())
    {
      var bytes = new byte[16];
      generator.GetBytes(bytes);
      return new Guid(bytes).ToString("N");
    }
  }

  private string CreateCodeChallenge()
  {
    codeVerifier = CreateCryptoGuid();
    using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create())
    {
      var codeChallengeBytes = sha256.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetByte(codeVerifier));
      return Convert.ToBase64String(codeChallengeBytes);
    }
  }  
  
  public JwtSecurityToken ParseAuthenticationResult(WebAuthenticatorResultauthenticationResult)
  {
    var handler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler();
    var token = handler.ReadJwtToken(authenticationResult.IdToken);
    return token;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The code in the <code>BuildAuthenticationUrl</code> method builds the URL required by the auth code grant flow with PKCE. The base URL, when using <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#_2-okta-as-the-identity-platform-for-your-app-or-api">Okta as the authorization server</a>, is <code>https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code>. The method then appends <code>client_Id</code>, <code>response_type</code> and <code>scope</code> parameters, sets the <code>redirect_uri</code> to the login redirect URI from the app configuration, and sets other parameters as required by the PKCE flow.</p>

<p>The <code>ParseAuthenticationResult</code> method parses the jwt <code>IdToken</code> returned by Okta into a <code>JwtSecurityToken</code> object that contains all the claims from the token.</p>

<p>You are now ready to use the <code>WebAuthenticator</code> class to start the login flow.</p>

<p>Go to the <code>MainPage.Xaml.cs</code> file and add and initialize <code>LoginService</code> field:</p>

<p><code>private readonly LoginService loginService = new LoginService();</code></p>

<p>Next, replace the <code>LoginButtonClicked</code> method with this:</p>

   <code>private async void LoginButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  try
  {
    var callbackUrl = new Uri(OktaConfiguration.Callback);
    var loginUrl = new Uri(loginService.BuildAuthenticationUrl());

    var authenticationResult = await WebAuthenticator.AuthenticateAsync(loginUrl, callbackUrl)
    var token = loginService.ParseAuthenticationResult(authenticationResult);

    var nameClaim = token.Claims.FirstOrDefault(claim =&gt; claim.Type == "given_name")
    if (nameClaim != null)
    {
      WelcomeLabel.Text = $"Welcome to Xamarin.Forms {nameClaim.Value}!";
      LogoutButton.IsVisible = !(LoginButton.IsVisible = false);
    }
  }
  catch (TaskCanceledException)
  {
      //User closed browser
  }
}
</code>   

<p>When the login button is clicked, it builds the authentication url and passes it and the callback url to the <code>WebAuthenticator.AuthenticateAsync()</code> method. The <code>WebAuthenticator.AuthenticateAsync()</code> method will launch an external browser and, when I log in, redirects me back to the app passing the token returned by Okta. It then extracts the <code>given_name</code> claim from the parsed claims and displays its value in the <code>WelcomeLabel</code>.</p>

<p>The logout button will simply reset the app to its initial state:</p>

   <code>private void LogoutButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  WelcomeLabel.Text = "Welcome to Xamarin.Forms!";
  LogoutButton.IsVisible = !(LoginButton.IsVisible = true);
}
</code>   

<p>Now run the app, click the Login with Okta button, log in to your Okta account and you will see a screen similar to this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>That’s it!</p>

<p>On July 29th, Ontology and Huobi Futures hosted an AMA in Ontology’s <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English Telegram</a> to answer questions from the community, with Tom Wong, COO of Huobi Futures as our guest&nbsp;speaker.</p><blockquote>Check the chat message history of AMA&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork/645336">here</a></blockquote> Segment 1: Collected Questions from&nbsp;Twitter  Q1: Can you briefly explain how the top milestones that the Huobi Futures team aims to execute before the end of this&nbsp;year? <p>First, I would like to introduce our product development goal.</p><p>Product development has always been a cornerstone for us. We are engaging to enrich our product line so as to provide a wider scope of&nbsp;service.</p><p>A couple of milestone products are planned to be launched in the following 2020, including options and USDT-margined perpetual swaps.<br>In terms of risk control: Huobi Futures has maintained zero clawback record since&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Owing to the robust risk control capability, Huobi Futures has maintained a zero clawback record since&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Besides, Huobi Futures has offered a real-time settlement for BTC, ETH, LTC futures and swaps, allowing users to withdraw the realized profits before settlement, thus improving fund utilization</p><p>Our risk control goal is to minimize the liquidation risks for users, to maintain the zero-clawback record as an exchange, as well as to offer more user-friendly products &amp;&nbsp;service.</p><p>Third, since crypto derivatives exchange is still a blue ocean market. One of our marketing targets this year is to develop oversea markets such as Korea, the UK, Russia, Singapore, and Vietnam. Our aim is to build brand awareness and to attract people in these countries as our&nbsp;users.</p> Q2: Are there any trading events to welcome the arrival of Ontology swaps on&nbsp;Huobi? <p>It has been so glad to connect with Ontology and got ONT perpetual swaps listed on Huobi Futures. To feedback communities, we are going to launch ONT swaps activities. You will not want to miss&nbsp;it.</p><p>There are $15,000 awards to be shared from 18:00 on July 30–18:00 on August 6&nbsp;(GMT+8).</p><blockquote>1. Trade and Share Activity ($10,000 prize&nbsp;pool)</blockquote><blockquote>Users who trade 10 conts of ONT perpetual swaps accumulatively on Huobi and share the activity poster to social media can get $5 ONT&nbsp;each.</blockquote><blockquote>2. ONT Swaps Trading Competition ($5,000 prize&nbsp;pool)</blockquote><blockquote>Users who trade 100 conts or above ONT swaps are qualified to share a $5,000 prize pool based on the proportion of trading amount. The more has been traded, the higher the awards will&nbsp;be.</blockquote><p>The official activity announcement will be released on July 30. Stay tuned and trade ONT swaps on&nbsp;Huobi!</p> Q3: Can you tell us the unique innovations and analytical tools Huobi brings to the table to make futures trading more flawless? <p>Actually we introduced a couple of innovations recently to optimize the trading experience of our&nbsp;users.</p><p>The first I would like to introduce is Locked Margin Optimization. Locked margin is a mechanism that applies when users hold both long and short positions. Under the situation, only a portion of the total margin of long and short positions will be charged since a part of the risk is hedged. As a result, less margin is required so that it improves fund utilization. On the other hand, it helps to reduce the chance of triggering liquidation.</p><p>The second is Partial Liquidation. Huobi Futures adopts a partial liquidation mechanism to help users reduce potential liquidation losses. When liquidation is triggered, instead of being liquidated at a time, positions of Huobi Futures users will be reduced gradually until a grade that meets the margin ratio requirement, helping users to reduce the potential losses incurred by liquidation. Other aspects that contribute to users' trading experience on Huobi Futures include the best liquidity, 7*24 customer support, and user education content.</p> Segment 2: Live&nbsp;Q&amp;As  Q1. As you said that Huobi Futures adopts PARTIAL LIQUIDATION MECHANISM to help users reduce potential liquidation losses. As a trader, How could I use this mechanism? <p>Partial liquidation is for everyone on Huobi Futures. No operation is required from users to use the mechanism. Besides, there is no charge for partial liquidation, while the fee is high on other competing platforms.</p><p>Under liquidation mechanism: the user’s position will change from 1 → 0<br>Under partial liquidation mechanism: the user’s position may change from 1 → 0.5 /0.1 / 0.01/&nbsp;0.</p> Q2. Security is the most important factor for any Traders before choosing any Cryptocurrency Trading platform for Trading. So, How much secure Huobi Futures is? Which Technologies are used by Huobi Futures for making it’s Futures Secure &amp; Unhackable? Also, do you have any plans for user’s Funds Insurance for Funds extra security? <p>From my perspective, security is the heart of an exchange. Huobi has 7 years’ experience in providing crypto trading service and has never been&nbsp;hacked.</p><p>For reducing the possibility of market manipulation, Huobi Futures has a price limit, order limit, and position&nbsp;limit.</p><p>Besides, we calculate the index price based on the weighted average of the latest transaction prices of multiple exchanges.</p><p>The ONT perpetual swaps price on Huobi Futures is composed of the ONT/BTC prices from Huobi, Okex, Binance and HitBTC (25% each respectively).</p><p>Index price helps to make price manipulation barely impossible to achieve: manipulate multiple exchange prices simultaneously needs a huge amount of funds, making price sudden change and recovery less likely to happen; thus helps to improve users’ asset safety on Huobi&nbsp;Futures.</p> Q3. Does Huobi Futures focus on professional traders or does it also focus on beginners? Do you consider it easy for beginners to understand and&nbsp;use? <p>I highly recommend new crypto derivatives users to master the basic underlying principles before entering the market. You can get ready quickly by watching Huobi Futures tutorials on our website, Medium, and&nbsp;YouTube.</p><p>Then try to trade futures with few dollars first. Besides, I suggest managing your cost and profit smartly by using trigger order to stop loss and take&nbsp;profit.</p><p>Why do you choose Houbi but not other exchanges?</p>  Best liquidity: Huobi Futures has been the world top crypto derivatives platform in terms of volume and liquidity. Our coin-margined perpetual swaps volume exceeded that of BitMEX in only 43 days after launching. You can check the crypto derivatives volume at statistics websites such as CoinGecko or Cryptorank.  Huobi is safe: We have an over 7-year of experience in providing digital asset service and never be hacked. Huobi Futures maintains zero clawback record since launch and is the first in the industry to offer real-time settlement service of BTC, ETH, and LTC Futures and&nbsp;Swaps.  Huobi is user-friendly: 7D*24H customer support with point-to-point service; WEB, APP, and API available to meet the demands of all users;<br>Multiple orders type available: such as trigger orders, flash close, FOK,&nbsp;IOC.   About Huobi&nbsp;Futures <p>Huobi Futures is the digital asset derivatives trading platform of Huobi Group. It was launched in December 2018 with the aim of providing the most secure, professional and efficient crypto derivatives service to&nbsp;users.</p><p>Huobi Futures now offers futures and perpetual swaps to cater for different market needs, while options are planned to be launched&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Covering mainstream digital assets, Huobi Futures now offers 20 kinds of perpetual swaps including ONT, as well as 10 kinds of futures, whose expiry covers weekly, bi-weekly, quarterly and bi-quarterly period.

<p>“Cicero accuses Catiline” 8 November 63 BC, a painting by Cesare Maccari (Public Domaine)</p>



<p>This is the third in the series on the paradigm shift
to a digital state. In <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/04/30/the-digital-state-part-1/">Part 1</a>, I pointed out that no
pillar of government is going to remain untouched. In <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/08/the-digital-state-part-2/">Part 2</a>, I showed how the technology
of elections is changing. And in this article, I look at how law-making is going
digital.</p>



<p>Rome, 63 BC</p>



<p>There were no physical
distancing measures in the Roman Senate in the session depicted in this
painting. The scene here is of Cicero delivering the breaking news that he had
uncovered a shocking plot by Catiline to bring down the government of the Roman
Empire. Catiline’s motive was that he thought he would be able to have his
debts, and those of his supporters, cancelled in the ensuing chaos. Even in ancient
Rome, not everyone in power was a stable genius.</p>



<p>In that story we find that
the “checks and balances” against power worked – but only in the nick of time,
and only because the legislators were able to meet physically. Had the
legislators been hiding at home in a lockdown imposed by the executive, things
might have turned out differently.</p>



<p>Other cities, 2020 AD</p>



<p>Fast-forward to the
year 2020. What grand painting about today’s legislatures might be left to
posterity? At the very least, an empty chamber. Despite our advanced digital
societies, our legislators were unable to meet at the height of the pandemic.
For a while, there were few formal “checks and balances” on executive power.
It’s not that the legislators couldn’t arrange a conference call among
themselves – they all have access to phones and computers; and it’s not that
parliaments do not adopt the latest technology – they have already switched
from candles to electric lights; it’s just that their protocols were not
written for the digital age. </p>



<p>The existing protocols
were handed down from an era when grand halls with marble floors and tall columns
defined gravitas and power – like in the painting above. </p>



<p>What would happen to a
bank that doesn’t offer e-banking and insists that its customers have to come
into a branch? What would happen to a stock exchange that doesn’t permit
electronic trading and insists that trading should be done on the marble
trading floor? Would they not become irrelevant? </p>



<p>Can there be any doubt
that parliaments might now look to tweak their protocols to be able to function
during future pandemics? Can there be any doubt that parliaments might now look
to move away from the Roman model from 63 BC? </p>



<p>On that there can be
no doubt. Here is an overview of some of the parliamentary upgrades being worked
on for the digital age. These measures are defined in terms of increasing
citizenship involvement and are not sequenced, i.e. they can run in parallel.</p>



<p>Level 1 upgrade:
remote voting for legislators</p>



<p>The parliamentary votes by legislators on legislation are usually not secret, which makes the votes personally and publicly knowable and auditable. This transparency makes it easier to quickly set up remote voting systems for members of parliament. The picture below shows one such remote voting application by the e-Government firm, Procivis AG.</p>







<p>Source: A remote
voting application for legislators designed by Procivis AG.</p>



<p>In cases where members
of parliament are required to vote in secret (see some examples <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2004_2009/documents/dt/562/562487/562487en.pdf">here</a>), we face the same
hurdles that a remote electronic voting system needs to meet, including the
ability of each voter to verify that their vote was actually cast and delivered
as intended. Some of the considerations in such an upgrade are discussed <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/08/the-digital-state-part-2/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Level 2 upgrade: more differentiated
voting options</p>



<p>In the digital age,
parliaments are struggling to reflect the preferences of increasingly diverse
societies. Survey after survey reveals that voters are not very happy with
their legislature. From the sample data in Figure 1 – for Argentina, Australia,
Chile, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and the United States – the percentage
of people who say they have a “great deal” of confidence in their national
legislature ranges from a low of 0.4% (Egypt) to a high of 3.8% (Australia). </p>



<p>Figure 1: Legislatures in trouble</p>



<p>% of respondents saying they have “a great deal” of confidence in their national legislature [1]</p>







<p>Such widespread unhappiness with a legislature is not a new phenomenon, of course, but it is potentially destabilising. When democracies were imploding in Europe in the 1930s, Friedrich August von Hayek&nbsp;(1899-1992), who won the Nobel Prize for economics, tried to understand why the shift away from democracy was occurring. Hayek’s conclusion was that “it is the ineffectiveness of parliamentary majorities with which the people are dissatisfied…the higher the education and intelligence of individuals becomes, the more their views and tastes are differentiated and the less likely they are to agree on a particular hierarchy of values.”[2]</p>



<p>There are numerous ideas how to better align
parliamentary outcomes to what the people want. One solution is to change what
people vote on and how they allocate their votes. By giving voters a
“voting budget”, they can allocate their votes according to their preferences.
One such method is called “quadratic voting” and was tested in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">experiment</a> for real legislation in the United
States. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Giving voters (both members of parliament as well as
the public) more differentiated options becomes easier if the technology is a custom-built
digital voting application, as opposed to a pen and paper. As with any proposal
to tweak voting arrangements, there will always be pros and cons, and it will
be for each democracy to decide what trade-offs they are prepared to accept in
order to best align legislative outcomes with what the people want.</p>



<p>We also know that trust in parliament is highest when people
are satisfied with their democracy (figure 2). We cannot expect voters to be
satisfied with their democracy when every time they go and vote, the policy
outcomes of the newly elected legislature and executive do not sufficiently represent
their preferences. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 2: The correlation between satisfaction with democracy and trust in parliament [3]</p>







<p>Level 3 upgrades:
Hybrid systems</p>



<p>Legislatures are
slowly but surely being “disintermediated”, in other words, they are losing
their erstwhile prime real estate monopoly in the capital city as their clients
go online. In practice, this means that at all three levels of government
(national or federal, state or provincial, and local or municipal) people are increasingly
getting involved directly in the business of initiating, drafting and even
approving legislation. Details about these trends can be found under concepts
such as the “<a href="https://procivis.ch/2019/05/21/technology-and-citizen-participation-%EF%BB%BF/">crowd-sourcing of legislation</a>” and “<a href="https://procivis.ch/2019/03/22/how-to-spend-it-a-focus-on-participatory-budgeting/">participatory budgeting</a>” –
both links here include examples, from Madrid to New York City, and from
Finland to Brazil.</p>



<p>Concluding thoughts</p>



<p>Just as this pandemic
has greatly accelerated structural changes that were already under way in the
private sector (such as the move to the home office), the same thing is
happening with regard to citizen interaction with the state: you don’t have to
leave your home. The power shifts are even more radical in democracies: you can
now govern from your lockdown.</p>



<p>Of course, not
everyone is happy with these trends – and some even fear them – but the point
is that digitalization is making them easier and easier. These developments are,
in any case, as unstoppable as the move away from the definition of power
captured in the painting above: white men in togas. </p>



<p>There is no getting
away from the central question, though: In the digital age, how can we better align legislatures with the
people’s priorities? Some states will actually figure this out and get it
right. It is inconceivable that this won’t involve more power to the people as
well as new digital forms of interaction between citizens and their
legislature. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the next article, Part 4, I’ll look at the digitalization of state-issued money and the implications for financial governance in the digital age.</p>

At present, Ampleforth has a market capitalization of $580 million, successfully surpassing Maker and ranking 27th on CoinMarketCap.</p><p>AMPL is a synthetic commodity currency, which is classified as an algorithmic stablecoin according to the classification of stablecoin. We know that any stablecoin needs a certain mechanism to ensure that the price of the stablecoin is anchored to the legal currency. For example, when the price of DAI is higher than $1, holders of MKR can vote to increase the types of mortgage assets, increase the upper limit of DAI, and reduce the stability fees. These measures can increase the supply of DAI and bring the price of DAI back to around&nbsp;$1.</p><p>Ampleforth will also increase or decrease the supply of AMPL through certain measures to bring the price of AMPL back to around $1, but the approach is different from common stablecoins. AMPL protocol can automatically adjust supply according to demand. When the price is too high, the wallet balance of all users increases, and when the price is too low, the wallet balance decreases. Throughout the process, the proportion of AMPL held by users will not change. AMPL does not allow price fluctuations at all, it is only when fluctuations exceed a certain threshold that the process of balance increase or decrease occurs. According to the description in the white paper, this threshold δ is set to 5%, and Pt is the target&nbsp;price.</p><p>Source: Ampleforth white&nbsp;paper</p><p>Ampleforth believes that this way can reduce its connection with the cryptocurrency market, but it may not be the case. Let’s take a look at the data for the past month. From June 23 to July 23, the circulation of AMPL increased from 5.61 million to 150 million, the price increased from $1.01 to $1.98, and the circulating market capitalization increased from $5.67 million to $296 million. It can be calculated that the income of holding AMPL this month is 51.28 times, but the price of AMPL has only doubled. It can also be seen from the figure below that although the price of AMPL is around $2.5 and the market capitalization has also decreased, the circulation has almost always been increasing. The monthly circulation increased by 25.67&nbsp;times.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap</p><p>To avoid unnecessary over-correction, the increase or decrease of the supply of AMPL is not achieved overnight, but a smooth process. The AMPL protocol executes the supply change by reference to the volume-weighted average price over the last 24 hours and divides the difference between the weighted average price and the target price by 10 to get the magnitude by which the supply should&nbsp;change.</p><p>When the price of AMPL is $1.5, the wallet balance of AMPL will increase by 50%/10, that is, an increase of&nbsp;5%</p><p>When the price of AMPL is $0.5, the wallet balance of AMPL will decrease by&nbsp;5%.</p><p>The supply of AMPL is readjusted at 10 AM every day, and there is a once-a-day arbitrage opportunity between Uniswap and other Exchanges. When the supply of AMPL changes, the AMPL reserve in Uniswap will automatically adjust, and the relative value of AMPL and ETH will also change, and the price of AMPL on Uniswap will automatically change. In centralized Exchanges (such as Bitfinex), the change in the quantity of AMPL takes time to settle and the price needs to be adjusted artificially. If you have balances on Uniswap and Bitfinex, you can buy them on Exchanges with low prices and sell them on Exchanges with high prices to complete arbitrage transactions. The liquidity and volume of transactions of the ETH-AMPL exchange pairs steadily rank first on Uniswap, showing the extent to which Uniswap affects the price of AMPL. As can be seen from the figure below, the price on Bitfinex will fall after 10 AM every day, which may be affected by arbitrage transactions.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://bitfinex.com/">bitfinex.com</a></p><p>It should be noted that some centralized Exchanges will close trading, deposits, and withdrawals before and after the daily readjustment of the number of AMPL. Some Exchanges do not even directly perform readjustment operations. Investors need to understand relevant rules in&nbsp;advance.</p><p>AMPL is designed to be a relatively stable currency, but it is always easy to deviate from $1 in the actual process. When the price fluctuates, the income will be magnified because of the same change in the liquidity. From the perspective of the stablecoin, AMPL is very impractical. Even if AMPL achieves price stability, it does not necessarily make sense. For example, the price of AMPL has been around $2.3 recently, but the number of AMPL has increased by 13 times compared to 20 days&nbsp;ago.</p><p>From the above analysis, we can also draw some empirical conclusions:</p><p>In the current situation of high prices, the completion of the readjustment of the circulation at 10 AM is likely to cause a larger price decline, which may exceed the proportion of the increase in the AMPL&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Assuming a weighted average price of $2.50 on the day, the incomes will not be affected if the price falls by 15% after the readjustment.</p><p>Arbitrage between Uniswap/Bitfinex is theoretically feasible.</p><p>The benefits and risks of AMPL may be relatively large and the above contents are not considered as investment suggestions.</p> 3. Questions of&nbsp;Readers <p>Question 1. What payment scenarios are Terra mainly used&nbsp;for?</p><p>Answer: Terra is mainly used in scenarios where payments are made in won. There are several points of evidence.</p><p>1) The historical total volume of transactions of KRT (the price of KRT is the same as won) is 1.46 trillion, which is converted into US dollars for a total of $1.22 billion. The historical total volume of transaction of Luna is 1.673 billion, which is converted to US dollars for a total of $650 million at the current price. The proportion of the volume of transactions of KRT is&nbsp;high.</p><p>2) The circulating market capitalization of TerraKRW (KRT) has reached $63.38 million, ranking 232th in CoinMarketCap.</p><p>3) The founder of Terra is the founder of South Korea’s second-largest e-commerce company.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

  <p>The <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-successful-chinese-companies-adapted-to-covid-19/">COVID-19 pandemic </a>has revolutionized the way people work. To maintain the safety and well-being of the workforce, the majority of organizations across the world have adopted a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-lead-better-remote-meetings/">remote work culture.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accurate expectation-setting and transparency of data are key to build mutual trust and lead successful remote teams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gartner research shows that organizations with high levels of trust increase their average employee engagement by 76% over those with low levels of trust. Managers must establish mutual trust to build successful remote teams.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
  Be transparent 
<p>Managers often worry about the lack of visibility in the workflows and routines of their remote direct reports. Create a transparent system of performance measurement that quantifies outcomes, not just activities or the amount of time spent on tasks. Accurate expectation-setting and transparency of data are key to build mutual trust and lead successful remote teams.</p>
  Be accessible and responsive 
<p>Remote working may trigger feelings of isolation and not being unnoticed. Prioritize employees' needs when they are stuck on a project and they require your feedback to progress. Be clear on what communication tools you prefer to use, share your availability frequently and organize regular scheduled calls for everyone. Communicate a response time when acknowledging a request and encourage others to do the same.</p>
  Create team profiles to increase engagement 
<p>Remote working has put pressure on teamwork and camaraderie. Some companies have started creating groups to share coffee chats and pictures, and using apps like Houseparty to organize virtual pizza team parties, farewells and welcomes. They have also accepted other forms of virtual social interactions using apps like Prelude, VirtuWall, QuizBreaker, Kahoot and Water Cooler Trivia to increase engagement among team members.</p>
<p>Have team members create profiles of their personal interests, hobbies and development areas so that employees who have the same interests can share photos and conversations that ultimately foster friendship and enhance collaboration with work colleagues.&nbsp;</p>
  Maintain confidentiality 
<p>As employees work remotely, they continue to have the same obligations to maintain the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-communicate-important-covid-19-data/">confidentiality of personal data</a>, client information and all third-party work. Agree on norms for what information can be shared outside the team and what access control is required.</p>
  Assess progress proactively 
<p>Remote workers can feel sidelined or isolated, which can affect the progress of their workload. Proactively ask your staff if they are facing challenges in advancing their projects or are unable to prioritize their work. Ask if they need extra support and assistance. You can easily detect signs of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/manage-employee-stress-with-flexibility-and-transparency/">anxiety and stress in the office</a>, but remotely it is more difficult to discern. Therefore, you need to be more proactive and understanding.</p>
  Recognize the team 
<p>In a remote working culture, visual signs of recognition are nonexistent. Managers must appeal to the most intimate needs for recognition of human beings. Identify what the employee is seeking — achievement, status or affiliation.</p>
 
 If the need for achievement prevails, recognize their good work by engaging them in challenging projects. 
 If the need for status prevails, involve the person in a prestigious project, let them lead a working group or engage them in a project sponsored by top management 
 If the need for affiliation prevails, involve them in a project or product that is not working well because of tensions between team members.

<p>We used to send long letters by airmail to keep in touch with friends overseas. Today, we stay connected electronically with free messaging that takes just an instant to send. While the tools we use to stay in touch have evolved over time, other ways such as the process of sending gifts, can still be an expensive, slow process.</p>



<p>Now, an easy new option for sending a gift to keep in touch recently became available with Civic Wallet. You may now send small virtual gifts to friends and family in the form of crypto. The process is fast, so compared to other methods of sending money, or even shipping something physical, gift-giving with crypto has become a much easier option. Whether your friends use Civic Wallet or another digital wallet, sending and receiving crypto is nearly instant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of this, the crypto you hold in Civic Wallet is protected by a <a href="https://www.civic.com/faq/#coincover">$1 Million Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee</a> (<a href="https://www.coincover.com/terms-and-conditions">full terms &amp; conditions</a>). If your friends are receiving money via Civic Wallet, they are also covered by the guarantee.</p>



 



 How to send crypto from your Civic Wallet to a friend’s Civic Wallet 



<p>There are two ways to send funds to a friend who is receiving it via Civic Wallet:</p>



<p>By username</p>



  



<p>Select the digital currency you’d like to send. Tap the Send icon and enter your friend’s username. Once you locate the username, enter the payment amount, and press Confirm &amp; Send.</p>



<p>By QR code</p>



<p>The second way to send crypto works if you are physically in the same room as the recipient.</p>



  Your friend begins by selecting the currency they’d like to receive in their wallet and tapping the Receive icon to generate a QR code on the next screen.  Open your Civic Wallet, tap the green Scan button on the bottom of the screen.  Scan your friend’s QR code using your phone, and enter the payment amount.  



 



 How to send crypto from your Civic Wallet to a friend outside of the Civic network 



<p>The last way to send currency is directly to an address, which varies by currency type.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By receiving address</p>



  



  Your friend should begin by opening their digital wallet and locating their receiving address. From here, your friend should copy the receiving address and text it to you.  Next, open your Civic Wallet and tap the Send icon for the crypto you’d like to send. Paste in the receiving address, enter the payment amount, and press Confirm &amp; Send.

  While digitalization is a major challenge for all kinds of enterprises, it is particularly hard for medium sized enterprises. For many years, medium sized enterprises have struggled to deploy Identity Management as well as Identity Governance (IGA) solutions and show true business value and a return on investment. This is largely due to the complexity of implementation and the level of configuration and customization to fulfill the requirements. As a result, many companies have deployed Access Management solutions like single sign-on only to find that while great for user convenience, they bring little to the table for proper lifecycle management and governance.

<p>In contrast to common perception, app security testing doesn’t always have to be a heavy investment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-ways-to-quickly-reduce-it-costs/">reduced IT budgets</a> meant that chief information security officers (CISOs) had to cut costs and compromise on risk management programs. One area of focused budget cuts was application security testing, an expensive but imperative part of the process.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-security-and-risk-leaders-can-prepare-for-reduced-budgets/">How Security and Risk Leaders Can Prepare for Reduced Budgets</a></p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>“Security testing helps identify vulnerabilities early on in the application development process,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/62770/Mark-Horvath">Mark Horvath</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner. “However, CISOs find it difficult to justify the costs of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/future-proof-application-strategy/">application</a> security testing. Compromising on this step can have serious implications, and it is important to not skip it.”</p>
<p>In contrast to common perception, app security testing doesn’t always have to be a heavy investment. CISOs can consider these seven tips to conduct security testing effectively without putting a strain on their budgets.</p>
 Include security experts in the architectural review at the start of development 
<p>Early testing minimizes the cost of fixing software defects. Including security experts at an early stage of development helps identify the gaps in security and remediate the risks. Organizations can avoid remodeling and remediation efforts if threats are mitigated at the very beginning.</p>
<p>Threat modeling is an expensive exercise, but in many cases can be done internally with free downloadable software. This is not restricted to new applications and can be extended to existing software, too. Especially when existing software is being repurposed or exposed as web services, a structured assessment of the risks and scenarios where an application can be attacked offers the opportunity to create test cases.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-9-security-and-risk-trends-for-2020/">Gartner Top 9 Security and Risk Trends for 2020</a></p>
 Select affordable testing options when budgets are reduced 
<p>In scenarios where budget constraints are a big hurdle to security testing, CISOs can benefit from affordable and open-source options. While these alternatives are often incomplete in terms of language, framework and vulnerability coverage, and functionality, with the appropriate customization and plug-ins, they can enable an effective application security program with minimal resources.</p>
<p>The free software doesn’t come with enterprise functionality such as dashboards, comprehensive reporting, distributed scanning sensors or plug-ins to integrate into the software development life cycle. However, internal experts can fill this gap by writing their own scripts, or can operate the tools manually where needed.</p>
 Use security testing services to jump-start your application security program 
<p>Involve developers in the testing process so that they can produce high-quality code once they understand the possible threats. “Assign one of your developers to shadow the pentester or application security testing service, or have your developer manage the program,” says Horvath.</p>
<p>Gartner research suggests that developers in this kind of program are prone to make significantly fewer security errors. These developers can also act as subject matter experts or security champions and identify issues more quickly for the team in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to involving developers in testing, CISOs can also introduce numerous “ethical hacking” courses available online to developers. This can enable developers to understand the world view on securing applications and how attackers operate.</p>
 Reevaluate your mix of security techniques on a periodic basis 
<p>As the program matures, and as new styles of coding and new technologies are introduced, vulnerabilities evolve. CISOs need to plan for this by scheduling periodic evaluations of the security techniques in practice.</p>
<p>For example, “If you have an application that is mostly in maintenance mode and requires mostly cosmetic changes, move resources from code scanning into pentest,” Horvath says.</p>
<p>Periodic testing is wrongly perceived as a cost-draining process. However, semiannual or quarterly reevaluation of priorities can optimize resources and ensure that development and security teams are familiar with all the tools.</p>
 Rotate testers and apply time limits to prevent overfamiliarity and burnout 
<p>Gartner research suggests that the number of threats found by a security tester reduces gradually over a period of five weeks and significantly declines after eight weeks of running a code. This doesn’t mean that the threats have been reduced. Because the tester is viewing the code multiple times, fatigue sets in. This can be a problem with critical sections of code or software, especially when the full functionality of the code may not always be tested or exercised.</p>
<p>Introducing code testing to a fresh set of eyes can help identify vulnerabilities that someone who has been working on the software for too long may have overlooked.</p>
 Avoid wasting paid testing hours 
<p>Underpreparedness is not new to the testing environment. Often when consultants arrive to begin testing, they are not fully briefed or prepared for the kinds of tests that have been requested. This causes delays in testing, less accurate results, and lower productivity for development teams and pentesters.</p>
<p>Prepare for the testing ahead of time by meeting with vendors and discussing the types and scale of testing you want to conduct, and preselect areas of code, infrastructure and processes you identify as gaps in your overall testing coverage. Use external testers to find business logic errors instead of the more “low-hanging fruit” types of issues that your internal testing can uncover.</p>
 Be flexible when scheduling opportunities for testing 
<p>Rolling out testing changes to a small population is a common practice within DevOps organizations. As these tests are performed in a controlled environment, it reduces the risks of exposing the entire organization to threats. CISOs can plan for canary or A/B testing during breaks in normal business hours, such as weekends and holidays. Another option is to set up parallel environments for security testing.</p>
<p>“Issues that appear as security vulnerabilities are often a product of poor code development. By using these security testing tips, organizations can create a robust framework for their applications’ security,” says Horvath.</p>

  <p>.NET Core version 3.1 just came out as of writing this article. It includes a new version of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/">Entity Framework (EF) Core</a>, the next generation of Microsoft’s tried and tested Object Relational Mapper (ORM). Entity Framework has been used alongside ASP.NET for years and has developed a reputation for being an essential tool in any developer’s toolbox for .NET Framework, and now .NET Core. .NET Core now also includes a built-in dependency injection system and class templating for controllers. These features make developing REST APIs remarkably easy.</p>

<p>Coupling the new .NET Core features with Okta provides a secure REST API in no time at all. Okta can be used as an authentication server that issues a JSON Web Token (JWT). Microsoft’s ASP.NET Core provides middleware for validating the token.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will create a simple REST API to serve a client application for a lending library. The client application will need to add library patrons, provide lists of available books, and let the server know when a book is checked out or checked in. You’ll use SQL Server for your database connected to your application with EF Core. You will learn how to build a REST API with ASP.NET Core, build a database with Code First principles, and secure it using Okta.</p>

 Secure Your Entity Framework Core Application 

<p>The first thing you need to do is set up Okta for use as an authorization server. In your Okta Developer Console, create a new application. Click Add Application and select the Service option. Give your application a meaningful name (I named mine LibraryAPI) and click Done. The next screen will show your Client Id and Client Secret. Make sure to note these—you’ll need them in your application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click on API &gt; Authorization Servers in the Developer Console and note your authorization server. By default, you should have one set up named “default”. The default one is fine for development purposes, but in a production environment, you will likely want to create a new one. Note the Issuer URI and Audience on this page as you’ll need those as well. Finally, click on the server and navigate to the Scopes tab. Click Add Scope and add a new scope called API. You will need to send this scope as a parameter when obtaining a token.</p>

<p></p>

 Scaffold Your Entity Framework Core API 

<p>Open up Visual Studio 2019 and click Create a new Project. Under templates, select ASP.NET Core Web Application and click Next. Give it a meaningful name (mine is named LibraryAPI) and click Create. Finally, select API on the Create a new ASP.NET Core web application page and click Create. It will take a minute to scaffold the project for you.</p>

<p></p>

 Get the Necessary NuGet Packages 

<p>The first package you’ll need is Entity Framework Core. As discussed before, Entity Framework is your ORM that will connect your web application to your database.</p>

   <code>Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -Version 3.1.4
</code>   

<p>Next, you’ll want to use Microsoft’s JWT validation library to check the token issued by Okta.</p>

   <code>Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer -Version 3.1.4
</code>   

 Configure Your Entity Framework Core API’s Startup 

<p>Next, you’ll need to configure your application so that it can properly validate the JWT that will be sent on each request. While you’re here, you can work on setting up your database as well. First, open the file named <code>appsettings.Development.json</code>. Add the following configuration to it.</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "LibraryConnectionString": "{yourConnectionString}"
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Audience": "api://default",
    "Authority": "{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default"
  }
}

</code>   

<p>Next, create a new class in your root folder called <code>Okta.cs</code>. This class will be a strongly typed object to contain the <code>Okta</code> settings you just placed in your <code>appsettings</code> file. You will need this class in your <code>Startup.cs</code> class shortly.</p>

   <code>namespace LibraryAPI
{
    public class Okta
    {
        public string Authority { get; set; }
        public string Audience { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, open <code>Startup.cs</code> (this was created by the Visual Studio Template) and change the code to the below:</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer;

namespace LibraryAPI
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddControllers();

            services.AddDbContext&lt;Data.LibraryContext&gt;(options =&gt;
                options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("LibraryConnectionString")));

            var okta = Configuration.GetSection("Okta").Get&lt;Okta&gt;();

            services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                    .AddJwtBearer(options =&gt;
                    {
                        options.Authority = okta.Authority;
                        options.Audience = okta.Audience;
                    });
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }

            app.UseRouting();

            app.UseAuthentication();
            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
            {
                endpoints.MapControllers();
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>A lot of this code was automatically generated by Visual Studio when you created the project. But you have added a few new pieces.</p>

<p>First, you added a <code>DbContext</code> to the services of the application. For now, this should result in a compiler error until you add the <code>LibraryContext</code> class to your application (which you’ll do shortly).</p>

<p>Next, you’re getting the Okta settings from the appsettings file you just amended. Having a strongly typed object to bind the Okta configuration section makes it a little easier to set up your JWT validation. To set that up, you just need to add authentication to your services then call <code>AddJwtBearer()</code> from the <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer</code> package you added earlier. Provide this method with your Authority and Audience so that it can properly validate the token.</p>

<p>You also need to configure your HTTP Request pipeline to use authentication and authorization. This can be added to the <code>Configure()</code> method as shown above.</p>

 Create Your Database with Entity Framework Core Code First 

<p>Next, you can work on designing and coding your database. Here you are using a Code First approach to creating your database. This means you’ll write C# code which EF Core will use to create or update your database using the connection string provided in your <code>Startup</code> class.</p>

<p>First, create your entities. For this project you’ll need three entities: <code>User</code>, <code>Book</code>, and <code>Checkout</code>. Create a new folder in your root directory and name it <code>Data</code>. In there, add three new files for <code>User.cs</code>, <code>Book.cs</code>, and <code>Checkout.cs</code>.</p>

<p>Start with the <code>User</code> entity. This entity consists of a <code>Username</code> and an <code>Id</code> which will be used as a primary key. All the entities you create will have a property named <code>Id</code> that is decorated with the attribute <code>[Key]</code> to mark it as a primary key.</p>

   <code>using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace LibraryAPI.Data
{
    public class User
    {
        [Key]
        public int Id { get; set; }

        public string Username { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next is a similar entity called <code>Book</code>. Along with the <code>Id</code> property, you’re also holding some information about the title, author, and description of the book.</p>

   <code>using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace LibraryAPI.Data
{
    public class Book
    {
        [Key]
        public int Id { get; set; }

        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string Author { get; set; }
        public string Description { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, edit your <code>Checkout</code> class with the following code. The <code>Checkout</code> entity is a little more complicated than the other two because it will include foreign key references to <code>Book</code> and <code>User</code>. This should make sense as a user checks out a book. To tell EF Core that this is a foreign key, you can add the <code>ForeignKey</code> attribute to a virtual property. The argument it needs, such as <code>BookId</code> on <code>Book</code>, tells EF Core that <code>Checkout.BookId</code> should reference the primary key on the <code>Book</code> class.</p>

<p>There is another way to manage the keys in your database called Fluent API. Fluent API is a more powerful way of setting up keys, cascading rules, mapping entities to tables, and a whole range of other functions. Most of the time Fluent API is overkill, especially when you are working in a Code First setup. However, a Fluent API is necessary if you are working in a database-first environment where the database structure may not interact well with EF Core or doesn’t have strict naming conventions.</p>

<p>The virtual properties on the <code>Checkout</code> entity serve a very important function. These objects are navigation properties that can be loaded when you retrieve a <code>Checkout</code> object or they can be ignored. By default, EF Core won’t load these objects. However, you can enable *lazy loading, eager loading, or use “Include” to tell EF Core to load these properties. More on that in a little bit. What’s important to know here is that these properties can be populated with the referenced entity Id specified in the attribute.</p>

   <code>using System;

using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;


namespace LibraryAPI.Data
{
    public class Checkout
    {
        [Key]
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public int UserId { get; set; }
        public int BookId { get; set; }
        public bool Active { get; set; }
        public DateTime CheckoutDate { get; set; }
        public DateTime DueDate { get; set; }

        public DateTime? CheckinDate { get; set; }

        [ForeignKey("BookId")]
        public virtual Book Book { get; set; }

        [ForeignKey("UserId")]
        public virtual User User { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>To tie this all together you will need a <code>DbContext</code> that has these entities in it. Create a new file in the <code>Data</code> folder named <code>LibraryContext</code> and add the following code:</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace LibraryAPI.Data
{
    public class LibraryContext : DbContext
    {
        public LibraryContext(DbContextOptions&lt;LibraryContext&gt; options)
        : base(options)
        {
        }

        public DbSet&lt;User&gt; User { get; set; }

        public DbSet&lt;Checkout&gt; Checkout { get; set; }

        public DbSet&lt;Book&gt; Books { get; set; }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuild
        {
            base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Book&gt;().HasData(new Book { Id = 1, Author = "J. R. R. Tolkien", Description= "The Fellowship of the Ring, the first volume in the trilogy, tells of the fateful power of the One Ring. It begins a magnificent tale of adventure that will plunge the members of the Fellowship of the Ring into a perilous quest and set the stage for the ultimate clash between the powers of good and evil.", Title = "The Fellowship of the Ring"});
            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Book&gt;().HasData(new Book { Id = 2, Author = "J. R. R. Tolkien", Description = "The Fellowship has been forced to split up. Frodo and Sam must continue alone towards Mount Doom, where the One Ring must be destroyed. Meanwhile, at Helm's Deep and Isengard, the first great battles of the War of the Ring take shape.", Title = "The Two Towers" });

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Book&gt;().HasData(new Book { Id = 3, Author = "J. R. R. Tolkien", Description = "The Return of the King is the towering climax to J. R. R. Tolkien's trilogy that tells the saga of the hobbits of Middle-earth and the great War of the Rings. In this concluding volume, Frodo and Sam make a terrible journey to the heart of the Land of the Shadow in a final reckoning with the power of Sauron.", Title = "The Return of the King" });
            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Book&gt;().HasData(new Book { Id = 4, Author = "J. R. R. Tolkien", Description = "Like every other hobbit, Bilbo Baggins likes nothing better than a quiet evening in his snug hole in the ground, dining on a sumptuous dinner in front of a fire. But when a wandering wizard captivates him with tales of the unknown, Bilbo becomes restless.

Bilbo quickly tires of the quest for adventure and longs for the security of his familiar home. But before he can return to his life of comfort, he must face the greatest threat of all - a treasure-troving dragon named Smaug.", Title = "The Hobbit" });

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Book&gt;().HasData(new Book { Id = 5, Author = "Philip K Dick", Description = "It's America in 1962. Slavery is legal once again. The few Jews who still survive hide under assumed names. In San Francisco, the I Ching is as common as the Yellow Pages.

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Book&gt;().HasData(new Book { Id = 6, Author = "Jim Butcher", Description = "With rent past due and a decent meal becoming an issue of some importance, Harry needs work, and soon. A call from a distraught wife, and another from Lt. Murphy of the Chicago PD Special Investigation Unit makes Harry believe things are looking up, but they are about to get worse, much worse. Someone is harnessing immense supernatural forces to commit a series of grisly murders. Someone has violated the first law of magic: Thou Shalt Not Kill. Tracking that someone takes Harry into the dangerous underbelly of Chicago, from mobsters to vampires, while he himself is under suspicion of the crimes.", Title = "Storm Front" });

        }

    }
}
</code>   

<p>If you’ve used Entity Framework before this should look familiar, but with some notable changes. The constructor here takes a <code>DbContextOptions</code> argument that will contain information about the database itself. This includes the connection string and the type of database used. You are using SQL Server in this application but EF Core is capable of connecting to a range of databases including MySql and Postgres.</p>

<p>You also need to include your entity sets as properties on the context.</p>

<p>And finally, there is the overridden method <code>OnModelCreating</code> where you will see what looks like some seed data for books. This is EF Core’s new way of seeding data. When you add a migration, EF Core will look in this method for any changes and add them to the migration. Here you have added a few sample books for testing your API.</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar with migrations, they are classes that EF Core uses to update (or downgrade) your database. You can use the command <code>Add-Migration Initial-Migration</code> in the Package Manager Console to add your first migration. This should include the entities you added and a section for the books’ sample data. Once the migration has been created, you can use the command <code>Update-Database</code> to create or update your target database with any outstanding migrations. <code>Update-Database</code> can also take a specific migration name to update or downgrade to that migration.</p>

 Add Your Controllers 

<p>By default, Visual Studio may have added a controller for <code>WeatherForecast</code>. You can delete this. With your <code>Controllers</code> folder empty, you are about to add three new controllers. But here you want to leverage Visual Studio to help you. Right-click on Controllers and hover over Add and click Controller. Click on the option for API Controller with actions, using Entity Framework. Click Add then follow the wizard for your <code>Book</code> entity. You’ll repeat these steps each time you add a controller.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Visual Studio will set up the routing, dependency injection for EF Core, and give you a list of RESTful methods to implement. You will need to do some work to trim methods that you will not support in this application. For example, users cannot add new books. They can only get a list of available books. See below for the final product.</p>

<p>One note about setting up your controllers this way: There is intense debate about whether you should inject a <code>DbContext</code> into your controllers. Many people believe you should abstract the data layer away from the controllers and use models and service classes here rather than entities and contexts. I tend to agree with that philosophy, however there is always a “but.” For this tutorial, it would be okay to inject the context into the controller, however this strategy may fail you one day and you have to write models anyway.</p>

<p>This controller, and all your other controllers, will need to be decorated with an <code>Authorize</code> attribute to let the application know to use the authorization and authentication middleware you configured in the <code>Startup.cs</code> file.</p>

<p>The <code>BooksController</code> only provides two methods, <code>GetBooks</code> and <code>GetBook</code>. These names are internal and the exposed name can be seen in the comments over the methods. The exposed names fit a more RESTful pattern and are controlled by the <code>Route</code> attribute and the <code>HttpGet</code> attribute.</p>

   <code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using LibraryAPI.Data;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;

namespace LibraryAPI.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    [Authorize]
    public class BooksController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly LibraryContext _context;

        public BooksController(LibraryContext context)
        {
            _context = context;
        }

        // GET: api/Books
        [HttpGet]
        public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Book&gt;&gt;&gt; GetBooks()
        {
            return await _context.Books.ToListAsync();
        }

        // GET: api/Books/5
        [HttpGet("{id}")]
        public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Book&gt;&gt; GetBook(int id)
        {
            var book = await _context.Books.FindAsync(id);

            if (book == null)
            {
                return NotFound();
            }

            return book;
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Follow the above method  to add a controller for <code>UsersController</code>. The <code>UsersController</code> will only allow <code>Get</code> and <code>Post</code> operations. Another aside here—there is also some debate about the role of <code>Post</code> and <code>Put</code> methods in a REST API. While many online sources will suggest that <code>Put</code> is for adding a resource and <code>Post</code> is for amending one, the Visual Studio template has these roles reversed.  In this project, you’ll follow the convention set up by Microsoft, although that may not always be the case.</p>

<p>Aside from trimming the unused methods, you’ll also need to amend the <code>Post</code> method to do a check before adding a user to the database. The default template will simply allow the API to always add a new user, relying on the client to do the check before adding the user.</p>

   <code>using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using LibraryAPI.Data;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;

namespace LibraryAPI.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    [Authorize]
    public class UsersController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly LibraryContext _context;

        public UsersController(LibraryContext context)
        {
            _context = context;
        }

        // GET: api/Users/5
        [HttpGet("{id}")]
        public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;User&gt;&gt; GetUser(int id)
        {
            var user = await _context.User.FindAsync(id);

            if (user == null)
            {
                return NotFound();
            }

            return user;
        }

        // POST: api/Users
        // To protect from overposting attacks, enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for
        // more details, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2123754.
        [HttpPost]
        public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;User&gt;&gt; PostUser(User user)
        {
            if (!UserExists(user.Id))
            {
                _context.User.Add(user);
                await _context.SaveChangesAsync();

                return CreatedAtAction("GetUser", new { id = user.Id }, user);
            }
            else
            {
                return UnprocessableEntity();
            }
        }

        private bool UserExists(int id)
        {
            return _context.User.Any(e =&gt; e.Id == id);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, you’ll need to add the <code>CheckoutsController</code>. For this controller you will include methods for <code>Get</code>, <code>Post</code>, and <code>Put</code>. <code>Put</code> is used for when a user returns a book to mark the checkout as returned by deactivating it and setting a time stamp on the checkout object for <code>CheckinDate</code>.</p>

<p>There’s a small change in the <code>Get</code> method here. You’ll notice there’s a call for <code>Include</code> when querying your database. Lazy loading isn’t enabled by default in EF Core so if you didn’t use <code>Include</code>, the navigation properties wouldn’t be populated. To explicitly tell EF Core to load this object, <code>Include</code> is used to identify which property to populate. You could also do this by enabling eager loading or lazy loading. The trouble with those is they can often load more data than you want. There’s always a tradeoff for whatever approach you use.</p>

</code>   

 Test Your Entity Framework Core API 

<p>With the application complete you can start debugging it with Postman or another REST client of your choice. You will want to test the actions. First, try to add a user without adding any headers. The result should be a 401 indicating you did not include the bearer token with the request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To correct this, make a call to your authentication server to receive a token. Note,, here the <code>content-type</code> must be <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. In the image below I have removed my <code>client_id</code>, <code>client_secret</code>, and Okta domain. You will need to populate these with your own.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, you can add this token to the header of your Add User call. This should return the user entity to you successfully.</p>

<p></p>

<p>With a user added, get a list of the available books. Remember to include your JWT Bearer Token.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, pick a book you like and send a call to <code>CheckoutsController/Post</code> to add the new Checkout.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you want to check the book back in, you can make a call to <code>CheckoutsController/Put</code> to do so.</p>

<p></p>

 The GiD Report #120 — How persistent identity can shape better online communities <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-119-ray-dalio-examines-history-to-understand-the-chaos-were-experiencing-today-690ec1c73548">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we’ve got for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  1a. Vitalik Buterin on persistent identity + free&nbsp;speech,  1b. Juan Benet on identity baked into the&nbsp;browser  1c. Balaji Srinivasan on portable identity network effects for 2-sided marketplaces  2. Big 4 antitrust hearings pushed to&nbsp;Wed  3. New OCC guy allows bank custody of&nbsp;crypto  4. Chinese state launches blockchain network  5. Ray Dalio on the Big Cycle of the U.S. and where it is&nbsp;now   1. For all the ways our internet platforms have better connected us, made it easier to create and to consume, there are some striking issues with the place we’ve arrived at in 2020. I won’t get into that since we’re all pretty aware of the primary critiques. <p>What about solutions?</p><p>Juan Benet (Filecoin), Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum), and Balaji Srinivasan (former Coinbase CTO, a16z) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTxE9KV3YrE&amp;feature=emb_logo">gave their future-y takes in a “debate” last wee</a>k (via <a href="https://global.id/junhiraga">/junhiraga</a>).</p><p>For starters, we need to rethink the incentive structures that drive our behavior. We also need to rethink how our platforms are structured. And we also need a lot more experimentation around&nbsp;both.</p><p>But we also need to rethink identity.</p><p>Here’s a thought exercise for you. How could we foster the free and independent speech and thought that comes with anonymity without devolving into a free for all like 4Chan and all the bad behavior that comes with&nbsp;it?</p><p>Here’s Vitalik:</p>Vitalik Buterin, TechCrunch<blockquote>So I feel like a 4Chan type of thing is a great example of the difference between anonymous and pseudonymous. 4Chan is much more on the anonymous side of the spectrum. And I think the difference is that you can focus on decentralization in the sense of avoiding other people’s negative incentives. That’s definitely part of what’s going on, but the other important thing is actively creating positive incentives right?</blockquote><blockquote>And if you don’t have any notion of persistent identity, then you can’t have positive incentives because there’s no persistent thing for those incentives to hook onto. There’re a lot of ways you can have persistent identity, persistent reputation — even in ways that are very strongly privacy preserving.</blockquote><blockquote>You can have pseudonyms, but then you could even do crazy things — for example, you switched to a new pseudonym every two weeks, but you would have some zero-knowledge proofs that links your pseudonym to some older pseudonym, and you don’t really know which one, but some kind of reputation score carries&nbsp;over.</blockquote><blockquote>You could even have negative reputation scores carry over potentially on someone — and if the research came up with a way of doing that in a privacy-preserving way so that there was a lot of room in terms of designing incentives to encourage actively good behavior.</blockquote><blockquote>And in that sense it can mean a lot of things. It can mean micropayments and monetary rewards. It could be just a reputation and having more people see your content. There’s a lot of things you can do that are fully compatible with the idea that people should be able to post under identities that are separate from their real identities that they use for personal like and work and so&nbsp;forth.</blockquote><p>All of which, BTW, is aligned with the spirit of the GlobaliD namespace. Your GlobaliD name doesn’t have to be your real name. And you can always have more than one name. That’s your prerogative.</p><p>It’s also the super exciting thing about identity in general. The deeper you dive into it, the more you start to understand how it can help reshape the way we interact and transact online in a fundamentally constructive way — far beyond the limits of what we’ve experienced so&nbsp;far.</p><p>Even simple things such as account recovery have creative solutions that both enhance trust while removing bottlenecks.</p><p>Here’s Vitalik on the concept of social recovery:</p><blockquote>If you lose your account, you have to appeal to customer service and sometimes they just never respond. More privileged people can have private channels where they could yell more and get listened to more. A lot of people just don’t have access to those kinds of channels. It’s a problem where people think that you can just talk to the kindly human at the end, they’ll figure it out. But often, it just isn’t true. This is an idea where you have some group of friends — somewhere between five and 10 contacts — and say any two thirds of them can reset your&nbsp;account.</blockquote><p>Of course, Vitalik also concedes that certain functions are simply better served by verification providers — and here, Vitalik is still speaking our language:</p><blockquote>The other half of the identity problem is proving real-world properties about yourself that are attested by authorities — like proving you’re a citizen of some country, proving that you graduated from some university, all of those things. And ultimately, you can’t decentralize those because they’re just fundamentally dependent on the centralized authority. But what you can do is create a kind of common standard and common platform for these attestations to&nbsp;happen.</blockquote><p>Now here’s Juan echoing Greg’s thoughts on baking identity into the&nbsp;browser:</p><blockquote>I think we need to return to the idea of persona, which was like Mozilla’s effort to create identity directly baked into the browser. I think if the operating systems we had coupled identities for data closer to the kind of identities for logging into the device, that would be a good win. The browser or the O/S might be the right place to put&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>The long time upside, though, will be the network effects of having these verified, persistent, and portable identities.</p><p>Here’s Balaji:</p><blockquote>One thing I want to just point out — this may be very obvious — but I think it’s actually pretty interesting for us. One of the advantages of Substack is there’s a hundred thousand people on there who have credit cards. And so a new publication has a built-in network effect. If you had an Ethereum ID with crypto in there, you start to get a network effect among things where all Ethereum users or all Bitcoin users can go and sign up for a site and you have a similar kind of network effect — where you would prefer it to be logged in with Ethereum or logged in with Bitcoin, and then you can pay and you’ve got identity and so on and so&nbsp;forth.</blockquote><blockquote>In some ways, that’s an obvious use case, but I think it rotates it a little bit where you just need a community of those folks who will all go and just click to sign up at a site and you start to get a network effect, and then you start getting more products built around that core. And the critical thing there, of course, is that the account and the money are both decentralized. So they’re not associated with Amazon.com or Substack or what have you, but with a decentralized community.</blockquote><blockquote>Then you can also have something where you have an Ethereum wallet, for example, or a Bitcoin wallet where you are pushing notifications and you get paid. Let’s say now you get to a future where there’s enough apps that they want to go and attract Ethereum holders, right? Then they pay a task to that wallet, which is a known purchaser of subscriptions. And now, boom, a little offer or task appears and you can click to go and purchase it. That’s a sketch of something where you can start building a two-sided marketplace around account holders on one hand and services on the&nbsp;other.</blockquote><p>That’s the long term vision of an interoperable, portable identity — one that’s not beholden to any single platform (or even any particular wallet or cryptocurrency for that&nbsp;matter).</p><p>Anyway, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTxE9KV3YrE&amp;feature=emb_logo">there’s plenty more from the full talk if you want to dive&nbsp;in</a>.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-simple-and-practical-steps-the-federal-government-should-take-to-fix-online-speech">The Simple and Practical Steps the Federal Government Should Take to Fix Online&nbsp;Speech</a>  <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-employee-leaks-show-they-feel-betrayed?utm_campaign=%5Bcovid19%5D%2BTech%2BImpac&amp;utm_content=564476&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=196813">“Facebook Is Hurting People At Scale”: Mark Zuckerberg’s Employees Reckon With The Social Network They’ve&nbsp;Built</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-creates-teams-to-study-racial-bias-on-its-platforms-11595362939">WSJ News Exclusive | Facebook Creates Teams to Study Racial Bias, After Previously Limiting Such&nbsp;Efforts</a>  <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-global-pandemic-lights-the-fuse-on-a-technology-revolution/">A global pandemic lights the fuse on a technology revolution | Indicio&nbsp;Tech</a>   2.

Speaking of regulators, the new OCC guy has only just moved into his office but is already making&nbsp;moves. <p>Like allowing <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/banks-in-us-can-now-offer-crypto-custody-services-regulator-says?utm_source=newsletters&amp;utm_medium=blockchainbites&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;clid=00Q1I00000MSaRFUA1">U.S. banks to provide custody services for&nbsp;crypto</a>:</p><blockquote>The letter, which appears to be addressed to an unidentified bank or similar entity, notes that banks “may offer more secure storage services compared to existing options,” and that both consumers and investment advisors may wish to use regulated custodians to ensure they don’t lose their private keys, and therefore, access to their&nbsp;funds.</blockquote><blockquote>“Providing custody for cryptocurrencies would differ in several respects from other custody activities,” the letter&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>It pointed to the need for digital wallets, adding that because they exist on a blockchain, there is no physical possession for&nbsp;cryptos.</blockquote><blockquote>“The OCC recognizes that, as the financial markets become increasingly technological, there will likely be increasing need for banks and other service providers to leverage new technology and innovative ways to provide traditional services on behalf of customers,” the letter&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/winklevoss-owned-gemini-now-provides-custody-for-crypto-blockchain-domains">Winklevoss-Owned Gemini Now Provides Custody for&nbsp;.Crypto Blockchain Domains — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/senate-hearing-sees-digital-dollar-as-a-tool-for-economic-supremacy">Senate Hearing Sees Digital Dollar as a Tool for Economic Supremacy — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/visa-hints-at-cryptocurrency-projects?utm_source=newsletters&amp;utm_medium=blockchainbites&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;clid=00Q1I00000MSaRFUA1">Visa Blog Post Hints at Future Digital Currency Projects — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-whatsapp-india/facebooks-whatsapp-to-partner-with-more-indian-banks-in-financial-inclusion-push-idUSKCN24N24E">Facebook’s WhatsApp to partner with more Indian banks in financial inclusion push</a>  <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/07/21/fact-check-america-midst-national-coin-shortage/5439455002/">Fact check: Yes, there’s a national coin shortage.

A number of empires and dynasties have sustained themselves for hundreds of years and the United States, at 244 years old, has proven itself to be one of the most durable now in existence. I think the most important question is how we adapt and change by asking ourselves and honestly answering some difficult questions.</blockquote><p>And there are certainly some difficult questions to contend with. But if the first half of this report is any indication, there are plenty of people out there trying to answer&nbsp;them.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-120-how-persistent-identity-can-shape-better-online-communities-7ed6daaad889">The GiD Report #120 — How persistent identity can shape better online communities</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					 <p>When I was hired at the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> as the first software engineer, my #1 task was to help developers start using <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk">Hyperledger Indy</a> quickly. It wasn’t an easy task—two years, loads of documentation, an entirely <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries">new Hyperledger project</a> (Aries), and countless workshops later, we’d taken what used to take about six months to accomplish and reduced it to a couple of weeks. I took that knowledge and created a paid training course for SSI developers that brought in $100k+ of revenue for the Sovrin Foundation. However, I’ve always had a bigger vision of what could be done for the SSI developer community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I helped start Trinsic, I wanted to create the best developer experience possible. The first version of our API was released exactly a year ago, with only four developers as the first users. Since then, we’ve grown into a community of hundreds of developers. We’ve released two additional APIs and worked hard to make it easy to start building applications that utilize SSI capabilities.</p>

					 <p>Our engineering team at Trinsic is thrilled to present our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs">new documentation site</a>, which we believe is the best place for someone new to SSI to get started learning. To begin, we explain the concepts of SSI in understandable terms. Our API reference then shows how these concepts are applied in workable building blocks. The reference applications we’ve built will make it easy to call the API in the programming language of your choice. If you have any questions, we have a discussion board for you to ask any questions you might have. Let’s dive in to some of the major features of this new developer hub.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Knowledge base 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Good knowledge about SSI has historically been hard to come by. Distributed across multiple blogs, repos, docs, webinars, and online courses are hundreds of pages of content, some of which is out of date. We’ve taken the knowledge that has historically only been available from hours of searching or paid consultants and made it accessible for everyone. The knowledge base includes:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					   Conceptual documentation  Technical documentation  Guides/tutorials  Reference applications  Glossary<br><br>  <p>We have big plans for this knowledge base and intend to continually improve it over time. Please let us know if there are topics you’d like to see explained, and we’ll make sure to cover it. The best way to understand something is not by being taught but by actually doing it. That’s why the best part of the knowledge base is that it’s right next to the API Reference.</p>

					 <p>Our APIs are our core product, used all around the world by developers in all industries. Previously, accessing the API was a multi-step process, including copying &amp; pasting API keys (and remembering to use the ‘bearer’ scheme!) and navigating to a SwaggerHub page. The new API reference lives in the same place as the documentation and will soon share authentication with the Trinsic Studio, which means you’re automatically authenticated while you’re logged-in to your Trinsic account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That means you can go from reading this blog post to making API calls in less than 30 seconds—seriously. Getting started couldn’t be easier.</p>

					 <p>A public community forum is a part of the documentation site as well. That means you can read documentation, make an API call, and ask a question without ever leaving the site. You can also search through questions previous developers have asked and contribute your answers. This forum is indexed by search engines, which means your comments can be discoverable by future developers who run into similar issues.</p>

  <p>Executive boards constantly push for digital transformation, but it can be difficult for executives to know where to start. Further, it is easy to become paralyzed by the potential directions and options, which leaves many leaders asking one question: What are the biggest digital strategy mistakes that we should avoid?&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital transformation success needs to operate at three levels — corporate governance, management and execution — but companies make mistakes at all three levels</p></blockquote>
<p>“Over 80% of CEOs responding to our annual CEO Survey said they have a digital transformation program underway to make their companies more digital,” says<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/18594"> Mark Raskino</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner. “However, our recent years’ surveys have also shown a lack of business model change penetration and other indicators, which causes us to think that many of these digital initiatives may not be sufficiently deep corporate transformations.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-revitalize-a-stalled-digital-transformation/">Digital transformation success</a> needs to operate at three levels — corporate governance, management and execution — but companies make mistakes at all three levels that will frustrate transformation. Knowing where those mistakes may happen can help enterprises avoid falling into these traps.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over 80% of CEOs responding to our annual CEO Survey said they have a digital transformation program underway to make their companies more digital</p></blockquote>
 
 Misread the true scope of digital change. Sometimes an enterprise may misread a situation from the outset by, for example, failing to examine how digital forces will change an industry or having an insufficient corporate mission to see and seize product and business model innovation. Not having a strong understanding of what is happening in your industry can lead to a superficial or narrow scope of change for any digital transformation. Raskino says organizations should think in terms of using digital to reinvent what their industry does. 
 Too much inward thinking. Too often organizations focus on what they want to do rather than analyzing customer needs, the opportunities those present, and a full competitive market view for examples and lessons. Raskino said this type of thinking is presuming that digital change is just another operating model change, but that is not the case. “An operating model focus does not consider the overall market. It focuses primarily on efficiency and effectiveness. A business model focus considers the market and how it is monetized. An outside-in perspective is what most successful digital transformation projects hinge on,” he said. 
 “It’s not my job.” Some <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-get-the-board-to-say-yes/">boards of directors</a> treat digital transformation as a management issue and not part of their role, while at the same time, some executive team members avoid the subject and treat it as something owned by IT. This cascading disassociation behavior impedes real change. Digital transformation must be part of the mission of the organization and in the core of its leaders. If it is not, patchy progress may be made, but transformational progress will elude the company. 
 Digital is undefined. Goals are vague. The organization has a hazy and confused vision for digital transformation because digital has not been defined. There are no associated specifics or a coherent plan in place. There is aspiration, and a collection of cool projects, and there is will, but there’s no specificity on what the digital journey is really about. Organizations must do the upfront hard work to define their goals, set specific targets and metrics, and then measure those to ensure the transformation project is on track. 
 Incrementalism. When digital is undefined, initiatives may only be focused on improving today and not putting the funding, systems and specific plans in place for real<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/fight-digital-transformation-fatigue/"> transformation</a>. Management should ask: Is it really “transformational”? The meaning of that word has become very diluted. Digital business works at the level of revenue and business model change and product reinvention. Look for the structural investment. If it is not there, you're very unlikely going to truly transform. 
 Fixed minds. A fixed mindset is one of constrained capabilities. People with fixed mindsets are not in learning mode. Organizations must learn how to develop a growth mindset to build an innovative culture that will thrive in the era of digital business. A growth mindset embraces the idea that new capabilities can be developed through smart learning, good strategies and input from others. Those who embrace this mindset see challenges as opportunities to grow and evolve, and they are resilient even when faced with failure. 
 Overplanning. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/choose-your-digital-transformation-starting-point/">Transforming to digital</a> is more about doing than planning. Organizations can get caught up in endless rounds of analysis paralysis, which slows the transformation project. To combat this, organizations should institutionalize lean startup thinking at every level. Lean startup thinking favors experimentation over top-down planning. This process aims to quickly and iteratively build an innovation to become a “minimum viable product” that can be released to the customer, and then through feedback it continues to evolve the innovation. 
 Technology-centric. Organizations should watch out for buying into the hype of the “next big thing.” Organizations should instead focus on reinventing their industry with a collection of technological tools. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/foster-innovation-to-drive-digital-transformation/">Transformation is never just doing the next big thing</a>. “Aim at unmet needs — the needs of the market and customers that our industry has never served before,” Raskino said. “Use the technological tools collectively to invent solutions to do things nobody could do before.” 
 Culture blindness. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cios-break-through-culture-barriers-to-enable-digital-transformation/">Culture is one of the biggest barriers</a> to scaling digital transformation. Culture is perceived to be big, unwieldy and hard to change. Attributes that may be culture barriers for some are, in fact, enablers for others. Organizations should focus on resetting purpose and beliefs to drive culture change. Determine the purpose of the company, what it yields for the world and what the beliefs are of the people coming to work each day. Use<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-culture-hacks-for-digital-transformation/"> culture hacks</a>, some of which can be implemented in less than 48 hours, to move culture from a barrier to an accelerator.

  People have experienced issues verifying the identity of potential dating matches for years. It is impossible to know if the person you're messaging is the love of your life or a scammer. With Verifiable Credentials like email, phone number and ID documents, BloomID can help solve all of that.
   
  
  
  
  
  

</div>
<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

 -->
<div class='wrap'>

<p>People have been experiencing issues with verifying the identity of potential matches while dating for hundreds of years. Classified ads in newspapers made that worse, and online dating has made it nearly impossible for you to know if the person that just messaged you is, in fact, the person of your dreams, someone trying to scam you, or even someone who poses a potential danger in real life.</p><p>Lots of solutions have been tried and tested to resolve this problem, but none have stuck. Whether you were on Lavalife in the 90s, Match.com or Plenty of Fish in the early 2000s, or are using Tinder or Bumble today, you may always have that sneaking suspicion about who’s really behind the keyboard until one of you gets the courage to ask for a video call or to meet up in person.</p><p>BloomID can help solve all of that. With Verifiable Credentials, like email address, phone number, ID document (with facial matching), social media accounts and more, adding Bloom’s technology to a dating app can significantly reduce the number of people getting fooled and, therefore, souring on your product and the experience. This can have a snowball effect, especially on a smaller platform. Authentic identity makes for authentic connections.</p><p>Today, Match.com provides ID verification for paid users, and checks that ID against a variety of databases to ensure the individual is not a criminal. However, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hillaryflynn/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the">Match Group does not implement this security feature across any of their free platforms</a>, including Plenty of Fish, Tinder, Meetic, Pairs, OkCupid, and others. It readily admits registered offenders are using its free products.</p><p>We didn’t come across any other dating platforms that allow you to verify an identity, including platforms targeted at seniors and retirees, therefore putting individuals at risk of being scammed, assaulted, or worse (<a href="https://www.datingnews.com/industry-trends/online-dating-statistics-what-they-mean-for-future/">see statistics 23-27</a>).</p><p>This problem can be seen as a tradeoff between bringing in a high number of users to your platform versus fewer people using a paid platform, although the latter would introduce more inherent trust. What you can do, instead, is introduce a middle-path: allow people to bring their reusable Verified Credentials to your dating platform to enable verified profiles, and have people self-select whether they want to focus on chatting with people with verified identities or not.</p><p>Let’s see how you can implement BloomID in your app!</p> Let’s Start Server Side <p>Let’s assume you have a back end that can handle some JavaScript in the form of Node.js, or that can be passed a payload from said Node.js library. </p><p>To that end, we’re going to implement <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/verify-kit/overview">Verify Kit</a> so that we can verify someone’s name on their profile is, in fact, the name on their photo ID that they have already verified. Verify Kit makes it simple to go from an http payload to a verified identity document in just a few steps.</p><p>We’re going to install Verify Kit using this command:</p> <code>npm install --save @bloomprotocol/verify-kit
</code> 
<p>Use the validateUntypedResponseData function from verify-kit, which returns an object with a kind property with potential values of 'invalid' or 'validated'. Assuming a 'validated' payload, the object will contain a data property structured as a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">verifiable presentation</a>.</p><p>Next, given a verifiable presentation, we extract the id-document from its verifiableCredential property and parse the JSON payload to receive the raw identity document data, which is structured like this:</p> <code>export interface IBaseAttIDDocData extends IBaseAttDataObj {
    date: TDateOrTime;
    name?: TPersonalName;
    country?: string;
    document_type?: string;
    authentication_result?: 'unknown' | 'passed' | 'failed' | 'skipped' | 'caution' | 'attention';
    biographic?: {
        age?: number;
        dob?: TDateOrTime;
        expiration_date?: TDateOrTime;
        name?: TPersonalName;
        gender?: string;
    };
    classification?: {
        classification_method?: 'automatic' | 'manual';
        id_type_name?: string;
        id_class?: TDocumentClass;
        id_class_name?: string;
        country_code?: string;
        issue_date?: TDate;
        issuer_name?: string;
        issue_type?: string;
        '@provider_specific'?: {
            issuer_code?: string;
            keesing_code?: string;
            generic?: boolean;
        };
    };
    facematch_result?: {
        is_match?: boolean;
        score?: number;
        transaction_id?: string;
    };
    images?: {
        front?: string;
        back?: string;
        selfie?: string;
    };
}
</code> 
<p>The most important properties of an identity document are the authentication_result and facematch_result. Any value in authentication_result that is not 'passed' requires manual review to verify the authenticity of the document. </p><p>Instead of starting from scratch, you can use the server side code from <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter/tree/master/bloom-starter-kyc/server">bloom-starter-kyc</a> as a way to kickstart your integration efforts!</p><p>Once you have all that in place, you’re ready to accept data from Share Kit!</p> Let’s Head Client Side <p>Share Kit is the front end library needed to generate a data sharing request. </p><p>Let’s assume you are building an Android app. You can find the Java Share Kit library here in Bloom’s GitHub account.</p><p>For this demonstration, let’s keep it simple by requesting the ‘id-document’ and ‘facebook’ verifications since you can extract ‘full-name’ from both and, with your own code that we will leave you to write in the language of your choice, compare the two server side!</p> Building the Android Library   Open the ShareKit project in Android Studio and let the project sync with gradle.  When the project is ready, click on the Build menu and then select Clean Project i.e. Build -&gt; Clean Project, in Android Studio.  Then also click on the Build menu and then select Rebuild Project i.e. Build -&gt; Rebuild Project, in Android Studio.  Finally navigate to the ShareKit directory and open the folders app -&gt; build -&gt; outputs -&gt; aar and copy the app-debug.aar library file generated. Paste this file anywhere in your filesystem and preferably rename it to sharekit.aar   Android Installation <p>Make sure your Android project has a minSdkVersion of 16 or greater, otherwise adding the library will cause your project to fail to build.</p><p>Add the sharekit.aar library generate above by doing the following in your Android Studio project:</p>  Click File -&gt; New -&gt; New Module.  Click Import .JAR/.AAR Package then click Next.  Enter the location of the compiled sharekit.aar file then click Finish.  Then make sure the sharekit library is added in your settings.gradle file i.e. include ':app', ':sharekit'  In your projects build.gradle file add a new line for the sharekit lib in the dependencies block i.e. dependencies { implementation project(":sharekit") }  Finally click on Sync Project with Gradle Files for your project to sync with the sharekit library.  <p>If the above steps are done successfully then you should be able to clean and Rebuild your project successfully as specified above i.e. Build -&gt; Clean Project &amp; Build -&gt; Rebuild Project</p> Usage <p>To use RequestButton in your project, do the following:</p>  Import the ShareKit class into your Activity/Fragment i.e. import com.bloom.sharekit.ShareKit;  Then initialize the RequestButton, set the share-kit request data &amp; callback-url and add it to your layout view programmatically like this:   <code>@Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        LinearLayout layout = findViewById(R.id.example_activity);

        // initialize the request data JSON Object and the types array
        JSONObject requestData = new JSONObject();
        JSONArray attestationTypes = new JSONArray();
        try {
            requestData.put("action", ShareKit.attestation);

            requestData.put("org_privacy_policy_url", "https://datingapp.co/legal/privacy");

            // add the attestations
            attestationTypes.put("id-document");
            attestationTypes.put("facebook");
            requestData.put("types", attestationTypes);
        } catch (JSONException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // this is the callback-url/deep link for your app which will be used by the bloom app to re-direct you to your after the request is handled
        String callbackUrl = "https://datingapp.co?token=3b922185-68c6-4e83-9b79-30e0b5fbf873";

        // initialize the button by passsing the activity, bloom requestData and your app's callback-url
        Button bloomButton = new ShareKit().RequestButton(this, requestData, callbackUrl);

        //add button to the layout
        layout.addView(bloomButton);

        // set the button padding if necessary
        layout.setPadding(30,50,10,10);
    }
</code> 
<p>That token above is unique to your app. It is not a token provided by Bloom. You choose your own as it’s a unique identifier for your app, allowing you to distinguish data sharing requests from multiple sources, or to ensure the data is being shared from your app, and not someone else’s.</p><p>Note that for a new Android Studio project, the layout created will be a ConstraintLayout instead of a LinearLayout as shown above. Also please add an id to the layout xml file before initializing it so that it looks as follows:</p> <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout 
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:id="@+id/example_activity"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity"&gt;

   
&lt;/android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout&gt;
</code> 
  And then initialize the layout as a ConstraintLayout instead of a LinearLayout i.e. ConstraintLayout layout = findViewById(R.id.example_activity);  After this, everything else in the above example will remain the same.  <p>4. Finally build and install the APK into a device or emulator and once your app pops up, you should see the RequestButton displayed!</p><p>Also, the first time you tap the button, you'll be presented with a variety of options for which app to use to open the link. Just select Open With -&gt; Bloom -&gt; ALWAYS so that it defaults to opening the Bloom App if it's installed instead of a web browser.</p><p>So how can this look and feel in a dating app? Let’s see some examples.</p><p>Here’s what the view for editing your own profile could look like:</p>A screenshot of our demonstration dating app featuring the "Verify with Bloom" button<p>And if “Felix” goes through the process of verifying his ID, that process looks like this.</p>  Tap “Verify with Bloom”  View and confirm the data sharing request  The Bloom data sharing request for DatingApp, our demo app<p>3. &nbsp;Success!</p>The success screen. We completed the data sharing request!<p>Felix’s view of his settings and profile could now look like this, with the Bloom icon (or another indicator of some kind) showing that he has verified his name is actually Felix.</p>The user's view of their own profile after verifying their name<p>Ta-da! He’s verified his name is actually Felix, we confirmed this server-side using the two Verifiable Credentials provided (the ‘full-name’ subtype from the ‘id-document’ and ‘facebook’), and so now can apply some kind of indicator to his profile to show that. </p><p>Now, how would this look to other users when viewing profiles of potential matches? We have some examples of that as well. </p>A view of Felix's profile when viewed as othersAnd a view of Mia's profile as seen by others<p>You could also provide the ability for users to verify their age, their phone number, email address, or implement some computer vision to compare the photo on their ID document to their dating profile photo!</p><p>That is just one of the many use cases where you can use Bloom’s open source technology to enhance trust and security within your platform on a user-permissioned basis, while maintaining data security and privacy. Verify the data provided, delete it from your Verify Kit service, and allow your users to connect knowing you have taken at least one concrete step towards making your dating platform safer for all parties.</p><p>More Resources:</p>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/share-kit/overview">Share Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/share-kit-android">Share Kit Android GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/share-kit-ios">Share Kit iOS GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/verify-kit/overview">Verify Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/verify-kit">Verify Kit GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter">Bloom Starter GitHub Repository</a>   Bloom: Your Data, Your Credit, Your Privacy <p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all in one simple app. No more centralized data storage.

<p><a href="https://authenteq.com/ready-for-scale-may-june-product-update/">Last month at Authenteq</a>: don’t have a developer team on-site? We have your back! Last month we wrapped up the building of the new infrastructure that allowed for API simplification, improved security measures, and integration speed. What is more, we added more languages to our service and implemented nifty image compression features to make sure that you can maximize your conversion. And even though we work hard this month, our product update is short, sweet, and full of automation. Here’s what we achieved this month:</p>



 Automated flagging&nbsp; 



<p>Automation is the key to successfully scaling internal ID verification and KYC processes. As we want you to become efficient with your time and resources, we decided to automate the flagging process. What does this mean? Instead of your compliance team having to flag suspicious users, our technology does that for you – automatically. This improvement allows for eliminating the negative side of the human factor. Therefore, lean back, save time, and let our AI-powered solution handle the fraudsters for you.&nbsp;<br></p>



 Data quick view&nbsp; 



<p>Every click matters, and we’re aware of that. To simplify the dashboard and your daily workflow, we’ve improved dashboard data visualization. Now you can take a glimpse at the user data by hovering over the user account instead of having to view the user information and come back to the main dashboard.&nbsp; </p>



 All onboard&nbsp; 



<p>Remember our old blockchain system – the idea is still extraordinarily futuristic and something we might come back to once the world is ready for <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/privacy-by-design/">privacy-by-design</a> notions. Long story short, we shut it down and migrated the last client to the new system. All of that went hassle-free, and we’re happy to run our services and cater to our customers on one, continuously improving the system.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>The “bricks to clicks” trend of retailers ramping up their e-commerce presence to keep up with the likes of Amazon is at light speed amid the pandemic, and it’s upending retail supply chains everywhere. There are many reasons for this turmoil: Retailers may keep less stock on hand, people may not be buying as many things for outside the house (clothes, jewelry, etc.), manufacturers themselves may need to slow production, and the list goes on.</p>
<p><br>
The disruption is driving a need for manufacturers to take more digital paths to market. Don’t get me wrong—supply chains will always exist—but we’re seeing an increase in the number of manufacturers who are shifting how they connect with customers. And it’s raising the bar for customer shopping experiences, making the demand to offer <a>extraordinary digital experiences</a> an imperative.</p>

  <p>COVID-19 might dominate the headlines, but it’s just one of eight key factors that will reshape business in this decade. The global pandemic will have long-lasting and far-reaching impact on the business world, but other shifts in macrobusiness environment areas — such as oil prices, weakening international relationships and climate change — have not gone away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Highly leveraged debt, crumbling international alliances and bubble-like asset prices. These were overdue for a reckoning</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-functional-leaders-should-know-about-scenario-planning/">Executives </a>will have to grapple with a host of other challenges during the 2020s, but from that maelstrom will rise new business opportunities.</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic arrived at a time when economies were already on the edge,” says<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/18594/Mark-Raskino"> Mark Raskino</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner. “A decade-long boom, generated substantially from inexpensive finance and lower-cost energy, led to structural stresses such as highly leveraged debt, crumbling international alliances and bubble-like asset prices. These were overdue for a reckoning.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 No. 1: Global pandemic 
<p>The impact of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">COVID-19 </a>will depend heavily on how long the pandemic lasts. A shorter time frame means that people will revert more quickly to pre-pandemic ways of operating. For example, after 9/11, people reverted to normal flying behavior three years later. If the pandemic persists, it’s more likely to have long-lasting societal effects. For example, the Great Depression impacted food habits for decades.</p>
<p>Think about how the pandemic will affect societal behaviors like personal hygiene and personal space norms, social gatherings and family interactions, the savings ratio and consumer buying habits.</p>
 No. 2: Market crash and recession 
<p>Although COVID-19 served as the visible catalyst for the 2020 market crashes and subsequent recovery, the reality is the markets were already fragile and precarious. In fact, Gartner found that in 2018 and 2019, half of CEOs were anticipating and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/use-this-3-phase-framework-to-navigate-the-covid-19-downturn/">preparing for an economic downturn</a>, which makes this recession unique to those in 2002–2003 and 2009.</p>
<p>Consider a variety of business and economic growth rate curves and test recovery plans against different possibilities. It’s likely that organizations will see reconfiguration and trend shifts in capital markets.</p>
 No. 3: Tech exuberance fade 
<p>For the past 10 years, a variety of game-changing emerging technologies were a big focus for companies looking to innovate and differentiate. This tech enthusiasm may deflate during the next few years. Some technology, like <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), will continue to be popular, but uptake of more “bleeding-edge” technologies like <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-quantum-computing/">quantum computing</a> and<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-reality-of-blockchain/"> blockchain</a>, with less-obvious use cases, could slow.</p>
<p>Revisit plans for speculative investment in new technology as skeptical boards reduce interest in less-proven technology. Begin thinking about restructuring plans for digital transformation in the current environment. There will be a trend toward outcome focus and pragmatism over open experimentation and innovating with the latest technologies.</p>
 No. 4: Talent shortage 
<p>Despite an increase in unemployment rates globally, key talent shortages will continue to plague executives. While COVID-19 has increased unemployment and underemployment, it has not created <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lack-of-skills-threatens-digital-transformation/">new pools of in-demand talent</a>.</p>
<p>Reconsider what types of skill sets will be needed in the post-COVID-19 world, and begin or increase reskilling programs during downtimes. Also consider ways to widen the talent availability pool by rethinking remote work or gig economy options.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/build-the-workforce-you-need-post-covid-19/">Build the Workforce You Need Post-COVID-19</a></p>
 No. 5: Systemic mistrust 
<p>Even before COVID-19, global consumer and citizen trust was at an all-time low. Now, closed borders, combined with a mistrust of “other”— even previously close trading partners — threatens to widen the gap. However, it’s possible that over the long term, a common enemy in the virus will inspire empathy, common purpose and cooperation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, consider whether consumers will continue to be loyal to long-standing brands or shift to those that have supplies of limited goods. CEOs had to make difficult decisions in response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>See if those actions have irrevocably shifted attitudes toward the brand. A more personal connection — such as an open, authentic and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/embrace-proactive-customer-experience-in-the-midst-of-covid-19/">empathetic email to customers</a> — might help overcome distrust.</p>
 No. 6: Weak productivity 
<p>Slow productivity growth and a lack of focus on efficiency and productivity has been at odds with the economic growth of the past decade. COVID-19 could drive changes that require executives to take a closer look at operations of the organization, from out-of-date products to bureaucratic roadblocks.</p>
<p>Consider how an increased proportion of remote working will affect overall productivity. The cost of operating in a socially distanced world will increase costs, requiring significant reengineering to return to pre-COVID productivity.</p>
 No. 7: Oil price conflict 
<p>The current global economy relies on oil. At its peak in 2008, oil reached a price per barrel of $150, but now faces the opposite and unplanned extreme. In March 2020, due to a dispute between Russia and Saudi Arabia, the price per barrel dropped to around $20 and after recovering, has hovered around $40. This has the ability to reset assumptions that are the basis of global competition in many industries and reshape economies.</p>
<p>Consider how hydrocarbon energy will compete with solar and wind and how this will impact global aviation, chemicals, plastics and others. Also, consider the possibility that an overshoot on oil supply cutbacks could cause the price to spike again.</p>
 No. 8: Climate change 
<p>At the very start of 2020, climate change was moving to the forefront of framing long-term business strategy and plans. Although temporarily overshadowed by COVID-19, executives should assume it will continue to influence businesses for the next decade.</p>

  <p>Java is one of the most mature and persistent development languages that exists. Recently, it shifted to a 6-month release schedule, enabling it to deliver more frequent updates to the language.
One of the changes introduced in Java 9 was the modular system.</p>

<p>The Java Platform Module System (JPMS) adds two fundamental capabilities when building Java apps:</p>
 
   Reliable configuration - replacing the brittle, error-prone class-path mechanism with a means for program components to declare explicit dependencies upon one another. 
   Strong encapsulation - allowing a component to declare which of its public types are accessible to other components and which are not. 
 

<p>Packages may be grouped into modules that serve as building blocks in the construction of very large programs. The declaration of a module specifies which other modules (packages,  classes, and interfaces) are required to compile and run code.</p>

<p>While we have the visibility modifiers—public, private, protected, and default—they are not enough to provide external visibility. A common example used to illustrate the problem is a “Util” class, this class may be used throughout a library from various packages within a JAR file but is NOT meant to be used outside of the library. JPMS can help with this type of situation.</p>

 Introduction 

<p>When Java 9 was created, the JDK went under a major refactoring to modularize its content. It created various modules  to organize the contents.  Some examples include:  <code>java.base</code>, <code>java.sql</code>, and <code>java.xml</code>(along with many others). To date, there are a total of 60 modules in Java 14 JDK.</p>

<p><code>java.base</code> has fundamental classes like <code>Object</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Double</code>, etc. While <code>java.sql</code> has classes related to accessing the JDBC API like <code>ResultSet</code>, <code>Connection</code> and others. Additionally, <code>java.xml</code> has classes related to XML manipulation like <code>XMLStreamReader</code>, <code>XMLStreamWriter</code> and similar classes in that vein.</p>

<p>The modularization enabled the possibility of reducing the Java runtime to include just the <code>java.base</code> if your application only depends on this module. By using the <code>jlink</code> tool that is bundled with the JDK, you can create a micro runtime with only the JDK modules you need. This post won’t cover how to use <code>jlink</code>—as it is not the focus—but you can see an example on this <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/jlink">Baeldung article</a>.</p>

<p>For the rest of this article, you should have at least some basic understanding of Spring Boot, Maven, and REST web services principles as well as Docker installed on your machine.</p>

 Install a Java 9+ JDK 

<p>First, you’ll need a Java 9+ JDK in order to use modules. If you have been using Java 8, you’ll likely have to download a separate JDK with a version of 9 or later to be used for this tutorial. This project is set up to use JDK 11 in this tutorial. You can download the JDKs from <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">AdoptOpenJDK</a>. Just make sure your JAVA_HOME environment variable is pointing to that JDK.</p>

 Project Structure 

<p>In this article, we’ll be covering how to develop a simple application with two modules: the <code>application</code> module (that contains the web-facing classes) and the <code>persistence</code> module (that contains the data access layer). We’ll also be using a couple of dependencies (<code>spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb</code> and <code>okta-spring-boot-starter</code>) to illustrate how they are configured when building a modular application.</p>

<p>The project source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/brunocleite/spring-boot-using-java-modules">GitHub</a></p>

 How to Structure a Modular Project with Maven 

<p>We’re going to create this project folder structure manually to better understand it. Each module will live inside a separate directory and have its own <code>pom.xml</code> file. There will also be a <code>pom.xml</code> on the project root that will serve as the parent pom for the modules.  Create the following folder structure:</p>

   <code>.
├── application
│   ├── pom.xml
│   └── src
│       └── main
│           ├── java
│           └── resources
├── persistence
│   └── src
│       └── main
│           └── java
└── pom.xml
</code>   

<p>First, let’s define the root <code>pom.xml</code>. It contains the common <code>&lt;parent&gt;</code> indication to <code>spring-boot-started-parent</code> and two entries in the <code>&lt;module&gt;</code> section. These entries are the names of the directories for the modules we are developing. Please note that they are specific to Maven and denote sub-projects, having nothing to do with the Java modules that we’ll be working on later.</p>

   <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
    &lt;parent&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;2.3.1.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;relativePath/&gt; &lt;!-- lookup parent from repository --&gt;
    &lt;/parent&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.developer&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-with-modules&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;packaging&gt;pom&lt;/packaging&gt;

    &lt;properties&gt;
    	&lt;java.version&gt;11&lt;/java.version&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;

    &lt;modules&gt;
        &lt;module&gt;application&lt;/module&gt;
        &lt;module&gt;persistence&lt;/module&gt;
    &lt;/modules&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</code>   

<p>The <code>persistence</code> module will have a <code>pom.xml</code> like the one below and point to the parent <code>pom.xml</code> that we defined earlier. This will have a dependency on <code>spring-data-mongo</code> since we’ll be saving our data to a Mongo DB.</p>

   <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
    &lt;parent&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.developer&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-with-modules&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/parent&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-with-modules-persistence&lt;/artifactId&gt;

    &lt;dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</code>   

<p>Finally, the <code>application</code> module will have a <code>pom.xml</code> (below), pointing to the parent <code>pom.xml</code> (above). It will also have a dependency on <code>spring-boot-starter-web</code>— as we’ll be creating REST endpoints on it—and a dependency on our <code>persistence</code> module:</p>

   <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
    &lt;parent&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.developer&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-with-modules&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/parent&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-with-modules-app&lt;/artifactId&gt;

    &lt;dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-web&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.developer&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-with-modules-persistence&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;${project.version}&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;

    &lt;build&gt;
        &lt;plugins&gt;
            &lt;plugin&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/plugins&gt;
    &lt;/build&gt;

&lt;/project&gt;
</code>   

<p>To compile the project, run <code>mvn compile</code> from the project root.</p>

<p>NOTE: Don’t confuse Maven modules with Java Modules.</p>

 
   
    <p>Maven modules are used to separate a project into multiple sub-projects. The main project will have a <code>pom.xml</code> referencing sub-projects in the <code>&lt;modules&gt;</code> section. Each sub-project will have its own <code>pom.xml</code>. When building the main project, it will automatically build the sub-projects too.</p>
   
   
    <p>Java modules is another name for JPMS (Java Platform Module System), it was added in JDK 9 under the name Project Jigsaw. It allows applications (packaged as JAR or WAR) to define a <code>module-info.java</code>. This special module-info file contains a set of directives which define its dependencies and which classes are exported for use by other libraries.</p>
   
 

 Build an Application Without Java Modules 

<p>The presence of <code>module-info.java</code> in an application’s source root defines that it is using Java modules. You will first build the application without JPMS and enable it in a later step.</p>

 Create the Persistence Module 

<p>Create a class <code>Bird</code> in the persistence module in <code>persistence/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/animals/bird/Bird.java</code>. This will represent the entity that we’ll be saving to DB.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.animals.bird;

import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

public class Bird {

    @Id
    private String id;

    private String specie;
    private String size;

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getSpecie() {
        return specie;
    }

    public void setSpecie(String specie) {
        this.specie = specie;
    }

    public String getSize() {
        return size;
    }

    public void setSize(String size) {
        this.size = size;
    }
}

</code>   

<p>Now we’re going to create a repository to save this entity to DB. <code>Spring Data MongoDB</code> does this for us automatically, creating the CRUD operations so all we have to create is an interface extending MongoRepository.
Create this class in  <code>persistence/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/animals/bird/BirdRepository.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.animals.bird;

import org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.MongoRepository;

public interface BirdRepository extends MongoRepository&lt;Bird, String&gt; {
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, for the persistence module. We’ll be creating a service class to expose the persistence operations in <code>persistence/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/animals/bird/BirdPersistence.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.animals.bird;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import java.util.List;

@Component
public class BirdPersistence {

    private BirdRepository birdRepository;

    @Autowired
    public BirdPersistence(BirdRepository birdRepository) {
        this.birdRepository = birdRepository;
    }

    @PostConstruct
    void postConstruct(){
        Bird sampleBird = new Bird();
        sampleBird.setSpecie("Hummingbird");
        sampleBird.setSize("small");
        save(sampleBird);
    }

    public void save(Bird bird) {
        birdRepository.save(bird);
    }

    public List&lt;Bird&gt; get() {
        return birdRepository.findAll();
    }
}

</code>   

 Create the Web Application Module 

<p>In the application module, create the main application class <code>application/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/SpringBootModulesApplication.java</code> annotated with <code>@SpringBootApplication</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootModulesApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootModulesApplication.class, args);
    }
}

</code>   

<p>Add a controller to expose REST operations on the Bird classes
This class will be stored on <code>application/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/BirdController.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer;

import com.okta.developer.animals.bird.Bird;
import com.okta.developer.animals.bird.BirdPersistence;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.util.List;

@RestController
public class BirdController {

    private BirdPersistence birdPersistence;

    public BirdController(BirdPersistence birdPersistence) {
        this.birdPersistence = birdPersistence;
    }

    @GetMapping("bird")
    public List&lt;Bird&gt; getBird() {
        return birdPersistence.get();
    }

    @PostMapping("bird")
    public void saveBird(@RequestBody Bird bird) {
        birdPersistence.save(bird);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>At this point, the application is functional and can be run. Start a MongoDB instance using the following docker command:</p>

   <code>docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo:3.6-xenial
</code>   

<p>Then, go to the project root and run:</p>

   <code>mvn install &amp;&amp; mvn spring-boot:run -pl application
</code>   

<p>If everything goes correctly, you’ll be able to navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/bird</code> and see a JSON output like this:</p>

   <code>[{"id":"5f03ff7277a08a55ae73c8b9","specie":"Hummingbird","size":"small"}]
</code>   

 Secure Your Web Application 

<p>Before we move on to using Java modules, it’s time to tune our app and make it secure by adding a single dependency and a couple configuration properties.</p>

<p>Add the following dependency to your <code>application/pom.xml</code> file:</p>
   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;okta-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.3.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

 Register an Application on Okta 

<p>To begin, sign up for a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">forever-free Okta developer account</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’re signed into Okta, register your client application.</p>

 
   In the top menu, click on Applications 
   Select Add Application 
   Click Web and then Next 
   Enter <code>Spring Boot with Java Modules</code> as the Name (this value doesn’t matter, so feel free to change it) 
   Change the Login redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> 
   Click Done 
 

 Configure the App with Okta Information 

<p>Create a file <code>application/src/main/resources/application.properties</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.clientId={clientId}
okta.oauth2.clientSecret={clientSecret} 
</code>   

<p>You can find {clientId} and {clientSecret} on the General tab of the Okta application you just crated:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can find {yourOktaDomain} on your Okta dashboard:</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you restart the app and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/bird</code> in an incognito/private browser window, you’ll see a login page.</p>

 Using Java Modules 

<p>Now it is time to modularize the app. This is achieved by placing a file <code>module-info.java</code> in each project’s source root (<code>src/main/java</code>). We’ll be doing this for both our modules: <code>application</code> and <code>persistence</code>. There are two ways to modularize a Java app—top-down and bottom-up. In this tutorial we’ll be showing the bottom-up approach; modularizing the libraries before the app. This approach is preferable as we’ll have <code>persistence</code> already modularized when writing the <code>application</code> and <code>module-info.java</code>. If <code>application</code> was modularized first then <code>persistence</code> would be treated as an automatic module and you would have to use the JAR file name for the module name.</p>

 Modularize the <code>persistence</code> Library 

<p>Create a module declaration file <code>persistence/src/main/java/module-info.java</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>module com.okta.developer.modules.persistence {

    requires java.annotation;
    requires spring.beans;
    requires spring.context;
    requires spring.data.commons;
    requires spring.data.mongodb;

    exports com.okta.developer.animals.bird;
}
</code>   

<p>Each <code>requires</code> keyword signalizes that this module will be depending on some other module.
Spring (version 5) is not modularized yet, its JAR files don’t have the <code>module-info.java</code>. 
When you have a dependency on the <code>modulepath</code> (formerly the classpath for non-modular applications) like this they will be available as <code>automatic modules</code>.</p>

<p>An <code>automatic module</code> derives its name using a two-step process:</p>
 
   If the JAR defines the <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code> header in its `MANIFEST.MF, then that property defines the module’s name. 
   Alternately, the JAR file name is used to determine the name.
The second approach is intrinsically unstable, so no modules with a dependency on such an automatic module should be published in public Maven repositories. 
 

<p>In Spring 5, the <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code> metadata was added to all Spring  libraries, if/when Spring defines module-info, the metadata in your application does NOT need to change.</p>

<p>The <code>exports</code> keyword exports all classes in that package. When another module uses a <code>requires</code> clause referencing that package, it will have access to the package classes.</p>

<p>In this example, the module is exporting all classes under the <code>com.okta.developer.animals.bird</code> package.</p>

 Modularize the <code>application</code> Project 

<p>Create a module declaration file <code>application/src/main/java/module-info.java</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>module com.okta.developer.modules.app {

    requires com.okta.developer.modules.persistence;

    requires spring.web;
    requires spring.boot;
    requires spring.boot.autoconfigure;
}
</code>   

<p>This one is similar to the first but, along with the Spring dependencies, we also have the <code>com.okta.developer.modules.persistence</code> dependency.</p>

<p>By adding the <code>requires com.okta.developer.modules.persistence</code> this module will have access to the package that was exported: <code>com.okta.developer.animals.bird</code>.</p>

 Running the Application 

<p>Go to the project root and run</p>
   <code>mvn install &amp;&amp; mvn spring-boot:run -pl application
</code>   

<p>If everything is operating correctly you’ll be able to login and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/bird</code> where you’ll see JSON output.</p>

 Learning More About Java Modular System 

<p>The Java Modular System is an excellent addition to the Java ecosystem. It helps organize and isolate classes that were otherwise needlessly exposed. By looking at the application <code>module-info.java</code>, you can see a blueprint of the application dependencies.</p>

<p>This topic is broad and, if you want to learn more, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22OW5t_Mbnk">talk by Alex Buckley</a> is an excellent start.</p>

<p>If you have an existing Spring Boot application that you’d like to have use the modular system, this other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxsCYxZ1gXU">talk by Jaap Coomans</a> will help you out.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is undeniably the first line of defense for organizations worldwide. It enables employees to securely access applications while enhancing control and transparency. But IAM is also on the change. It is already more than just the traditional employee IAM. Digital business requires advanced identity services, well beyond the human identities.</p>
<p>The segregation between various dimensions of IAM is blurring. IAM today treads the line between providing security and acting as a business enabler. It has left behind the notion of being "just IT" and turned into a necessity for implementing security and policy and a facilitator of modern business models.&nbsp;But how can security leaders turn the challenges, both legacy and new, into opportunities to mitigate risk and add value to the business? And all this in a way that will elevate the position, and change the perception, of security at the same time?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/remote_work_iam"></a>

  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a wide range of strategic planning activities. As the focus turns largely to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/">recovery and renewal</a>, functional leaders are increasingly pulled into enterprise conversations about likely outcomes when the way forward is neither clear nor certain. They also have to plan for a range of potential outcomes for their own functions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scenarios are compelling descriptions of possible futures — not necessarily the most probable ones, but plausible, coherent and substantially different ones</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Business models are evolving frequently, particularly as executives consider which pandemic-related trends will become permanent. This requires a prompt shift in the strategy that defines how the enterprise will play and win — and requires all functional leaders to be prepared to support a new strategy,” says Caroline Angle, Principal, Advisory, Gartner.</p>
<p>“Those who understand how disruption affects enterprise strategic and operational decisions can make small but powerful changes to prepare their own teams to act on the risk and opportunities that come from volatility.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36189"]</p>
 Scenarios don't forecast the future; they explore what’s possible 
<p>Many functional leaders already serve as strategic advisors to corporate-level scenario planning exercises, but far fewer have experience in scenario planning for their own function. Even those who work regularly with their CFOs on financial scenario planning — tied more directly to the operating plan — may need to expand their capabilities to apply the discipline of scenario planning to identify and develop their own strategic assumptions.</p>
<p>“Scenarios are compelling descriptions of possible futures, not necessarily the most probable ones, but plausible, coherent and substantially different ones,” says Angle.</p>
<p>As such, scenarios aren’t intended to forecast the future. They are neither predictions nor contingency plans. And they aren’t the same as strategic options, which are things within an organization's control. Scenarios are external, outside of the organization’s control.</p>

 Know the objectives for your function 
<p>Ultimately, the objectives of scenario planning for the function are the same as at the corporate level:</p>
 
 Maintain focus on critical growth and transformation initiatives during disruption. 
 Identify “surefire” strategic decisions to pursue, regardless of which future unfolds. 
 Perform due diligence on critical short-term decisions, and make strategic course corrections as needed. 
 Prepare the team to mitigate potential risks, and provide timely risk-aligned guidance for different scenarios. 
 
<blockquote>
<p>Scenario planning can often come across as a “blue-sky exercise,” so make the exercise pragmatic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can’t, however, simply apply the outputs of enterprisewide planning to finance, assurance or other functions — primarily because the high altitude of organizations’ plans fails to consider the implications for functions’ strategies, risk exposure, demand and supplies.</p>
<p>For example, at the corporate level, responding to a market turn might translate into efforts to attract new customers. But for a function, it might mean renegotiating with suppliers or increasing support for ad hoc workload surges.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz02NzYzNjBmN2NjMjAxMWVhOWE4ZjBhN2E0NDAyMjczOQ=="></a></p>
 Diagnose the implications of scenarios for your function 
<p>For each scenario cascaded down from the enterprise level, functional leaders need to diagnose and articulate the implications on two fronts:</p>
 
 Supply-demand needs analysis. Review scenarios and understand how each might impact the organization’s demand for the function’s services. Consider how your function may need to increase or decrease its available resources in response. 
 Strategy-risk exposure and opportunity. Determine the risks and opportunities created by a specific scenario. Consider whether those risks and opportunities significantly change the work that your function will do to support the strategy. 
 
<p>Once the implications, risks and opportunities are clear, adjust the function’s strategy, goals and projects or initiatives for a given scenario. Translate these into action plans by deciding which levers (e.g., people, processes, systems, budget) you should pull to meet business needs, manage risks and capitalize on opportunities.</p>
<p>Action plans should match the severity of the implications and tie back to the function’s core strategy.</p>
 Bring scenario planning down to earth 
<p>Scenario planning can often come across as a “blue-sky exercise,” so make the exercise pragmatic by:</p>
 
 Leading functional teams to define actions they must either start or stop doing right now to prepare for the future scenario 
 Assigning action items (e.g., running a cost optimization pilot project) to specific staff members 
 Participant diversity is critical. Typically, managers’ perspectives are based on their experience, and they can provide input on resourcing. Frontline staff can contribute from operational and workload-impact perspectives. The variety of viewpoints helps reveal interdependencies and uncovers a complete set of potential implications. 
 
<p>The outcome is a playbook of scenario-independent strategic actions (i.e., surefire moves) and a set of actions that are contingent on each scenario’s emergence (i.e., scenario-specific moves). This approach can make strategy execution more resilient because it allows functional leaders — in the event of scenario changes — to simply substitute the original actions with scenario-specific actions without the need for a full-blown strategy review.</p>

 Prepare to capture opportunities 
<p>As teams craft risk response strategies, they should also spend time identifying opportunities to revamp strategy, budget and talent plans.</p>
<p>For example, as functions considered the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-prepare-for-the-u-k-s-uncertain-brexit-terms/">threats of Brexit</a>-related scenarios, they likely identified risks such as visa changes for non-U.K. staff and supply issues from third-party service providers moving location. But opportunities also surfaced to create new business partnerships and bridge capability gaps by tapping into latent talent pools in areas of the EU.</p>
<p>Focusing on action items that will help the functional team get ahead of uncertainties is more motivational for functional teams than being left to react to negative effects — and is less stressful for those who must execute the action plan.</p>

   Prior to COVID-19, the top priority of 51% of general managers (GMs) for 2020 was to grow revenue from existing products and services, and 35% agreed their second priority was to grow revenue from new products and services.

  <p>Prior to COVID-19, the top priority of 51% of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-succeed-as-a-new-technology-manager/">general managers </a>(GMs) for 2020 was to grow revenue from existing products and services, and 35% agreed their second priority was to grow revenue from new products and services.</p>
<p>But leading high-tech GMs now must pivot. Although GMs were previously concerned with making their numbers, today their top question is, “How do we successfully navigate the crisis?”</p>
<p>In late 2019, Gartner conducted a survey of more than 200 technology GMs regarding their priorities, effectiveness and future plan, but the unexpected global pandemic has pushed all GMs to think differently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[swg_ad id="36151"]</p>
<p>According to Gartner, global IT spending is expected to fall 7.2% in 2020 and not recover globally until 2022 or later. For high-tech executives, the key to success will be how they bounce forward (not back). The level of social, economic, business and technology change is transforming the GM’s role and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the crisis changes customer and market expectations, priorities, values and needs, it’s never been more important for GMs to rethink plans and approaches, while they take on new responsibilities that include gaining deeper customer and market intelligence, incorporating new market and technology developments, and responding to the current changes.</p>

<p>These added responsibilities have made the GM role more complex, making its effectiveness, particularly through a crisis, matter more than ever because it acts as a reflection of the company; the more effective the GM, the more ambitious and diverse the company’s growth plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“An effective general manager will build teams and organizational connections to gain the alignment, authority and funding for success,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/22308">Mark McDonald</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a “disruptive crisis,” general managers need to recognize broad realities, embrace current challenges and lead for the future.&nbsp;</p>

					 <p>Last week, the Decentralized Identity Foundation <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/building-interoperable-zkp-credential-systems-70bc20a8a809">announced work on interoperable zero-knowledge proof schemes</a> that Trinsic participated in. Since then, we’ve had some folks ask us, “What are zero-knowledge proofs?” It’s a great subject for our first Trinsic Basics post—a series of blog posts geared toward educating people who are new to the community about the powerful aspects of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) and verifiable credentials. So let’s kick it off!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In short, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) allow you to prove a piece of information is true (like, that you’re over 18) without revealing the information itself (your birthdate). For this post, we’ll talk about ZKPs in the context of SSI.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 The concept 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Suppose there’s a circular cave that has a door in the back (see the drawings below for detail). The door in the back requires a 4-digit code to unlock, and the only way from one side to the other is through the door. If you want to prove to your friend that you know the code without revealing the code, how could you do it? Easy! Hangout at the back by the door and come out whichever side your friend asks you to. If you do this enough times successfully, your friend will feel confident you know the code. Through this process, you will have proven you know the code without revealing the code.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							
																					When your friend isn't looking, you go into one side of the cave.¹
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							
																					You wait for your friend to tell you which side to come out of.²
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							
																					If you succeed enough times, your friend will trust that you know the code.³
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Applying ZKPs to verifiable credentials and SSI gives individuals the ability to leverage this power in their everyday lives.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 When would ZKPs be helpful? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Consider a simple proof-of-age scenario. In the United States, for example, you must be 21 years old to rent a car. What if you could prove you are at least 21 years old to the rental car company without revealing your actual birthdate? Instead of handing them your driver’s license (which includes your birthdate and other personal information such as your home address), a ZKP would allow you to send a digital <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/glossary#proof">proof</a> that simply states you are 21 or older.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other potential use cases for ZKPs include the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Qualifying for a loan. Instead of revealing your actual credit score to the bank, you can use a ZKP to prove that your credit score is above a certain number. The bank can trust that your credit is above a certain threshold that it defines, and you don’t have to reveal more than is necessary.  Proof of Address. If you needed to prove you lived in a certain voting district, you could use a ZKP to prove you lived in the correct area, without disclosing your address.  Not a Bot. Using ZKPs, you could prove that you are a verified person through any business flow, without disclosing any information about yourself.  <p>These scenarios center around human traits, but there are plenty of industrial, medical, automotive, and other interesting use cases as well. ZKPs are useful any time privacy or data minimization is a priority.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 How you can use ZKPs 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic allows you to take advantage of the power of ZKPs through our platform. First, you will need a digital wallet. The <a href="http://www.trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet">Trinsic Wallet</a> is a great place to start.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Second, you’ll need some credentials in that wallet. You can use the Trinsic Studio to create your own credentials in less than 5 minutes. Or you can get some sample credentials by doing a <a href="https://trinsic.id/getting-essential-workers-back-to-work-with-ssi/">demo</a> or <a href="https://www.metadigital.tech/demo/">two</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have a digital wallet with credentials, you’re ready to prove some stuff about yourself! To create a verifier, head to the <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Trinsic Studio</a> and click on “Verifications.” Click the “Create Verification Template” button, then the “+ Policy” button, then select “Predicate.”</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>There are a lot of powerful things you can do with these verification templates, but we’ll just focus on the ZKP for now. As you can see, in this example we’re setting up a verification policy that will ask someone to prove their age is ≥ 18.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>After I’ve set up the policy, I can send it to the digital wallet. Here’s what it looks like:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>From here, the digital wallet allows you to select from any credential that satisfies the policy you sent to it.&nbsp;It’s that easy! You’ve successfully presented a proof of age without revealing any personal data.</p>

					 <p>While this was a lightweight introduction to zero-knowledge proofs, the topic is rich with technical complexity. At Trinsic, we strive to take complex topics and make them simple to implement. If you’d like to get started with zero-knowledge proofs in less than 10 minutes, head to the Trinsic Studio and <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">get started</a>!</p>

The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   The market capitalization of the major stablecoins increased to $12.223&nbsp;billion.  Last week, the circulation of USDC, BUSD, and DAI increased by 6.6 million, 6.17 million, and 7.88 million, while the circulation of USDT remained unchanged.  The number of Terra users increased to 1.758 million. In the past 6 months, the number of Terra users has increased by 10.57% on average every&nbsp;month.  In the past 30 days, Terra has an average of 5,562 daily active&nbsp;users.  As of the evening of July 19, CHAI, the payment gateway (wallet) of Terra is the DApps with the most active users, with 44,300 active users in the past 24&nbsp;hours.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past week(July 11, 2020, ~ July 17, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market circulation of major stablecoins is approximately $12.223 billion, and the market capitalization continues to&nbsp;grow.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>In the past week, the market capitalization of stablecoins has increased by approximately $5.29 million. Among them, the circulation of USDC, BUSD, DAI, and GUSD increased by 6.6 million, 6.17 million, 7.88 million, and 910,000, while the circulation of PAX, TUSD, and HUSD decreased by 7.67 million, 100,000, and 8.49 million.

Algorithmic stablecoin project Terra&nbsp;(LUNA) <p>In the seventh stablecoin report, we introduced the compliance and asset transparency of commonly used collateralized stablecoins. Among them, USDT, which is the most used, has the worst compliance, which also brings a certain risk to the entire cryptocurrency market. In addition to collateralized stablecoins, there is also a class of algorithmic stablecoins. In this report, we will introduce LUNA with a 50% price increased in a&nbsp;week.</p><p>Source: TradingView</p><p>Terra was founded by the founder of TMON, South Korea’s second-largest e-commerce company, and received $32 million of investment from Binance Labs, Okex, Huobi Capital, Polychain Capital, FBG Capital, and other institutions at the beginning of establishment in 2018. The current market capitalization of LUNA is $121 million, ranking 71st in CoinMarketCap.</p><p>There are two types of tokens on Terra, the native token Luna and the stablecoin family Terra, burning Luna allows for the minting of Terra. Terra includes stablecoins anchored to the US dollar, euro, RMB, yen, pound, won, and a basket of currencies. Other types of stablecoins can be added by voting. Different from MakerDAO and other CDP Stablecoin Systems, there is a corresponding relationship between Collateralized Debt Positions in MakerDAO and the people who generate debts, and they will face liquidation when the collateral rate is too low. In Terra, there is no such relationship. Anyone can burn Luna to mint Terra or send Terra to the system to obtain the equivalent of Luna, which enables Terra to be anchored to the value of the legal currency. For&nbsp;example:</p><p>When the price of TerraSDR &lt; 1SDR, users and arbitrageurs can send 1TerraSDR to the system to obtain Luna worth&nbsp;1SDR.</p><p>When the price of TerraSDR &gt; 1SDR, users and arbitrageurs can send Luna worth 1SDR to the system to obtain 1TerraSDR.</p><p>The Terra protocol uses a proof-of-stake mechanism. By collateralizing Luna mining, voting rights can be delegated to verification nodes. The miner also acts as a Price Oracle and needs to vote on the exchange rate between Luna and the target legal currency asset, taking the weighted average of the votes to get the final exchange rate. Miners will be punished if their votes are too inaccurate. Collateralized Luna will also enjoy a certain income, and its value capture capability is similar to tokens of Exchange platform.</p><p>Mining Terra requires payment of 0.1%-1% seigniorage tax to miners. According to the white paper, the upper limit of this fee is 1SDR (approximately $1.39) and transactions with higher fees have an advantage over traditional payment&nbsp;methods.</p><p>As the use of Terra increases, more Luna will be burned to mint&nbsp;Terra.</p><p>Vote to govern Terra, such as adding other types of Terra&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Prophecy rewards and gas&nbsp;fees.</p><p>According to calculations, in the 199 days from the beginning of the year to the present, the average annualized return of collateralized Luna is 12.8%. The number of Luna collateralized is 305 million, the collateral rate is 30.59%, and collateral income includes seigniorage, prophecy rewards, and gas&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Source: station.terra.money</p><p>Because of the founder, Terra has attracted a large number of users. Terra established Terra Alliance with e-commerce partners including Woowa Brothers, Qoo10, Carousell, Pomelo, and TIKI. As you can see from the chart below, Terra attracted a larger number of active users at the beginning of the startup and currently has 1.758 million users. In the past 30 days, Terra has an average of 5,562 daily active users. In the past six months, the number of Terra users has increased by an average of 10.57% every&nbsp;month.</p><p>Source: station.terra.money</p><p>According to the ranking of <a href="http://dapp.com/">Dapp.com</a>, as of the evening of July 19, CHAI, the payment gateway (wallet) of Terra is the DApps with the most active users, with 44,300 active users in the past 24&nbsp;hours.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, <a href="http://dapps.com/">DApps.com</a></p><p>As we can see from the above analysis, in addition to the familiar legal collateralized stablecoins, there are also many people using Terra for payments. Among the top 100 blockchain projects by market capitalization, there are also <a href="http://crypto.com/">Crypto.com</a>, MCO, Nano, MonaCoin, Reserve Rights, and other projects related to payments or stablecoins. Blockchain is getting closer and closer to our&nbsp;lives.</p> 3. Questions of&nbsp;Readers <p>Question 1. Maker DSR is 0. Why are there still 70 million DAI in&nbsp;DRS?</p><p>Answer: According to DAI Stats, the total supply of DAI is 205 million, of which 131 million are ERC20 tokens, and another 69.8 million are deposited in DSR. If DAI is deposited on platforms such as Aave, there is an annualized interest rate of 4%, and there is no reason for investors to deposit DAI in DSR. After our multiple verifications, Compound deposited the market liquidity part (deposit and loan balance) into DSR. At present, the total deposits of DAI in Compound are 774 million, the total borrowing is 717 million, and the deposit-loan balance is 66&nbsp;million.</p><p>Question 2. The amount of DAI in Compound has exceeded the total amount of DAI. How does this affect&nbsp;DAI?</p><p>Answer: First of all, we can see that the total deposit of DAI in Compound is always greater than the total borrowing, and the deposit-loan balance is close to 70 million DAI, which means that the increase in deposits in Compound will not bring risks to DAI. Besides, the total deposit of DAI in Compound in July rose from $43 million to the current $777 million. At the same time, the supply of DAI also rose from 128 million to 223 million. On the one hand, the increase in the supply of DAI is related to Maker increasing the upper limit of DAI, and on the other hand, it may also be related to the demand brought by Compound, which is positive for&nbsp;DAI.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Decentralized Identity is a concept that may not be mainstream yet, but it is a term that embodies the sentiment that many individuals feel regarding the control they wish they had over their personal data. The public has become increasingly more vocal about the misuse of their data, and global regulation has responded to this outcry with the GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, and more. While this grants some control over some aspects of user data, there is an assumption that underpins these privacy regulations: that personal data can be held and used by an entity other than the owner.</p>
 Identity verification a promising use case for decentralized identity 
<p>But for a decentralized identity solution to succeed, it will likely need to make a place for itself in the enterprise space first, rather than going directly to the masses. And for this strategy to work, it needs a different business case, one that addresses the public’s needs from the angle of the enterprise. This should take the difficulties that enterprises face into consideration; that enterprises are saddled with a honeypot of data – a vulnerability that must be protected – and users seek out ways to simplify their many accounts by reusing passwords. A promising use case for decentralized identity is identity verification, possible in various iterations of customer onboarding, reusable KYC, or proof-of-(attribute).</p>
 Is blockchain the obvious choice? 
<p>A decentralized architecture appears to be the most promising way forward. The entire concept is decentralized – instead of an organization holding a mass of employee and end-user data centrally, the SSI concept envisions a way where each individual is the only one that holds their identity data.</p>
<p>Blockchain has been the decentralized architecture of choice, given its strengths in the chronological sequencing of events with transparency and tamper-proof auditability. It does face a trade-off with scalability and decentralization: when a blockchain is fully decentralized, the work and time it takes per block consensus is quite high. Sacrifice the decentralized format for a network of trusted nodes (usually operated by a consortium of organizations, or a single organization), and the transactions can be trusted without such labor-intensive consensus processes.</p>
 Privacy as a challenge to blockchain 
<p>The other challenge that blockchain faces for decentralized identity is privacy. Any data published to the blockchain is permanent, making it an ill-suited match for exchanging identity data which must have the power to be removed at the owner’s request. There are workarounds, such to anonymize or pseudonymize identity data stored in each block.</p>
<p>So, is blockchain really the technology that will deliver decentralized identity solutions? We already see a few solutions coming on the market that use alternatives to blockchain, like directed graph technology. Some notable differences between the directed graph approach and the blockchain are:</p>
 
 Directed graphs do not arrange linkages in a chronological chain – as transactions are ordered with blockchain – but in a web of interconnected digital repositories. 
 Consensus is reimagined, without cryptocurrencies and mining. Some implementations require nodes issuing a transaction to validate two transactions from other nodes before its own is validated. This resolves scalability challenges that Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains face, because the more exchanges that are made with a directed graph implementation, the faster they are validated. 
 Data held in the nodes of directed graphs can be linked to a single source of truth. This means that if a piece of identity data, for example the expiration date on a license, is updated in the “off-graph” storage, it is updated in each instance throughout the graph. This is unlike blockchain, where a transaction published to the chain is permanent without the option of updates. 
 
 Directed Graphs could be better suited to identity use cases 
<p>Directed graphs seem to be better able to handle relationships, instead of transactions as we’ve seen with blockchain implementations of decentralized identity. This leaves more room for roles to change, for identity attributes to become valid and invalid, and for different personas to be used in private and professional settings. Directed graph solutions for decentralized identity are still new on the market, and more research and the test of time will reveal how this technology plays out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether an application is targeting consumers, employees, partners or otherwise, the client-side of an application (e.g., a mobile app, a web app) interacts with the server-side of an application via an Application Programming Interface (API). Simply put, APIs make it easy for a developer to create a client-side app. Microservice architectures are also made possible by APIs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because they’re often available over public networks (access from anywhere), APIs are typically well documented or easily reverse-engineered. Also highly sensitive to denial of service (DDOS) type incidents, APIs are attractive targets for bad actors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An attack might include bypassing the client-side application in an attempt to disrupt the functioning of an application for other users or to breach private information. <a>API security</a> is focused on securing this application layer and addressing what can happen if a malicious hacker were to interact with the API directly.</p>

  <p>PASETO is a new security token format designed to be easy to use and free from the issues inherent with JSON Web Token (JWT) related specifications. Platform Agnostic SEcurity TOkens (PASETO) is a draft RFC spec created by <a href="https://paragonie.com/">Scott Arciszewski</a>. PASETO reduces the scope of the JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) family of specs (which JWT is a part of), while still providing the functions that secure applications need.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PASETO is everything you love about JOSE (JWT, JWE, JWS) without any of the many design deficits that plague the JOSE standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, I’m going to introduce you to <a href="https://github.com/paseto-toolkit/jpaseto">JPaseto</a>, a new Java developer library we’ve built that makes it easy to work with PASETOs in your own applications.</p>

<p>Before we get into that, however, let’s talk about JWTs.</p>

 What’s wrong with JWTs? 

<p>The simple answer to this question is “nothing.” It is technically possible to build and use JWTs correctly. However, due to the complexities of the JWT spec, it’s easy to misuse them, which results in the large number of JWT vulnerabilities we’ve seen lately. While many of these vulnerabilities are specific to a given JWT implementation, part of the fault lies with the JWT specification itself.</p>

<p>JWTs aim to support a wide range of cryptographic algorithms, including no cryptography at all! Think about that for a minute; one of the core features of a JWT security token is the ability to disable said security.</p>

<p>Some of the most common JWT exploits we see are authentication bypass attacks, where an attacker is able to edit or forge a JWT and disable the token’s cryptographic verification. The creator of the PASETO spec goes into more detail on the various cryptographic and spec-related issues in the JWT spec in his <a href="https://paragonie.com/blog/2018/03/paseto-platform-agnostic-security-tokens-is-secure-alternative-jose-standards-jwt-etc">well-known post</a>.</p>

<p>You can browse through a list of JWT vulnerabilities in the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?form_type=Advanced&amp;results_type=overview&amp;query=jwt&amp;search_type=all">NIST CVE database</a> if you’re interested in seeing various other JWT-related issues.</p>

<p>Why is this so important? JWTs have become a critical part of web authentication. They’re used in nearly every modern web application to secure user sessions. Their widespread adoption paired with their inherent security issues has caused a perfect storm of widespread vulnerabilities.</p>

 Enter PASETO: A Secure Alternative to JWTs 

<p>PASETOs were designed to improve upon the design of JWTs, making them more cryptographically resilient and far simpler to use.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://paseto.io/">PASETO spec</a> defines two types of tokens: local and public. Local tokens are always symmetrically encrypted with a shared secret key which means no one can view the contents of a local PASETO unless they have the correct secret key. Public tokens are readable by anyone and are validated with a public key. There is no “none” option; you cannot have a security token without security!</p>

<p>Similar to JWTs, a PASETO token is a set of dot-separated base64url encoded data formatted as:</p>

 <code>version.purpose.payload.footer
</code> 

 
   version: Allows for incremental improvements the token format, (current versions are “v1” and “v2”)
     
       v1: Uses strong cryptographic primitives that are more widely available today 
       v2: Uses newer and stronger cryptographic primitives, but are supported by fewer cryptographic libraries 
     
   
   purpose: A short string describing the token format “local” or “public”
     
       local: The payload of the token is encrypted and is only viewable by parties that have the shared-key 
       public: The payload is NOT encrypted, it is signed and verified with a public key 
     
   
   payload: Encoded data with a format specific to the version and purpose of the token 
   footer (optional): Unencrypted JSON, typically used to store the ID of a public key used to validate the token. 
 

<p>All PASETO tokens formats are tamper proof and the entire message is authenticated, meaning if you change anything in the token, validation fails.</p>

 JPaseto: A PASETO Library for Java/JVM Developers 

<p>At Okta, we developed an open-source Java-based PASETO library named <a href="https://github.com/paseto-toolkit/jpaseto">JPaseto</a> to make getting started with PASETO even easier. We took everything we loved and learned from the popular <a href="https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/">JJWT</a> project and put it into JPaseto (JJWT is the most popular JWT library for Java developers).</p>

<p>From a high-level perspective, JJWT and JPaseto have the same feature set (the ability to create and verify tokens); however, JPaseto has less than half the lines of code.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you need to parse JWTs, I’d still recommend the JJWT library, as it does protect you from types of exploits that have been in the news lately.</p>

<p>We take the quality and security of JPaseto very seriously, and the library has been through a <a href="https://paragonie.com/audit/OiT6VlbQ7n6Y6Qz6">comprehensive security audit</a> by the same group of cryptographers that wrote the PASETO specification.</p>

<p>JPaseto is available on <a href="https://search.maven.org/search?q=jpaseto">Maven Central</a> and can be used in any JVM based project (Java, Kotlin, Groovy, etc) by including the following dependencies:</p>

   <code>compile 'dev.paseto:jpaseto-api:0.5.0'
runtime 'dev.paseto:jpaseto-impl:0.5.0',
        'dev.paseto:jpaseto-jackson:0.5.0',
        'dev.paseto:jpaseto-bouncy-castle:0.5.0'
</code>   

<p>NOTE: If you are not using Jackson or Bouncy Castle in your project, see the project’s <a href="https://github.com/paseto-toolkit/jpaseto#installation">readme</a> for other options.</p>

<p>Here’s what token creation looks like using a fluid builder pattern:</p>

   <code>String token = Pasetos.V2.PUBLIC.builder()
                .setPrivateKey(privateKey)
                .setKeyId("my-kid")
                .setIssuer("https://my-service.example.com")
                .setAudience("blog-post")
                .claim("custom-claim", "a-value")
                .claim("1d20", new Random().nextInt(10) + 1)
                .compact();
</code>   

<p>If this looks familiar to you, that’s because the PASETO specification has the same set of “registered” claims as the JWT spec and, of course, because it’s JSON, you can add any additional claims.</p>

<p>Parsing a token is also similar. First, create a reusable parser:</p>

   <code>PasetoParser parser = Pasetos.parserBuilder()
                .setPublicKey(publicKey)
                .requireAudience("blog-post") // optional
                .build();
</code>   

<p>Finally, parse the token string. All of the validation is handled for you:</p>

   <code>Paseto paseto = parser.parse(token);

// get the custom claim from the token
int diceRole = paseto.claims.get("1d20");
</code>   

 What’s Next for PASETO? 

<p>Software bugs are inevitable; it’s a fact of life in the software world. The more complex the code, the more likely there is an issue. This is doubly so with security. The JWT spec attempts to cover more use-cases than it should. This leads to complex code which, of course, leads to bugs and, in a security world, that means vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>As security professionals, it falls on to us to help improve the security posture for everyone. PASETO isn’t going to replace JWTs right away—JWT is a core part of the OpenID Connect specification after all. But…one of our goals at Okta is to help build the future of security, which is why we’ve invested in building out tools to support the PASETO specification.</p>

<p>If you’re using PASETOs in any projects, we’d love to hear about it!</p>

 Frequently asked questions  What is GlobaliD? <p>GlobaliD is a digital identity platform that puts you in control of your identity and your data, allowing you to go about your day-to-day business online without sharing your personal information — unless you want&nbsp;to.</p><p>With GlobaliD, you collect verifications, which protect your privacy while giving you permission to take important actions online — like applying for a job, renting a room, or sending and receiving funds. Your GlobaliD identity and your verifications areportable, meaning that you can use it with any GlobaliD partner, and lets you control others’ access to your&nbsp;data.</p> What is a digital identity? <p>Your digital identity is a digital representation of all the identifiers and behaviors that make up who you&nbsp;are.</p><p>This could mean personal information such as your date of birth, your home address, or your government ID number. Or it could mean a secret passcode, a photograph, or even facial biometric data. With your GlobaliD digital identity, you collect verifications of those identifiers, which allows you to develop your reputation and digital trust, providing access to products and services.</p> What makes my GlobaliD different from social&nbsp;login? <p>Most digital identity platforms take ownership and control of your digital identity and your data for their own purposes. For instance, social media companies make money from selling your data to unauthorized third parties. Further, common forms of digital identity are limited and siloed, meaning that if you develop a positive reputation on one platform, you aren’t able to reuse that reputation elsewhere.</p><p>In contrast, GlobaliD is privacy-first by design, allowing you to take ownership and control of your own digital identity, so that you can use it any way you and anywhere see fit. This means that you can represent and verify yourself online in a trusted way, while retaining ownership and control of your digital identity and your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Only you can decide how your data is accessed or used, and who can access and use it. Since you own your GlobaliD digital identity, it is fully portable, allowing you to take the trust and reputation that you develop with you wherever you&nbsp;go.</p> What is a portable identity? <p>A portable identity is one that you can take with you along with the trust and reputation you’ve already established, meaning that you can use it to access and to use services anywhere.</p><p>Common forms of digital identity today aren’t portable and are instead locked within their respective platforms, so that a trusted reputation that you have worked hard to build — such as on a social media platform cannot be used at&nbsp;, an auctions marketplace, or a home rentals marketplace.</p><p>With GlobaliD, your identity is fully portable, meaning that you can take your trusted reputation with you wherever you go. This is analogous to how phone numbers were once fully-owned by network carriers, requiring you to get a new phone number every time you switched, but are now portable so that you can keep the same number even if you switch carriers.</p> What is self-sovereign identity? <p>The Sovrin Foundation: Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a term used to describe the digital movement that recognizes an individual should own and control their identity without the intervening administrative authorities. SSI allows people to interact in the digital world with the same freedom and capacity for trust as they do in the offline&nbsp;world.</p> What are verifications? <p>Verifications are credentials you can collect that provide objective proof that your provided information has been verified as true by a specific third-party verification agency.</p> What are verification providers? <p>Verification providers are independent, third-party agencies that provide verifications for your GlobaliD digital identity. You can collect verifications from providers of your choosing to develop your reputation and digital trust. New verification providers are regularly added to the GlobaliD ecosystem.</p><p>Examples of verification providers you can access&nbsp;today:</p>  Email (Ekata, Berbix, Mandrill, and&nbsp;others)  Age (AgeChecker.Net)  Phone number (Ekata, Berbix, Civic, and&nbsp;others)  Address verification (Ekata, Onfido, Yodlee, and&nbsp;others)  Liveness (Google, Verifi.me)  Government ID (Onfido, Berbix, Veriff, Civic, and&nbsp;others)  Social media account (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google)  Bank account (Yodlee and&nbsp;others)  Cryptocurrency wallets&nbsp;(Zabo)  Accredited investor status (InvestReady)  Sanctions watchlists screening (Uphold)  College degree (National Student Clearinghouse)  Peer-to-peer vouches  Among many&nbsp;others!   What is a GlobaliD&nbsp;Name? <p>Your GlobaliD Name is a unique handle that represents your digital identity. Any verifications you collect are tied to your GlobaliD Name, allowing you to build a trusted reputation for this identity. You can claim any GlobaliD Name of your choosing as long as it’s available — it doesn’t have to be your real name. You can also claim more than one GlobaliD&nbsp;Name.</p> How does GlobaliD protect my privacy and my&nbsp;data? <p>GlobaliD protects your privacy and data through our verifications system and industry-leading security practices. GlobaliD verifications are statements that describe something about you that an independent, third-party verification agency has verified to be&nbsp;true.</p><p>Using public key cryptography, your private data is encrypted and stored in the GlobaliD Vault and can only be accessed or shared with your explicit consent. This means that your data isn’t being redundantly stored by each new service provider you choose, is only accessed on a need-to-know basis, and that these verifications of yours are portable since they can be used to verify your identity with other GlobaliD partners.</p><p>In the case of a partner data breach, your data is safe since they were never storing it themselves. That service provider can then request to delete your private data from the GlobaliD Vault. Nobody — including GlobaliD — can decrypt your personal data without your express permission.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-frequently-asked-questions-738947ebcfeb">GlobaliD—Frequently asked questions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>On July 22nd, 2020 IBM announced their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/financial-services">IBM Cloud for Financial Services</a> – what is this, why have IBM taken this step, and what does this announcement mean?</p>
 Financial Services Compliance Challenges 
<p>One recurring challenge for all organizations is complying with the ever-increasing number of laws and regulations. When IT services are delivered on-premises organizations often believe that this ensures the oversight, control and visibility needed to ensure and prove compliance. This is not the case with cloud-delivered services where there is a shared responsibility model and less visibility of the CSP controls. However, digital transformation initiatives are adopting cloud services to provide speed and agility, and this is leading to tensions between the organization's functions for digital transformation and those responsible for risk and compliance. Nowhere is this more apparent than in financial services.</p>
<p>The hyperscale CSPs such as AWS, Azure and IBM provide easy access to the capabilities needed by development teams to accelerate the creation of critical new business applications. While the major cloud service providers go to great lengths to secure the infrastructure of their environments it is up to the customer to secure their use and to prove compliance. This is often outside the skills of DevOps teams or is overlooked and can lead to the existence of critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber adversaries.&nbsp;</p>
 Compliance is not enough – you need to prove you are compliant 
<p>Another challenge is that even where a cloud service is well secured and is being used in a compliant manner, the customer must prove that this is the case to regulators. CSPs often approach this by publishing long lists or the laws and regulations with which their service is compliant. However, this is not sufficient to solve the customers’ compliance challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the customer’s perspective, there is a need to show how the controls that they have in place contribute to meeting their regulatory obligations. These obligations vary from customer to customer as do the risks and so each customer will have an individual mapping between risks, controls, and obligations. This mapping is complex and must include all IT services involved irrespective of how they are delivered. This means including how the controls within the service are governed as well as how they are used and there must be adequate proof the controls not only exist and are effective but also how they map to obligations and risks. In effect, this is a specialized form of cloud security posture management described in a previous <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/cloud-security-posture-management-tools">blog</a>.</p>
 IBM Policy Framework for Financial Services 
<p>It is in this area that IBM have taken action for Financial Services.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Bank of America, and using the knowledge from the IBM Promontory, IBM has created the IBM Policy Framework for Financial Services. This is intended to deliver the benefits and flexibility of a public cloud in a secure environment, to enable financial institutions, ISVs and SaaS providers to host apps and workloads in the cloud with confidence and trust.</p>
<p>IBM has established an Industry Cloud Advisory Council in support of the IBM Policy Framework for Financial Services. This will support this effort and advise on its ongoing advancement. Chief Technology Officer Tony Kerrison will represent Bank of America on the Council, which will be led by Howard Boville, SVP, IBM Cloud. The Council will be focused on bringing major financial institutions together to help drive the strategic evolution of cloud security in this highly regulated sector.</p>
<p>This Policy framework defines a set of controls based on financial services needs mapped into specific controls on the IBM Cloud. For example, the obligation to protect data end to end is supported by a wide range of IBM Cloud features and controls. These include IBM Cloud™ Hyper Protect Crypto Services which is a key management and cloud hardware security module (HSM) and puts controls of keys into clients’ hands to meet obligations for key management and data protection.</p>
<p>The Policy Framework is based on:</p>
 
 IBM public cloud controls aligned with NIST that are relevant to financial services’ needs. 
 Implementation and deployment practices to guide ISV and SaaS providers with cloud services architectures. 
 Implementation and evidence guidance for ISV and SaaS providers to complete and evidence compliance to the Policy Framework. 
 
<p>In support of this IBM have also announced their Financial Services Compliance Centre which is based on their OpenPages GRC tool augmented by assets acquired through their <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-06-15-IBM-Acquires-Assets-from-Spanugo">recent acquisition of Spanugo</a>.</p>
 My Opinion 
<p>This is an interesting development in the cloud space. It addresses the compliance challenges that are faced by financial services organizations and which according to IBM are limiting their adoption of public cloud services. It illustrates the difficulties faced by all organizations where the hybrid IT delivery model driven by digital transformation has added to the complexities of matching controls to risks and demonstrating compliance in a consistent manner. This approach is likely to become important in other regulated industries.</p>

  <p>After widespread protests against racism in the U.S., tech giants Microsoft, Amazon and IBM publicly announced they would no longer allow police departments access to their facial recognition technology. The concern? Artificial intelligence (AI) can be prone to errors, particularly in recognizing people of color and those in other underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>Such ethical concerns don’t end at facial recognition software. Any organization developing or using AI solutions needs to be proactive in ensuring that AI dangers don’t jeopardize their brand, draw regulatory actions, lead to boycotts or destroy business value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Install an external AI ethics board to prevent — not just mitigate — AI dangers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft President Brad Smith was widely quoted as saying his company wouldn’t sell facial-recognition technology to police departments in the U.S., “until we have a national law in place, grounded in human rights, that will govern this technology.”</p>
<p>So, in the absence of highly rigorous institutional protections against AI dangers, what can organizations do themselves to guard against them?</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>After all, AI could lead any number of negative outcomes, from eliminating stable, well-paying jobs to determining prison sentences and medical benefits through unaccountable algorithms. Anything fully automated can abuse and be abused.</p>
<p>The first, and perhaps the most critical, step to prevent these outcomes: Install an external AI ethics board to prevent — not just mitigate — AI dangers.</p>
 Institute protections beyond what exists 
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has raised specific concerns about <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-for-ethical-data-collection-during-pandemics/">how to apply data ethics </a>to decision-making processes when collecting, using and sharing data about employees and the health of individuals. But every organization now has to guard against AI dangers if it hopes to leverage the many opportunities AI offers to the business.</p>
<p>The perceived and actual dangers most often stem from the ability of AI to make decisions and take action with little or no human intervention. Often publicized are the risks that AI poses to privacy, jobs, relationships and equality.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-ways-to-embrace-proactive-data-ethics/">3 Ways to Embrace Proactive Data Ethics</a></p>
<p>Although public mechanisms do exist to mitigate against AI dangers, they aren’t sufficient. Market forces have encouraged companies to develop AI to meet, for example, government needs for facial recognition and surveillance — yet there hasn’t been an associated boost in their commitment to ethical use.</p>
<p>Regulators often aren’t prepared or knowledgeable enough about AI to codify adequate oversight. Courts, focused on avoiding a difficult-to-reverse legal outcome, tend to be more or less stringent than is necessary to ensure public well-being.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An uninformed, unaware board is not a useful board. Make sure your board members have all the details needed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s hardly surprising, then, that AI solution developers are concerned that their AI will become warped during development or be misused once in the market. Microsoft’s concerns about the use of facial recognition technology are certainly warranted, given that the advanced technologies, while designed to protect communities, can also negatively impact those very same communities.</p>
<p>And that burden can all too easily fall on people of color, those from the LGBTQ community and others who already tend to be underrepresented in many of the institutions that develop and provide oversight of such technologies.</p>
 Create an external board dedicated to ethical AI 
<p>Axon, a law enforcement technology solution provider, established an external ethics board to help mitigate the shortcomings of the mechanisms meant to protect the public. Specifically, the company created a board that enabled greater transparency, accountability and representation in the AI development process. The following are among the lessons learned.</p>
 Representation 
<p>Your primary customers are the buyers of your products, but who are the consumers? In the case of policing technologies, law enforcement agencies might be the customers but the communities they serve are the consumers — and they are directly impacted by the use of the technologies.</p>
<p>Make sure to overindex voices that understand your critical consumers and can provide insight into the potential impact of your AI technologies. This helps to filter out poor AI product proposals before they go to market.</p>
 Transparency 
<p>Be totally transparent with your AI ethics board about every AI project and your AI roadmap. An uninformed, unaware board is not a useful board. Make sure your board members have all the details needed to make confident recommendations on developing projects. This kind of transparency and credibility will help you to acquire and keep worthy board members.</p>
 Accountability 
<p>Once the board has made its recommendations, senior leaders need to respond to them — publicly. This demonstrates that the organization is committed and accountable.</p>
 Empower the AI ethics board 
<p>Axon also took discrete steps to empower the AI ethics board and its members:</p>
 
 Select effective members. As well as overrepresenting those who will be impacted by your AI technologies, make sure the board is truly independent. To do this, involve the board itself in selecting future members, and make sure the board doesn’t include any employees of your organization. Make the board diverse enough and qualified enough to challenge business decisions. Possible members include not only experts in AI and machine learning, but regulators, academics and practitioners in your business segment. 
 Enable relevant and transparent feedback. Use three basic rules to ensure that the board is effective: 1) Provide total access to information (e.g., about the logic behind algorithms), 2) allow the board to control its own agenda and 3) don’t interfere in the board’s recommendations. Axon’s board publishes its recommendations to a completely separate website maintained by a university, not the company. 
 Organize for accountability. Give your AI development team unrestricted access to the ethics board, an internal ombudsperson and the ethics board ombudsperson. This ensures trust among all parties and participants and installs mechanisms to handle any ethical concerns that arise (including whistleblower complaints). 
 
<p>An effective external AI ethics board embeds in the organization’s culture AI development practices that drive competitive advantage and business resilience and make the organization more attractive to talent.</p>

  <p>When I decided to transition away from being a Principal Enterprise Architect into a specialized identity engineering role, a number of my colleagues asked me why.   My answer has always been this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Because, for the last five or six years, every project I’ve done has been an identity project—we just didn’t know it when we started.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That response is usually met with a nodding head and a resigned, weary shrug.   Too often, it fails to be recognized as a cornerstone in application or system design,yet it is fundamental and pivotal to a system’s success. When a project does finally discover that identity is crucial, it’s usually too late to deal with properly.  Scope, budget, project planning– none of these efforts made allowances for identity concerns. If you’ve ever wondered how organizations end up with fragmented identity strategies, multiple tools, duplicated user definitions, and commensurate security gaps, I’d propose it comes from this reactionary response to projects that forgot to plan for identity.</p>

<p>Historically, product owners, developers, and infrastructure resources have all seen identity as a byproduct of deployments at best, or a component of an application at worst. If you were to compare an application to an airplane, identity would be neither the wings nor the fuselage.  It would be the air that makes it fly.  Without a solid identity strategy and platform to empower it, your project won’t get off the ground, stay safely in the air, or find its way back to the ground in one piece.</p>

 A “First Class Architectural Citizen” 

<p>When you draw out a design, be it a simple application or a globally distributed content distribution network, you start with some pretty pronounced and ubiquitous boxes.   Databases, application servers, and web services are all the usual suspects.   Should you map an organization’s technology sectors, you’d likely draw big boxes for “ERP”, “CRM”, “ITSM”, “HRIS”, and similar monumental acronyms.   These big boxes represent important beachheads in a technology stack.  They are also not just technology systems.  Instead, these are usually large-scale technology partnerships with various business columns using technology to enable business workloads.  These integral, core systems have some things in common:</p>

 
   They are owned by an authoritative, cross-functional and influential arm of the organization 
   They receive a recurring annual budget to be enhanced, improved, and maintained 
   They have dedicated resources to support them 
   They own (source of truth) significant portions of the organization’s master data and the business rules surrounding them 
   They receive a level of visibility, support, and attention that makes them universally recognizable across all functional columns of the organization 
 

<p>These types of systems are platforms upon which other ancillary systems, products, or applications base their designs.  It is these systems that dictate what a “customer” is, how a “product” is defined or other such fundamental precepts.   Truly, the combination of these core systems makes up the organization’s “technology business engine”.  Note, these are not “technology engines”, but purposefully “technology business engines”.  These systems both power and define business functions.</p>

<p>Thus, in our modern era, identity has become this first-class architectural citizen; an equivalent to the ERP, CRM, and others.  Concepts like data privacy, consent, and data residency should be enough to hammer home the point that how we deal with data about people’s identities can no longer be a “feature” of a random application.  However, there are the practical realities of a centralized and elevated identity system to consider, as well.</p>

 User Experience 

<p>Centralizing, or standardizing if you prefer, identity concerns enables your organization to improve the ways in which your employees, customers, and partners interact with you.   From the simple benefits of universal profile management to the less flashy, but incredibly important, ability to unify authentication—all these things make your user’s experiences better with less friction.   This increases your ability to acquire, keep, and expand the user’s relationship with your business.  A happy user, employee, partner, customer, or whomever, is a user that costs you less, makes you more and will tell friends.</p>

 Data Consistency 

<p>The relative ease with which applications can be deployed has contributed to an ever-increasing number of them.   These applications can be spun up quickly, in some cases by third parties outside the control of local IT groups, and deployed in the wild literally in days.   If identity—specifically user and user profiles sprawls with it—then the valuable data about a user is lost in the noise.   User duplication, authorization fragmentation, and a host of other data issues are obvious.  What’s maybe less obvious is the impacts on things like GDPR or, more generally, consent and data privacy.  How can you forget a user if you don’t know all the places that user is remembered?  Furthermore, what if each instance of that user is defined differently; perhaps an email address here and a phone number there?   Simply standardizing the core master data definition of what a user is and controlling the basics of their profile could be enough to justify identity as a first-class architectural citizen.</p>

 Time 

<p>When I look at the identity sprawl in systems I’ve helped build or consulted upon, I always think about one thing: Time;lost re-inventing the wheel, time spent fixing bugs in one system that was duplicating logic already implemented bug-free in another, time wasted.</p>

<p>Reuse should not be a new concept at this point.  However, reuse has always been met with the emotional barrier of the dev or product team that was sure they could “do it better” or that did not want to be dependent upon somebody else’s code.</p>

<p>This is why identity has to be a first-class citizen.  Think of the argument that would ensue in a sprint planning meeting if someone suggesting duplicating the sales tax calculation that already existed in the core order management system.  Hopefully, nobody would allow this duplication of effort and risk to the core business logic system.   This same sort of allergic reaction needs to exist if a team wants to implement their own user profile store.   Identity has to be seen as a core, cornerstone system, and, once that happens, no longer will time be wasted reinventing that particular wheel.</p>

 Security 

<p>Threats, compliance concerns, innovation; all these things and more contribute to the need to be proactive and reactive in your security posture.  There is no greater risk to an application or system than its own users.  Phishing attempts, account takeovers, credential sharing—you name it, users will find a way to help cause a breach.   A central identity platform will not eliminate this risk, however, your only hope in being able to augment and adjust your security tactics is to have one place to implement your strategy.</p>

 Final Thoughts 

<p>We have reached a precipice in enterprise design for identity.   For decades, identity was a component that “came with” something else.  Now, with the need to integrate and propagate our data and systems around the world, identity must stand as its own thing.  Identity is no longer able to be considered a part of something–it is, in fact, its own thing.</p>

<p>So, that’s what I mean when I say that Identity must now be a first class architectural citizen.  When building out designs, be it a simple website or a massive business footprint, identity must be thought of as a foundational entity in order to reap the benefits of its incredible impacts.</p>

 Attacks and account take-overs like last week’s Twitter hack are completely avoidable. Enterprises must implement biometric multi-factor authentication to ensure that only the right users have access to the right systems at all times. If they don’t, users will continue being vulnerable to hacks and&nbsp;scams. <blockquote>“A New York Times report that has yet to be confirmed by Twitter said that hackers breached employee Slack accounts and found credentials for the Twitter backend pinned inside a Slack channel,” — <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-says-hackers-downloaded-the-data-of-eight-users-in-wednesdays-hack/">ZDNet</a></blockquote><p>The hackers responsible for last week’s attack were able to breach Twitter’s backend systems by stealing credentials from within the social media platform’s private employee Slack channel. Once inside Twitter’s systems, the attackers were then free to take over at least <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-says-hackers-downloaded-the-data-of-eight-users-in-wednesdays-hack/">103 accounts and download the personal data of at least 8 accounts</a>.</p><p>In light of this unprecedented attack, we have to ask ourselves some serious questions — what were login credentials doing on the public Slack channel in the first place? Why were they posted there publicly for ease of access? How did the hackers get access to Twitter’s slack? Were those credentials phished out of an employee in an advanced social engineering attack?</p><p>If there’s one thing that’s certain, it’s that passwords are inherently insecure, and failing us. Despite the known security risks, even the world’s biggest companies still struggle with enforcing proper password&nbsp;hygiene.</p><p>Why then, are companies like Twitter still using passwords as a means of accessing their backend systems, when biometric multi-factor authentication solutions for the workforce are on the&nbsp;market?</p><p>To avoid disastrous hacks and breaches, companies must immediately stop using passwords to authenticate employees and start embracing biometric multi-factor authentication as a weapon to permanently end hacks caused by compromised credentials.</p> Why would biometric multi-factor authentication have stopped the Twitter&nbsp;attack?  1. Without passwords, there is nothing to steal, lose or remember. <p>Biometric multi-factor authentication can help secure corporate systems by removing human error from the equation altogether. Unlike passwords, biometrics can’t be easily stolen, faked, or phished. Biometrics also can’t be shared between multiple users, written down and published online, or forgotten.</p><p>If Twitter (and Slack) were using biometric multi-factor authentication, the entire attack could have been foiled — saving Twitter and Slack their respective reputations, and Twitter’s users hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;dollars.</p> 2. Biometric MFA can stop bad actors from moving through a&nbsp;network <p>Biometric multi-factor authentication solutions allow for seamless and secure authentication that is minimally disruptive to workflow and the user-experience. This means biometric MFA can be used to set stringent access controls for users, ensuring that only the right people have access to the right systems at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>In last week’s attack, once the hacker gained access to Twitter’s systems via the compromised credentials found on the company’s Slack channel, they were then free to move through the network until they found a way to hack the accounts of prolific&nbsp;users.</p><p>The hacker’s ability to move through the network indicates that Twitter wasn’t using MFA to secure employee access at multiple entry points to its corporate systems.</p><p>Access controls ensure that lower-level employees aren’t able to move through a network, meaning that if a single set of login credentials are compromised, a hacker can’t then use them to freely move within a network until they find sensitive and private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Having biometric MFA checks at each access point in Twitter’s system would have prevented the attacker from moving laterally through Twitter’s network, which would have stopped them from breaching multiple&nbsp;systems.</p> 3. Biometric multi-factor authentication provides greater security than two-factor authentication <blockquote>“Twitter said hackers got “through” their two-factor protections but did not specify if it referred to the backend accounts or the Slack accounts.” — <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-says-hackers-downloaded-the-data-of-eight-users-in-wednesdays-hack/">ZDNet</a></blockquote><p>Why didn’t Twitter’s two-factor authentication stop the&nbsp;attack?</p><p>The short answer is obvious: Twitter’s 2FA solution still relies on passwords — which are inherently insecure.</p><p>Twitter uses 2FA solutions that combine passwords (something only the user should know) and one-time codes (sent to either the user’s phone via SMS or push or the user’ email address — which only the user should have access to) to authenticate its&nbsp;users.</p><p>The problem with 2FA solutions that partly depend on passwords is that one half of the entire solution is unreliable. If a password is compromised or shared willingly between people (as was the case with credentials being pinned in Twitter’s Slack), all a bad-actor then needs to do is compromise the user’s device or email accounts to bypass 2FA. Unfortunately, this is easily done if the user’s passwords for these accounts have also been compromised.</p><p>One-time codes (the second half of 2FA solutions) sent via text or email have their own security risks; if an email account or phone number has been compromised without the victim’s knowledge, then bypassing the 2FA security becomes entirely possible.</p> If one thing is certain: Biometric multi-factor authentication would have stopped the Twitter&nbsp;hack <p>Biometric multi-factor authentication solutions depend on the user proving who they are via their unique biometrics (something that can’t be easily stolen or faked), and via proof that they have their registered device (by only logging into accounts from these devices). With biometric MFA, the reliably strong methods for authenticating users are fundamentally more secure than 2FA solutions that depend on inherently insecure authentication methods.</p> To prevent hacks for good, biometric MFA must also be privacy-enhancing and universal <p>While biometrics remove human error from the cybersecurity equation, they aren’t necessarily immune to being hacked — that’s why it’s critical that biometric multi-factor authentication solutions are also privacy-enhancing.</p><p>At <a href="http://keyless.io">Keyless</a>, we combine multi-modal biometrics with privacy-enhancing technology to provide a passwordless, secure and privacy-enhancing authentication solution. Our multi-factor solution can be implemented at every access point, ensuring that only the right users have the right access at the right&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>“Designed with privacy in&nbsp;mind”</blockquote><p>By providing a secure, frictionless way to establish access controls at multiple entry-points, Keyless prevents unauthorized movement through a company’s private systems. This protects from threats like the Twitter hack, where an unauthorized user wreaked havoc simply by stumbling upon a set of compromised credentials.</p> Privacy-enhancing technology allows Keyless to do two&nbsp;things:  1) Ensure biometric data is never&nbsp;exposed. <p>Keyless uses <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-shamir-s-secret-sharing-e864efbf3648">privacy-enhancing technology</a> to transform biometric data so that it never represents personally identifiable information. This is done via a one-way encryption function. The transformed data is then split into fragments and stored on different servers (nodes) in the Keyless Cloud Network (instead of on the user’s device). This means that even if one (or all) of the nodes are compromised, that a user’s personal information is never at risk of being compromised.</p> 2) Authenticate users without viewing raw biometric data. <p>Keyless uses <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-secure-multiparty-computation-dc3fb9365458">secure multiparty computation </a>— a privacy-enhancing technology — that allows multiple nodes in our network to authenticate users without needing to view the raw components of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>To protect end-users and organizations against fraudulent takeovers, Keyless leverages advanced liveness detection and anti-spoofing techniques, in addition to the built-in multi-factor security. This allows Keyless to ensure that only the real user gains access to private accounts.</p> There’s no excuse to continue using passwords — it’s time to go passwordless <p>At Keyless, we believe biometrics are the answer for solving the key challenges that have arisen in cybersecurity, which ultimately led to the Twitter hack last&nbsp;week.</p><p>Biometric multi-factor authentication allows us to close the gap between security, privacy, and convenience. By leveraging biometric solutions, organizations can offer both a seamless authentication experience and powerful security. Thereby putting a permanent stop to hacks and threats caused by compromised or weak credentials.</p><p>If companies want to avoid future large-scale attacks and hacks like last week’s Twitter hack, then they should immediately be looking to ditch passwords for good. It’s time for enterprises and technology companies to embrace passwordless authentication to secure corporate systems, implement access controls, and protect their&nbsp;users.</p><p>If they don’t, they’ll leave themselves and their users vulnerable to financial scams, privacy breaches, fraud, and identity&nbsp;theft.</p> Request a Free Trial of&nbsp;Keyless <p>Keyless™ authentication can help deliver secure and seamless digital experiences for your end-users and for your increasingly remote workforce.</p><p>Head to our <a href="http://keyless.io">website</a> to learn more about our biometric authentication and identity management solutions.</p><p><a href="http://www.keyless.io">www.keyless.io</a></p><p>Alternatively, you can email us directly at <a href="http://info@keyless.io">info@keyless.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/if-twitter-did-this-one-simple-thing-last-weeks-attack-would-never-have-happened-fca128786bd3">If Twitter did this one simple thing, last week’s attack would never have happened</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech">KeylessTech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Shortly after 4PM last Wednesday, the Twitter accounts of major celebrities, tech companies, and CEOs all began posting tweets promising free cryptocurrency to followers who sent Bitcoin to a specific address within the next 30 minutes. The crypto scam turned out to be part of a massive coordinated hack affecting dozens of major Twitter accounts with millions of followers, the largest security breach in the company’s history.</p><p>The hack compromised the Twitter accounts of former U.S. President Barack Obama and presidential candidate Joe Biden, billionaire tech founders and CEOs Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and major tech companies such as Apple and Coinbase. Overall, 130 accounts were targeted. After fears grew that Twitter had been fatally compromised, the company blocked tweets from verified accounts as it assessed the damage, many of which were restored a few hours later. </p><p>According to the Bitcoin address used in the tweets, scammers likely made off with over a hundred thousand dollars within just a few minutes. The tweets were all a variation of the same message, offering followers a chance to double their Bitcoin in return for simply sending some to a specified address.</p><p>“I am giving back to the community. All Bitcoin sent to the address below will be sent back doubled! If you send $1,000, I will send back $2,000. Only doing this for 30 minutes,” read a typical tweet. The crypto scam closely followed the Bitcoin impersonation scams that proliferated on Twitter following the big crypto boom in 2017, except this time, instead of scammers impersonating Twitter accounts, they hacked them.</p><p>While on the surface it appears like the attack was primarily carried out to scam followers out of Bitcoin, it’s possible that the attackers were actually after something more valuable - the direct messages of high-profile politicians, tech executives, and celebrities. According to Twitter’s official support account, attackers were able to download all of the data for eight of the compromised accounts using the platform’s “Your Twitter Data” tool.</p><blockquote><p>For up to eight of the Twitter accounts involved, the attackers took the additional step of downloading the account’s information through our “Your Twitter Data” tool. We are reaching out directly to any account owner where we know this to be true.</p>— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1284331132255756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <p></p><p>That would include direct messages and, in some cases, synced address books. Depending on which accounts the attackers stole data from, this information could be worth far more than whatever Bitcoin they collected from the crypto scam. While Twitter has not directly disclosed the eight impacted accounts, the company has said that none of the eight were Verified accounts.</p><p>Regardless, the fact that the attackers were able to download user data signals that they most likely had full access to the accounts. In order to carry out the hack, it appears as though the attackers targeted Twitter employees to gain access to the company’s internal systems. In a Twitter Support tweet, the company said, “We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.”</p><p>In a followup thread on Thursday, the company said that there was no evidence that attackers accessed passwords and that instead they accessed tools only available to Twitter’s internal support teams. As of Saturday, the company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">confirmed in a blog post</a> that of the 130 accounts targeted, “for 45 of those accounts, the attackers were able to initiate a password reset, login to the account, and send Tweets.”</p><p>Social engineering remains one of the most glaring weak spots when it comes to cybersecurity, as shown by last week’s hack. Some of the biggest data breaches of all time have been the result of social engineering schemes, from a <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3180762/inside-the-russian-hack-of-yahoo-how-they-did-it.html">phishing attack that led to 3 billion Yahoo accounts</a> being compromised to a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/anatomy-of-the-target-data-breach-missed-opportunities-and-lessons-learned/">major breach that exposed over a 100 million credit cards at Target</a> in 2013.</p><p>With such vast reach, a critical security compromise of a major social media platform such as Twitter could have a far more disastrous impact if, for instance, more nefarious hackers were to gain access to and send threatening or alarmist messages from the account of a high profile politician or executive. Such a scenario could severely impact the stock market or elicit a negative response from another country.</p><p>That exact scenario happened in 2013, when a <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-day-in-history-hacked-ap-tweet-about-white-house-explosions-triggers-panic-2018-04-23">single post from the Associated Press’ Twitter account</a> sent the Dow Jones into a tailspin and momentarily wiped $136.5 billion off of the S&amp;P 500’s total market capitalization. “Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama Injured,” read the tweet. It turned out to be fake and was quickly deleted, but it made clear the real world effects of insecure social media platforms.</p><p>We’re lucky that Wednesday’s hack was used for the rather mundane purpose of attempting to get followers to part with some of their cryptocurrency, it could have been much worse.

 The GiD Report#119 — Ray Dalio examines history to understand the chaos we’re experiencing today <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-118-the-fastest-growing-cybercrime-and-what-it-tells-us-about-identity-65807d150062">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Some quick housekeeping:</p><p>Check out <a href="https://medium.">Greg’s Linqto panel appearance (alongside Uphold’s JP and&nbsp;others)</a>.</p><p>Greg also recently participated in a special class with Moscow School of Management SKOLKOVO and International Investor Organization INVESTORO. You can <a href="https://www.investoro.com/gregkidd/en">check it out&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week we’ve&nbsp;got:</p>  Ray Dalio on the big cycle of the U.S. part&nbsp;1  The world’s largest companies (and how they’ve changed over the last 10&nbsp;years)  The EU’s big ruling on U.S. cloud services and data&nbsp;sharing  Ben Thompson on the TikTok&nbsp;war  The New Yorker on the history of platforms and the future of online&nbsp;speech  Stuff happens   1. Ray Dalio has been working on a series of reports outlining the history of big cycles to help him understand what’s going on today — which we’ve covered in the past. (Ray’s the founder of Bridgewater, one of the biggest hedge funds around in terms of&nbsp;AUM.) <p>[<a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-a-tragic-week-explained-catholicism-without-hell-and-a-new-world-order-855f217d8537">Check out our last report on Ray&nbsp;here</a>.]</p><p>For Ray, each big cycle is comprised of 3 main&nbsp;parts:</p>  the long-term debt/monetary cycle,  the wealth and political gap&nbsp;cycle,  and the global geopolitical cycle  <p>So it’s pretty intuitive to see how it applies to where we are today — at the end of another big cycle. Debt is at record highs. Inflation is zero or negative. And governments and central banks around the world are borrowing and printing just to stay&nbsp;afloat.</p><p>We’ve also seen wealth and power accumulate at the top — expanding inequality and fueling monopolies as the winners take all. In parallel, we’re seeing the rise of populism on the left and right with people like Bernie, AOC, and Trump and movements like&nbsp;BLM.</p><p>With the center — socially, economically, and politically — crumbling, the U.S. has never been more divided. It’s a climate in which wearing a mask sparks intense debate, drawing social and political lines in the&nbsp;sand.</p><p>Geopolitically, things are only getting messier. A lot messier. And if things were feeling a bit biblical already with the pandemic, there’s also that locust&nbsp;plague:</p><blockquote>Locusts in swarms the size of Manhattan have been ravaging crops through East Africa, the Middle East and South Asia and could be “a bigger threat in some of these countries than Covid-19,” according to Gro Intelligence CEO Sara&nbsp;Menker.</blockquote><p>Anyway, Ray just published Part 1 of his latest report, Chapter 4, which covers <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chapter-4-big-cycle-united-states-dollar-part-1-ray-dalio/">the Big Cycle in the context of the U.S</a>. Part 1 is mostly history — much of which is super interesting and detailed, but probably the biggest takeaways are the principles he outlines.</p>Ray Dalio, Bridgewater<p>Some highlights:</p>  Severe economic downturns with large wealth gaps, large debts, and ineffective monetary policies make a combustible combination that typically leads to significant conflicts and revolutionary changes within countries.  Deflationary depressions are debt crises caused by there not being enough money in the hands of debtors to service their debts. They inevitably lead to the printing of money, debt restructurings, and government spending programs that increase the supply of, and reduce the value of, money and credit. The only question is how long it takes for government officials to make this&nbsp;move.  During periods of severe economic distress and large wealth gaps, there are typically revolutionarily large redistributions of wealth. When done peacefully these are achieved through large tax increases on the rich and big increases in the supply of money that devalue debtors’ claims, and when done violently they are achieved by forced asset confiscations.  <p>All of which leads us to today. I’ll wait for Ray’s next piece and let him outline where we’re going since this is heady stuff and really the only concrete conclusions I can make is that things are going to change and there’s going to be a lot of uncertainty.</p><p>Mostly I just have questions:</p>  How will this change the way we think about and manage our money and our value and our&nbsp;wealth?  How will the rise of populist forces impact the current corporate-led political establishment? (And in turn what does that mean for the country’s most powerful companies — the majority of which are&nbsp;tech?)  How will this impact how society thinks about bottom-up approaches versus top&nbsp;down?  How do we think about trust in a world that becomes increasingly distrustful?  Who are the real winners and losers in the rejiggered landscape? (Aside from… Tesla and Moderna.)  China?  <p>Here’s how Ray frames what potentially might come within a historical context:</p><blockquote>What is fascism, and why was it adopted in countries like Germany and Japan? Consider the following three big choices that one has to make in order choose a country’s approach to governance:</blockquote><blockquote>a) bottom-up (democratic) or top-down (autocratic) decision-making,</blockquote><blockquote>b) capitalist or communist (with socialist in the middle) ownership of production, and</blockquote><blockquote>c) individualistic (which treats the well-being of the individual with paramount importance) or collectivist (which treats the well-being of the whole with paramount importance).</blockquote><blockquote>Pick the one from each category that you believe works best for your nation’s values and ambitions and you have your preferred approach. Fascism is autocratic, capitalist, and collectivist. Fascists believed that top-down autocratic leadership, in which the government directs the production of privately held companies in a way that individual gratification is subordinated to national success, is the best way to make the country and its people wealthier and more powerful.</blockquote><blockquote>The United States and Great Britain believed that the democratic, capitalist, and individualistic mix was better, while the Soviet Union believed that the autocratic, communist, and collectivist mix was&nbsp;best.</blockquote><p>Of course, that was then. What comes next is still up in the&nbsp;air.</p><p>Ultimately, that’s the silver lining here. Everything is primed for&nbsp;change.</p><p>That’s scary. It’ll be messy. And I certainly don’t want to downplay the negative impact that all of this is and will continue to have on so many people around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>But it’s also a massive opportunity to help shape whatever comes&nbsp;next.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-13/bank-of-england-debating-digital-currency-creation-bailey-says">Bank of England Debating Digital Currency Creation, Bailey&nbsp;Says</a>  <a href="https://pv.glenbrook.com/covid-19-will-finally-force-b2b-digital-adoption/">COVID-19 Will (Finally!)

In terms of the consolidation of power and wealth, here’s a report from Fifth Era that highlights the cosmic shift in corporate power over the last&nbsp;decade. <p><a href="https://list-manage.agle1.cc/onlinelink/6745784850644992/6329074142150656/PBXHWo1PHDnoJ?ns=fifthera">Fifth Era</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><p>2010 World’s Largest Companies by Market&nbsp;Cap</p>  PetroChina ($329&nbsp;bn)  Exxon ($316&nbsp;bn)  Microsoft ($256&nbsp;bn)  ICBC ($246&nbsp;bn)  Apple ($213&nbsp;bn)  BHP Billiton ($209&nbsp;bn)  Wal-Mart ($209&nbsp;bn)  Berkshire Hathaway ($200&nbsp;bn)  General Electric ($194&nbsp;bn)  China Mobile ($193&nbsp;bn)  <p>5 years&nbsp;later:</p><p>2015 World’s Largest Companies by Market&nbsp;Cap</p>  Apple ($621&nbsp;bn)  Google ($408&nbsp;bn)  Microsoft ($347&nbsp;bn)  Berkshire Hathaway ($318&nbsp;bn)  Exxon Mobile ($304&nbsp;bn)  Johnson &amp; Johnson ($257&nbsp;bn)  General Electric ($248&nbsp;bn)  China Mobile ($243&nbsp;bn)  Novartis($240 bn)  Nestle ($233&nbsp;bn)  <p>And now:</p><p>2020 World’s Largest Companies by Market&nbsp;Cap</p>  Apple ($1,576&nbsp;bn)  Microsoft ($1,551&nbsp;bn)  Amazon.com ($1,432&nbsp;bn)  Alphabet ($980&nbsp;bn)  Facebook ($676&nbsp;bn)  Tencent ($620&nbsp;bn)  Alibaba ($579&nbsp;bn)  Berkshire Hathaway ($433&nbsp;bn)  Visa ($413&nbsp;bn)  Johnson &amp; Johnson ($370&nbsp;bn)   3. Speaking of increasing distrust, the big news last week is that the EU ruled against American cloud services. <p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eus-top-court-restricts-personal-data-transfers-to-u-s-citing-surveillance-concerns-11594888385">WSJ reports</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/ctomc">/ctomc</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/hn">/hn</a>):</p><blockquote>Thousands of companies will face restrictions on storing information about European Union residents on U.S. servers, after the bloc’s top court ruled that such transfers exposed Europeans to American government surveillance without “actionable rights” to challenge it.</blockquote><blockquote>The surprise ruling Thursday from the European Court of Justice, which invalidates a widely used EU-U.S. data-transfer agreement known as Privacy Shield, is a victory for privacy activists who have long said the U.S.’s surveillance practices should make it ineligible to store European&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>The decision, which pits European data-privacy concerns against U.S. national-security priorities, will create legal headaches and potentially disrupt operations for thousands of multinational companies. Depending on how it is applied, the ruling could force some of them — including tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc., AMZN +4.04% Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc. GOOG +2.41% and Apple Inc. — to decide between a costly shift toward data centers into Europe or cutting off business with the&nbsp;region.</blockquote><p>Also:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eus-top-court-restricts-personal-data-transfers-to-u-s-citing-surveillance-concerns-11594888385">EU’s Top Court Restricts Personal-Data Transfers to U.S., Citing Surveillance Concerns</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/india-regulator-non-personal-data-draft-report/">India seeks new regulator for nonpersonal data — TechCrunch</a>   4. And that distrust goes both&nbsp;ways. <p>Here’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/">Ben Thompson on The TikTok&nbsp;War</a>:</p><blockquote>After all, this certainly wasn’t the first time that TikTok has seemed to act politically: the service censored #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd, blocked a teenager discussing China’s genocide in Xinjiang, and blocked a video of Tank Man. The Guardian published TikTok guidelines that censored Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, and the Falun Gong, and I myself demonstrated that TikTok appeared to be censoring the Hong Kong protests and Houston Rockets basketball team.</blockquote><blockquote>The point, though, is not just censorship, but its inverse: propaganda. TikTok’s algorithm, unmoored from the constraints of your social network or professional content creators, is free to promote whatever videos it likes, without anyone knowing the difference. TikTok could promote a particular candidate or a particular issue in a particular geography, without anyone — except perhaps the candidate, now indebted to a Chinese company — knowing. You may be skeptical this might happen, but again, China has already demonstrated a willingness to censor speech on a platform banned in China; how much of a leap is it to think that a Party committed to ideological dominance will forever leave a route directly into the hearts and minds of millions of Americans untouched?</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>First, data security is absolutely a concern. To that end all companies that deal with valuable intellectual property or national security-related information should ban the use of WeChat by any of their employees, as should the government; it is simply too easy to pass information, even by accident. In addition, that same group of companies and governments should not use Zoom until the (American) company has shifted the bulk of its engineering out of China and demonstrated vastly improved corporate controls.</blockquote><blockquote>What matters more in an ideological war, though, is influence, and that is why I do believe that ByteDance’s continued ownership of TikTok is unacceptable. My strong preference would be for ByteDance to sell TikTok to non-Chinese investors or a non-Chinese company, by which I mean not-Facebook. TikTok is not only a brilliant app that figured out video on mobile, it is also shaping up to be a major challenge to Facebook’s hold on attention and thus, in the long run, advertising. This would be a very good thing, and I fear that simply banning TikTok will simply leave the market to Instagram Reels, Facebook’s TikTok&nbsp;clone.</blockquote> 5. All of that is compounded by a general sense of distrust in technology overall. Well, maybe distrust isn’t the right word here. But the pressures of where we are in the cycle and the impact of these rapidly accelerating trends is making us reevaluate our understanding of the platforms that more so than ever define&nbsp;us. <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/trump-twitter-facebook-and-the-future-of-online-speech">a nifty New Yorker piece on the future of online speech</a> and the history of those platforms and the relevant regs that fostered them (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>Ultimately, the problems that need solving may not be ones of content moderation. In the book “Platform Capitalism,” published in 2017, the economist Nick Srnicek explores the reliance of digital platforms on “network effects,” in which value increases for both users and advertisers as a service expands its pool of participants and suite of offerings. Network effects, Srnicek writes, orient platforms toward monopolization; monopolization, in turn, makes it easier for a single tweet to be an extension of state power, or for a single thirty-six-year-old entrepreneur, such as Zuckerberg, to influence the speech norms of the global digital commons. Both outcomes might be less likely if there were other places to go. The business model common to many social-media platforms, meanwhile, is itself an influence over online speech. Advertisers are attracted by data about users; that data is created through the constant production and circulation of user-generated content; and so controversial content, which keeps users posting and sharing, is valuable. From this perspective, Donald Trump is an ideal user of Twitter. A different kind of business might encourage a different kind of&nbsp;user.</blockquote><blockquote>Nothing about the current arrangement should be treated as inevitable; the commercial Internet is relatively young. Many scholars and tech critics have begun to look beyond the issue of moderation. Some argue for legislation requiring algorithmic transparency, which would illuminate how information is prioritized and amplified; Klonick has suggested that tech companies should register as public-benefit corporations, which would be required, by their charters, to benefit society as well as make money. (The Corporation for Public Broadcasting and New York’s M.T.A. are P.B.C.s.) In an article published in the Minnesota Law Review, “The Law of the Platform,” Orly Lobel, a law professor at the University of San Diego, argues that many of the most innovative Web sites don’t sell products, as such; instead, they offer their users access to algorithms, and to “a digital system of reputation and trust” that connects them. Regulating these never-before-seen businesses effectively, she writes, may require going “back to first principles,” thinking in fresh ways about what online platforms are and how we want them to&nbsp;behave.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/inside-the-federal-trade-commissions-facebook-probe-2b2b58c6-8469-40a7-832e-4fc8d8b9de0f.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Inside the Federal Trade Commission’s Facebook&nbsp;probe</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/twitters-big-hack-bares-broad-dangers-b6c05341-c2a6-468e-b719-5b52b411c941.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">Twitter’s big hack bares broad&nbsp;dangers</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/twitter-doesnt-need-web-3-0-to-solve-its-identity-problem">Preston Byrne: Twitter Doesn’t Need Web 3.0 For Its Identity Problem — CoinDesk</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/hackers-take-over-prominent-crypto-twitter-accounts-in-simultaneous-attack">Twitter Hack Takes Down Joe Biden, Elon Musk Accounts in Widespread Bitcoin Scam Attack — CoinDesk</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/toddjcollins">/toddjcollins</a>— <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/twitter-accounts-hacked-crypto-scam/">High-profile Twitter accounts simultaneously hacked to spread crypto scam — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/money-reimagined-this-isnt-good-for-bitcoin">This isn’t good for&nbsp;Bitcoin</a>   6.

<p>Dental staff are among the most vulnerable professions for COVID-19 infection risk. In March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that healthcare systems prioritize urgent visits and delay elective care to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings.</p>
<p>According to the April 1, 2020 edition of ADA News ("HPI poll examines impact of COVID-19 on dental practices"), by early April, 95% of dental practices were fully shuttered—or open only for emergency care.</p>
<p>A COVID-19 pandemic does not mean your teeth go on a vacation from needing cleanings, fillings, or root canals. Eventually, dental-office staff and patients need to go back to supporting their communities with peace of mind.</p>
<p>In order to enhance safety and confidence, the Georgia Academy of General Dentistry (GAGD) has partnered with MedCreds to more safely bring its members and their communities together. By promoting FDA-approved COVID-19 tests and using MedCreds’ verifiable credentialing for those tests, dentists, staff, and patients can now verify one another’s COVID-19-test-result status before any dental procedures.</p>
<p>Through COVID-19 testing and using MedCreds’ privacy-preserving COVID-19 test result credentials — which are owned and controlled exclusively by the patient—dentists can better protect staff and patients from COVID-19 infection risk.</p>
<p>ESSENTIAL TO THE PUBLIC’S HEALTH</p>
<p>In an April 17, 2020 letter written by American Dental Association (ADA) President Chad P. Gehani and Executive Director Kathleen T. O’Loughlin to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, dentistry was labeled “essential to the public’s health”.</p>
<p>“Enabling dentists to test patients prior to dental treatment will help lower the ‘very high exposure risk’ of dental personnel in contracting COVID-19 when treating infected but asymptomatic patients,” wrote Gehani and O’Loughlin in the HHS letter.</p>
<p>O'Loughlin added that testing patients prior to dental treatment would add a layer of safety for both dental personnel and the patients they treat.</p>
<p>DENTAL STAFF TEAM SAFETY</p>
<p>Dentists, dental assistants, dental hygienists, and office staff are among the most at-risk medical professions in this pandemic.</p>
<p>By strictly following ADA and CDC guidelines, and incorporating MedCreds’ verifiable COVID-19 test results credentials into safety protocols, dentists make a visible commitment to the safety of patients, staff, and their families.</p>
<p>MEDCREDS TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>At its core, MedCreds offers a digital verifiable credential that is a simple, private, and trusted way for a person to hold—and verify to others—their medical test results.</p>
<p>Built on blockchain and cryptography technology and accepted as an open-source global technology standard, MedCreds’ verifiable credentials allow people to verify and share their health status from a smartphone or personal computer, while fully controlling who is able to access their health status information.</p>
<p>By using blockchain-supported verifiable credentials, dental patients can prove their COVID-19 and other health test result status without also sharing unnecessary personal information. This protects personal privacy, and empowers individuals to securely share personal health information.</p>
<p>At the same time, dental practices have greater confidence that staff and patients are meeting best-practice requirements for COVID-19 safety.</p>
<p>THE ‘TRIANGLE OF TRUST’</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials facilitate interactions using a pattern called the "Triangle of Trust"</p>
<p>Issuers (e.g. a certified lab or doctor) issue digital credentials to a patient.</p>
<p>Holders (that would be you) receive a digital credential from an Issuer. This credential is stored in a “digital wallet” (a mobile app) which is accessible from a phone or computer.The holder can then share their COVID-19 test result status.</p>
<p>Verifiers (e.g. a dental receptionist) are those who may request a patient’s COVID-19 test result by sharing a web-link or QR code that prompts a patient for their consent to share their test result status.</p>
<p>HOW TO IMPLEMENT MEDCREDS</p>
<p>Any dentist office can simply and quickly have a MedCreds account created. After that, dentist-office staff can invite all patients and staff to create their free accounts at MedCreds.com by sending to them an email or SMS. The test result credentials can be easily and securely issued via the MedCreds web-portal platform.</p>
<p>When a patient arrives at a dentist office, the receptionist will request that they share their COVID-19 test result (and/or other type of test such as body temperature) by scanning a QR code, or responding to an email or text message. The credential verification proof will show the required information, such as COVID-19 test date, who administered the test, and the test result. But, that verification proof will only be shared after the credential holder (the patient) reviews and approves the sharing of their credential information.</p>
<p>In addition, your patient can also share this status at other locations (e.g. schools, office buildings, airplanes), or any place/situation that requires verifying their COVID-19 test result.</p>
<p>MedCreds enables your patients and staff at your dental office to confirm that each others’ COVID-19 test results were issued by an authorized medical authority.</p>
<p>When a patient schedules a dental appointment, there are important steps that should be taken before issuing a MedCreds “digital credential.”</p>
<p>THE MEDCREDS PATIENT PROCESS</p>
<p>Step #1: A patient remotely asks a dentist to order an FDA-approved COVID-19 test from their local lab.</p>
<p>Step #2: The dentist chooses a lab where the test will be performed.</p>
<p>Step #3: The dentist receives and reviews the test result, and—using the MedCreds’ platform—issues to the patient their personal, verifiable test-result credential.</p>
<p>Step #4: The patient now owns and controls the digital COVID-19 test result credential, and can share their result using a scannable QR code.</p>
<p>Step #5: Upon arriving at the dentist office, a patient scans the QR code prepared by the office staff, and the credential verification is instantly received, proving the legitimacy of their test result. This can also create an anonymous “paper trail” of office visitors’ health test results status, if desired by the dental practice manager.</p>
<p>MEDCREDS RECOMMENDED TIMETABLE</p>
<p>Due to the current challenges and limited availability of testing in some locations, it is advisable for dentists and their patients to follow a schedule such as the one below:</p>
<p>3 Weeks Before A Dental Appointment - Schedule an appointment with a doctor to get a referral for a COVID-19 test,</p>
<p>2 Weeks Before A Dental Appointment - Have a telemedicine visit with a doctor to have a health screening. The patient will be referred to a COVID-19 test at a convenient location,</p>
<p>[NOTE: The 2 items above may be accelerated for short-notice needs]</p>
<p>1-4 Days Before Your Dental Appointment - Visit a testing site to have a test administered using an approved COVID-19 test,</p>
<p>1 Day Before Your Dental Appointment - The patient receives a medical-professional-issued COVID-19 test-result credential from MedCreds.</p>
<p>Day of Patient’s Dental Appointment - Prior to arriving at the dental office, the patient shares with the office a verification proof of their COVID-19 test result via the MedCreds app. The dental office will then have a cryptographically verifiable record of COVID-19 test results issued by an authorized medical provider.</p>
<p>This process provides assurance that all dentist-office visitors have a suitable COVID-19 test result, prior to visiting, that has been issued by an authorized medical professional.</p>
<p>By following this procedure, patients and their dental-care team are assured that participants have made extensive efforts to create a safe environment for everybody, including having cryptographically verifiable records documenting the process.</p>
<p>MEDCREDS PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARD</p>
<p>According to a May 29, 2020 ADA press release ("CDC Guidance for Dental Settings Echoes ADA Guidance"), the CDC's Guidance for Dental Settings provides detailed patient management and facility consideration information for before, during, and after dental appointments.</p>
<p>This is in close alignment with the ADA’s Return to Work Interim Guidance Toolkit.</p>
<p>CDC and ADA recommendations include:</p>
 
 Request that dental staff call patients prior to the scheduled appointment to ask questions about their current health status.<br>
Advise patients to wear a face covering when entering the dental practice. 
 Limit the number of people who accompany a patient to the appointment. If possible, the patient should make the visit alone. 
 Assess all patients upon arrival; temperature checks may be completed. 
 Remove items in office waiting rooms such as toys or reading material to limit potential transmission through high touch surfaces. 
 Encourage social distancing practices by minimizing the number of patients in the waiting room by spacing appointments thoughtfully and perhaps by asking patients to wait in their car until the dental staff is ready to treat the patient. 
 Advise dental staff members to wear additional personal protective equipment (PPE) as appropriate, such as surgical masks or N95 masks, full face shields or goggles with side shields to ensure an environment that is as safe and healthy as possible for patients and the dental team. 
 Place hand sanitizer generously around the office for use, and ensure surfaces are cleaned regularly. 
 
<p>Headquartered in Pacifica, CA, MedCreds enables anyone that has a COVID-19 test result to hold a digital verifiable credential that can instantly and privately prove the results of their COVID-19 test, using only their mobile phone or personal computers</p>

<p></p>



<p>As the whole world has grappled with COVID-19, consumer behavior has shifted dramatically, and businesses had to respond in real-time. And while some of the changes will be temporary, industries like telemedicine, entertainment, hospitality, and fintech may never look the same. However, within real estate and self-tour, COVID-19 has acted as an accelerant, pushing companies to live in a reality that likely would have taken years to reach under any other circumstances. It’s a reality that one company is welcoming with open arms.</p>



<p>Self-isolation and social distancing have become a new way of life for most and legally mandated for many. Adapting to these new rules and norms as an individual does not mean that plans will follow suit; leases expire, families grow, and out of town job opportunities are all still very real. For an industry that has seen a rise in fraudulent actors on both sides, companies and renters alike typically only had two options: group open houses or one on one viewings, neither of which are seen as safe options today. For <a href="https://walk.in/">Walk.in</a>, a self-touring app, COVID-19 has acted as a means to expand offerings to those looking for a new home or office space in a way that feels comfortable and safe on their own terms.<br></p>







<p></p>



<p>Walk.in had already started outfitting properties with smart locks before the pandemic hit. They also built an app to facilitate self-tours to rental properties either with or without smart locks and used their own company as a test pilot.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>“The whole tour was a black box. A decision was made. We needed follow up, we needed metrics.”</p>– Ofir Sperling, CTO of Walk.in<br></blockquote>



<p>Before they found <a href="https://authenteq.com/">Authenteq’s KYC solution</a>, interested prospective renters selected a listing online and once they clicked on it, were prompted to provide a cell phone number where a link to download the app was sent. Sperling began researching the space for identity verification tools that could be integrated into the process.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>“A lot of companies were offering a lot of unnecessary services, too many bells and whistles, Authenteq took a surgical approach to ID verification and that’s what we really needed.”</p>– Ofir Sperling, CTO of Walk.in</blockquote>



<p>For Sperling, while identity verification was crucial, it didn’t allow for confirmation of who was actually entering the building and when. Authenteq’s selfie verification – which matches biometric data to the verified government-issued identification – allows them to not only answer those questions but brings peace of mind as it keeps the privacy and security of residents already living at that property at an all-time high. Choosing a fully automated system ensures that this all happens in real-time, eliminating both any lag time, thus enhancing the overall user experience, and the risk of human error. They have also included an AI-enhanced chat option for live feedback during tours.</p>



<p>Sperling and his team are currently collaborating with Authenteq on an advanced dashboard that will include the option for rental agents to manually override certain decisions in the rare instances where human intervention may be needed. </p>



<blockquote><p>“We do want to give our managers autonomy in the ID verification process where special circumstances may arise, but those are very rare.”&nbsp;</p>– Ofir Sperling, CTO of Walk.in</blockquote>







<p>Within the last 10 months, Walk.in has expanded from a simple auto-generated SMS text message system to a fully automated sophisticated KYC and identity verification system that allows for in-depth metrics to better evaluate business operations and reduces fraudulent claims overall.</p>



<p>The launch of Walk.in during COVID-19 was a daunting feat but as Sperling puts it, “it was the ideal real-world stress test for the system,” as they were able to make ad hoc adjustments and upgrades during the launch based on usage, feedback, and any new or temporary legislation. As a family-owned business with nearly 70 years in real estate, Walk.in’s team is uniquely positioned to understand what all parties involved need and they have brought that knowledge and experience into the technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before COVID-19 hit, 30 percent of their properties were listed on the Walk.in app, after the integration with Authenteq, 100 percent are now on the platform. </p>



<blockquote><p>“If you look at history, sometimes the biggest accelerators are disasters. There are a lot of technologies that come out of wars, it’s the same thing in medicine. And if you look at the self-tour space, it was us and two other companies, now there are at least 10 others that emerged during COVID. Our main advantage is that we come from this world of real estate, we grew up here, we know it much better than somebody coming from the tech world, just trying to capitalize on this moment.”</p>– Ofir Sperling, CTO of Walk.in</blockquote>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p> 
<p>Back in February (oh, how time flies! Just to think that it was right before the&nbsp;beginning of the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic…) I wrote a blog post looking at Oracle’s ambitious plans for developing&nbsp;its&nbsp;cloud strategy and expanding&nbsp;its&nbsp;worldwide infrastructure footprint. The post was titled “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/will-2020-be-the-year-of-oracle-cloud">Will 2020 Be the Year of Oracle Cloud?</a>” and just five months later the company has already demonstrated that it&nbsp;does not just&nbsp;finally&nbsp;have&nbsp;a&nbsp;promising&nbsp;vision for Oracle Cloud, but also a strong commitment to delivering&nbsp;on&nbsp;it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>A week&nbsp;ago,&nbsp;I attended an online event (yet&nbsp;another sign of the post-COVID times) hosted by Oracle’s Larry Ellison, where he spent a whole hour outlining his company’s recent achievements. And those are quite impressive indeed.&nbsp;The company’s cloud infrastructure shows significant growth not just in customer adoption, but physical size as well – currently, Oracle Cloud already has 24 regions worldwide, same as AWS,&nbsp;and planning to&nbsp;reach 36 regions by 2021. Very attractive pricing for customers with massive egress traffic requirements has already made a few prominent companies switch to Oracle from other clouds to reduce their costs – perhaps the most notable being Zoom.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>However, as I mentioned a few times in earlier posts already, Oracle has finally learned to focus their marketing efforts not on pricing alone, but on their unique differentiators – capabilities no other cloud service provides&nbsp;currently have. The key buzzword of this strategy is of course “autonomous”. Starting with the Autonomous Database in 2018, Oracle has brought Autonomous Linux to the market a year later and this time, Autonomous Data Guard was announced as a service to&nbsp;protect business-critical data in the cloud from disasters and network outages.&nbsp;Sealed from any external administrative access and powered by artificial intelligence, autonomous solutions&nbsp;largely&nbsp;eliminate the possibility of&nbsp;human&nbsp;negligence, misconfiguration, vulnerabilities left unpatched, or&nbsp;many&nbsp;kinds of malicious activities.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>The biggest announcement however was that autonomous services, which for several years were only offered as a part of Oracle’s public cloud portfolio, are finally available in the company’s private cloud platform,&nbsp;Cloud@Customer. Powered by the next-generation Exadata&nbsp;Cloud@Customer&nbsp;platform, Oracle’s Autonomous Database, with all its performance benefits and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/can-autonomous-improve-security-posture">security features</a>, is finally available to customers which for various reasons were avoiding the public cloud. While the hardware and the data reside on the customer’s premises, the infrastructure is fully managed by Oracle Cloud’s engineers and the pricing is equal to the one in the public cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Thanks to the company’s cloud infrastructure platform which&nbsp;maintains&nbsp;a&nbsp;strict separation between the cloud control plane and customer&nbsp;instances and ensures that Oracle’s engineers can never access sensitive customer data, this allows for completely new hybrid deployment scenarios.&nbsp;For example, Oracle can now build a new cloud datacenter for a single customer and operate it as a dedicated&nbsp;cloud&nbsp;region with full feature parity with its public cloud&nbsp;and the same unified management console. It is by no means a cheap solution with pricing starting at $500k per month, but this just announced service already has several early adopters.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Even though Oracle has entered the cloud race significantly later than current market leaders, it had an&nbsp;opportunity to learn from their mistakes and avoid repeating them. Instead,&nbsp;it&nbsp;focused&nbsp;on its unique expertise and made&nbsp;autonomous security the foundation of its development strategy. With the latest announcements of its Gen 2&nbsp;Cloud@Customer&nbsp;platform, Oracle can offer its customers exactly the same functionality on-premises as in its public cloud, ranging from just the Autonomous Database to a full-featured private cloud datacenter with over 50 managed services. To the extent of my knowledge, no other major CSP has anything comparable to offer&nbsp;at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Last but not least, it’s worth mentioning that Oracle’s second-generation cloud infrastructure has been architected&nbsp;with a much stronger emphasis on “security by design”. Incorporating such features as advanced tenant- and resource-level isolation and off-box network virtualization, it can ensure that customers’ sensitive data is kept off-limits not just from “nosy neighbors” but from Oracle’s own administrators as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Oracle has never positioned itself as a security vendor, its cloud strategy clearly indicates that security is the company’s top priority and a foundational principle for their cloud infrastructure. This might be just the right thing you need in these turbulent times.</p>

  The relentless move towards the digital transformation seems unstoppable. Organizations must secure their trust and reputation in the face of increasing attacks, advances in technology, increased regulation and compliance, and the continued shift to the cloud and cloud services. Unfortunately, not a single week goes by without another large-scale data breach or leak reported by the media – it seems that a company of any size or industry can fall victim to insufficient or ineffective data protection controls.

<p>On July 17th, Jack Tao, CEO of Phemex, was invited to join an AMA with our Co-Founder Andy Ji in the <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Ontology English Telegram</a> to talk about zero-fee spot trading on <a href="https://phemex.com/">Phemex</a> and much&nbsp;more!</p><p>Check the chat message history of AMA&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork/642671">here</a>.</p> Section 1: Top 10 pre-selected questions  Q1. Why the name&nbsp;Phemex? <p>Jack: Excellent question! Our name is inspired by the Greek Goddess Pheme, the personification of fame and the public’s voice. “Mex”, of course, just stands for mercantile exchange. We aspire to be the most trustworthy platform, one that is open and transparent. We want to represent and address the needs of our users and the crypto industry as a whole. Everything we do is with the best interest of our customers in mind. This is why we believe this name is well suited to represent our philosophy.</p> Q2. How are you different from other platforms? <p>Jack: Thank you for the question! Phemex is certainly different from other exchanges or trading platforms. Although we provide similar services, since our inception, we’ve diligently followed 4 core&nbsp;values.</p>  The client always comes first. Too often have we seen other exchanges prioritizing profits over service. To us, this is simply unacceptable. This core value, which also happens to be one of MorganStanley’s, is exemplified through our excellent customer service, the availability of our leadership team, and our openness to communicate.  We strive to improve every day. We are never satisfied with what we have achieved and we are not afraid to change in order to lead the industry. The recent addition of our Spot Trading services and Zero-Fee model is a great example of&nbsp;this.  Mutual benefit. We see fair and mutually advantageous partnerships that can become long term relationships as a key to success. This idea is what has helped us with the incredible number of new payment gateways and coins that we are featuring rapidly, including the Ontology&nbsp;family!  Giving back. Once again, another one of MorganStanley’s values as well. Whether it’s interesting and educational giveaways like our Satoshi Puzzle, charity work, or better and more affordable services, we will always give back to the community that supports us. We will never forget to remain thankful and humble for this opportunity we have to serve&nbsp;you.   Q3. Who are the people behind&nbsp;Phemex? <p>Jack: Thanks for asking this, we are always proud to introduce the core members of our team. Besides me as CEO, we have Cecilia Wang as our CMO. Cecilia used to be the CEO of J.C.Moritz. Her company specialized in serving top global management consulting firms and Fortune 500 clients in the areas of private equity and venture capital. With more than 10 years of executive experience in creating, developing, and managing both businesses and teams, Cecilia is undoubtedly one of the reasons for Phemex’s success. Next, we have Yang Du as our Chief Architect. Yang also has extensive experience in the financial industry as a core developer. He worked in Ericsson, MorganStanley, and HKEX for about 12 years. One of his main motivations is his belief that technology is meant to improve and simplify our lives. Having worked closely with Yang for many years, I can confidently say that he is one of the best developers I have ever met. Finally, as our Director of Business Development, we have Federico Variola, a Ph.D. candidate at Fudan University. He actually first encountered Phemex while researching the prospective role of cryptocurrencies in the international community. It wasn’t long after that, he joined our team to become a part of what he describes will be “a fundamental shift in transnational relations and the global economy”.</p> Q4. What do you think is the advantage of using Phemex than the other trading platforms? <p>Jack: Besides the core principles and guiding philosophies that differentiate us from others. Our services are also superior in many ways. Take our Zero-Fee Spot Trading and Premium Membership for example. We are the first major exchange to say goodbye to trading fees. While other exchanges will charge you 0.1–0.5% per trade that you make, we instead offer you a premium membership that can cost as low as $7 a month. For active and high volume traders, this means thousands or more in savings. The reason we’ve chosen to lead the industry with this model is once again rooted in our desire to provide better and more accessible services that place our customer’s needs&nbsp;first.</p> Q5. What are the benefits of @Phemex_official from doing AMA in @OntologyNetwork? What is the strength of the community that @Phemex_official expects? <p>Jack: As mentioned previously, customer service and open communications are two factors that are very important to us as a company. This is why we wanted to provide this opportunity to the Ontology community to get to know us better and ask us any questions that you may be curious about. We are always incredibly happy to partner with a promising project that has a passionate community. This AMA is only the first step in our initiative to merge our communities and grow together as we ensure mutual&nbsp;success.</p> Q6. Is there a plan to list futures trading for ONT on the Phemex platform? <p>Jack: Yes! We are diligently working to develop an ONT perpetual contract for you and all those interested. Stay tuned with our social media as we will announce more details&nbsp;soon.</p> Q7. With the recent breach happened on Twitter, What can you say about the security of Phemex? And what ways do Phemex implement to avoid data&nbsp;breach? <p>Jack: Security is very important to us. We take these types of incidents very seriously. Although we cannot comment on Twitter’s security practices and what led to the recent breach, what we can do, is promise you that both your assets and data are safe with us. In terms of our wallets, we’ve implemented a Hierarchical Deterministic Cold Wallet System which assigns separate cold wallet deposit addresses to each user. All the deposits are periodically gathered in the company’s multi-signature cold wallet via offline signature. Each withdrawal request is rigorously scrutinized by both operators and founders. Based on our sophisticated Wall Street risk control experience, we are able to detect any malicious actions and quickly act to protect the assets of our users and platform. Qualified withdrawal requests are also processed via offline signature, thereby all assets remain 100% stored in a cold wallet system with all operations conducted offline.</p><p>In terms of our system, it is deployed on secured on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) Cloud. We have firewalls to separate different zones and machines for different trading purposes. Our internal network access management protocols control the accessibility of one instance to another. Phemex applies restrictions on a system level. In many restricted zones, we only allow whitelisted instances to access the system while the system itself must also be whitelisted.</p><p>As far as your account, we use a bank-level double-entry bookkeeping system to ensure account security. Each time a user performs a funding operation, Phemex performs a matching accounting action in two or more accounts to prevent the tampering of records. Through the double-entry bookkeeping mechanism, Phemex can immediately detect if the user’s account has been tampered with. If so, the system will immediately freeze the tampered account and stop all of its pending actions and operations.</p><p>Rest assured knowing that our security is top-notch and even in the unlikely event of any incident we have you covered&nbsp;100%.</p> Q8. Would you please allow ONT currency to be withdrawn from the platform or will the withdrawal remain for USD and&nbsp;BTC? <p>Jack: All of our listed tokens, including ONT, can be directly and conveniently withdrawn to the wallets of your&nbsp;choice.</p> Q9. Can customers get support from PHEMEX support without delivering sensitive personal information? What information do you save on the system? Is it necessary to present the information? How does the system protect users from risks?? (@phonglan1232) <p>Jack: Absolutely! You will get assistance from our customer support at any point you desire without the need of providing any sensitive information. Our service has no KYC. This means that when you create an account, you do not have to provide your personal information. Likewise, when you request our assistance, you only need your user ID and the email address you used to create the account, but again, none of these are associated with your personal identity.</p> Q10. Will a Phemex token be created and what obstacles stand in the way of&nbsp;that? <p>Jack: At this time, we have no plans of creating our own token. We instead want to focus our efforts on improving and optimizing the services that we currently provide. In addition, we are more interested in partnering with influential projects such as Ontology to help address other demands that are already present in the crypto industry.</p> Section 2: Top 5 selected LIVE questions  Q1. I am already using other Trading platforms. Why should I Move to the Phemex Platform? What Main benefits will I get on the Phemex platform? (@rinnguyen) <p>Jack: The main benefits of trading on Phemex are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>1) zero trading fee for spot&nbsp;market</p><p>2) top liquidity in derivatives trading</p><p>3) best performance, no lagging no overloading (we have a youtube demo for that, the only one in the&nbsp;world)</p><p>4) best&nbsp;security</p><p>5) the best CS among&nbsp;peers.</p><p>6) transparency&nbsp;….</p><p>7) more financial products to provide to our members with no change in membership fees, and more and&nbsp;more</p> Q2. What is the main potential Threat do you see in Blockchain Technology currently? What is the real-life problem Phemex is aiming to solve with Blockchain? (@ashwini_Crypto) <p>Jack: Well, threat… I would rather say challenges. It is a new, fresh industry. It gives ppl another choice except for fiat. The technology inspired many of us probably a generation. Since it shows a way to build something cool and better. But it has many challenges. TPS, throughputs are still the main challenges we&nbsp;have.</p><p>Whether we can fully achieve decentralization or get closer needs time and effort. I do see researchers are working on it, many good projects like Ontology are moving towards those directions. But I do believe blockchain tech is one of the most important innovations in this century, no doubt. it changes many ppl’s careers and lives. and I believe it will be something even bigger and&nbsp;better.</p><p>Regarding the Phemex mission, we want everyone can catch opportunities and prevent risks in this revolution. Quite simple. Exchanges play a critical role in this industry. The exchange has to be safe, cheap, efficient to help us find true values of cryptos. DeEx is not perfectly ready. CeEx still has lots more to offer if more and more team like us to join the party, this industry will become better and&nbsp;better</p> Q3. How does Phemex incentivize liquidity in the markets? Does Phemex have in-house market makers to ensure liquidity is consistently provided? What can people do if they are interested in providing liquidity on Phemex? (@armahes) <p>Jack: We use 3rd party MMers. Top MMer in bitMEX, FTX, Binance, Huobi (ignore my sequence&nbsp;:)), etc. are all MM with us. and there are more connecting. We will soon be one of the top liquidity.</p><p>Improving the liquidity on our platform is always a top priority for us. We are currently and continuously working to optimize our services by signing up with more third-party market makers. If you wish to help us in this task, feel free to write to us at marketing@phemex.com and we will discuss any future potential collaboration.</p> Q4. Community Support &amp; Awareness of Platform is very Important for any Exchange &amp; Trading Platform! So, How do you Evaluate Community Support? What are your plans to achieve more Adoption &amp; awareness of the Phemex Exchange Platform? (@Hoang_NamV) <p>Jack: We have established several local communities to encourage our users' involvement and we have received great feedback and support from all over the world, if anyone is interested in joining we’d be glad to have you on&nbsp;board.</p><p>The Phemex team has established several local communities to encourage their users' involvement and they have received great feedback and support from all over the world if anyone is interested in joining they will be glad to have you on&nbsp;board.</p> Q5. what success stories have you been able to observe in the time you have been active? Which users have stood out, any particular case interesting? (@lelebakar) <p>Jack: There are so many. There are so many young generations dedicated themselves to this industry and become extremely successful. Like Vitalik (ETH). One of the biggest MMer among, Huobi, Phemex, Binance was born in 1990, 4 years ago he was struggling to find a job as a developer.<br>There is a guy in our exchange won xx BTC by just using $2 worth trading welcome bonus. I have a friend in NY, try to build the next generation of blockchain and he has been working on that for 4 years. I mean this new industry is full of excitement and surprises. This is the part I like most. If you dig into it you will find your&nbsp;gold.</p><p>Speaking on this collaboration, Andy JI, Ontology’s Co-Founder said:</p><blockquote>Ontology is pleased to be listed on Phemex, a revolution in traditional exchange services. After joining the #ZeroFeeFamily, users in the Ontology community can enjoy a better ONT spot trading experience on&nbsp;Phemex.</blockquote> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ama-recap-ontology-x-phemex-ddb44cd2d9e0">AMA Recap: Ontology x Phemex</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>Due to the recent large demand for Network Fees from token holders, on this Members’ Day, we hope to provide our friends with the opportunity to get more Network Fees: top up Network Fee within a specified period, and get additional 20%.</p><p>Time-limited Network Fee&nbsp;benefits</p><p>1. Rules: top up Network Fee with any token, and an extra 20% Network Fee will be sent, which means you pay $1 get $1.2<br>2. Period: 6:00(UTC) on July 20 ~ 6:00(UTC) on July 27<br>3.

When transferring, using dapps, or managing account permissions, as long as the operation sends transactions to the blockchain, fees will be generated and deducted from users’ Network Fee balance. Besides, the Network Fee is required when enabling new blockchain features, withdrawing Hongbao balance, and participating in some limited activities in&nbsp;MYKEY.</p><p>The characteristic of the Network Fee is the integration of network resources of multiple public blockchains. You can use the major features of MYKEY without GAS / Ram / CPU / NET. MYKEY will actively expand Network Fees into the transaction and financial management scenarios in the following time.

  <p>OpenID Connect has become a leading standard for providing relying parties with identity information. With a growing global adoption, OpenID Connect faces new use cases, like eGovernment, telecommunications, and health applications, where just providing identity information is not enough. Instead, the identity provider (IDP) needs to explicitly attest the verification status of the claims delivered. More precisely, it must distinguish verified from unverified claims and provide information about the verification itself: What data was verified? How was that checked and according to which rules? When was it checked and by whom? What evidence was used in the process? This information facilitates mapping between regulatory/legal contexts and provides a basis for dispute resolution and auditing. OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance aims to solve this problem: The standard defines a robust and unambiguous representation of verified claims and verification metadata. Based on global collaboration, it includes identifiers for various international trust frameworks, identity documents, and verification methods. Fine-grained data minimization controls ensure user privacy and compliance. This talk gives an introduction to the current status of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance: From the design objectives to the data structures.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve5_2020_07_16_lodderstedt"></a>

  <p>I have such a great job. I’m constantly inspired by ForgeRock customers all over the world who are delivering breakthrough digital experiences. So I know that these individuals are innovating beyond expectations, but it’s always gratifying when the industry also gives credit where credit is due. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/">KuppingerCole</a>, Europe’s leading analyst firm for Information Security, awarded BMW its prestigious KC Virtual Award.</p>

<p>The KC Virtual Awards honor outstanding Identity Management (IM) and Security projects and this year the award for the best IAM for Digital Transformation project was bestowed upon BMW. The globally recognized automaker has a strong focus on identity. The company manages 25 million identities ranging from employees to customers to dealers, ensuring the right people are using the right products and apps, and enjoying the best possible digital experience.</p>

 How Did BMW Do It? 

<p>It was important to BMW to ensure ease-of-use so its customers and partners can easily and safely access various BMW applications. To achieve this, BMW needed to consolidate its numerous disparate systems and build a central Identity Platform (IDP) for the whole organization to better serve its employees, customers, partners, car dealers and technical providers. Prior to the consolidation, BMW was developing tons of custom code to connect various systems, which was costly and time-consuming. The disparate systems also required users to log in to multiple systems multiple times, which complicated the goal of a seamless user experience.</p>

<p>BMW embarked on an identity strategy, called OneIDP, which required the company to consolidate 20 different Identity Management and Access Management (IAM) systems that supported its three brands (BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce and other entities like BMW Financial Services) into one. With this project, BMW wanted to:</p>

  Offer an exceptional and seamless user experience&nbsp; 
	 Reduce onboarding and maintenance cost through automation 
	 Achieve faster time to market through automation 
	 Increase scalability 
	 Enable new business cases such as IoT 
	 Increase performance 
 <p>ForgeRock’s platform enabled the company to bring together its identity systems and achieve significant cost savings, improve time to market, scalability and compliance. The new approach, which supports 25 million users, also allows BMW to deliver critical data and services to consumers, partners quickly, easily and securely. Stephanus Reiger, Group IT--Infrastructure and Technology Management for BMW Group, recently participated in a virtual panel during <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-live">ForgeRock Identity Live</a> and said, “ForgeRock is essential for us to create a central IDP for BMW.”</p>

 BMW for the Win! 

<p>Since deploying OneIDP, BMW has surpassed expectations. For example, rolling out new applications was costly and took up to 15 days. With ForgeRock, the process is automated, making it possible to deploy new apps within seconds and at zero cost. Additionally, internal performance tests revealed that BMW can process 8,000 authentication requests per second. During the award ceremony, Gerald Maier, IT Solutions Architect for BMW, said, "I'd really like to thank the 2 partners, IC Consult...and of course ForgeRock because in my opinion they not only have excellent software, they really supported us with excellent knowledge and experience."</p>

					 <p>Looking to do its part in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, Trinsic <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/call-to-action-verifiable-credentials-covid-19-a180155a157c">announced</a> three months ago that it would waive all fees for anyone working on projects related to the pandemic. Since then, we have seen a myriad of use cases ranging from using verifiable credentials for HIPAA certifications, to privacy-first contact tracing, to credentialing doctors for telemedicine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The use case with the strongest traction has been creating verifiable COVID-19 test results in digital form. Currently, the process of receiving and using a paper-based COVID-19 test result is fraud-prone and clunky. Verifiable credentials makes this process more secure and streamlined.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of our partners, MedCreds, is on the leading edge of providing secure, privacy-respecting, and regulatory-compliant solutions and has recently taken their COVID-19 verifiable test-result product to market.</p>

					 <p><a href="https://mymedcreds.com/">MedCreds</a> is an application that provides people with their COVID-19 test result in the form of a verifiable credential. This means that MedCreds gives people a trustworthy digital version of their test result that they carry on their phone or computer and can share with others. <a href="https://trinsic.id/powerful-apis/">Trinsic APIs</a> power the MedCreds application, allowing for the secure and scalable exchange of verifiable credentials.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Employers are currently using MedCreds to better protect their patients and staff as they return to work.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Here’s how it works:<br><br></p>  A person registers for a MedCreds account and connects with a MedCreds medical provider.  The MedCreds provider briefly chats with the person and orders a test.  The person then takes a FDA-approved COVID-19 test, and the medical provider sends the patient their test result as a verifiable credential which they can store on their mobile phone or computer.  The person can then easily share their test result by scanning a QR code at places like their dentist’s office, their workplace, or the airport.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 MedCreds in action 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>MedCreds recently announced that it partnered with <a href="https://www.bravemaker.com/">BraveMaker</a>, a California-based nonprofit film arts organization, to help its film crews more safely return to work for a recent filming project. A preliminary trial was done as a first step toward standardizing the use of verifiable credentials for COVID-19 test results into a reliable process to help re-start movie production as safely as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Ben Littlejohn is a board-certified, family-medicine physician who works with MedCreds as a medical advisor. Of the partnership between MedCreds and BraveMaker he said the following:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				“I am excited that patients to whom I have issued MedCreds verifiable credentials can prove to any other party, with certainty, that I issued these test results. Until now, this level of verification for medical test results has not been possible. I am proud to help BraveMaker studios get back to work and restart the independent film industry."			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The film industry is not alone in using MedCreds to return to work. MedCreds has <a href="https://medcreds.com/georgia-academy-of-general-dentistry/">partnered</a> with the <a href="https://www.gagd.org/">Georgia Academy of General Dentistry</a> (GAGD) to provide free COVID-19 test credentials to their providers and patients. Using MedCreds, dentists can significantly reduce the risk of spreading and contracting COVID-19 for both them and their patients. The video below provides a brief summary of how this works.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Streamlining the process 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The current process of delivering COVID-19 tests results is cumbersome and inefficient. When a medical professional receives the result of a COVID-19 test, they must call the patient to deliver the result. If the patient does not answer (a frustratingly frequent occurrence), the provider must keep calling until the patient does answer because leaving voicemails with test-result information is a violation of HIPAA regulations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If a patient wants documentation of their test results, they must either pick up a printout of their test result or have the result faxed to them. Emailing the test result to the patient is not HIPAA-compliant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is essentially impossible to verify that a test document is legitimate because:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Printouts are notoriously easy to forge.  There is no standardized format for COVID-19 test results, so it’s hard to visually spot a fishy-looking document.  And there are a dizzying number of labs and types of tests—all of varying quality.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may think someone finding a suspicious-looking document could simply call the lab or doctor to verify its authenticity, but the lab or provider would be unable to answer any questions because—you guessed it—that’s not HIPAA-compliant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With MedCreds, the medical professional delivers the test result straight to the patient’s phone or computer, skipping the hassle of contacting them by phone. The patient can share the result in a private way with anyone, and anyone can verify (using Trinsic’s advanced cryptography) that it was issued by such-and-such lab and hasn’t been tampered with or altered. And, it is HIPAA-compliant!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Brent Blue is a family-practice physician and another medical advisor for MedCreds. In the following video, he explains why his practice uses MedCreds, and why he recommends it to his colleagues.</p>

					 <p>While it is impossible to eliminate all risk, the MedCreds system significantly reduces the risks of reentering the office, going to the dentist, boarding an airplane, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Knowing that someone recently tested negative for the novel coronavirus significantly reduces the likelihood that they are spreading the disease. This information can be combined with other data such as COVID prevalence in a certain area, how close people are likely to interact in a certain setting, and the age or health demographics of groups to make better decisions about when and how to reopen, and how to do so safely. Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/call-to-action-verifiable-credentials-covid-19-a180155a157c">wrote</a>:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				"By risk decisions, I mean that everyone can autonomously decide how much risk they’re willing to take on. For example, an airline could specify passengers will only be allowed to board if they can present a negative result from a test that was taken in the last two hours. But the employee loading the bags into the plane maybe only needs to have taken a test in the last 48 hours. The policy can be set depending on the risk level of the activity."			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The steps to safely reopen society and the economy are not cut and dry. And we’re still learning every day about the best ways to reopen economies. But MedCreds provides a valuable tool to make better risk decisions and reduce the risk of spreading or contracting the virus.</p>

<p>Last month we celebrated two years since the launch of the Ontology MainNet, coupled with the unveiling of <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/introducing-ontology-2-0-layer-2-enabled-accessible-business-suite-997a76f6cd2a">Ontology 2.0</a>, which saw the integration of a number of community suggested upgrades to our&nbsp;MainNet.</p><p>Guaranteeing the future development and success of our ecosystem remains our number one priority and we want to make it as easy as possible for every individual to get involved in our network. This is why our new staking model, rolled out on 7th July, lowers the barrier for entry for users to stake their tokens and run a node. As well as securing the Ontology network, staking ONT now provides rates currently ranging from 7% up to 40% APY depending on the node, which are competitively high rates amongst both public chain staking yields and DeFi&nbsp;yields.</p><p>Keep scrolling to read about the advantages for individual stakers.</p><p>Benefits for individual stakers</p>  In a bid to encourage more stakers to participate and earn ONG rewards, the minimum stake requirements have been lowered from 500 ONT to 1&nbsp;ONT.  As part of our new governance and staking economic model, the ONG fee per transaction will be increased fivefold from 0.01 ONG to 0.05 ONG, which helps stakers earn more from network&nbsp;fees.  The staking yield fluctuates in real-time and is affected&nbsp;by:  <p>(a) Network operation and staking&nbsp;status</p><p>(b) Fee-sharing ratio set by the&nbsp;nodes</p><p>(c) Node ranking (only the top 49 nodes can receive the Foundation bonus)</p><p>(d) ONT and ONG&nbsp;price</p><p>Users can switch between nodes and sort them by their Annual Percentage Yields (APY), helping users easily identify the nodes with the highest rewards. You can check out the latest figures for each node and learn more at <a href="http://node.ont.io/">node.ont.io</a>.</p><p>Staking Revenue&nbsp;Estimate</p><p>Before you begin staking, you can use our Node &amp; Staking Yield Calculator, which is available at <a href="http://node.ont.io/">node.ont.io</a>.</p><p>Please note that the effective yield depends on a number of dynamic variables, such as the price of ONT and ONG, the total staked amount on the network, and the total ONT staked on each node. The results are based on our own prediction formulas, and we do not guarantee any specific accuracy. The result is only a rough estimate and should not be used as financial advice.</p><p>Step by&nbsp;step</p><p>For example, if you choose to stake 900000 ONT on OKEx Pool, the expected yield rate is 8.24% (a figure at the time we used the calculator, it may change in real-time).</p><p>For more details on the yield calculation methods for consensus and candidate nodes, please refer to <a href="https://node.ont.io/Ontology%20Staking%20Incentive%20Calculation_202006.pdf">Ontology Staking Incentive Calculation</a>.</p><p>Start staking now by downloading <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet</a>!</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/to-stake-or-not-to-stake-the-benefits-of-staking-ont-50723e7c1e7e">To Stake or Not to Stake?

  <p>Consumer Identity Management (CIAM) ensures privacy, consent management, security, personalization and user experience for external users, especially consumers and customers. Although the drawbacks of building yet another data silo are obvious, many organizations still view CIAM as an isolated system. But this ignores significant potential. Matthias Reinwarth talks about the range of opportunities that can be gained by converging CIAM into an overall IAM concept, but also by integrating CIAM into broader cybersecurity and marketing infrastructures.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve5_2020_07_16_reinwarth"></a>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>It looks like the whole world is currently talking (at least, tweeting) about the latest large-scale Twitter hack. High profile accounts of the likes of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos, as well as companies like Apple or Uber, were suddenly promoting a cryptocurrency scam. At first, they referred to a specific crypto-related website, but as it was quickly taken down, the hackers switched to spreading multiple Bitcoin addresses, asking people to send money to them to get a double amount of their investment back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even though this type of scam is nothing new and should look obviously suspicious to anyone, the sheer size of the Twitter platform allowed hackers to reach enough gullible people to collect over $100,000 within hours.</p>
 The hack was an inside job 
<p>Looking at the number of accounts affected (including major corporations with strong security practices), it quickly became obvious that the attack was performed by a single actor with a possibility of it being an insider job at Twitter. The company later confirmed “a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.”</p>
<p>Several screenshots of the alleged internal tool have also leaked, showing what an employee could do to an account, including changing the email address linked to it to prevent legitimate owners from restoring their access. Various press outlets are currently speculating about the methods the hacker could have gained access to this tool from a Twitter employee: was it really a social engineering attack or an action of a malicious insider.</p>
 Inconvenient assumptions 
<p>For me, however, this is by far not the biggest question. Judging by the attack timeline and Twitter’s reaction to it, it becomes rather clear that they were not aware of malicious activities happening on such a massive scale until the attack was already underway, causing public outcries and even calls from concerned politicians. Does it imply that the company has no appropriate security monitoring tools in place, which would have at least alerted about suspicious behavioral anomalies in their network?</p>
<p>Also, the idea of employees having unchecked access to such powerful administration tools, giving them a potential ability to manipulate any account, access sensitive personal data, or even post on their behalf raises a lot of concerns. Does Twitter even have any privileged access controls in place for these tools? How could it be compliant with regulations like GDPR and CCPA?</p>
 What can users do? 
<p>Can we even trust anything posted on the platform anymore, if nobody can be protected from such attacks, not even Elon Musk or Donald Trump? And by the way, who is supposed to be held responsible for this debacle? The first thing I tried to do after I’ve read about the attack is to find the name of Twitter’s chief security officer. But apparently, the company does not have one since 2018…</p>
<p>Finally, what can we the users do? Nothing apparently. Protecting sensitive systems from malicious insiders can only be done, well, from inside the company. Unfortunately, it’s apparently too late to teach Twitter about PAM, compliance and security best practices, but at least we could teach you… Check out our latest <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/kcvepam">KCLive Event on Privileged Access Management</a>, for example – this could be a good start towards becoming smarter than Twitter!</p>

  Digital transformation has made it possible for the Organisations to become more effective and more efficient in developing new products and the ways of working, at the same time Organizations now face many challenges to their digital security. The increased connectivity needed to support mobile employees, to integrate business partners into internal processes and to get closer to their customers has increased digital risks. Protecting the digital assets, the systems, and applications in this complex hybrid IT environment requires a well-thought-out understanding of risks and countermeasures.

Identity and Access Governance (IGA) with its two core elements, Identity Provisioning and Access Governance, is essential to enabling and securing digital transformation.

This KCLive Event will focus on the main points of IGA, Its core capabilities, how to enable and protect the Digital Transformation with IGA.

Help you understand Why having infrastructure for Identity Provisioning and Access Governance in place is the cornerstone for successfully managing identities, their accounts, and their entitlements across the heterogeneous and increasingly hybrid IT infrastructure of organizations.

<p>Last week, GlobaliD co-founder and CEO Greg Kidd participated in the Linqto Global Investor Conference, where he’s a regular panelist.</p><p>Focusing on the future of digital assets, <a href="https://youtu.be/qmmBKMYJFDk">the panel</a> also featured:</p>  JP Thieriot, CEO of&nbsp;Uphold  Bill Sarris, CEO of&nbsp;Linqto  Jamie Finn, President of Securitize  Matthew Le Merle, co-founder and Managing Partner of Fifth Era and Keiretsu&nbsp;Capital  JP, Bill, Greg, Matthew, and&nbsp;Jamie<p>Here are some highlights from their discussion on the current market and their investment strategies:</p>  Benefits of moving any asset class from paper to native&nbsp;digital  Uphold’s developer-first approach to the&nbsp;wallet  GlobaliD’s distinct contribution—portability   On “the benefits of moving any asset class from paper to a native digital&nbsp;format”: <p>Greg: I take a sociopolitical view. Obviously with GlobaliD, we’ve been big in terms of financial inclusion — that’s getting everybody a seat at the table. But there’s also just an access issue with getting every asset, every form of value at the&nbsp;table.</p><blockquote>“So while there’s getting everyone a seat at the table, it’s letting everything in the room be a chip on the table. That’s just a fun box that I want to see opened. I want to see it happen in my lifetime and I’m excited. Let the show&nbsp;begin.”</blockquote><p>That’s an amazing transformation of society. We can’t even begin to imagine if everything around us is liquid, then all sorts of things that we didn’t used to think of as money are now a form of money or exchange. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a communist or a capitalist. We all live in an exchange society — and the idea that there would only be certain types of things that are liquid in the world versus everything — it’s an access issue to&nbsp;us.</p><p>So while there’s getting everyone a seat at the table, it’s letting everything in the room be a chip on the table. That’s just a fun box that I want to see opened. I want to see it happen in my lifetime and I’m excited. Let the show&nbsp;begin.</p><p>On “the biggest barriers to getting this digitally enabled world really humming”:</p><p>Greg: When I was at the Federal Reserve, we had this fleet of learjets. It wasn’t for people — it was for flying checks around. Because you had to present the checker where it came from to get settlement. 9/11 happened and we suddenly realized with all the planes grounded that we weren’t going to be able to clear because the jets couldn’t&nbsp;fly.</p><blockquote>“There’s this little thing called COVID. You might’ve heard of it. The transformation in terms of what people are now doing through conference calls like this and the fact that this seems like the new normal has shown that it’s possible to take something that we took for granted doing in person — going to work and seeing each other. And what we’re doing now — this accelerated all my expectations about digitization.”</blockquote><p>Somebody said, “Well, you know, maybe we should just send the information on the checks around like everyone else in the world does.” And if we didn’t do that, the whole U.S. financial system would have melted down. We realized we didn’t need the physical asset to do clearing and settlement. But we needed a crisis. And after the crisis, it was clear — we don’t need Learjets. We could do this digitally.</p><p>What’s the crisis that we have today? There’s this little thing called COVID. You might’ve heard of it. Who would have thought that we’d be having this meeting or watching NASCAR or Hamilton in a digital format — as opposed to going in-person to NASCAR or going to see Hamilton. The transformation in terms of what people are now doing through conference calls like this and the fact that this seems like the new normal has shown that it’s possible to take something that we took for granted doing in person — going to work and seeing each other. And what we’re doing now—this accelerated all my expectations about digitization.</p><p>So if you’re going to have these kinds of conversations and do a whole bunch of things that we were used to doing physically, now, we’re going to do virtually. It gives me hope that this process of moving toward digitization of all assets can be sped up. Just like the process of moving from in-face meetings to teleconference calls. You look at the growth of Zoom — it’s possible. We have had a kick in the pants now. Never let a good crisis go to waste — just like as happened with the Fed, just like is happening now with&nbsp;COVID.</p><blockquote>“First, the brave go forth and have to climb steep curves to make small inroads. Then second, the talented see the future vision, and they begin to make small profits. Then third, the strong command and conquer the necessary markets. And finally fourth, the masses follow, turning disruption into what is the&nbsp;norm.”</blockquote><p>Bill: I’ve been in disruption in three different industries and inertia is the main deterrent. Disruptive change happens in a series of steps. First, the brave go forth and have to climb steep curves to make small inroads. Then second, the talented see the future vision, and they begin to make small profits. Then third, the strong command and conquer the necessary markets. And finally fourth, the masses follow, turning disruption into what is the&nbsp;norm.</p><p>This usually takes a long period of time for that to gestate. As Greg is saying, with what’s happening with the pandemic, it’s like what happened with the dinosaurs. We lost 75 percent of all species during a very short 30 million period at one point 65 million years ago. Well, we’re already in the third phase — as the strong are conquering the markets right now. And with the pandemic — that’s why I said earlier, I think this is all just exponentially [decreasing] the time it’s going to take for us to get through the disruption of this space. It will be happening totally within the next 5–10 years and not 20 years from&nbsp;now.</p> On Uphold’s developer-first approach to the&nbsp;wallet: <p>Matthew: I just want to explain why Alison [Davis] and I were investors in Inktomi that powered the best search engines. They’re all gone, AltaVista, Ask Jeeves — we don’t even know their names. And the reason was that Google came along. Well, I’m an investor in Coinbase and in Circle and in Kraken — and we were in Zoom — and now I’ve seen Uphold and it feels like that same sort of moment. It is so much easier. And it’s mashing together Coinbase and PayPal and Telegram and other things. What’s your distinctive contribution, JP, to this dialogue.</p><blockquote>As an example, another of your panelists will soon be building a wallet on top of Uphold and hopefully dozens more behind him will be doing similarly. So following a Stripe sort of path to the future — that’s certainly one big differentiator.</blockquote><p>JP: The thing that differentiates us from that list of companies you just went through is our ability to act as a platform as opposed to as a single retail-oriented property. As an example, another of your panelists will soon be building a wallet on top of Uphold and hopefully dozens more behind him will be doing similarly. So following a Stripe sort of path to the future — that’s certainly one big differentiator.</p><p>The other is in driving third-party ecosystems that are not today served by the banking system by those let’s call it rival exchanges you just allied to or by anybody else. The example I’ve used there is the Brave ecosystem. Brave proposes to reorganize the way money moves between advertisers and publishers and users of the internet.</p><p>There just isn’t another platform out there that can handle the complexity, handle the millions of constituents in those three buckets around the world. We do the same for Coil. We’re going to announce some other big partners. So as the world heads toward Web 3.0 monetization and towards a gig economy that will see more freelance workers than corporate employees in 5–10 years, we’re purpose-built for&nbsp;that.</p> On GlobaliD’s “distinctive contribution”—portability: <p>Greg: We have the Copernicus issue. For a long time before Copernicus, people thought that the sun revolved around the earth and that meant that your identity belonged to a government or a corporation. It might be a bank; it might be Facebook. It might be any of those. And the inversion that we’re doing is your identity belongs to you — that the earth revolves around the sun and you are the sun. So it is your ability to attach any source of assets you want to your identity and do with them what you&nbsp;want.</p><blockquote>So whether it’s porting your reputation from Airbnb or Uber or porting your money from Wells Fargo or Schwab, it’s your money. So portability for us is the big differentiator. We’re neutral. We support all the identity platforms. We would connect to all asset sources. As long as you have a name, you attach all your assets to&nbsp;that.</blockquote><p>We believe simply because your assets sit on this server or that server controlled by this country or that company — that shouldn’t get in the way of you doing what you want with your assets within the law, right? So the law might say, you have to have a certain amount of identity or whatnot, but once you’ve checked the boxes from a compliance point of view, where those assets sit shouldn’t affect whether they’re liquid and usable. We’re pioneering that — that concept that you get an identity first, and then you’re a user of all these other&nbsp;systems.</p><p>So whether it’s porting your reputation from Airbnb or Uber or porting your money from Wells Fargo or Schwab, it’s your money. The fact that you want to use Uphold or some other platform, well that’s because they have the best user experience. But if you change your mind, you can take your assets with you where you&nbsp;go.</p><p>So portability for us is the big differentiator. We’re neutral. We support all the identity platforms. We would connect to all asset sources. As long as you have a name, you attach all your assets to that.

  <p>Like most organizations, you’ve probably relied for years on legacy identity governance and administration <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">(IGA)</a> solutions to manage user access, ensure compliance, and protect vital data. Unfortunately, these solutions are falling short in their ability to meet your ever-changing business requirements and needs today. Why? Legacy IGA solutions don’t provide enterprise-wide visibility or identity context. Instead, they operate in ‘identity silos’ based on static data, including assignments, roles, and entitlements. Combined with the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-identification-a-key-to-inclusive-growth#">increasing volume</a> and type of identities, this can leave your already overburdened risk and security teams struggling to keep up as they manually provision access privileges and rubber stamp access requests and certifications. The resulting operational inefficiencies can leave your teams blind as to who has access to what and, more importantly, why they have access. Without enterprise-wide visibility and contextual insights, organizations will continue to have outdated access rights and privileges, which can leave them increasingly exposed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take heart. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. ForgeRock has developed an AI-driven identity analytics solution, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Autonomous Identity</a>, that allows organizations to maximize the business value of their existing IGA solutions by addressing identity and governance solution gaps. So, how is this accomplished? Read on.</p>

 How ForgeRock Autonomous Identity Addresses Legacy IGA Challenges&nbsp; 

 Legacy IGA Challenge: Identity Silos 

 ForgeRock Solution: Contextual, Enterprise-Wide Visibility 

<p>Unlike <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/bring-digital-identity-out-shadows-fuel-digital-transformation">siloed legacy IGA solutions</a>, ForgeRock Autonomous Identity collects and analyzes identity data from all data sources to gain enterprise-wide visibility into all identities and their access rights. This provides security and compliance teams with contextual insight into who has access to what and why.&nbsp;</p>

 Legacy IGA Challenge: Access Blind Spots 

 ForgeRock Solution: Access Risk Awareness 

<p>Legacy IGA solutions have user access blind spots.

 ForgeRock Solution: Access Rights Identification 

<p>Say goodbye to manual rubber stamping and bulk approvals. ForgeRock Autonomous Identity automates the analysis of all identity-related data across the enterprise. By analyzing and quickly identifying the entire user access landscape, organizations can proactively rectify overprovisioned users and outliers, recommend remediation, and automate the removal of access rights when appropriate.</p>

 Legacy IGA Challenge: Inappropriate Access Privilege Patterns 

 ForgeRock Solution: Enterprise-Wide Access Insights 

<p>Instead of relying on manual access analysis of security and compliance teams, ForgeRock Autonomous Identity saves time and effort by automating insights into all user access patterns. By continuously ingesting new identity data, Autonomous Identity evolves its machine learning (ML) model to understand dynamic changes within the organization. This enables it to predict and identify outliers, including inappropriate access privilege patterns and unauthorized user access across the entire enterprise.&nbsp;</p>

 Legacy IGA Challenges: Manual User Access Approvals 

 ForgeRock Solution: Automated User Access Approvals and Remediation 

<p>Eliminate the need for manual approvals and remediation. ForgeRock Autonomous Identity enables the automatic approval of high-confidence, low-risk access requests and certifications, as well as the revocation and removal of stale user access rights. This AI-driven identity analytics approach reduces operational access request burdens and accelerates certification campaigns without exposing the organization to unnecessary risk.</p>

<p>Emerging technology is incredibly stimulating, yet so often it is idealistic in nature and seemingly theoretical. The self sovereign identity&nbsp;(SSI)&nbsp;conceptual architecture has existed in the ‘idealistic’ bucket for some time. This is familiar territory — to win hearts, souls, and break new ground, it’s proponents must be prepared to set fire to ingrained foundations. If the SSI community had incepted too close to traditional archetypes it would have risked a constrained imagination. The only real option for emerging technology is to build a far, faraway island, and beat your drum loud enough for people to hear. With that comes an obligatory&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle">hype cycle</a>, and the requirement to at some point close the technical chasm. The SSI community has built that isolated island (all a little too familiar for us kiwis), and now it’s time to build the boat.</p>



<p>SSI offers an opinionated shift in the way traditional Identity Management (IdM) is architected, which often results in the two models being pitted against each other — as if one must disappear for the other to exist. This dogmatic framing overlooks the potential which exists to extend traditional IdM protocols (think boat…) towards a more user-oriented SSI model.</p>



 OpenID connect, and its advantages 



<p>When it comes to interactions that involve expressing a digital identity, the web takes the lion’s share. In relation to IdM on the web today, one core protocol that has consistently grown in popularity is OpenID Connect (OIDC). For those unfamiliar, OIDC provides the pipes that enable the use of a third party login service (eg. “Login with Facebook”) rather than creating a new account with every website you visit. OIDC provides&nbsp;many&nbsp;practical benefits — it is a pervasive, simple login service. It has reduced administrative overhead, allowing individuals to simplify the number of accounts (or distinct digital identities) they have to maintain.</p>



 OpenID Connect — what’s missing? 



<p>With all of its success, OIDC has failed users in ways that were likely unforeseen at the time. It does not provide users with a way to organise their digital existence in one place, and fails to provide complete transparency over where and how their information is used. Keeping track of, and being able to utilise our digital information to access services shouldn’t be difficult in the first place. The currently constrained (and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html">damaging</a>) user experience is symptomatic of broader problems with how traditional IdM and protocols like OIDC are architectured — best illustrated by the&nbsp;<a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">identity NASCAR problem.</a></p>



The Identity Nascar Problem



<p>The term was coined to describe the assemblage of third party icons on a websites login page, which resemble the crammed sponsorship decals covering&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR">NASCAR</a>&nbsp;racing cars. This has long been lamented by designers because it creates an overwhelming and crowded user experience. The logos impose a cognitive burden on users who have to choose an Identity Provider (IdP), and keep track of which one they use and where.</p>



<p>This style of federation also has distinct market consequences. In order for a website to reduce the crowd of logos on their login screens, they have to pick (say, two or three). To ensure sufficient user coverage, the websites will pick the most well known (say, Facebook and Google), creating a predictable cycle where the popular become more popular.&nbsp;Like in NASCAR, it is now near impossible to break in, as a few large oligopoly-like brands are incumbent. This can hinder the progress and adoption of emerging technologies, particularly if they threaten incumbent business models. But the evidence is showing us we need a better way — entrusting something as fundamental as how users identify on the web to a select few sets up a dangerous environment, one where even brands like Apple who pride themselves on privacy are unable to avoid&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/researcher-sign-apple/">massive mistakes</a>.</p>



<p>In addition, because users converge around a few main IdPs, the amount of data accumulated is colossal (known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/samuelgoto/WebID#the-rp-tracking-problem">relying party tracking problem</a>) — this includes what sites you visit and services you use. They do not have in place measures to minimise their data collection or reduce correlation. Many Governments legally forbid the assignment of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/national-ids">national identifiers</a>. Good digital identity will exist only when corporations operate in frameworks where global identifiers aren’t assigned to us either.</p>



 How do we make things better? 



<p>SSI advocates for a component between the issuer/IdP and the relying party that acts on behalf of the user. This independent piece of software infrastructure acts to better preserve a user’s privacy and&nbsp;improve&nbsp;their experience. The component is often referred to as a ‘digital wallet’ or in other terminology circles as the&nbsp;‘holder’)</p>







 What makes an ecosystem that features a digital wallet more resilient against problems described above? 



<p>A couple of key points:</p>



 1. Separation of Authority and Facilitation 



  In traditional IdM, the IdP is both the issuer of the user’s identity information, AND the facilitator of services around how the user expresses their identity. This necessitates a close relationship between the issuer and the relying party (and the aforementioned&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/samuelgoto/WebID#the-rp-tracking-problem">tracking and correlation</a>).  In SSI, the digital wallet is an intermediary that acts on behalf of the user — akin to their agent. The facilitator component is removed from the IdP and is reassigned to the digital wallet. This means that the relying party doesn’t need to ‘phone home’ to validate the information from the authoritative source.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Kim Cameron</a>&nbsp;calls this “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruF1s9jF6_w&amp;feature=youtu.be">the separation of claims and recognition</a>”, acknowledging it as SSI’s biggest value.  



 2.&nbsp;Portable Identity 



  With today’s IdM technology, whether a user likes the practices of the IdP or not, it is incredibly difficult to switch to another provider. For example if you have an identity with a service that is dependent on your google account (centered around an @gmail.com address) and you would like to keep that identity but use another provider instead of google, this is virtually impossible.  In SSI, digital wallets utilise underlying technologies such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralised Identifiers</a>&nbsp;(DIDs), which enable users to seamlessly move between different wallets — without losing their identity.  



 3. A single view for where and how your information is being used 



  In traditional IdM, individuals have no single place to go to view and organize the different dimensions to their digital identity. They have different siloed apps and website accounts, sure, but no way to view and manage this in one place. This leads to fragmentation and lack of transparency for users. A digital wallet represents a new opportunity to fill in these gaps and provide users with greater visibility into the digital presence.  



 4.&nbsp;Finally, a note on standards 



  Behind the glossy and simple user interface (isn’t this just a simple app?), digital wallets are&nbsp;incredibly complex technical beasts. This can’t really be understated. There is a robust standardisation progress occurring around the SSI community. Standards compliance and interoperability is a&nbsp;requirement&nbsp;(albeit not easy). This takes time and effort, and arm-waving is incredibly detrimental to progress. We hope to see emphasis on standards compliance show up in trust framework accreditation processes.  



 Did someone mention a boat? 



<p>Little known to many, when OIDC Core was being standardised (back in 2014), a chapter in the original specification alluded to a world similar to that put forth by SSI proponents. The&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">Self-Issued OpenID Provider&nbsp;</a>(SIOP) chapter sets out a way (albeit incomplete) on how something akin to a “digital wallet” component could fit into infrastructure based around OIDC.</p>







<p>The diagram shows the introduction of an intermediary piece of software which acts on behalf of the subject/user facilitating interactions involving their identity. SIOP introduced the idea that the user could have a role to play between the two parties, and that there could be multiple issuers of claims that could be provided to a relying party to access services. Unfortunately at the time there was no concept of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralised Identifiers</a>&nbsp;(DIDs), so whilst the idea was good, it was found wanting.</p>



<p>Now that we have technologies like DIDs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, decentralized ledgers, and a thriving SSI community progressing and aligning to the standards, the idea is back on the table. There is a laundry list of things to bring this to reality.&nbsp;<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">Client Bound End-User Assertions</a>&nbsp;is one contribution we have made to this effort. This specification addresses the need for a more formal binding mechanism between the issuer and the digital wallet.</p>



 What’s next? 



<p>There are lots of organisations involved in the effort to bring SSI and existing IdM closer together, and it is spawning momentum. To get involved look out for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/siop-virtual-meetup-2-tickets-113754506792">second&nbsp;SIOP virtual meetup</a>, and initiatives occuring in OpenID and DIF. As always,&nbsp;<a href="http://mattr.global/">reach out to us</a>&nbsp;if you want to chat. This particular effort just might be the sail for our boat.</p>

 The GiD Report #118 — The fastest growing cybercrime and what it tells us about the state of&nbsp;identity <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-117-why-larry-summers-thinks-crypto-will-succeed-kara-swisher-on-tech-antitrust-b5af5497d5ba">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Here’s what we have this&nbsp;week:</p>  The Fed’s new report on synthetic identity payments fraud (and what that tell us about the state of identity)  Stuff happens   1. The Fed’s new report on synthetic identity payments fraud (and what that tell us about the state of identity) <p>First off, Here’s <a href="https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/strategic-initiatives/payments-security/synthetic-identity-payments-fraud/">a report that Greg contributed to from the Federal Reserve on synthetic identity payments fraud</a>. We’ve talked about <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-self-sovereign-identity-mitigates-fraud-and-builds-a-more-inclusive-future-1b238464cd09">synthetic identity fraud in the past</a>, and it continues to be a buzzy topic. Why? According to McKinsey, it’s the fastest growing cybercrime today.</p>Photo: Pixabay<p>It’s also the type of fraud that highlights exactly what’s wrong with the system today, hitting the U.S. particularly hard because of our outdated identity frameworks and our over-reliance on Social Security Numbers. 40 percent of synthetic IDs are just random SSN numbers with some real PII sprinkled in for good&nbsp;measure.</p><p>That’s compounded by all the data breaches in recent years (which are only growing), providing criminals with a growing pool of stolen PII. Siloed data only exacerbates the issue, making detection difficult. 95 percent of synthetic identities go undetected using current fraud models, according to the&nbsp;Fed.</p><p>Naturally for the Fed, it’s a big problem for most of the reasons that you’d&nbsp;expect:</p><blockquote>Synthetic identities can be used to deceive government or corporate systems into thinking they are real people — creating far-reaching impacts on the U.S. financial system, healthcare industry, government entities and individual consumers. While synthetic identities are sometimes used without criminal intent, there are serious consequences when criminals use them to steal funds, escape detection or facilitate drug and human trafficking. They also have been linked to crime rings, including those that fund terrorism.</blockquote><p>What’s more scary is that there’s going to be a huge delay between the rising growth we’re seeing now and the painful but delayed societal impact we’re going to experience down the road. Right now, there’s minimal detection, minimal investigation, minimal awareness, and minimal reporting.</p><p>Especially if you’re a&nbsp;kid:</p><blockquote>According to the Child Identity Fraud Study conducted by Javelin Strategy &amp; Research, more than a million children were victims of identity fraud in 2017. While this figure is not specific to synthetic identity payments fraud, it indicates the potential magnitude of risk to children, who are a favorite target for this type of fraud. Synthetic identity fraud can lie dormant for years, only being uncovered once individuals turn 18 and apply for their first car or student loans. Other consequences of synthetic identity fraud extend beyond payments fraud to include denial of disability benefits, rejection of tax returns and inaccuracies in health&nbsp;records.</blockquote><p>And let’s just say — with the way things work now, trying to reclaim your identity once it’s been compromised is not&nbsp;fun.</p><p>The solutions aren’t easy either because the problem is systemic so any response needs to be comprehensive. For starters being able to digitally verify a SSN would be a step in the right direction. That initiative started last month. (Are you surprised that we weren’t able to do&nbsp;that?)</p><p>The other pillars, according to the Fed, have to do with regulations and data integrity.</p><p>And the more you read into the report and think about where things need to go, the more you start to realize that the world is eventually going to start to look a lot like what we’re building at GlobaliD:</p>  Actually verified claims attached to your&nbsp;identity  A portable identity that you own/control  An identity that you can easily reclaim in the case of&nbsp;fraud  No more data silos — they’re easily hackable and make fraud prevention all but impossible  <p>Not because it’s cool, or anything — even though it is. But because we pretty much have to. And with the current trend toward a more digital life only accelerating with everything going on, the stakes are only getting higher — along with the opportunity cost of not&nbsp;acting.</p><p>Anyway, I’ll leave you with this quote from David McCourt of Granahan McCourt Capital <a href="https://twitter.com/1WorldIdentity/status/1280554811088347138">during an OWI identity panel last&nbsp;week</a>:</p><p>When I started in the network company, the phone company owned your phone number. Young people now don’t even think about that. They used to own your handset. They owned the network, the service, the hardware, and the&nbsp;number.”</p><p>Spoiler alert (in narrator’s voice): They don’t&nbsp;anymore.</p><p>(FYI: OWI’s KNOW 2020 is now officially canceled.)</p><p>Related:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">Josh</a> — <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ua.gov.diia.app&amp;hl=uk&amp;fbclid=IwAR0QqLT4EqfSjs3gFQGxm399o4_sCSYQ3BEAvjEMQUrh5oaMN2NG-_Hta1M">Ukrainian gov-sponsored digital identity&nbsp;app</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/whatsapps-business-user-base-grew-tenfold-from-2019-11594298961">WhatsApp’s Business-User Base Grew Tenfold From&nbsp;2019</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/roger-stone-facebook.html">Facebook Removes Roger Stone for Ties to Fake&nbsp;Accounts</a>  <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/commission-uses-its-own-e-signature-service-sign-international-agreement-world-bank-2020-jul-08_en">The Commission uses its own e-Signature service to sign an international agreement with the World&nbsp;Bank</a>  <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202007/digital-id-potential-shown-by-estonias-e41m-windfall-u-s-analyst-predicts-billions-in-potential-savings-from-adoption">Digital ID potential shown by Estonia’s €41M windfall, U.S. analyst predicts billions in potential savings from&nbsp;adoption</a>  <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/estonian-identity-verification-platform-veriff-raises-15-5m-to-expand-internationally/">Estonian Identity Verification Platform Veriff Raises $15.5M To Expand Internationally</a>   2.

<p>Liveness Detection is an important element in user identity fraud protection. IDnow has just launched a vastly improved Liveness Detection solution for IDnow AutoIdent. Our blog article explains what Liveness actually is and what this means for our users.</p>
  
 What is “Liveness”? 
<p>In biometrics, Liveness Detection is an AI computer system’s ability to determine that it is interfacing with a physically present human being and not an inanimate spoof artifact. So, fraudsters using stolen photos, Deep Fake videos, or masks in order to access or create online accounts will be uncovered and stopped.</p>
 How to measure the successful of the application. 
<p>The sophistication of a biometric system is measured by the False Acceptance Rate (FAR). This is a specific key performance indicator that measures false acceptances with a biometric security system. It tracks and evaluates the precision of a biometric system, and therefore determines the rate at which unauthorized users are verified by the system.</p>
<p>Current regulations require a biometric system for governmental use to have a FAR of below 0.1%. In general, AI-powered solutions are able to outperform even these very high requirements. IDnow AutoIdent has a FAR of only 0.05%.</p>
 The new IDnow Liveness Detection solution. 
<p>The new solution offers an even better False Acceptance Rate of 0,00002% (that’s 1/4.2 Million!). Furthermore, the user experience has been significantly improved based on usage data and user feedback: our previous design required users to rotate their heads, which wasn’t too comfortable for many. With the new solution, the user just has to move his face closer to the camera, and the Liveness Detection will recognize and confirm in less than two seconds that it is indeed a live person’s face. This is not only an incredibly smooth user experience, but it also provides the highest level of security: even advanced masks, imposters, lookalikes, and doppelgangers can be spotted with an unprecedented level of accuracy.<br>
</p>
 Trust in AI-powered solutions. 
<p>IDnow continues to see an increasing trust in AutoIdent – from January until June, transactions have increased over 1000%. And based on our expertise, this confidence is justified: with the new Liveness Detection solution, we are able to provide an outstanding user experience and reliably prevent identity fraud at the same time.</p>

					 <p><a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">Self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) is a movement that claims digital identity should be just as legitimate and nuanced as a person’s human identity, while being accessible to all, privacy-preserving, and not reliant on a single government or corporation. It was originally conceived by idealists seeking to provide people more autonomy and control of their digital relationships. Over the past decade, the world has seen a shift from legacy on-premise software to the cloud, creating tremendous value/innovation on the one hand (Salesforce, Veeva, Twilio, etc) and centralization/surveillance problems on the other (Facebook, Google, etc). Talking about cloud, a Web 2.0 technology, in the context of a Web 3.0 technology like SSI may seem unrelated. However, the combination of cloud with SSI can offer much needed usability and benefits compared to more traditional delivery models and otherwise decentralized systems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TL;DR: </p>  Cloud-native software done right can deliver more benefit than its on-premise/locally-hosted alternative while reducing costs and risk.   Organizations should understand the trade-offs between cloud and local deployments for self-sovereign identity specifically for individuals and organizations.   Any who pursue a cloud solution for SSI should seek well-architected platforms that take advantage of cloud-native functionality.   Trinsic is a modern platform that provides a full-stack SSI platform leveraging the best of cloud and local elements.

												<a>Ongoing innovation</a>
					 
					 <p>In multi-tenant cloud software, all new features are pushed to all customers simultaneously, creating a virtuous R&amp;D cycle and enabling engineering resources to focus on innovating rather than supporting previous releases (analysts estimate that up to 80% of on-prem software vendors’ R&amp;D spend is on maintaining old versions/products).</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Lower-cost</a>
					 
					 <p>Cloud software can utilize platform-specific functionality (Azure KeyVault or AWS Lamda), which can’t be equally represented across a myriad of different hardwares, databases, or operating systems. In addition, hosting, security, and compliance costs can be amortized across all customers rather than reinventing the wheel for each new deployment.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Customer service</a>
					 
					 <p>With a subscription or usage-based pricing model, the vast majority of revenue from a given customer will come to the vendor far in the future, causing SaaS companies to rely heavily on customer retention for survival. The incentive therefore is to provide fantastic customer service to existing customers, not exclusively seek out new ones. Cloud-based solutions are also much, much easier to provide satisfactory support due to the other reasons listed.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Aligned incentives</a>
					 
					 <p>Generally speaking, SaaS companies seek to align pricing with value. That way, the software provider only receives revenue when the customer creates value. SaaS companies are incentivized to remove barriers to entry and help their customers receive value because doing so is the only way the SaaS company will scale.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Seamless, dependable upgrades</a>
					 
					 <p>Cloud software is architected to ensure that new features can be introduced with no downtime, cost, or disruption to their customers.&nbsp;This is possible because there are common variables for infrastructure and installations without the variability (OS, databases, hardwares, etc.) a customer’s own environment introduces.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Security and stability</a>
					 
					 <p>Cloud-based solutions are typically more secure than self-managed ones—especially in highly-regulated industries¹, because any security failures risk the vendor’s reputation and potentially data of all customers at once. This creates a strong incentive to make stability, security, and data privacy a core competency of the platform.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Scalability</a>
					 
					 <p>Cloud-native software scales much better than on-prem software because as more resources are needed, more resources can easily be utilized. AWS, Azure, and other cloud platforms utilize usage-based payment models that accommodate for spikes in usage and make building redundancy into the product straightforward.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Core competencies</a>
					 
					 <p>Historically, large organizations (e.g., Coca-Cola) have had no choice but to build and maintain large IT divisions (instead of—you know—making beverages). This is becomingly increasingly unnecessary with cloud technologies.&nbsp;Every company can specialize in their expertise and focus on their business—vendor and customer alike.</p>

												<a>Data security/privacy</a>
					 
					 <p>Entrusting another organization with your sensitive data is no easy task—20 years ago, Salesforce struggled at first to get companies to entrust their customer lists to the cloud. But by 2020, most security professionals <a href="https://www.continuitycentral.com/index.php/news/technology/4384-cloud-is-safer-than-on-premise-say-that-majority-of-security-leaders">believe</a> data is safer in the cloud than on-premise. It also appears the severity of on-premise software breaches is higher than cloud-based².</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Control</a>
					 
					 <p>Having access to and control over the source code of your software means that customizations can be made—as long as the licensing agreement allows it. While this is advantageous for some use cases, it can be costly to implement and unclear whether/how the customizations will interact with or potentially break other components of the software.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Centralization</a>
					 
					 <p>Some cloud-based softwares are so far superior to their substitutes that they can create monopolies that centralize power and unfairly exploit their position in markets. It should be noted that centralization has massive benefits—but it’s important that there is interoperability, open source alternatives, and healthy competition to avoid a bad situation.</p> 
				 
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The benefits and concerns present with cloud technologies are just as true for SSI as they are for other types of software. </p>

					 <p>Trinsic’s cloud platform consists of the following products. You can get started free and enjoy robust documentation and support for each.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Trinsic Studio: An easy-to-use web interface for managing credential exchange with no code. Also serves as the mechanism to acquire API keys and manage billing for paid plans.<a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/"> Try it yourself free</a>, and issue a credential in less than 5 minutes!  Provider API: Our newest API enables developers to programmatically provision issuer and verifier cloud agents. Learn more about the provider API in the recent launch<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-launches-ssi-provider-product/"> announcement</a>.  Credentials API: Our core API enables developers to have a turnkey way to issue, verify, and manage verifiable credentials on any Hyperledger Indy network. Check out our<a href="http://docs.trinsic.id/"> documentation</a> or one of our<a href="https://github.com/streetcred-id/issuer-reference-app"> reference</a><a href="https://github.com/streetcred-id/verifier-reference-app"> applications</a> to get started.  Wallet API: An API for creating and managing cloud wallets on behalf of credential holders. It’s the backend of our Mobile SDK, which you can read more about in our recent<a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-wallets-3-decisions/"> post</a> about building your own SSI wallets. Get started with the API by checking out the<a href="http://docs.trinsic.id/"> documentation</a>.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							
																					Trinsic's APIs work together to create a full-stack self-sovereign identity platform.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic has built the first end-to-end, cloud-native, hyper-scalable cloud architecture for self-sovereign identity. Not only can you programmatically issue verifiable credentials, but you can programmatically create credential issuers. (Which can themselves issue credentials!) We utilize certain cloud-native functionality to achieve this.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Enterprise-grade key management</a>
					 
					 <p>By utilizing a cloud-native secure key management service, we ensure encryption keys can only be accessed by backend servers associated with those keys. Nobody at Trinsic has access to encryption keys.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Scalable databases</a>
					 
					 <p>Open source implementations use SQLite databases within the wallet, which has scalability limitations. We substitute these wallets for globally-distributed databases specifically built for scale. These also enable advanced indexing and querying.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Partitioning</a>
					 
					 <p>Proper architecture ensures information from one organization can’t be accessed by another organization and that wallets that live in the cloud are secure.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Data residency</a>
					 
					 <p>Our services can be deployed in data centers in most geolocations around the world, ensuring regulatory compliance.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Redundancy</a>
					 
					 <p>Uptime guarantees and SLAs up to 99.99%.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Self-hosted key management</a>
					 
					 <p>If required, your organization can control its own keys, while keeping the agent software hosted in the Trinsic cloud.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Custom analytics</a>
					 
					 <p>We leverage an analytics infrastructure capable of handling millions of events per second, enabling real-time analytics and insights.</p>

					 <p>The Trinsic Wallet is the world’s most popular interoperable SSI wallet, supported free forever. The wallet lives on the device and key management is done by leveraging the operating system backup of the device (ie., iCloud backup for iOS devices). We also offer an encrypted cloud backup service. Learn more about the Trinsic Wallet<a href="http://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet"> here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although our own mobile app doesn’t utilize the Wallet API, some of our partners have built mobile apps using the Wallet API.

					 <p>Self-sovereign identity will improve security around the world and hopefully make identity theft entirely obsolete, but not for the reason most people think.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many believe that this is because SSI decentralizes storage of personal data. Instead of PII honeypots that become targets for hackers because millions of people’s data can be stolen from one breach (see: Equifax), SSI information is stored in end-users’ wallets on their phones so a breach would only expose one person’s data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Right? Well…sort of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One important reason that SSI will reduce identity theft is by reducing our world’s dependence on knowledge of secrets and increasing dependence on possession of secrets. Imagine a future where applying for a bank account in the USA requires a social security number (SSN) in a verifiable credential. By proving possession of the credential, I’m allowed to open an account. Even if a hacker discovered my SSN, they couldn’t open an account in my name because possession of the credential is necessary, not just knowledge of the identifier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other reason that hacking is reduced is that each wallet is encrypted using separate keys. In addition to breaching enterprise security systems, a hacker would need to individually decrypt each wallet, which increases the costs to hack cloud-based SSI services exponentially.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So while it’s true that SSI will reduce the occurrence of centralized honeypots of data, the real benefit is that it reduces the value of the data inside the honeypot and increases the cost to access that data, which in turn reduces the incentive to hack it.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Self-sovereignty means key ownership 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>A philosophical belief of many in the SSI community is that self-management of encryption keys is necessary for SSI. This is especially true of people from other blockchain communities where possession of a single key means possession of money (and loss of the key means<a href="https://coinnounce.com/10-dramatic-stories-of-people-who-lost-their-bitcoin-private-keys/"> loss</a> of the money). When it comes to SSI, the issue is different for individuals and organizations.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Individuals 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>As it relates to individual people,the issue is nuanced. To date, totally decentralized key management technologies have not been widely adopted because they introduce additional inconveniences for end-users. So naturally, a spectrum exists to accommodate users who value convenience. As mentioned in a Medium<a href="https://medium.com/@rileyparkerhughes/immunity-passports-and-verifiable-credentials-a-response-to-critiques-142499fba4fb"> post</a> in response to critiques about key management technologies for SSI:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				"The degree of inconveniences, security, and user-control depend on the implementation. The simplest key management solution is a complete custodian model. Coinbase has done a great job doing this for cryptocurrencies. A hybrid model could also be employed (this is the one used in the Trinsic Wallet today); a user can back up an encrypted copy of their wallet to a secure cloud or export the wallet to keep in storage of their choosing. Completely decentralized solutions indeed require a great deal of technical knowledge and/or inconvenience but importantly exist for those who don’t want to rely on anyone other than themselves to safeguard their data."			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>That being said, any cloud-based/custodian wallet solution must enable the end-user to export their wallet from the cloud into a wallet where they control the keys. Otherwise, the vendor has total control over the user’s identity – and that isn’t self-sovereign.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Organizations 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Organizations are organized under the laws of a particular jurisdiction and governed by individual people. Unlike natural persons, organizations do not have unalienable rights or dignity. Put simply, people are self-sovereign, organizations are not. Therefore, the ideals that apply to individuals apply differently to legal entities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To drive this point home, organizations cannot manage their own keys no matter how much they want to because they are inanimate, socially-constructed legal entities. The best those legal entities can do is to enter into legal agreements to employ qualified natural persons to manage the keys on their behalf. Alternatively, an organization can enter into a legal arrangement with another firm, including a SaaS provider, to manage keys on its behalf.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Your decision 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>We recommend utilizing a cloud-native³ SSI platform, just as your organization (and you as an individual) surely utilize the cloud for other solutions. If cloud isn’t right for you, we recommend you explore the<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet"> open source</a> reference implementations. They are a free way to install working software on-prem, although it can take a significant development/expense to make it scalable and secure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trinsic’s cloud platform is available for anyone to try out free at<a href="http://studio.trinsic.id/"> studio.trinsic.id</a>.

In 2017 and 2018, they brought organizations like Merck, Maersk, and the NHS to their knees costing billions of dollars in revenue loss and recovery costs. While they were reeling from the impact, one shining light was the fact that their cloud-based solutions were not infiltrated.(<a href="https://www.logicworks.com/blog/2017/05/wannacry-public-cloud/">https://www.logicworks.com/blog/2017/05/wannacry-public-cloud/</a>).<br><br>  It should be noted that there is a difference between a cloud-native, multi-tenant architecture, and a traditional on-premise software solution deployed and hosted in the cloud. In many ways, hosting deployable software somewhere other than on-premise can give you the worst of both worlds—you are paying for the high development costs of a product that works across hardwares/clouds/OS/etc., but you don’t get the benefits of customization or control. And since it’s not cloud-native, security becomes trickier—products built to accommodate more hardwares/databases/OS will inevitably have more attack vectors than a native solution (think: security of a PC vs a Mac).

<p>by Jacqueline Arlt, Senior  Recruiting Manager&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the last couple of years, IDnow has been growing exponentially, not just in its number of employees, but also concerning market share and global expansion.</p>
<p>Today, we tend to look at IDnow as a scale-up, rather than a start-up. There are a few key differences between those two notations: A start-up is highly experimental with short product and engineering iteration cycles. They are often in the early stages of the funding cycle and haven’t yet figured out which processes work best for them, e.g., in Sales or Marketing. On the contrary, over the course of the last couple of years, IDnow has validated the main building blocks for accelerated growth: product-market fit, a proven go-to-market strategy in its core DACH region, as well as an established business model.</p>
 
  To be able to ensure the product-market-fit, it is not only essential to understand the market needs, but also how to satisfy those needs in the best possible way: we have proven that our product suite is beneficial to a lot of companies and we completely validated its distribution channels. This is true not only for the financial services sector but also for other market segments like mobility, gaming or insurance. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  In October 2019, we concluded our series C funding round with Corsair Capital LLC as the leading investor. Since then, we have invested in further developing our growth plans – for example, we opened up offices in London and Paris for our 10 colleagues being based in the UK and France. In addition to that, we concentrated on sharpening our technology and on scaling up our team.<br>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  IDnow set out to hire a strong pool of talent. Instead of hiring all-rounders, we started advertising for more focused roles, so that we could boast an array of experts joining across different departments. Moreover, we concentrated on enhanced delegation in hiring department heads and team leads.<br>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  At IDnow, we have an established onboarding process. All new starters take part in a number of sessions with every single department to get fully immersed into the IDnow team. This way, they get introduced to our company culture and mission to make the connected world a safer place. On top of this, all new starters get assigned two buddies – one within the respective department and one from another team – who will support them during the onboarding process.<br>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Marketing also plays a major role during the scale-up phase. One has to find the right balance between efficiency and volume – plus dive deep into the data and look at the various channels in their entirety. Our Business Intelligence team is playing a key role in enabling the commercial teams to review dashboards each week and, in turn, measure performance. 
 
<p>While focusing on growth the majority of the time, it’s still important to develop the organization in a healthy manner. With some of the changes last year, we put the company’s management on a broader footing. Now we are working with the next level of leadership to empower and enable them to take the company to the next level as a scale-up. The last couple of months have also seen a strong focus on building a comprehensive and robust reporting grid for both operational and financial key performance indicators. Given the complexities of our business in terms of products, technology, and business model, it’s key to perform an in-depth analysis to be able to base&nbsp;decisions and strategies on it.</p>
<p>One of the questions we get asked in pretty much every interview is, “What’s it like working for IDnow?” In short, the culture is really open and collaborative – if you need help, you will find at least a handful of colleagues being there to answer any question you have, and it’s really fun working together. Even though we now have around 130 employees within the core team, everyone still knows each other by name, thanks to the close-knit culture IDnow displays. This isn’t just within the respective team but also between different departments – and even with colleagues based in different locations – thanks to after-work events, workouts and interdisciplinary projects. By now, we have a lot of processes and structures in place, but nothing is set in stone – if you have an idea and want to try a different course of action, then you don’t have to wait weeks for the approval. The management is highly responsive and open, so if you are up for it, you can easily make a great impact at IDnow. Even though we are not a start-up anymore, we have held on to the most important characteristics of it. We want to keep the atmosphere of a young, agile business, and continue to combine it with the benefits of an established company.&nbsp;What’s next for IDnow – what are we working toward?</p>
<blockquote><p>“The current challenge is to accomplish the scaling phase in a healthy and successful way. IDnow is well-known and established in the DACH region – we have a comprehensive customer portfolio and strong market access. Now we are focusing on the mission to expand this success and the company’s footprint to other markets and industries whilst broadening our product portfolio – we aim to be scalable, replicable and projectable. Therefore you need an experienced and passionate team that’s able to grow in an efficient way,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO.</p></blockquote>

<p>At Authenteq, we’re continuously perfecting our product and services. However, we’ve always been silent about what we’re up to. As the security space is becoming crowded, and the Covid19 pushes the need for further digitalization in the business landscape, we are ready to break the silence and pledge to share our product updates.</p>



<p>After all, great technology is transparent technology! Here’s what we’re up to during May and June:</p>



 Building a new and fast infrastructure 



<p><a href="https://authenteq.com/privacy-by-design-and-electronic-identity-verification/">Privacy-by-design</a> is our aspiration; however, we noticed that the market is not ready for fully decentralized ID verification and <a href="https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc/">KYC</a> solution. Therefore, we decided to take a step towards building a new system that is built to meet&nbsp;the highest data security standards. Also, the new system is not only faster, but it will also give an opportunity to larger firms that require top-level security to store the data locally. We’re ready to enable our larger customers to scale with ease, while we’ll handle the data security and fraud prevention.</p>



 Image compression to decrease the drop-off rate 



<p>We understand the importance of your user experience, and therefore, over the last couple of months, we worked on improving our image compression services. With the current set-up, your users can upload their documents and selfies and finish the full onboarding process under 60 seconds.</p>



 Benefit from the localization functionality 



<p>As an internationally operating organization with various clients across the globe, we understand the importance of language. Therefore, we strive to continuously add more languages to our product. This month we added Russian language support to our Mobile SDK. We now support English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, and Russian languages! The language detection depends on both your application and the Users phone settings, and we know that this nifty localization-centric functionality will increase your conversion rates.</p>



 Simplified API 



<p>We want the Authenteq technology to be accessible to any organization that needs a trustworthy partner in navigating the ID authentication and KYC space. That’s why we improved our API and API documentation – to provide your team with a frictionless integration process even when you don’t have a delegated developer on site.</p>



<p>These couple of months enabled us to step back, evaluate our dreams, and take a healthy step forward in rebuilding the product infrastructure. The new infrastructure is future-proof and is ready to grow for scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s all for the past two months! The upcoming period will be even more exciting as the new infrastructure will allow for more functionality to ease and enhance your user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to give it a try and explore what Authenteq has to offer? Start your <a href="https://customer-dashboard.app.authenteq.com/registration/">30 days trial</a>, get to know your customer, and mitigate risk.</p>

<p>We’ve heard from many of you about your love of cryptocurrency. Many of you have accumulated a few different wallets along the way and have asked about the best way to HODL crypto. Now that Civic Wallet is in app stores, we hope you’re excited&nbsp;to take advantage of the wallet’s features. With Civic Wallet, you can bring in your crypto and start protecting it with the company’s <a href="https://www.civic.com/faq/#coincover">$1 Million Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee</a> (<a href="https://www.coincover.com/terms-and-conditions">full terms &amp; conditions</a>). The protection is already part of each Civic Wallet, and there’s no need to sign up for it.</p>



<p>Now, let’s say that you lose your phone or somehow lose access to your Civic Wallet. Depending on the digital wallet you use, this could mean that you lose access to your cryptocurrency permanently. But, here’s what Civic Wallet gets right, where other digital wallets may fail: because Civic Wallet is multisig and has already verified your identity during enrollment, restoring your digital identity and cryptocurrency is easy.</p>



<p>Having lived through some of crypto’s earlier years, many of us are familiar with stories of people who have misplaced passwords or somehow lost their private keys. Thankfully, with Civic Wallet, there are no more passwords or seed phrases to track.</p>



<p>How to bring your digital currency into Civic Wallet</p>



<p>After downloading Civic Wallet and setting up an account with some basic information, you may easily send yourself some digital currency (USD, BTC, ETH or CVC) from a digital wallet outside of the Civic network.</p>



 Tap Receive to transfer funds into Civic Wallet from another wallet or exchange. 



  Open your Civic Wallet and select your currency type. For example, if you choose to start with BTC, tap on the Receive icon. Once on the Receive screen, copy your unique BTC address to your phone.  Then, go to your other digital wallet, input an amount, paste your Civic Wallet address as the recipient of the funds, and pressed send.  



<p>That’s it! The transaction takes a few minutes, and before long you’ll see the crypto in your Civic Wallet. Check out our Help Center for more instructions on <a href="https://support.civicwallet.com/hc/en-us/sections/360006096413-Sending-Receiving-Funds">how to send and receive funds</a>.</p>

					 <p>Since before Trinsic even began, we were major contributors to various open source decentralized identity projects, the primary one being <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a>. In fact, I became a main <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/agentframework-for-net-joins-hyperledger-aries-14aba357da41">contributor</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a>, a mature self-sovereign identity (SSI) <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/glossary#agent">agent</a> codebase for the .NET Core runtime, and our CPO Michael Boyd is an original contributor to the first open source Python agent, which helped launch the Aries project. As a company, Trinsic is still contributing to these efforts, and we’re excited to announce our next major contribution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are excited to announce that we have contributed an out-of-the-box cloud agent controller for Aries Framework .NET accessible via an OpenAPI. Before this contribution, the Aries Framework .NET, although a feature-rich codebase, required configuration to assemble a useful agent service. This contribution brings Aries Framework .NET into parity with other Aries codebases which expose an API for developers to interact with. Now, building Aries-based cloud agents will be easier than ever.</p>

					 <p>Hyperledger Aries provides libraries, frameworks, and protocols for developers to implement verifiable credentials that are interoperable across any ecosystem or method that supports <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/glossary#didcomm">DID communications</a> (DIDComm). Standardization of DIDComm is done at the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-starts-didcomm-working-group-9c114d9308dc">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> and is used by decentralized identity ecosystems across the board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dozens of organizations, especially enterprises, use the Aries Framework .NET for various SSI projects across different business domains, especially mobile wallets.

					 <p>With the addition of the OpenAPI, consumers of Aries Framework .NET in a cloud environment no longer need to spend time building their own controllers or APIs to access the functionality therein. Instead, they can use the OpenAPI included in the repo to speed up the development process significantly.<br><br></p><p>The <a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> core <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/master/samples/aspnetcore/README.md">sample project</a> has been updated to show how easy it is to add the OpenAPI endpoints to your .NET project. By just adding a few lines of code into your <code>Startup.cs</code> file, your project will support the primary SSI use cases of issuing credentials, verifying credentials, making connections, etc.</p>

While the open source Aries Framework APIs must expose a great deal of complexity in order to be runnable on all platforms, accommodate all use cases, and remain unbiased with regard to implementation details, the Trinsic APIs cut out all the complexity to create the best developer experience possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a cloud-native managed service, we’ve taken special care to ensure stability, security, and scalability. And best of all, it’s free to get started—just pay by usage once you start to scale.</p>

Learn more about the provider API in the recent launch <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-launches-ssi-provider-product/">announcement</a>.  Credentials API: Our original API enables developers to have a turnkey way to issue, verify, and manage verifiable credentials on any Hyperledger Indy network. Check out our <a href="http://docs.trinsic.id">documentation</a> or one of our <a href="https://github.com/streetcred-id/issuer-reference-app">reference</a> <a href="https://github.com/streetcred-id/verifier-reference-app">applications</a> to get started.  Wallet API: An API for creating and managing cloud wallets on behalf of credential holders. It’s the backend of our Mobile SDK, which you can read more about in our recent <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-wallets-3-decisions/">post</a> about building your own SSI wallets.

  <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions have become essential for compliance and security. A wide range of PAM solution choices is available, with the next generation of solutions designed to address the entire PAM process, not just the individual PAM challenges. Next-gen solutions are also built to optimize business operations with automated processes, simplified deployment and easily integrate with existing environments. They take into consideration the way admins work, provide maximum transparency and remove the operational friction that was typical of first-gen solutions. Plus, they scale and transform your PAM program as your environment and business evolves. Attend this session to examine the factors that go into a next-gen PAM solution and why you should invest in a next-gen PAM solution that is able to keep up with and not stand in the way of change.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve4_2020_07_07_gyongyosi"></a>

Thus, there is a need for PAM, with organization, processes, policies, controls, and technology. But PAM must not be an isolated initiative. It is tightly linked to both cybersecurity and IAM initiatives, and there is also an interplay to ITSM. In his talk, Martin Kuppinger will look at how PAM relates to other areas and how to set up a comprehensive initiative that focuses on mitigating risks and improving security, by linking PAM to the rest of IT in a well-thought-out manner.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve4_2020_07_07_kuppinger"></a>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>There are ongoing discussions from <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/commission-white-paper-artificial-intelligence-feb2020_en.pdf">high-level expert groups from the EU Commission</a> about what regulation of Artificial Intelligence – particularly the algorithms that process data – will look like. There is a high priority to not only create alignment with the GDPR but to add flexibility for future advancements so that a baseline level of data protection is always provided, even as new AI applications are implemented.</p>
<p>There are many elements of the GDPR that are particularly worth looking closer at regarding algorithmic models for recommendations, predictions, and decisions.</p>
<p>Labeling AI systems according to the risk they pose</p>
<p>Article 22 of GDPR speaks to a data subject’s right to be exempt from decisions that are wholly made with automated processing. A precursor to this right is that a data subject must know if a decision is powered only by automated processing before they can request to be exempt. Labeling automated processing systems is the solution that many companies use to address this, and many working groups call for widespread labeling of AI systems and propose it for upcoming EU regulation.</p>
<p>One option was proposed by the German Data Ethics Commission and is a <a href="https://www.bmjv.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Themen/Fokusthemen/Gutachten_DEK_EN_lang.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3">five-level risk-based system for AI regulation</a>. It assumes that there is a gradient of how much harm an algorithm could potentially cause and lays out increasingly strict requirements and interventions accordingly. The AI system’s potential to cause harm would be calculated by the likelihood and severity of that harm. The level of risk assigned to a system would impact the requirements of corrective and oversight mechanisms, specifications regarding the transparency of algorithmic systems and the explainability and comprehensibility of the results, and rules on the assignment of responsibility and liability within the context of the development and use of algorithmic systems.</p>
<p>A regulation that follows this framework would define five levels of risk that an AI system could have, and among other safeguards would apply a label that corresponds with the level of risk the system poses. This figure is from the <a href="https://www.bmjv.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Themen/Fokusthemen/Gutachten_DEK_EN_lang.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3">Opinion of the Data Ethics Commission</a> report published in January 2020, outlining the five levels of risk and potential requirements that a system in each risk category would need to comply with.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Local explainability</p>
<p>The right to an algorithmic explanation in the GDPR has been heavily debated on what exactly that entails, and even if an explanation is required at all, leaving obvious gaps in the ability of the GDPR to assure protection to data subjects on this topic. The existence of this debate makes it almost certain that a clause on explainability in upcoming AI regulation will be included.</p>
<p>This of course means that regulators and eventually companies using AI will have to confront the paradox that while nearly every proposed framework for AI governance requires explainability, many algorithms do not have a satisfactory means of providing local, or individual, explanations. And even one of the front-runner solutions that determines the smallest change to input values that would deliver the desired outcome – first seen in LIME, sometimes called “<a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80505/ibm-watson-openscale/">contrastive explanations</a>” by IBM and “<a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/counterfactual.html">counterfactual explanations</a>” in the academic community – is rejected by the German Data Ethics Commission. They do not consider it a suitable option for local explanations because it doesn’t offer the user a complete picture of what affected the decision and may give the impression that some attributes are more influential than others when that is not the case.</p>
<p>What to expect</p>
<p>Regulation on the application of AI is still a long way from being finalized. But the EU will likely be among the first to provide legally binding guidance. We can expect more flexible phrasing than in the GDPR to address how quickly it has proved inadequate in governing data protection for AI and facial recognition applications. The risk-based framework is one option that would bring flexibility and allow for ongoing innovation but will cause interpretability issues and may leave huge numbers of algorithms unregulated – for example, all that falls under the level 1 risk.</p>
<p>Explainability may be regulated very harshly and may become an even larger barrier to maturity for machine and deep learning models than before. When there is a clear rejection of a specific explainability method by organizations that will likely influence the design of AI regulation, we can expect requirements that may not be technically possible yet, which would trigger a retraction of some solutions already on the market.</p>
<p>And we can expect AI regulation to be made in the model of the GDPR, using similar terminology and striving to fill the gaps in data protection that have been exposed since its implementation in 2018. One example<a></a> is that we will likely see the terms “data controller” and “data processor” again, updated to fit the context of AI development and implementation. Another is that the “conditions for consent” will likely reappear in reference to populating training data sets and when the model is being implemented.</p>
<p>Legally binding regulation for AI is still on the distant horizon. The EU Commission is still finalizing its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation/guidelines">recommended framework for AI governance</a>, a project two years in the making. Its next update was expected in June 2020. A regulation built on that framework will likely still take a few years to be approved.</p>

<p>A Roman coin from around 60 BC depicting a voter putting a ballot into a container.</p>



<p>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/costavayenas/">Costa Vayenas</a></p>



<p>This is the second in the series on the paradigm shift to a digital state. In Part 1, published <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/04/30/the-digital-state-part-1/">here</a>, I pointed out that the state is becoming increasingly digital and that no pillar of government is going to remain untouched.</p>



<p>In this article, I focus on one area of
citizen-government interaction that is being digitized, namely the technology
of elections. </p>



<p>The 2020 accelerator</p>



<p>The coronavirus has been a massive accelerator of all
things digital involving the state. In the area of public health, 28 governments
were able to rapidly introduce COVID-19 apps. [1] Tracking the virus at sewage
plants has also given governments a one-week city by city heads-up on where
outbreaks will be confirmed next. [2]</p>



<p>Beyond digital public health initiatives, dozens of
governments around the world either postponed elections in 2020 and/or changed
the election process to “remote” (i.e. permitting voting from home). [3] </p>



<p>New kinds of ballots</p>



<p>Over thousands of years, the ballot has been many
different things: a show of hands, the spoken word, light and dark pebbles,
engravings on bits of clay, entries on small wax tablets, olive leaves, pieces
of bronze, papyrus, parchment, vellum, marbles, the lifting of swords, and
paper. [4]</p>



<p>In our age, a number of state entities have
experimented with e-voting. The US was one of the first countries to experiment
with voting by email, at first just for the military abroad. At the time, it
didn’t seem to matter that the votes were not really secret – someone still had
to print them out at the other end. More recently, West Virginia became the
first US State to permit the military to vote via mobile phones using
blockchain. [5]</p>



<p>There is a lot of trial and error involved. I remember
how impressed I was by the Norwegians, who explained why one of their electronic
elections nearly turned into a disaster as a result of an error in the
encryption code. [6] If this type of thing could nearly happen in Norway, a
wealthy country with a technocratic administration, then we might well ask what
could all go wrong if e-voting were launched in less well-prepared countries
that have fewer resources and lower standards of transparency and governance?</p>



<p>Voting technology is not neutral – it can shift the
outcome of elections </p>



<p>That technology influences how the people instruct
their representatives is as old as recorded history. My choice of the Roman
coin above illustrates one of the ways that voting took place two thousand
years ago.</p>



<p>There was a time when elections were not conducted by
secret ballot, neither in ancient Greece or Rome, nor in the United Kingdom&nbsp;or
in the United States. In the UK, the secret ballot was only introduced as late
as 1872 and later in the US. Before the introduction of secret ballots, one
method of voting was for voters to verbally tell an appointed election official
at the polling station who their vote was for. The official then had to record
that and tally the results. </p>



<p>When society decided it was time to switch to a secret
ballot, a different voting technology was required. The new method delivered
its objective – a secret ballot – but it also changed election outcomes. In one
study, voter turnout in the US declined by around seven percentage points after
the introduction of the secret ballot. [7] A possible explanation for
this decline is that some voters had only gone to the polls as a result of
pressure from their landlord or their employer, or as a result of gifts from a
particular candidate. The introduction of the secret ballot also discriminated
against those who could not read or write, thus keeping them away from the
polls. </p>



<p>Another effect of the introduction of the secret
ballot, noted after Rome introduced it in 139
BC, was that gifts from candidates were now redistributed to specific tribes or
regions. Sometimes the gifts were provided after the regional result became
available, thereby confirming the quid pro quo. [8]</p>



<p>The Swiss experience: Postal voting changes the
numbers </p>



<p>What about the impact of postal voting on election outcomes?
In Switzerland, every eligible
citizen, regardless of where they are registered in the world, automatically
receives a ballot in the post, complete with a self-addressed return envelope,
whether they want it or not. A long-term study that looked at the impact on
voter turnout following the introduction of postal voting&nbsp;in Switzerland
found that it resulted in an increased voter turnout of around four percentage
points. [9] At first glance, that is a surprisingly low number considering that
the ballot arrives at your home without you requesting it, and includes a
return envelope addressed to the ballot-counting authority. How much easier can
it be than that? But that is also a reminder of how uninterested the average
person is in politics – they don’t even want to open the envelope. Getting
people to vote is hard work. On the other hand, a permanent increase of four
percentage points in voter turnout shows that more convenience does make a
difference. And given how narrow some election wins are, four percentage points
can make a huge difference in some places. Seen from that perspective, a
permanent increase of four percentage points is a big deal in politics.</p>



<p>The type of ballot matters, therefore</p>



<p>So, if you change the ballot or tweak the election
process (who can vote, when, where and how?), you change the voter turnout and
that may change the election outcome. </p>



<p>As the state goes digital in a big way, voting from
one’s mobile phone from home in one’s pyjamas will inevitably have an impact in
certain jurisdictions if the voting choices are considered relevant. Evidence
from different jurisdictions is that the introduction of e-voting resulted in
different rates of usage and different trends. It was considered a flop when
introduced in a limited way in France for French residents living abroad, but
was better used by Swiss residents overseas in their elections. In Estonia, e-voting has resulted in more persons
voting from more different places (i.e. also when they were outside the
country) – a result which is more in line with the idea that if something is
relevant, then people will probably use it. But voters are not going to be
persuaded to use their new devices to vote for candidates and choices that do
not appear relevant to them. </p>



<p>Many aspects play a role in this new remote voting value-chain,
including how user-friendly the technology is. A legally-recognized digital ID
will be a major component of a more user-friendly system. This is indeed one of
the foundational technologies that has made e-voting widely used in Estonia. </p>



<p>New rights created</p>



<p>There is also evidence that new voting technology has
created important new freedoms: eligible citizens have acquired new freedoms in
terms of when they can vote (anytime, day or night, from the time early
votes are accepted) and where they can vote (from anywhere). This
technology has even created the new freedom (which exists in Estonia) for voters to change their vote,
as often as they wish, switching it from one candidate to another, until the
polls close. The reasons for such a feature are two-fold: first, because the
technology makes it possible (that’s what technological innovation is all
about, after all – if the app offers the feature, some will use it), and
second, because it makes it less likely for coercion to occur at home or at
work since voters can keep changing their preferences from anywhere at any
time. All three of these new freedoms were triggered by a new voting technology
– a paper-based system would not make it easy to keep a polling booth open 24/7
or allow voters to change their vote after they had cast it or allowed voters
to vote from anywhere.</p>



<p>Concluding thoughts</p>



<p>E-voting (assuming honest software, good governance
and the appropriate checks and balances) [10] potentially represents a major
upgrade of democracy. It will become cheaper and easier to
formally obtain the people’s consent. The “transaction costs”, to use the
academic jargon, will fall dramatically – both for the voter and for the state.
The implications of this efficiency gain will differ from country to country.
But its real disruptive potential lies elsewhere: It opens the possibility,
unforeseen by the founding fathers of old constitutions, that it would become
logistically much easier to consult the people on more things more frequently.
Once that realization dawns in more places, someone, somewhere is going to
become the first to want to try out such a disruptive thought. If the ballot is
a button on your mobile phone, should the app only be used for general
elections every few years? What about the in-between years? Should the people
not be consulted more often on more things? If not, why not? </p>



<p>The growing availability and use of technology
enabling electronic voting will, over time, open up a Pandora’s box. It will
challenge the centuries-old customs of a representative system that was built
in the days when the majority of the voters were labouring in the fields and
knew very little about the policy debates taking place in a faraway
legislature.</p>



<p>The availability of new technology by which the people can choose to make their will known, combined with the growing complexity faced by modern-day legislatures, is hastening the decline of the representative system as we’ve known it. </p>

<p>The legal challenges come from three main angles: first, there is the claim that the technology might not ensure the secrecy of each individual’s choice (like when you mark your cross on a piece of paper privately behind a curtain at a polling booth), second, that what happens on the inside of the computer is not verifiable by ordinary members of the public (like when election observers can see how the ballot boxes are emptied onto counting tables to be counted and the people doing the counting can be monitored), and third, that each vote might not be given equal treatment if different types of ballots and different mechanisms are used for recording, transmitting, sorting, counting and storing votes in different constituencies. This latter point becomes especially important in very tight races and when recounts are needed, and a tiny number of votes can make the difference.</p>

Some have even called for using the wallet as the central point of <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">explaining SSI</a>. If you’re seeking to implement an SSI solution, you have two options:<br><br></p>  Use an existing mobile wallet, like the popular <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>, <a href="https://connect.me/">Connect.Me</a>, or <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi</a>.  Develop your own wallet, custom-made for your use case.  <p><br>Many of the people we talk with prefer option #2, because typically different use cases have different requirements. But there’s a reason there are only a handful of wallet apps out there—building an SSI wallet is complex! At Trinsic we seek to remove as much complexity as possible to empower others to build incredible SSI solutions.</p><p><br>In this post, we’ll help you understand the trade-offs associated with developing a digital wallet for your users.</p>

					 <p>Digital wallets are quite complex under the hood. They need to be capable of securely storing verifiable credentials. They need to speak all the right protocols to exchange secure messages in an interoperable fashion. They need to manage cryptographic keys. The software libraries required to perform these functions are quite extensive and can get “heavy.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, most people in the developed world carry around a miniature supercomputer in their pockets. Smartphones are easily capable of handling a 100kb wallet application. That’s why most SSI wallets are what we call “edge wallets” (meaning the wallet itself resides on the person’s device). Edge wallets have the added benefit of being a more “pure” solution with individuals owning, controlling, and managing their own wallet and keys without relying on a third-party provider. The Trinsic Wallet is an edge wallet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The alternative to an edge wallet is a cloud wallet. With cloud wallets, the “heavy” cryptographic libraries are processed on a server in the cloud. This keeps the implementation lightweight and flexible. The subject of the wallet (usually the end-user) can control it via any existing authentication scheme from any platform. For example, a user could view the same wallet via mobile app or through a browser—something that’s not possible with edge wallets. Cloud wallets do require, however, that the user have internet connectivity. Finally, the user should ideally be able to export their wallet out of the cloud and import it into an edge wallet if they so desire—otherwise, it’s really not self-sovereign. Trinsic’s <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Trinsic/Wallet/v1">Wallet API</a> provides a cloud wallet solution which can be integrated using our mobile SDK.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Decision #2: Customization &amp; Control 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The customization of a wallet can be as varied as the potential use cases to which they can be applied, but not every implementation needs to start from scratch. A few out-of-the-box wallets are available, including Evernym’s <a href="http://connect.Me">Connect.Me</a> and the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>. Using these wallets is a great option if you don’t need a lot of customization. It’s important to consider the user experience: In the early days, it might feel awkward to direct your users to download a third-party application; but in the long-term, users won’t want to download three or five or more different wallets—for convenience purposes, they’ll probably want just one wallet that stores everything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have an existing application and simply want to integrate SSI capabilities into it, using cloud wallets is a good option. It gives a great deal of flexibility and customization.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you intend to develop an SSI wallet that primarily serves as an SSI wallet and doesn’t require a large amount of customization, then a white label wallet could be a perfect fit. The cost to white label an existing SSI wallet is much less than the cost of a single developer, while guaranteeing the functionality you need. Learn more about white labeling the Trinsic Wallet <a href="http://trinsic.id/white-label">here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you intend to develop an SSI wallet that needs a large amount of customization, it probably makes sense to build it from scratch. Trinsic open sourced its Xamarin mobile SDK and helps maintain an open source reference mobile application called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin">Aries Mobile Agent Xamarin</a> (AMA-x). This would be a good place to start if you have a strong development team and don’t have a rushed timeline. For faster development time, you could try the Trinsic Mobile Starter Kit, a skeleton application that gets your team over the hardest parts of the development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Customization and control are generally correlated together, as is cost. The more of each you get, the costlier the solution because of the resources you’ll need to commit to building and maintaining that solution.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Decision #3: Budget 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Every organization has its own budget constraints. Some prefer usage-based pricing while others prefer fixed costs. Some have large development resources while others don’t. It’s impossible to tell an organization which direction they should go without diving into the minutia of the situation. However, there are some guiding principles that could help.<br><br></p>  The more customization and control you want, the more development resources you’ll need.  If you have developers, but they’re constrained by other tasks as well, consider using a cloud wallet or white-labeled solution. This will help you focus on your specialty.  If you have no developer resources at all, but you do have budget, find a delivery partner that can help you build it out. We’d be happy to connect you with vendors willing to help you.  If you have no developer resources AND no budget, you’ll need to use an existing SSI wallet product.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Trinsic Resources 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Above we’ve listed several SSI wallet solutions that Trinsic can offer. Outlined below are the Mobile Starter Kit, Wallet API, and White-label offerings.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Mobile Starter Kit 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The Trinsic Mobile Starter Kit is the best starting place to build a mobile (edge) SSI wallet. It is a skeleton mobile app that includes all the libraries and functions you need to perform basic SSI functionality. Assembly is required, however, to compile the functions correctly to build a useful application.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Best option if:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  You want a wallet owned and built entirely by your team but don’t want to start from scratch.  You have the development resources necessary to build the application in Xamarin.  You have some designs in mind that you’d like your developers to implement.  You prefer an edge agent solution to a cloud agent solution for your use case.  An SSI wallet is your app’s main function.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Remember this:<br><br></p>  The Mobile Starter Kit source code is licensed from Trinsic via an annual subscription.  It includes a training to help your team get started and make sure your developers hit the ground running.  It also includes a dedicated senior engineer on support.  To productionize your application, a cloud-based “mediator” service is required to route messages, deliver push notifications, and optionally store encrypted wallet backups.  Trinsic offers a performant and scalable mediator service as an add-on (you can also build your own mediator service).<br><br>  <p>For more information on the Mobile Starter Kit, <a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">contact us</a>.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Mobile SDK 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The Trinsic mobile SDK is a client library to consume the <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Trinsic/Wallet/v1">Wallet API</a> (previously called Custodian API), which allows you to control a Trinsic-hosted cloud wallet. We handle all of the complexity on our end, so you don’t have to worry about tying up loose end(point)s . You’ll install a client SDK into your app which is much thinner than the Mobile Starter Kit. This SDK component interacts with the APIs and the cloud wallet. Thus, the wallet is hosted in the cloud but controlled by the mobile SDK.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Best option if:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  You need something quick and scalable.  Your solution needs to accommodate for a wider variety of smartphones, devices, or otherwise needs to be cross-platform.  Your development team isn’t capable of maintaining an edge SSI wallet because they’re too busy, don’t have the expertise, or some other reason.  Your app’s main function is not as an SSI wallet, but you just want to add SSI capabilities to your current app.  Your app will be connected to the internet when being used to access the API.  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The Wallet API cost is simply usage. We charge a small fee based on DIDComm used. Trinsic can support hundreds of thousands of cloud agents (for usage above that, please <a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">contact us</a>). This is a great place to start for a proof of concept, pilot, and rapid scaling in production.</p>

 The GiD Report #117 — Why Larry Summers believes crypto will succeed, Kara Swisher on Big Tech antitrust <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-identity-is-techs-next-big-wave-75c80e453941">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  An unprecedented time for&nbsp;change  Larry Summers on&nbsp;crypto  Kara Swisher on Big Tech antitrust — and their impending Congressional hearing  Stuff happens   1. One thing’s for sure. These are interesting, unprecedented times. As I’m writing this, the stock market continues to roar even as the coronavirus is spiking across the country, the unlikeliest of correlations (with the crypto market in tow as&nbsp;well).  Today, traders take their cues from the printing press more than they do fundamentals. <p>Coming out of July 4th weekend, the country has never been more divided both socially and politically. Things are tense globally, too, with the two most populous nations on earth skirmishing both on their borders and on their tech platforms. Hong Kong is no longer the Hong Kong that we&nbsp;knew.</p><p>Kanye West wants to run for President.</p><p>It’s a time of chaotic change and as such, deep uncertainty. But what’s clear is that the ways things were will no longer be, giving space for new things to&nbsp;come.</p><p>It’s the type of environment that sparks much needed conversations and reflections around the way we live and do&nbsp;things.</p><p>We intuitively grasp that we’re coming to the end of a cycle and we intimately feel the gravity and implications of whatever comes&nbsp;next.</p><p>So here we&nbsp;are.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/7dcf23">Briefing: Facebook, WhatsApp Suspend User Data Requests in Hong&nbsp;Kong</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/e8523e">Briefing: Indian Startups Boom After Government Bans TikTok and Dozens of Other Chinese&nbsp;Apps</a>   2. After 2008, we suddenly realized that we weren’t very comfortable behind so beholden to big banks, and we felt a stinging resentment bailing them out because they were Too Big to&nbsp;Fail.  People reacted by taking to the streets. Politicians reacted by passing more stringent banking regulations. And hackers reacted by bandying around this thing called&nbsp;Bitcoin. <p>Fast forward to today and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is about the real reason why crypto will succeed in a podcast with Circle’s Jeremy&nbsp;Allaire.</p><p>A lot of people throw the term the “establishment” around these days for better or worse — a sign of the times. In the case of Summers, he’s pretty much as establishment as you can get. And so it says a lot that he has such a pragmatic take.</p><p>First he acknowledges the “Bitcoin is gold” idea, even if he doesn’t give it much&nbsp;weight:</p><blockquote>Seems to me that the case for crypto historically rests on three pillars of which I think one has a quite substantial chance of being valid and important and sufficient to support a very big table. And I don’t particularly believe the other two. One case is a case that governments are going to debauch all the traditional currencies, that the pressures of rising debt, dealing with crises, standing behind banking systems — all that is going to lead to hyperinflation.</blockquote><blockquote>And then people aren’t going to want to be putting their money in currencies. They’re going to be wanting to be putting their money in gold, but there are a variety of problems with gold. And so internet exchangeable gold in some proper form is going to become immensely valuable.</blockquote><blockquote>That’s possible. I don’t read existing currencies as being on their way to being debauched, right? Seems to me that while certain monetary aggregates as measures have risen, there are good technical ways to understand that. And you look ahead at market expectations from index bonds, people think that the real problem is that central banks in Japan, Europe, and the United States won’t be able to meet their inflation targets of 2%, won’t be able to get inflation up to 2% even over the next generation.</blockquote><blockquote>So that might be a wrong bet, but the odds that these traditional currencies are going to become so inflationary, and it’s going to be so difficult when they become inflationary to earn an interest rate on them, that people are going to be seeking some separate, really scarce, hard asset — I just don’t think that that’s going to drive a major crypto industry.</blockquote><p>Which is a fair take. He’s also a seller on Bitcoin evangelists:</p><blockquote>Second thing I think is that I don’t think crypto is going to be accepted as some kind of libertarian paradise. I know that there are people who believe that financial privacy in terms of the ability to transfer money is a fundamental human right. And that without it, there will be substantial infringement soon on freedom. And I understand those arguments, but I guess my attitude is more captured by the fact that the 500 Euro note is always referred to as the “Bin Laden.” And that suggests something about the result of when you have super&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>So I don’t think governments will permit tax evaders, money launderers, privacy cravers, and zealots to use this technology to advance their privacy relative to what they have now. I think if anything — around concerns about regulation, corruption, tax evasion — governments will want less financial privacy over time, and they will succeed in getting what they&nbsp;want.</blockquote><p>Like I said, an establishment guy. And to be fair, that’s a relatively balanced take. When you take the ideology out of it, there’s going to be a middleground where innovation and regulators and law enforcement meets. The challenge, of course, is finding that optimal middleground that empowers individuals while also providing lawmakers the necessary tools to take on the bad&nbsp;guys.</p><p>And in terms of the point about less financial privacy over time, that is indeed the trend we’re seeing in places like Sweden and India that have abolished cash.</p><p>But now for Summer’s number one selling point when it comes to crypto innovation:</p><blockquote>I think the case fo all of this innovation will lie in the fact that there’s a ridiculous degree of friction in today’s world around doing quite complex things, whether it’s the 8% in two days that it can cost me to send money to kid when my kid is in a study abroad program, whether it’s the two-and-a-half plus percent that it costs me every time I use a Visa card in a department store, whether it’s the three bucks I have to pay for the routine act of getting cash out — I could go on with examples of this kind. I think the friction both in terms of monetary payment and the friction in terms of effort that’s involved in exchange is excessive.</blockquote><blockquote>And I think that the friction isn’t just coming from the greed of the middle people, although there is greed of the middle people. It’s coming from the various difficulties and challenges associated with a mutual trust. As you know better than I, the computer science theory on which a lot of this is based was referred to as the Byzantine General’s problem.</blockquote><blockquote>How do you get a group of people who don’t trust each other to nonetheless be able to do business together and innovation in institutional form that permits interaction where it otherwise wasn’t possible? That’s what the common law corporation, what the contract was. And I think the kind of innovation that’s involved and coming out of the crypto community is very fundamental. And we tend to associate the idea of innovation with new machines and new medicines, but it’s also a new way of doing&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>So for Summers, it’s about innovation in trust.

In the past couple of years, that same realization is dawning on them when it comes to Big Tech, which is more systemic to our society than ever before, influencing everything from how we communicate to how we buy things to how we&nbsp;vote.  There aren’t too many things we agree on as a whole these days, but Big Tech continues to be one of&nbsp;them. <p>And so the Big Tech leaders of Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple will be getting grilled by Congress about antitrust stuff in late&nbsp;July.</p>Photo: NRKbeta<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/anti-trust-tech-hearing-facebook.html">Kara&nbsp;Swisher</a>:</p><blockquote>This hearing will be part of a wider bipartisan inquiry into how the tech giants dominate the digital industry and hurt rivals and consumers.</blockquote><blockquote>Along with fines, politicians and regulators are contemplating new laws on privacy and competition, the repeal of a law that gives platforms broad immunity for content on their sites, and, perhaps most drastically, breaking them&nbsp;up.</blockquote><blockquote>And while each company has different problems — such as a damaging role in the spread of disinformation and hate speech (Hello, Facebook!) — the near monopolistic power of their services and what to do about it is the focus of the House investigation.</blockquote><blockquote>“We have very serious concerns about the absence of competition,” Mr. Cicilline said. “So we are interested in a wide range of things like their acquisitions, bullying, market power, their favoring of their products and services.”</blockquote><blockquote>While the House has been conducting its investigation, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have also been looking into competition in tech. So, too, have state attorneys general and also international regulators, most notably the European Commission under its antitrust head, Margrethe Vestager.</blockquote><p>The heads of Big Banks went through this. Now it’s Big Tech’s&nbsp;turn.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-ceos-will-testify-in-house-antitrust-hearing-84f48cac-56ef-4c71-b10b-a46e1539aca7.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">Tech CEOs will testify in House antitrust hearing</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/anti-trust-tech-hearing-facebook.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;amp;stream=top">Here Come the 4 Horsemen of the Techopolypse</a>  <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/07/01/facebook-boycott-facebook-stronger-347073?utm_campaign=%5Bcovid19%5D+Tech+Impac&amp;utm_content=564291&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=196702">Opinion | How the Facebook Boycott Could Just Make Facebook&nbsp;Stronger</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/6fe6d6">Briefing: U.K. Regulators Question Google Search Deal With Apple’s&nbsp;Safari</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/fd50eb">Briefing: Senate Committee Passes Bill Targeting Tech’s Legal&nbsp;Immunity</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/63ecde">Briefing: European Regulator Plans Big New Push Against Tech&nbsp;Firms</a>   4.

<p>Unexpected events that highlight our vulnerabilities and weaknesses are often the catalysts for large transformation. The events of 9/11 prompted governments around the world to tighten airport and aircraft security overnight, which had been relatively lax up until that&nbsp;morning.</p><p>Could Coronavirus, and the onslaught of cyber attacks and threats targeting displaced workforces, be the inflection point that finally pushes us towards adopting secure and private authentication technology?</p> Passwords are the real security&nbsp;threat <p>When it comes to remote-work security, passwords are doing more harm than good. In the last week alone, remote workers attempting to access San Francisco Airport’s systems remotely had their credentials compromised, after the airports websites were hacked; and the usernames and passwords of half a million Zoom users, who had their accounts hacked last month, went up for sale on the dark web this&nbsp;week.</p><p>Earlier in the year — pre-Coronavirus — Marriott Hotels suffered a massive privacy breach, where the records of 5.6 million guests were exposed after just two employees had their passwords compromised.</p><p>These examples highlight two things: how vulnerable corporate systems and databases are when they are protected by passwords, and how attractive companies become to criminals when they store user login credentials in their databases.</p><p>Yet despite passwords inviting a range of cyber threats, dismantling password authentication systems has been largely avoided. Rather than overhauling how we authenticate, Band-Aid security solutions that aim to bolster passwords have been the&nbsp;go-to.</p> There’s no Band-Aid solution for passwords <p>Solutions like password managers fail to adequately protect against threats because hackers know that maintaining password hygiene has become too much of a challenge for the average user. The vast majority of people ignore password best practices; whether by recycling their passwords across multiple accounts, or choosing weak passwords.</p><p>To make matters worse, it’s easy for hackers to get their hands on stolen passwords — the going rate for a set of compromised credentials is less than a dollar on the dark web. Once a hacker has a single set of login credentials, they can use those to crack passwords to other accounts.</p><p>Because of this, just one stolen password should be treated for what it is — a major security threat. The famous computer security expert, Window Snyder, put it best when she said: ‘one single vulnerability is all an attacker&nbsp;needs’.</p><p>It’s likely that Coronavirus-related attacks will continue to highlight how weak passwords are, hopefully driving us to adopt smarter authentication technologies that don’t put us at unnecessary risk.</p> Biometric authentication has never been more&nbsp;secure <p>Biometrics have come a long way in the past decade, and are now at the point where they are secure enough to completely replace passwords. Unlike passwords, a user’s unique biometrics and characteristics can’t be guessed or&nbsp;cracked.</p><p>Advances in machine learning, including deep learning, have substantially boosted the security and reliability of facial recognition systems, which have enabled new research directions in novel authentication modalities, like behavioral biometrics; where users are authenticated by how they interact with smartphones and desktops rather than via their physical characteristics.</p><p>These authentication techniques allow us to authenticate users based on how they interact with their devices, rather than via their physical characteristics. They don’t require user attention and can, therefore, be used for continuous authentication. With continuous authentication, the user’s device continuously monitors the user (by processing keystrokes or smartphone movements in the background) and makes frequent authentication decisions based on this&nbsp;data.</p><p>New authentication protocols that combine these advancements with emerging privacy-preserving technologies, such as secure multi-party computation and zero-knowledge cryptography, allow for biometric data to be stored securely.</p><p>As with all emerging technology, despite its readiness and potential, widespread adoption can be slow; but unprecedented events can also often lead to decisive&nbsp;action.</p> Lockdowns’ silver lining for cybersecurity <p>Coronavirus lockdowns and the subsequent cyber threats are the most significant disruption to work-place security in modern history. They may also, however, have a silver lining; they could help usher us into a new era of online security and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>If the Coronavirus pandemic lockdowns force us to replace passwords with something far more secure — like our own unique digital DNA — then it wouldn’t have been for&nbsp;nothing.</p><p>Once we make the inevitable decision to switch to biometric authentication, we will significantly improve security and privacy — effectively putting a permanent stop to a vast majority of cyber&nbsp;threats.</p><p>This is a repost of an Article written by Paolo Gasti — Chief Technology Officer at Keyless Technologies featured in <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/covid19-catalyst-biometrics/">Infosecurity Magazine</a></p> Keyless is the world’s first privacy-preserving biometric authentication and identity management platform.  <a href="http://keyless.io">Schedule a Demo</a> and #GoKeyless  <p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/will-covid-19-be-the-catalyst-to-finally-replace-passwords-with-biometrics-7a51c6cea1d3">Will COVID-19 be the Catalyst to Finally Replace Passwords with Biometrics?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech">KeylessTech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  When organizations modernize their Identity and Access Management (IAM), they have three fundamental requirements: an understanding of current capabilities, a migration strategy to transform the IAM infrastructure and finally, the staff with the expertise to execute the plan. The challenges on the way from legacy IAM to a modern IAM infrastructure are manifold and should be considered beforehand.

<p>Pacifica, CA July 6, 2020: MedCreds, which offers private and trusted verifiable credentialing solutions for COVID-19 and other health conditions, has partnered with BraveMaker, a Redwood City, California-based non-profit film arts organization to help its crew members more safely return to work.</p>
<p>Built on a blockchain and cryptography technology, MedCreds allows people to verify and share their health status from a smartphone or personal computer, while owning and controlling who sees their personal information.</p>
<p>Using blockchain-supported verifiable credentials that are owned ONLY by the individual, the MedCreds app safely helps get people back to workplaces, dentists, schools, airplanes/trains, restaurants, and shopping malls, while helping to reduce the possibility of  COVID-19 transmission.</p>
<p>“I am glad that MedCreds has created their app so my cast and crew can share their recent COVID-19 test results in a way that protects their privacy, and at the same time gives me the comfort of knowing the results are verified from an authorized medical authority,” says  Tony Gapastione, Bravemaker CEO. “Running a company and producing films comes with a lot of stress and anxiety, but I feel better knowing that we are doing everything we can to create a safe work environment that assures my staff we are taking every precaution possible to help reduce health risks on our work sets.”</p>
<p>Tony Rose, CEO of MedCreds, is excited to be working with BraveMaker Films to help independent-film-production companies go safely back to work.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 has shut down many businesses,” says Rose. “MedCreds is proud to offer our tools to help California's economy start back up again. MedCreds is different from other COVID-19 and contact-tracing apps because it allows ONLY the  individual to retain ownership and control of their medical credential and information.”</p>
<p>How MedCreds Works</p>
<p>One week before the production start date, BraveMaker Films’ offers to its cast and crew members the opportunity to remotely ask a doctor to order an FDA-approved COVID-19 test from their local lab. Many film-crew members then chose various labs where they wished to have the test performed.</p>
<p>The doctor then reviews the test results, and—using MedCreds’ verifiable credentials—issues to crew members that completed a COVID-19 test their personal, verifiable test result credential.</p>
<p>Each of those BraveMaker Film crew members owns and controls their digital COVID-19 health credential, and can share their results by scanning a QR code upon entering the set.</p>
<p>An appointed BraveMaker representative instantly receives verification of the legitimacy of those crew member's test results, following the QR scan.</p>
<p>For BraveMaker and its Crew Members, MedCreds:</p>
 
 Enables crew members with COVID-19 test results to confirm their COVID-19 status was issued by an authorized medical authority 
 Gives cast and crew members the ability to download the MedCreds app on their smartphone or personal computer to share their COVID-19 status at other filming locations; the dentist; senior-care centers; for International travel; or any other situation that requires verifying the result of their COVID-19 status. 
 Allows BraveMaker to keep a secure log of credential proofs, demonstrating that they have taken advanced health and safety precautions to protect their film crew. 
 
<p>Ben Littlejohn, MD, a board-certified, California based, family-medicine physician, who works with MedCreds as a medical advisor, believes that MedCreds is the most private technology to enable businesses and the economy to begin opening up again.</p>
<p>“I am excited that patients to whom I have issued MedCreds verifiable credentials can prove to any other party, with certainty, that I issued these test results,” says Dr. Littejohn. “Until now, this level of verification for medical test results has not been possible. I am proud to help Bravemaker studios get back to work and restart the independent film industry.”</p>
<p>Headquartered in Pacifica, CA, MedCreds enables anyone that has a COVID-19 virus or antibody test result to hold a digital verifiable credential that can instantly and privately prove to any person or company the results of their COVID-19 test, using only their mobile phone or personal computer.</p>

<p>Once upon a time in Hollywood on the first day of a production, gaffers, key grips, boom operators, and lighting techs would show up for work—ready to make magic.</p>
<p>Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit and everything suddenly changed, leaving the industry wondering how to protect production crews so they can come back to work.</p>
<p>The solution: like hospitals requiring a COVID-19 test within 48 hours of elective surgery, testing can create a safe production set for cast and crew.</p>
<p>BraveMaker Films, an independent film production non-profit, is starting to bring their cast and crew back to work after months in quarantine.</p>
<p>BraveMaker has an urgent need to ensure that cast and crew have a safe production set, so they can bring their business back to life.</p>
<p>MedCreds Creates a Verifiably Safe Work Environment for BraveMaker</p>
<p>On July 6, 2020, MedCreds (which offers private and trusted verifiable-credentialing solutions)  <a href="http://https://blog.medcreds.com/ghost/#/editor/page/5f036d4ec82e8e0001ead65f">announced it has partnered with BraveMaker</a> to assist them in creating a verifiably safe work environment.</p>
<p>Right now, film production crews are still developing best practices for providing safe production sets, and the film-industry unions (DGA, SAG-AFTRA, IATSE and Teamsters) recently came out with safety guidelines on set.</p>
<p>MedCreds, working with Bravemaker, learned about the challenges involved to coordinate group COVID-19 testing with production schedules.</p>
<p>Challenges with COVID-19 Testing</p>
<p>On Wednesday, July 1, 2020, BraveMaker had 21 people from the Bay Area visit Dr. Ben Littlejohn a physician, via a Telemedicine Zoom call to be referred for a COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>We discovered that since everyone was from a different place, each city and county have different rules regarding who can get tested. Many of the COVID-19 testing facilities did not have appointments available for 3 days or more. In some cases, lab results took 4 days after the test was completed.</p>
<p>MedCreds and BraveMaker learned valuable lessons for getting a film production crew back to work safely.</p>
<p>Challenges</p>
 
 Cities, counties, and states have different eligibility requirements for COVID-19 testing 
 Insurance plans differ in which testing facility they contract with 
 Each testing facility has availability of appointments that vary depending on ever changing supply and demand 
 
<p>A Plan for Production Sets</p>
<p>Due to the current challenges and limited availability of testing in some locations, we can offer the following insights:</p>
 
 
<p>3 Weeks Before Production Start Date - Cast and crew are directed to schedule an appointment with their own doctor or a MedCreds Network doctor to get a referral for a COVID-19 test</p>
 
 
<p>2 Weeks Before Production Start Date - Cast and crew have either a zoom or in-office visit with their doctor to have a health screening. Each person is referred to a COVID-19 test at a lab convenient to their location</p>
 
 
<p>1-4 Days Before Production Start Date - Each person visits a testing site to have a test administered using an approved COVID-19 test</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>1 Day Before Production Start Date - All cast and crew have received their medical professional issued COVID-19 test result credential from MedCreds</p>
 
 
<p>Production Start Date - Prior to arriving on set, or upon arrival, cast and crew scan a QR code and consent to sharing their COVID-19 test result status, via MedCreds verifiable credential proof, with the production company. The company will then have a cryptographically verifiable record of COVID-19 test results issued by authorized medical providers for each of their cast and crew.</p>
 
 
<p>This process provides assurance that everyone has been screened and educated about health and safety policies, and a COVID-19 test result has been issued by an authorized medical professional.</p>
<p>By following this procedure, production companies can be assured they have made extensive efforts to create a safe environment for their cast and crew, and such companies have cryptographically verifiable records documenting the process.</p>
<p>Given the current situation, with this process, Film Production Companies can be sure that everyone arriving on set has had a recent COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>In the future, testing will be more widely available, and businesses will be able to re-open with confidence.</p>
<p>Ben Littlejohn, MD, a board-certified, California based, family-medicine physician, who works with MedCreds as a medical advisor, believes this is the most private technology to enable businesses and the economy to begin opening up again.</p>
<p>“I am excited patients to whom I have issued MedCreds verifiable credentials can prove to any other party, with certainty, I issued these test results,” says Dr. Littejohn. “Until now, this level of verification for medical test results has not been possible. I am proud to help Bravemaker studios get back to work and restart the independent film industry.”</p>

   Have you been affected by the new anti-money laundering regulations in Estonia? The scandal, in which 200 billion euros were laundered through an Estonian branch, has reinforced the urgent need for financial institutions to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) as a part of their larger Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts.

<p>Cryptocurrencies have transformed the way society views money, its value, how it can be traded, where it is stored, and who regulates it. Hailed as both revolutionary and dangerous, depending who you ask, the allure has been unmistakable. More than 50 central banks globally have experimented with cryptocurrencies or are developing their own. The cryptocurrency space has moved exponentially faster than the more traditional financial institutions, which has resulted in a lag between innovation and regulation, with some countries banning them entirely. </p>



<p>Estonia was not one of those countries. Long seen as a leader in the digital space, Estonia has become a type of haven for blockchain and cryptocurrency leaders, which is why last week’s news that it had revoked licenses from 500 crypto companies came as a shock to some.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move has been tied to a larger crackdown on illicit financial transactions as the investigation into a Danske Bank money laundering scandal comes to a close. The scandal, in which 200 billion euros were laundered through an Estonian branch, has reinforced the urgent need for financial institutions to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) as a part of their larger Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts.&nbsp;</p>



 Estonia’s New Regulations 



<p>Since loosening the restriction for cryptocurrency companies in 2017, Estonia issued a whopping 1,400 licenses to firms in the subsequent years. While part of the regulation that stipulates firms must begin operations within six months of obtaining a license is not new, it is the enforcement of this piece alone that led to the country revoking more than 30 percent of Estonian crypto companies’ licenses.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-11/eu-nation-at-center-of-dirty-cash-storm-cracks-down-on-crypto">Bloomberg</a>, the head of Estonia’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the regulator responsible for issuing the licenses, claimed that the new regulations are a response to stricter AML requirements and risk mitigation, and not meant to suppress the crypto field, nor are the regulations industry-specific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Estonian government has also passed a bill amending the processing time for 30 to 90 days and has upped the license fees substantially. Any crypto company registered in Estonia must now either incorporate in the country or open a local branch.&nbsp;</p>



 KYC Strengthens AML Efforts&nbsp; 



<p>The basic idea behind and value of KYC from a financial institution’s perspective is to understand who their customer base is (whether as individuals or as a firm) and what types of transactions they will be carrying out with that account. KYC becomes a crucial part of AML in assessing the risk any given customer or account poses. It can be monitored and flagged, thus to a large extent preventing illicit activity from happening at all.</p>



<p>While the <a href="https://authenteq.com/the-true-cost-of-kyc-and-how-authenteq-lowers-it/">true cost of KYC</a> varies depending on the number of users any given company has and processes, the cost of non-compliance is grave. Danske Bank is facing fines in the billions. In addition to fines and legal fees, ideals of credibility, security and safety can all be tarnished indefinitely, resulting in lower customer retention rates, the loss of partnerships, or outside investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opting for a <a href="https://authenteq.com/">fully automated</a> identity verification and KYC solution can not only reduce processing times while increasing AML efforts, it removes the need for in-house staff during the approval process, reducing both costs and removing the risk of human error. A trusted and compliant solution eliminates the need and associated costs to the development of proprietary technology. Creating a frictionless onboarding process for customers allows companies to focus on their overall user experience and purpose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing for certain is that regulation that prevents identity theft and fraud will only become more prevalent, and companies without KYC baked into their business model run the risk of being shut down or never starting at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first half of 2020 marked a few significant milestones for Civic. Most importantly, we’re proud that Civic Wallet is now available in app stores! Since late March we’ve been offering gated, invite-only Civic Wallet access to a waitlist of users around the world. The wallet was officially made available in the app stores on June 15.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We built Civic Wallet because we wanted to be the first company to get a digital wallet right for the consumer. Civic Wallet offers a safe way to store and transact with digital currency around the world. We put you at the center of the wallet experience, so you’re in charge of your crypto and identity. Restoration is easy and guaranteed if you ever lose your phone.</p>



<p>Start protecting your crypto immediately</p>



<p>With a Civic Wallet, you may immediately bring in digital currency and start protecting it with our company’s <a href="https://www.civic.com/faq/#coincover">$1 Million Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee</a>, provided by Coincover and insured by Lloyd’s of London underwriters (<a href="https://www.coincover.com/terms-and-conditions/civic-wallet">see terms &amp; conditions</a>). Civic Wallet also offers an easy way to store digital currency and pay your friends and family around the world. You may send and receive funds to usernames, addresses and even to QR codes after creating a verified identity. Digital currency, including BTC, ETH, USDC and CVC, may be sent globally with low fees for a limited time.</p>



<p>When you sign up for Civic Wallet, you’re authenticated as a real person, using both AI and blockchain-based technology. Because of this unique identity technology, there are no more seed phrases or passwords to remember. Importantly, Civic Wallet is multisig, meaning that more than one private key is required to transact with the wallet. In the event that you lose access to your Civic Wallet, Civic will work together with our partners to recover access to your crypto. And because we are non-custodial, you remain in control of your crypto.</p>



<p>What’s next for Civic</p>



<p>Now that we’ve launched Civic Wallet in app stores, we’re hard at work on the next set of new products and features. Recently, we announced a proof-of-health verification for employers with <a href="https://www.civic.com/healthkey/">Health Key by Civic</a>. Together with our partner, <a href="https://www.circlemedical.com/">Circle Medical</a>, we are ready to securely verify employee health status for San Francisco Bay Area companies while protecting privacy for employees. With Health Key by Civic, employees will have control over the information they share with third parties.<br></p>



<p>Next quarter, we’ll have new Civic Wallet features and product announcements, including more identity features. We built Civic Wallet to protect personally identifiable information (PII), and no PII is stored directly on a blockchain, only an attestation of the information. This is one of several layers of protection designed to shield Civic Wallet holders from bad actors. In addition to identity features, we’ll be adding user profiles, and continuing to develop identity and crypto use cases.</p>



<p>In the news</p>



<p>Health Key by Civic and the generally available Civic Wallet were <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/06/16/apple-and-google-admit-ethereum-app-to-let-employees-prove-theyve-been-vaccinated/#6805bdee40f7">exclusively featured in a Forbes story</a>, which received more than 40,000 unique views to an influential industry-focused audience. The story became an Editor’s Pick and was shared by Forbes Tech on Twitter to more than 2.6 million followers. Following the breaking news, other tech publications such as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/civic-to-launch-vaccination-proofing-tool-on-apple-google-app-stores">Cointelegraph</a> and <a href="https://ventureburn.com/2020/06/vinny-linghams-civic-launches-consumer-first-digital-wallet/">VentureBurn</a> also reported on the news. In all, combined with our <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200616006076/en">press release</a>, Civic Wallet news reached more than 103 million readers.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Civic <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200331005187/en/Civic-Coincover-Announce-First-of-its-Kind-Crypto-Wallet-1">announced a partnership</a> with Coincover to offer Civic Wallet users a $1 Million Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee (<a href="https://www.coincover.com/terms-and-conditions/civic-wallet">see Terms &amp; Conditions</a>). Coverage for this announcement included stories in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ex-royal-mint-teams-crypto-insurance-now-provides-1m-cover-for-all-civic-wallets">CoinDesk</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/civic-wallet-now-offers-1m-fdic-like-insurance-for-crypto">Cointelegraph</a> and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/civic-wallets-1-million-guarantee-could-bolster-mainstream-cryptocurrency-adoption/">BeINCrypto</a>.</p>



<p>Civic appeared in a number of podcasts throughout the first half of the year, including <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/02eeaKpBfm70m8HpdxdrKQ?si=mqnhyJZlSnGk44Ovlx2Mlg">Encrypted</a>, <a href="https://www.orchid.com/podcast/episode-2-vinny-lingham/">Follow the White Rabbit</a>, the <a href="https://share.insider.thomsonreuters.com/link?entryId=0_clmxnogh">Crypto Coin Show</a>, the <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1vAxRBWOyNzxl">Matt Brown Show</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ayz_8_cm9DI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Tech Central</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/multicoin-capital-partners-explain-how-they-invest-in-crypto-startups">Cointelegraph</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ICQdHrUy5U">TF Labs</a>, and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/vinny-lingham-ceo-civic-general-partner-at-multicoin/id1476353378?i=1000467276111">Solana</a>. Some other highlights include this <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/vinny-lingham-at-ces/">CES panel</a> and an appearance in the <a href="https://cryptopiafilm.com/">Cryptopia</a> documentary and this story about the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/feds-quantitative-easing-strategy-holds-long-term-benefits-for-crypto">macro-economy and crypto</a>.</p>



<p>Building the health use case for identity verification</p>



<p><a href="http://identity.com">Identity.com</a>, the identity ecosystem operating independently from Civic as a nonprofit, has been hard at work building structural inroads to new identity use cases, including proof-of-health verification. From the non-profit’s work contributing to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Verifiable Credentials Data Model to its contributions to California State legislation related to medical test results and verification credentials, Identity.com has actively laid groundwork for health verification. Identity.com is currently working on separating its ecosystem’s infrastructure, so that multiple identity validators may enter its marketplace for verifying credentials.</p>



<p>Get Your Civic Wallet</p>



<p>It’s been an exciting 2020 so far, and we’re looking forward to the second half of the year. If you haven’t tried out Civic Wallet yet, getting started is just a click away in the <a href="https://l.civic.com/zDCwB4PHN7">Google Play Store</a> or <a href="https://l.civic.com/0jODC5JHN7">App Store</a>.<br></p>

   CEO Perspective&nbsp; 

<p>ForgeRock Identity Live 2020 went virtual last week! It was exciting to connect with everyone, share what is happening at ForgeRock, and learn from each other. While I would have preferred to meet in person, the conversations with customers and partners were just as meaningful. We heard from leading brands around the globe about how identity is shaping the future of their organizations and saw some amazing product demos from our ForgeRock team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Top of mind for everyone was how we’ve all experienced the way we live change overnight. The pandemic has&nbsp;put greater emphasis on the need for digital identity solutions that can keep employees productive and consumers <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/connect-everyone">connected</a> while still protecting the security of the enterprise and the privacy of the user. </p>

<p>In the last nine weeks, we’ve all been grappling with similar questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do you provide secure and frictionless access to apps and information for a remote workforce? How do we reduce the enormous strain and complexity an increasingly remote workforce puts on IT teams? How can businesses keep the costs of things like password resets down when more people are creating new online accounts daily? And how can we help consumers, citizens and students get to the things they need easier and from any device?&nbsp;</p>

<p>We heard our panelists ask and answer these very questions. We believe artificial intelligence (AI) is the way forward when it comes to access and enabling smooth and secure experiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were also reminded that digital transformation is a journey – no two organizations are the same. Aside from delivering amazing solutions that are simple to use, provide superior security and intelligence, and are delivered as a cloud service – we must also create a path that can either help you leapfrog from where you are today or build on what you have at your own pace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the advancements in the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>, we’ve made orchestrating identity journeys even simpler and more secure, and that includes solutions like <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">ForgeRock Go</a>, aimed at making usernames and passwords a thing of the past. It was gratifying to hear Sean Carrick, vice president,&nbsp;identity operations and engineering, LPL Financial, echo our belief that it's a strong addition to the platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Balancing user experience with security is critical. Verizon IT Executive Director Manah Khalil pointed out that the power of artificial intelligence (AI) will help determine what makes one of their millions of customers distinct while also protecting their privacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cloud is a great opportunity for organizations to deploy their infrastructure faster and at less expense. Understanding that everyone’s cloud journey is at a different stage, we’ve made it simple to manage identities across all use cases and with any <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">cloud option</a> – your cloud, our cloud, or a public cloud.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rich Kneeley, managing director of cybersecurity and privacy at PwC, shared that companies that have already moved to the cloud were in a much better position to respond to the pandemic than others: “Employees, consumers, and business partners are expecting greater collaboration, increased security, deeper personalization, and unique experiences as they interact with their trusted brands. Identity should be a business enabler for increased cloud adoption.”</p>

<p>When the reality of the pandemic hit, our customers had to act fast. Scalability and simplicity of deployment really matters. For example, the New South Wales Department of Education in Australia manages more than one million student and employee identities, making it the second largest school district in the Southern Hemisphere. Shane Gandy, director of identity management for the district, successfully navigated the pandemic and points to AI as a tool that will make similar challenges easier to overcome in the future: “With COVID-19, we had two weeks to mobilize all these identities for online learning with the understanding that some students don't have access to devices or even the Internet. We had to quickly and securely get people access to these services.”</p>

<p>Creating delightful user experiences is a passion at ForgeRock and essential in a digital world. That came into play at the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) when the pandemic struck. “With COVID-19, we had to adjust to the volatility. In April and May, we had historic volumes of trading - 150,000 people joined or re-joined their accounts – and we went from $1.6 billion to $33.3 billion a day in revenue. Tools like multi-factor authentication (MFA) were very helpful in providing one front door for customers to enter and offer a better user experience, ” said Tristan Geering, Chief Information Security Officer, ASX.&nbsp;</p>

 Final Thoughts&nbsp; 

<p>The pandemic won’t be the last disruption for your organization. Customer expectations will continue to push your business to evolve. Accordingly, you need an identity platform that can flex with you and help you grow your business no matter the circumstance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are committed to building on the strength of our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">AI-driven platform</a> and enabling your workforce to be productive from anywhere, putting consumers on a happy path, and, most importantly, continuing to deliver innovation that does the heavy lifting for you.</p>

<p>This is how we see the future of identity and the role it plays for our customers. We launched a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/nextwave">wave of new innovation</a> last week designed to help you achieve this new reality.</p>

<p>I’d like to thank all our customers and partners who helped make <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-live">Identity Live</a> 2020 a success. Catch highlights from all three shows and hear from BMW, Accenture, Deloitte, and others <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/videos/identity-live-2020-virtual-edition-highlights">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Informatica just announced that they agreed to acquire Compact Solutions, a vendor of Enterprise Metadata Management with engineering and professional services being based out of Krakow, Poland. Compact Solutions core product is MetaDex, which enables full end-to-end visibility of data flows, especially around some complex data sources, and thus helps organizations in understanding, tracking, managing, and protecting data flows and increasing efficiency in their broader data and analytics landscape as well as making more efficient use of their data.</p>
 Metadata Management: Knowing your data and where it resides 
<p>Metadata Management is an approach which – ideally – provides insight into all data within an organization by adding valuable context to the data. Data resides in a variety of systems and is used in a variety of ways. The sprawl of data, which has increased over the past years with the event of Big Data and Cloud, makes efficient use of data a challenge, across a range of use cases. These include Analytics, Data Governance, Data Privacy, Master Data Management, Data Integration, or Data Quality.</p>
<p>Knowing where data resides and fully understanding the data can help in reducing sprawl and enabling a more efficient use of data with better data quality. It also helps organizations in efficiently migrating solutions and data to the cloud, as part of the common “cloud-first” strategies of today, by e.g. removing sensitive data elements ahead of migration, and by efficiently managing and governing key data assets in the cloud.</p>
<p>Metadata Management discovers and analyzes data sources, helps in understanding where data resides, where data is flowing and where it originates (i.e. Data Lineage). It is built around a Data Catalog, such as Informatica EDC, which includes the solutions' ability for discovering and extracting metadata from sources ranging from COBOL programs to cloud-based data storage.</p>
 The rationale behind the deal: Informatica’s strategy 
<p>Informatica is acquiring Compact Solutions to further strengthen its already extensive Metadata Management and data cataloging capabilities, and make its Enterprise Data Catalog the most comprehensive solution for a data catalog. Compact Solutions adds unique capabilities in extracting metadata and lineage from complex data sources such as code and stored procedures in databases and data warehouses (both static and dynamic code), legacy mainframe systems, and many other complex sources of such data.</p>
<p>Based on that, Informatica positions itself as the only vendor that can provide comprehensive Metadata Management and Data Catalog across all enterprise sources, and comprehensive data lineage.</p>
 The need for getting a grip on your big data: Governance, not data sprawl 
<p>Apparently, one aspect I’m specifically looking at is how this a better Metadata Management can help organizations in improving Data Governance, Data Privacy, and Security. Our observation is that virtually all organizations are facing challenges in these areas. This has become an even bigger challenge in the past year. Big Data is driving data sprawl. Enhanced Metadata Management helps deal with this sprawl by identifying, classifying, and governing this data. This is critical, especially for organizations that want to succeed in their Digital Transformation journeys.</p>
<p>Metadata Management helps in delivering on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/an72565">Big Data Security, Governance, and Stewardship</a>, because they make sprawl manageable. I have no illusion that we will be able to reduce sprawl, but knowing where which data resides, what are its key attributes, what are the sources of this data, can this data be trusted and what is the quality of this data helps in getting grip on that data. Factually, Metadata Management might also help in reusing data instead of creating new instances, but probably growth will exceed reuse.</p>
 Metadata Management: The role in Data Security and Big Data Security 
<p>Beyond Big Data Governance, Metadata Management also is a foundation for getting better in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/lb80109">Data Security</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/singh/data-security-and-governance-dsg-for-big-data-and-bi">Big Data Security</a>. Several organizations I’ve been talking to are understanding their shortcomings in efficiently and effectively managing all their data, from sources such as files to data lakes, databases, analytics, and BI reports being created by these. We look at the market for Database and Big Data Security for long, with our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/lc79015">Leadership Compass</a> and other research.</p>
<p>Knowing where data resides, where it is flowing, and how it gets transformed along its way (discovery and lineage) helps in enabling business (and also software vendors and cloud service providers, both Informatica and 3rd parties) to make progress on better solutions e.g. for</p>
 
 Data encryption/pseudonymization 
 PII protection and protection of other valuable information assets 
 Applying data security measures beyond that (e.g. access controls) more broadly and consistently 
 
<p>Enhanced Metadata Management the way Informatica is promising is an important step towards making significant progress in Big Data and Data Governance, Security, and Stewardship.</p>
 Data is the new gold if you know it 
<p>If you want to go with “data is the new gold”, or if you just see the increasing value and relevance of data for every modern business, one thing is apparent: Unless you have a grip on that data, you will struggle with leveraging the value of your data. Thus, better Metadata Management is essential, and this acquisition promises to be a significant step forward. But regardless of the solution, you choose: Metadata Management and comprehensive Data Catalogs are essential for every successful, digital business.</p>

					 <p>We are excited to launch the world’s first product built specifically for <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) providers. Beta testers of the Provider API call it “a game-changer for companies building SSI solutions.” It’s a turnkey way for companies to programmatically create and manage credential issuers/verifiers (which we’ll call “organizations” — they’re also known as “cloud agents”¹). Through this important release, Trinsic became the first decentralized identity provider to open up its platform to any company wishing to provide SSI solutions.</p> &nbsp;  Story of the Provider API <p>Vendors in the decentralized identity space, including Trinsic, have historically focused on credential issuers, holders, and verifiers²&nbsp;(see image below). And that worked well, as long as the verifier could trust the issuer of the credential.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>But trusting the issuer shouldn’t be taken for granted. In early SSI initiatives, the verifiers knew who the issuers were, and visa-versa. But in order to scale this model, trust gets more complex. Suppose there are 10,000 issuers of the credential that you’d like to verify. How will you manage to maintain a relationship, and therefore trust, with each of them?</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>This problem is solved by scalable governance and innovative SSI providers. The <a href="http://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a> was formed (and Trinsic <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-joins-trust-over-ip-foundation-as-founding-member/">joined</a> as a founding member) to create scalable governance. Trinsic’s Provider API solves the other half of the equation; enabling providers of trust solutions with the world’s most scalable SSI platform.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>“The largest trust networks in the world work in exactly this way,”³&nbsp;and a perfect case study is illustrated in the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/98/2020/05/toip_050520_primer.pdf">primer deck</a> for the Trust over IP Foundation: payments networks. As you can see in the image below, merchants don’t need to trust the issuing banks, they trust a credit card provider like Mastercard. Mastercard builds out a platform, provides governance, and ensures the system can be trusted. With the Trust over IP governance stack and the Trinsic platform (complete with the new Provider API), this trust model can be generalized and scaled to any industry.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>We’re working with several SSI providers who are deploying verifiable credential solutions into various markets. Before we developed the Provider API, they had three options:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Use the Trinsic Studio to create organizations manually, one-by-one. This was the preferred option but still was not as powerful or flexible as it should be.<br><br>  Use open source reference Aries agents to create organizations one-by-one. These reference codebases are extremely useful for learning the protocols or playing around with one or two organizations. But to scale to hundreds or thousands of verifiers, for example, requires a herculean development effort fraught with scaling, security, and cost-related obstacles. (Trust us, we’ve been there!)<br><br>  Use another vendor with similarly clunky or manual processes.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, with the Provider API in hand, these SSI providers can create organizations programmatically as a part of their application or workflow. Last week, one of our beta testers created 13,000 verifiers for their client with a single script!</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					  <br>Practical application <p>We can’t wait to see how you use the Trinsic platform, including the new Provider API. To get your creative juices flowing, see how the Provider API has been used over the last few months by our beta testers.<br><br></p>  Build a platform: With the Provider API in hand, you have everything you need to build your own SSI platform. In fact, you could build a product exactly like Trinsic Studio if you want to — all the functionality we expose in the Studio is now accessible through our APIs.<br><br>  Tackle a market: With the Provider API, you can focus on building a solution for a specific market like governments, health care institutions, financial services, etc. You’ll never need to redirect your customers to create a Trinsic account or ask them to install special software.<br><br>  Provide SSI internally: The Provider API enables enterprises to make individual departments, branches, and/or locations into issuers. For example, a university could create a credential issuer for their Registrar’s Office, College of Humanities, and Tuition and Loans Office. Or a franchiser could create a credential verifier point-of-sale system for each of its franchisees.<br><br>  Create an ecosystem: If you’re creating an ecosystem for a specific geography, industry, or cause, you can easily equip each participant with the ability to issue and verify credentials.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					  <br>The world’s most advanced SSI platform <p>With the addition of the Provider API, Trinsic now has three turnkey APIs that give you the tools you need to build a successful SSI solution. These APIs were built with feedback from scores of developers to make them easy to use and are architected with security and scalability top-of-mind.</p><p><br>The Provider API creates and manages organizations. Organizations can do two things:<br><br></p>  Use the <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Streetcred/agency/v1">Credentials API</a> (formerly Agency API) to issue, verify, revoke, and manage verifiable credentials. This API also enables secure communications via DIDComm-based connections and messaging.<br><br>  Use the <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Streetcred/custodian/v1">Wallet API</a> (formerly Custodian API) to create and manage secure cloud wallets that they control on behalf of holders.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					  <br>Get started <p>Trinsic’s products are designed to be accessible, so the Credential API and Wallet API are free to integrate. The Provider API is a paid feature. First, navigate to the Trinsic Studio and make sure you’re subscribed to a paid plan. Then simply navigate to the upper-right-hand account button and select “Provider Key.” The token you generate will enable you to authenticate to the API. See the video below for step-by-step instructions on how to get started.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The best demonstration of the powerful API platform we support is the Trinsic Studio, which is built entirely on our own platform, including the Provider API. The Studio provides a simple way to get started with SSI without a single line of code and to access API keys and manage billing and analytics for your plan.<br><br></p><p>Please <a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">reach out</a> if you’d like a demo or have any questions. We would be happy to walk you through it or help you make a decision. You can also refer to our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/organizations">documentation</a> for more information.<br><br></p><p>At Trinsic, we believe that a host of valuable companies will be built upon the Trust over IP stack. We hope companies intending on providing SSI solutions to your respective industries will find value in our platform, including the Provider API, and help us make the world a safer, more accessible place through SSI.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			
						
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Notes:<br><br></p>  For the sake of simplicity, we refer to credential issuers and verifiers as “organizations” throughout our core products (Trinsic Studio and Trinsic Wallet). For folks familiar with technical terminology, “enterprise agents” or “institutional agents” are other synonymous term since credential issuers and verifiers control wallets, keys, credentials, and other information on your behalf. For more definitions, refer to Trinsic’s terminology in our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/introduction">documentation</a>.<br><br>  Issuers, holders, and verifiers are the roles defined in the W3C Verifiable Credential <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">spec</a>.<br><br>  Quote from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drummondreed/">Drummond Reed</a> in a <a href="https://youtu.be/ktFSEBB5ogI?t=821">webinar</a> hosted by <a href="http://northernblock.ca">Northern Block</a>

  <p>Before there were PAM solutions everyone was given access to privileged accounts with little regard or control as to who had access to them, when they had access and what they did with that access. As security breaches started to rise and compliance regulations were written it was obvious that manual processes and home-grown approaches to manage privileged access weren't enough to secure your organization.</p>
 First PAM solutions solved issues but were too inflexible 
<p>That's when privileged management solutions popped up in the market. There were solutions for password management and delegation solutions were created along with ways to unify your UNIX environment. Shortly after, session management solutions were created and finally, analytics were introduced. And while these solutions solved a problem they were brought to market by separate companies and each solved a separate problem. These stand-alone, incompatible point solutions were next to impossible to manage centrally and difficult to implement. Furthermore, these tools required users to change the way in which they worked and often led to user-acceptance issues.</p>
 Next-gen PAM solutions grow with your business 
<p>That brings us to today, and the rise of multi-platform environments, digital transformation, AI, virtualization, robotic process automation (RPA) and DevOps practices. The IT world has changed, and PAM solutions need to change with it. Next-generation PAM solutions are architected to take into consideration the entire PAM process not just the individual challenges around PAM. They are designed to be operations- and automation-ready making them easy to deploy and seamlessly integrate into your environment and business processes. Next-Gen PAM solutions take into consideration the way that admins work, provide maximum transparency and remove the friction typical of first-generation solutions. They grow with you and enable you to scale and transform your PAM program as your environment and business evolve.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/ashford">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>If anyone in any organization was in any doubt about the importance of having a Disaster Operations Plan, that has surely changed since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some organizations have coped better than others, but every organization should either be working on developing a Disaster Operation Plan or on improving the one they already have by identifying where the plan did and did not work well.</p>
 Design a plan based on resources you already have 
<p>A Disaster Operation Plan is a crisis-specific plan that builds off what an organization should already have in place. The following established elements in business and IT management can help provide the foundation of your plan for worst-case scenarios that could threaten the business.</p>
 
 Business Continuity Management&nbsp;is&nbsp;a management-level strategy&nbsp;commonly focused on major IT issues, local catastrophes, etc. This is the closest discipline to Disaster Planning and Operations.&nbsp; 
 Incident Response Management&nbsp;is an IT discipline targeted at efficiently responding to cyber and/or IT incidents. However, the methodologies used in Incident Response Management can be helpful when reacting to something unknown or unprecedented, like Covid-19. 
 Emergency Planning&nbsp;is another common&nbsp;management-level&nbsp;approach, but usually narrowly focused on the unexpected absence or loss of all general management.&nbsp; 
 IT Infrastructure and Security&nbsp;is an operational-level discipline which ensures that IT infrastructure remains available and that security is at the required level.&nbsp; 
 Supply Chain Management&nbsp;is an operational-level discipline that ensures that the supply chain is adequately&nbsp;managed, and&nbsp;should include strategies to keep it working even during a crisis, with a particular focus on the cyber supply chain, especially for digital businesses. For more on this topic, see the webcast: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve2_2020_06_02_schuetze2">Necessary Components of an Effective Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM)</a> 
 Business Resilience Management is a cross-functional and inter-disciplinary approach to align all the protective disciplines listed above to achieve the goal of resilience. 
 
<p>Business resilience is an extremely important part of day-to-day business operations, particularly as a growing number of businesses become highly IT-dependent and transform themselves into digital businesses. &nbsp;Business resilience, which includes all the other protective disciplines, is aimed at enabling a business to adapt quickly to risks and disruptions, while maintaining key business workflows and safeguarding employees, assets, and brand reputation. A Disaster Operation Plan, therefore, is an important part of business resilience, supported by all the other protective disciplines.</p>
 What to include in your Disaster Operations Plan 
<p>Disaster Operations Plans should consist of&nbsp;eight elements:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Plan Activation:&nbsp;Who activates the plan, and when? Responsibility must be clearly designated, and there should be a backup for this decision.&nbsp; 
 Crisis Management:&nbsp;Who is responsible for managing which tasks during a crisis? Who is the backup? The responsibility and accountability for all crisis-related tasks should be clearly defined.&nbsp; 
 Crisis Communication (Internally and Externally):&nbsp;Who communicates? Those responsible for communication should be clearly designated to keep the message coherent and consistent for the appropriate channels and recipients. Training in crisis communication is highly recommended. External support may be required. Don’t forget that internal communication during a crisis is&nbsp;also essential!&nbsp; 
 Crisis Organization:&nbsp;How does the organization change during a crisis? Crisis teams should address the changing role of critical departments such as management, finance, HR, production, IT, supply chain, etc. These departments may merit their own crisis teams.&nbsp; 
 Business Continuity:&nbsp;Planning for continuity during a crisis includes knowing what can be shut down or cut, and what the impact of these actions will be. This may be done on a per department basis. 
 IT Continuity:&nbsp;Draw upon existing Incident Response Management capabilities to map business functions to their IT impact, to keep as many essential systems and services running as possible, and to put processes in place for recovery. There should be some anticipation of transitions required in different crisis scenarios, such as working from home during a pandemic to ensure maximum possible business continuity and resiliency. 
 Improvement:&nbsp;Preparing for every crisis scenario is not possible, but it is always possible to learn from experience. Incorporate the experience of everyone in the organization into the rapid decision-making required in a crisis.&nbsp; 
 Return to Normal:&nbsp;Plan for how to transition from disaster operations back to normal operations. Ask questions such as what, who, how, and when, e.g. designating roles to appropriate people, identifying signals, or proposing processes. 
 
<p>As stated earlier, a Disaster Operation Plan is one of the elements contributing to business resilience, which should be the overall goal of every organization to ensure their ability to survive and thrive in an increasingly competitive, digital and sometimes hostile and unpredictable global business environment.</p>
  
 The Business Resilience Management approach to stronger organizations 
<p>Any organization that has not done so already should make business resilience the focus of everything it does, from its business model and organizational structure to IT investments and business processes. This can be done by adopting a Business Resilience Management (BRM) approach, which is the comprehensive and standardized management of all processes to identify and mitigate any risks that threaten an organization. BRM, therefore, is a cross-functional and inter-disciplinary approach that involves risk, business, and security professionals.</p>
<p>This approach underlines the importance of closer collaboration between Business Continuity and Cyber Security teams. For more on this topic, please see our Advisory Note <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/an70361">Business Continuity in the age of Cyber Attacks</a>.</p>

<p>IAM tools using artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of machine learning (ML) can address the aforementioned challenges. Such tools could take much of the complexity out of identity management, providing the ability to see and do more without requiring additional IT resources.</p>

The concept of Peter Thiel’s ZERO TO ONE is essentially about creating something truly innovative and new that takes us/society from 0=&gt;1. Compared to taking us from 1=&gt;n, which is more derivative, less about real innovation and more about optimization. <p>0=&gt;1 is adjacent to the theme of <a href="https://kunle.app/june-2020-wave-hunting.html">Ayo’s latest blog post</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">Greg</a>), which focuses on “wave hunting.” In other words, a successful startup isn’t just about good execution, it’s about solving the right problems, which in turn, amplifies good execution.</p><p>Ayo’s recent time at Square working on the Cash App (2014–2019) reinforces this experience:</p><p>I also think Square/Cash App rode (and are still riding) a few massive waves that cut across rapid technology adoption, new technologies becoming widespread that weren’t before, and discontinuous changes in the economic structure of financial services. A large domain with lots of growth and macro change is a force multiplier for strong execution. Example waves (from my time on Cash) are below, but they’re meant to be illustrative.</p><p>Ayo’s example waves regarding Square&nbsp;Cash:</p>  Time to money (moving money in the US is slow, which taxes financially vulnerable Americans living paycheck to paycheck)  Next Day ACH (Square+Stripe productized this for merchants, who typically wait up to a week before getting funds from credit card payments)  Instant Push to Debit (a Square innovation that Greg referenced during last week’s open&nbsp;mic)  Mobile &amp; impact on distribution (self explanatory)  Dodd Frank and the impact of the Durbin amendment (as expected, regulations plays a role — impacting incumbent business models and providing opportunity for challenger banks particularly when it comes to the underserved)  <p>Ayo also provides a framework for pinpointing the chillest&nbsp;waves:</p>  best case: find a large market with lots of growth and&nbsp;change.  Failing that, find a small niche with lots of&nbsp;growth  Failing that, find a large market with lots of&nbsp;change  Failing that, find a large&nbsp;market  Don’t fail&nbsp;that.  <p>It’s not hard to think about GlobaliD within that framework. At the very least, the market for identity is huge because identity touches everything and includes everyone, everywhere. Think of a larger market — I dare&nbsp;you.</p><p>And there’s plenty of arguments for why the market is experiencing heaps of growth and certainly change, accelerated by the global pandemic, underlied by a general convergence of our physical and digital&nbsp;worlds.</p><p>Even if, from a practical perspective, it makes sense to target a smaller niche — those avenues are instinctively available. And with all the incredible progress around the product and the platform, the challenge now is to pinpoint exactly what those waves&nbsp;are.</p><p>Taku and the rest of the team are already on it. And it’s where his second link comes into play — re: <a href="https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit/">a16z’s famous Product-Market Fit blog&nbsp;post</a>.</p><p>It’s also the type of challenge that requires leadership across the entire team — re: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioocNc-HvTs">Ronald Heifetz — On Leadership</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">Greg</a>)</p><p>BONUS: At the end of his piece, having shared past waves from experience, Ayo ponders potential future waves worth catchin’:</p><blockquote>A friend who’s been in Silicon Valley for a long time recently commented that a lot of the biggest opportunities left for technology are these truly large domains in the world, that software has only started to touch. He mentioned financial services and healthcare as two where software has only scratched the surface. Extending this, the others I think (all for different reasons) are logistics, freight, construction, natural resources, energy, industrials, and mining. There are probably others I’m not considering, but these are the obvious ones. When hunting waves, you’re more likely to find large, valuable ones, outside the domain of pure, traditional software.</blockquote><p>Is that a Greg Kidd reference?? (Disclaimer: pure speculation.

The big news this past week is the growing Facebook backlash, which, according to various reports, is building&nbsp;steam. <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-ad-boycott-calls-grow-louder-3db49cea-01f5-478e-a42e-5463b6087ba3.html">Axios</a> (last&nbsp;week):</p><blockquote>Calls for advertisers to boycott Facebook grew this week, amid increased scrutiny around the tech giant for the way it moderates content.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Tension between advertisers and the tech giant have existed for years, but now — as the country faces a reckoning over longstanding systemic racism — marketers feel more compelled to take a public stand against companies that waffle on filtering hate&nbsp;speech.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: The North Face, the outdoor apparel brand, became the first major marketer on Friday to announce that it is boycotting the use of Facebook advertising.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-f2ca78d3-ec72-4d0c-b733-4c4fc7857c74.html">Also Axios</a> (this&nbsp;week):</p><blockquote>The Madison Avenue boycott against Facebook has quickly grown into a worldwide movement against the content moderation policies of social media giants, Axios’ Sara Fischer&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: The initial Facebook boycott among advertisers, prompted by Facebook’s refusal to fact-check a post by President Trump, has hit a nerve among people outside of the marketing community, who think boycotting social media advertising altogether could help to create a healthier internet.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: Jim Steyer, the CEO and founder of Common Sense Media, an advocacy organization that’s part of the campaign organizing the boycott, tells Axios that the #StopHateForProfit campaign is moving its focus to marketers overseas, where many big brands spend a large portion of their marketing dollars.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/business/dealbook/facebook-boycott-ads.html">Andrew Ross&nbsp;Sorkin</a>:</p><blockquote>This is getting&nbsp;serious</blockquote><blockquote>A boycott of advertisers on social media is gaining momentum, and Facebook is the primary target. Marketers are expressing unease with how it handles misinformation and hate speech, including its permissive approach to problematic posts by President Trump.</blockquote><blockquote>Who’s doing what. The boycotts have followed a call by the advocacy group Stop Hate for Profit, which is keeping a running list of participating companies. Over the weekend, Starbucks and Diageo said they would pause advertising on all social media platforms. They’re among the biggest spenders on Facebook ads: Starbucks spent $95 million and Diageo $23 spent million on the platform last year. Other companies have boycotted Facebook specifically, including Honda America, Levi Strauss and Patagonia.</blockquote><blockquote>Who’s next? Procter &amp; Gamble, the world’s largest advertiser, said it wouldn’t rule out a pause on Facebook ads. (Its big rival, Unilever, is stopping ads on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter through the end of the year.) Big ad agencies generally take their orders from clients, but they also have leeway to steer spending to certain platforms over&nbsp;others.</blockquote><p>And let’s not forget, this is a war on multiple&nbsp;fronts:</p><blockquote>Claiming censorship by major social media platforms, many right-leaning pundits, lawmakers and others have decamped to the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/06/27/parlers-founder-explains-why-he-built-trumps-new-favorite-social-media-app/#698f71d15016">upstart network Parler</a>. That may cost Facebook some high-profile users — and an <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1275852495215042562">outsized source of engagement</a> on its platform.</blockquote><p>One of Parler’s selling points (aside from free&nbsp;speech)?</p> 3. Because privacy matters, perhaps now more than ever (and for Facebook, as we mentioned previous, as it once did). Here’s Ben Thompson on Apple’s recent announcement at WWDC on&nbsp;privacy. <p>First <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital/apples-privacy-changes-represent-tectonic-shift-digital-ad-industry/2263841">a primer from&nbsp;AdAge</a>:</p><blockquote>Apple announced new privacy changes to its upcoming iOS 14 software that will significantly hinder how media buyers and brands target, measure and find consumers. One change will make it harder for apps to track iOS users across different apps and websites. Another will make attribution — determining which tactics contribute to sales or conversions — harder for marketers.</blockquote><blockquote>The changes, announced Monday at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, apply to the company’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), which assigns a unique number to a user’s mobile device. Advertisers have access to the feature and use it in areas including ad targeting, building lookalike audiences, attribution and encouraging consumers to download&nbsp;apps.</blockquote><blockquote>IDFA is shared with app makers and advertisers by default, but that will change once iOS 14 rolls out this fall. Then, users must give explicit permission through a popup for app publishers to track them across different apps and websites, or to share that information with third&nbsp;parties.</blockquote><p>Ben’s take:</p><blockquote>Facebook was the king of the IDFA (and the Google Advertising ID equivalent on Android): it was the linchpin around which its app install business in particular was built. The company could understand when a user spent a certain amount in a game, for example, look for users that were similar, and then display an app install ad for that game, and measure how effective it was. In fact, over the last few years, Facebook has simply asked advertisers to specify what return on ad spend they are hoping to achieve, and Facebook does all of the work of figuring out how many ads to display to which users — the entire process is automated.</blockquote><blockquote>This part of the business is going to change a lot. Apple was quite clever in their approach: instead of killing the IDFA, which could be construed as anti-competitive, particularly given Apple’s expanding app install ad business (which is expanding beyond App Store search ads), Apple is simply asking users if they would like to be tracked, and letting them render the IDFA useless. Notably, Facebook has declined to even show app install advertisements to the 30% of U.S. iPhone users that turned off their IDFA of their own accord — and now it is opt-in, instead of&nbsp;opt-out.</blockquote><p>I have an iPhone. Everyone in my immediate family has an iPhone. Do you have an iPhone? These changes will clearly have a big impact on Facebook’s strategy and business&nbsp;model.</p><p>And more generally, it sort of shows where the wind is&nbsp;blowing.</p><p>Facebook is fighting a war on multiple fronts. And we haven’t even talked about antitrust yet this&nbsp;week.</p> 4. BUT. Don’t make the mistake of counting Facebook out. Facebook will evolve and it will adapt. And in fact, according to Ben, Facebook continues to be very well positioned. <p>First off, the boycott. It’s an eye-catching headline. And it certainly has the potential to move the needle. But perhaps not in the way that you might think. Let’s also not forget — we’re in the midst of a pandemic and big companies will be looking to conserve cash and get lean. As my astute (and sometimes pessimistic) friend Alan pointed out, a lot of these big companies are taking the opportunity to cut advertising while framing it as “the right thing to&nbsp;do.”</p><p>You certainly wouldn’t put it past them at the very&nbsp;least.</p><p>But also consider this: The top 100 big brand advertisers on Facebook make up only 20% of their ad revenue. The other 80% is made up of 8 million smaller advertisers.</p><p>What happens when those big advertisers drop out? The 8 million smaller guys actually UP their ad spend. It’s a market after all. Ads are cheaper and so their cost of user acquisition actually goes down. Ben <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/facebook-earnings-auction-dynamics-full-steam-ahead/">explains</a> (in a previous analysis of FB’s Q1 earnings):</p><blockquote>That first bit gets at the other thing the Wall Street Journal article got wrong: it is not simply that direct response stayed strong while brand advertising declined, but rather that Facebook actually received more direct response advertising because brand advertising declined…</blockquote><blockquote>Notice, though, what happens in a situation like the coronavirus crisis, where a segment of advertisers competing for limited inventory stop buying ads: the mobile gaming company doesn’t reduce their budget — to do so would be to kill the company! — but in fact ends up getting more efficient spend. Suddenly the clearing price for the auction to show those app install ads is $0.75 per app install; now the mobile gaming company is getting 26,667 app installs for its $20,000 spend, which results in an expected profit of&nbsp;$6,667.</blockquote><p>In other words, Facebook is very well positioned. Here’s Ben&nbsp;today:</p><blockquote>This explains why the news about large CPG companies boycotting Facebook is, from a financial perspective, simply not a big deal. Unilever’s $11.8 million in U.S. ad spend, to take one example, is replaced with the same automated efficiency that Facebook’s timeline ensures you never run out of content. Moreover, while Facebook loses some top-line revenue — in an auction-based system, less demand corresponds to lower prices — the companies that are the most likely to take advantage of those lower prices are those that would not exist without Facebook, like the direct-to-consumer companies trying to steal customers from massive conglomerates like Unilever.</blockquote><blockquote>In this way Facebook has a degree of anti-fragility that even Google lacks: so much of its business comes from the long tail of Internet-native companies that are built around Facebook from first principles, that any disruption to traditional advertisers — like the coronavirus crisis or the current boycotts — actually serves to strengthen the Facebook ecosystem at the expense of the TV-centric ecosystem of which these CPG companies are a&nbsp;part.</blockquote><p>What about Apple’s fundamental privacy changes? Ben compares it to GDPR (i.e. Facebook will be just&nbsp;fine):</p><blockquote>This part of the business is going to change a lot. Apple was quite clever in their approach: instead of killing the IDFA, which could be construed as anti-competitive, particularly given Apple’s expanding app install ad business (which is expanding beyond App Store search ads), Apple is simply asking users if they would like to be tracked, and letting them render the IDFA useless. Notably, Facebook has declined to even show app install advertisements to the 30% of U.S. iPhone users that turned off their IDFA of their own accord — and now it is opt-in, instead of&nbsp;opt-out.</blockquote><blockquote>Still, I wouldn’t count Facebook out: to the extent the company is hurt, it seems likely that the universe of 3rd-party ad tech companies that lack Facebook’s direct connection with users, both in terms of data collection and ad display, will be in far worse shape, and it is not as if the digital ecosystem — and its associated advertising — is going to disappear. Indeed, much like GDPR, the safe bet is the company with the wherewithal to make lemons out of lemonade. Notably, Apple’s alternative for app install ad campaigns, SKAdNetwork, is so limited that there is likely to be tremendous value in whatever company can create the exact sort of automated campaign creation that Facebook is already offering.</blockquote><p>The main point? Facebook is a goliath and will continue being one for quite some time, barring very aggressive antitrust measures — which isn’t something you can necessarily count out as we’ve discussed.</p><p>Via <a href="https://global.id/anej">Anej</a>:</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a6410a72-6e30-4f6d-9f5b-adaba1c1588e">Facebook executive admits to ‘trust deficit’ on call with advertisers</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/google-to-limit-how-long-it-hangs-on-to-some-data-dacd964b-d35f-417b-9696-625f6332c39f.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiospm&amp;stream=top">Google to limit how long it hangs on to some&nbsp;data</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-faces-trust-crisis-as-ad-boycott-grows-411fc2e6-cda2-4acc-9313-520d0188d8bd.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">Facebook faces trust crisis as ad boycott&nbsp;grows</a>   5.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>Many security product vendors are now offering CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) as part of their portfolio - so what is CSPM and why might you need it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In their race towards digital transformation, organizations are using cloud services to accelerate the development of new apps and improve efficiency. This provides many important business benefits but also increases the challenges of ensuring cyber-security and regulatory compliance. CSPM solutions are intended to provide a way to identify and control some of these risks.&nbsp;</p>
 
 They supplement CASBs (Cloud Access Security Brokers) which focus on SaaS to provide visibility into employees are accessing cloud services and controls of access to sanctioned cloud services. 
 CSPM provides visibility into potential vulnerabilities in the configuration of cloud services with a focus towards IaaS. 
 Cloud Access Security Brokers 
 
<p>The initial concerns over organizational use of cloud services stemmed from the use by employees of publicly available SaaS services with which they were familiar to “get the job done”. Typically, this would be to bypass organizational security controls that were perceived as obstructive or to get access to functionality lacking in organizational systems. However, this was often done without consideration of the wider risks involved. These risks include for example, the use of untrustworthy services which could expose sensitive and regulated data to leakage as well as to infection by malware. CASB solutions were developed to plug this gap. However, while CASB helps to control the use of SaaS they do not adequately cover the secure configuration of IaaS / PaaS used for DevOps.</p>
 Cloud Security Posture Management 
<p>Within organizations, the GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance) function sets the risk posture and IT Security translates this into concrete controls around the services. When IT services are delivered on-premises the responsibility for this is clear and lies within the IT organization. When IT services are delivered through the cloud the responsibility for security and compliance is shared between the cloud customer and the cloud service provider and this can lead to gaps in the customer’s controls. CSPM tools are intended to help customers to identify and plug the gaps in the customer’s controls.</p>
<p>As organizations go through digital transformation, they are adopting DevOps using IaaS / PaaS cloud services to create new applications and to modernize their existing ones. This avoids the need for capital expenditure as well as the lengthy procurement delays involved when new hardware is needed.&nbsp; In addition, some organizations are now using cloud services to back up their business-critical data. This increases the need to ensure that DevOps use of cloud services takes care of security and compliance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the major cloud service providers go to great lengths to secure the infrastructure of their environments it is up to the customer to secure their use of these services. This is often outside the skills of DevOps teams or is overlooked and this can lead to the existence of critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber-adversaries.</p>
<p>The hyper-scale CSPs such as AWS and Azure provide easy access to the capabilities needed by development teams to accelerate the creation of critical new business applications. For example, the recently announced <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/azure-services-now-run-anywhere-with-new-hybrid-capabilities-announcing-azure-arc/">Azure Arc</a> and <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80219/aws-control-tower/">AWS Control Tower</a>. However, these have typically only applied to the vendor’s own cloud services. CSPM tools claim to provide a single point from which to manage these risks across multiple clouds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;These vulnerabilities often include:</p>
 
 The customer’s administrative accounts may be poorly secured. 
 The number of resources used may not be fully understood or properly controlled by the customer. 
 Access controls on the resources may be improperly configured allowing public access. 
 Where data is stored, and workloads are run may not be properly controlled. 
 Sensitive or controlled data may be copied and even shared with third parties for testing purposes. 
 The customer’s technical stack from OS, through middleware, may be vulnerable through poor configuration and lack of patching. 
 The tools provided to secure the cloud services may not be used or incorrectly configured. 
 
 CSPM Key Capabilities 
<p>CSPM solutions should support the capabilities needed to address these challenges in a consistent way across multiple cloud services. The key focus is on identifying and protecting the in-cloud components of services delivered through IaaS / PaaS by mapping the in-cloud controls to required policies. Where there are deviations alert and remediate. Note CSPM does not in general implement the controls but rather they provide a consistent way to exploit the functionality provided by the cloud services.</p>
<p>Key capabilities include:</p>
 
 Ensure that authentication and access controls meet policies. Focus on the cloud administrators and DevOps (rather than the end-users of the hosted applications) 
 Ensure that the controls over access to cloud services and cloud resources in line with policies and access to on-premises. Focus on cloud administrators and DevOps users. 
 Policy-based definition and enforcement over who can access what data, while ensuring compliance standards are met. Focus on cloud administrators and DevOps users. 
 Prevent compromise by exploitation of application vulnerabilities through ensuring that patching and security controls meet policy. 
 Track and enforce in-cloud network configurations to meet policy. 
 Manage in-cloud VM operating systems, storage solutions, and related systems to comply with the policy to prevent unpatched vulnerabilities and ensure best practice. 
 Manage container-based workloads to ensure compliance with policies and best practices in the same way as for other delivery models. 
 Out of the box policies that support major compliance needs and security frameworks such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST, PCI-DSS, GDPR, CCPA etc. 
 
<p>Digital transformation is driving the use of cloud services and DevOps is the engine that enables business growth. Risk and compliance management see the use of cloud services and rapid development as factors that increase the risks of compliance failure and business risks following cyber-attacks. CSPM tools help organizations to ensure the secure and compliant use of IaaS clouds for their digital transformation.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of 2020, IDnow notices an enormous increase in transactions with the AI-based solution AutoIdent. From January to June a volume increase of over 1000% was recorded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The customer base covers a wide range of different industries – insurance, banking, mobility, cryptographic currency platforms, and telecommunications. The use cases within these industries are just as diverse: new business models, security maximization, digitalization, and much more.</p>
<p>Best-in-class fraud prevention.</p>
<p>The advancement of a biometric system is measured by the False Acceptance Rate. This is a specific key performance indicator that measures false acceptances with a biometric security system. It tracks and evaluates the precision of a biometric system, and therefore determines the rate at which unauthorized users are verified on the system.</p>
<p>Current regulations require a biometric system for governmental use to have a FAR of below 0.1%. AI-powered solutions are able to outperform even these very high requirements. IDnow AutoIdent, for example, has a FAR of only 0.05%. So, trust in AI-powered solutions definitely is warranted.</p>

<br>
Today, in this second installment of the two-part blog series, we continue down the example path of our open banking GraphQL service and introduce another layer of authorization: user privacy management and enforcement. In order to implement this, we will introduce a data governance layer to apply dynamic user privacy preferences and fine-grained access control for our GraphQL service.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/schuetze">Christopher Schuetze</a></p><p>Modern and hybrid operating models, Software-as-a-Service, regulatory requirements, working from home, various types of internal and external users, and the phenomenon of BYOD (bring your own device) are challenges we have to face today. Such challenges are constantly emerging, which demands a flexible approach. Often these flexible requirements result in many specific sub-solutions for particular problems. This causes the company to have no central overview of which services, which devices, and which applications are used and for what purpose.</p>
<p>To challenge the internal IT teams even further, we have a professional cyber-crime industry. These people try to steal data or to blackmail organizations, based on existing gaps in systems, applications, processes, and protection mechanisms.</p>
 Connect and manage everything – Security must not have gaps 
<p>The goal of every company must be to contain and structure this uncontrolled growth. An open architecture that meets future requirements must be at the forefront of enterprise security efforts. KuppingerCole has developed the Security Fabric for this purpose. It is based on the experience gained from consultancy work at numerous international companies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>KuppingerCole’s Security Fabric – Connect Everything</p>
<p>The KuppingerCole Security Fabric connects all types of identities to access devices, data, applications, systems, and networks. The goal is to achieve consistent security from end to end for everything. The most important point is that no access is unmanaged or ungoverned. At the center of the Security Fabric are five core topics that a well-defined Security Architecture must include:</p>
 
 Govern and Manage – Security Frameworks, Risk Assessment and Asset Classification and general IT Risk Management are the core components here. Governance and Security Management must be ensured. 
 Protect – Spans from Data Security to Enterprise Information Protection to Network Security and Malware Protection. The purpose of these Building Blocks is to protect Data, Applications, Systems, Networks and End Points. 
 Detect – The objective is to detect potential attacks by using various monitoring and Security Intelligence mechanisms. Usually, this is implemented by a Security Operation Center or Cyber Defense Center. 
 Respond – Determining what to do in response to a cyber-attack is an essential part of a comprehensive Cybersecurity approach. Incident Response Planning and Processes are fundamental pre-defined processes to ensure all stakeholders know what to do in response to an incident. 
 Recover – It is mandatory to develop the ability to recover from an incident and to have some flexibility enabled by Operational Resilience. Business Continuity Management helps organizations to keep some of their core services running – even when they are actively under attack. 
 
 Using a fabric concept helps to organize and structure capabilities and services 
<p>The Security Fabric is not a concrete product or service. It is a toolset and paradigm to define the right building blocks, to bundle them within capabilities, and to define services such as a “Protection and Detection Service” or a “Respond Service”. These services are the foundation of the organization’s IT Security. Applications must integrate into the Security Fabric to benefit from advanced, central, and modern security concepts. This method also helps security organizations to have a central approach and overview.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>KuppingerCole’s Security Fabric – A set of services</p>
<p>A key benefit of the Security Fabric is to maintain an overview of the zoo of applications and services that run within an organization. The fabric helps to structure the existing services, show the gaps and reveal the existence of duplicated services. This helps to improve the general portfolio, to optimize technology investments, and to improve security on a continual basis.</p>
 Security Fabrics improve cybersecurity and flexibility 
<p>Some things to look for when choosing your Security Fabric:</p>
 
 An open, integrated and extendable architecture is the standard for the Security Fabric to meet today's requirements and be open for those of tomorrow. It should support different deployment models with identical capabilities, whether on-premises or as a service. 
 
 
 With dynamic orchestration and intelligence capabilities at the core, it should provide you with the flexibility and agility you need to build new digital services or integrate with legacy systems. 
 Pay attention to building up a reliable toolset that can be fully integrated and easily extended by new services to fulfill future requirements. 
 
<p>Having a Security Fabric in place helps organizations improve their portfolio, their spending, and their cybersecurity because this takes a business-centric view of the things you really need. KuppingerCole provides specialized support to help organizations to improve their security as well as their security architecture by using the Security Fabric.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tib.eu/en/">TIB — Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology</a>&nbsp;and Jolocom have jointly applied for an EU grant under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">Next Generation Internet</a>&nbsp;initiative for Human Centric Solutions. The project is named ConDIDi — Conference Digital Identifier Integration — and the aim is to use SSI technology to make it easier for conference organizers and participants alike to track credentials and reputation, while automatizing data protection &amp; privacy and facilitating interoperability across global academic identification systems.</p>



 The challenges of academic conferencing 



<p>In the scientific community one of the most important assets an individual or an institution can possess is a good reputation. Professional reputations are often built up via publication numbers and garnered in peer review.</p>



<p>Academic conferences play a vital role in enabling and promoting peer review, while also providing the foundations for future publications via conference proceedings. Proper conference management is therefore crucial for the academic community.</p>



<p>However, due to limited funding and staffing, very often the management and participants of a conference have to contend with various delays, cancellations, misalignments, and even occasional failures to provide information — be that before, during or after a conference. Particularly where the time after a conference is concerned, the lack or delay of publicly shareable professional credentials (such as proof of participation or a publication) can have significant consequences and unfavorable repercussions in the academic sphere (e.g. for the career tracks of individuals or funding opportunities for individuals or departments).</p>



<p>For organizations which host conferences and event facilitators, keeping track of participants and providing subsequent services (e.g. provisioning proofs of participation, vetting presenters, ensuring panel diversity, collecting attendee information and confirmations) can be a resource-draining process. Smaller departments are often led to foregoing conference hosting despite high-quality content.</p>



<p>These challenges serve to exacerbate the problem of non-diversity and unintentional glass ceilings due to lack of information on participants or due to infrastructural bias towards established conferences or organizations.</p>



 Full lifecycle conference credentials 



<p>ConDIDi seeks to reduce the management burden on both parties by providing solutions which equip participants with technology for Self-sovereign Identity, like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials, for their participation at academic conferences. Automatizing the process of verifying that participants have fulfilled requisite criteria (e.g. have paid their participation fees, satisfied requirements for paper submission, agreed to chair a panel, checked into the venue, etc.) would reduce a large part of the bureaucratic and time-consuming overhead of conference management.</p>







<p>At the same time, traditional uncertainties and demand for further assistance from conference management can be minimized if participants were able to automatically receive proof of their participation and relevant participation information (e.g. the participant’s role as presenter, chair, author in a pending publication, etc.), and also share those documents with third parties. Additionally, it will become easier for third parties (e.g. university hiring committees, publishing houses, head-hunters, external conference speaker selection committees) to find and verify the reputation of individual academics based on specific criteria.</p>



 TIB and Jolocom 



<p>TIB, based in Hannover, is one of the pillars of the German academic community and has already gained international recognition for leading the German ORCID consortium (a global system for identifying academic authors, independent of name duplications or differing naming conventions based on language) and ConfIDent (a pilot project to catalogue academic conferences and afford greater visibility to small or newly-established conference events) — two projects among many to establish globally verifiable IDs for academic personnel and conferences and thereby increase transparency and equity within the field.</p>



<p>Jolocom is a leading steward of SSI in Europe with a long-term commitment to open source and open standards. We will bring our full tech stack for SSI (including library, SDK, SSI protocol and Jolocom SmartWallet end-user application), as well as technical expertise and a production-ready SSI wallet to ConDIDi, with the express goal of accelerating the deployment of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials, ensuring the interoperability of available solutions and increasing the self-sovereignty of users.</p>



  



<p>TIB and Jolocom have both been early adopters and pioneers of Distributed Ledger Technologies and the Web 3.0 approach in Germany. Multiple encounters within the DLT community have led to a growing interest in joining forces on behalf of open standards, open access, and interoperability. The chance to build a human-centric solution that implements the Self-sovereign Identity approach in the academic sector, while also increasing global collaboration and interoperability due to the gradual integration of different solutions (ORCID, ConfIDent, ConDIDi) into one system, were the deciding factor in jointly applying for the NGI LEDGER grant.</p>



 What’s next for ConDIDi? 



<p>The ConDIDi project was selected out of 300+ applying projects for the shortlist in March, and went on to be&nbsp;<a href="https://ledgerproject.eu/index.php/2020/05/26/ledger-has-selected-16-human-centric-projects-working-on-decentralised-technologies-to-enter-its-2nd-round-of-the-venture-builder-programme/">chosen as one of sixteen project</a>s to receive official funding. In July the project will begin working toward developing a market-ready MVP as the acceleration program commences.</p>



<p><a href="https://ledgerproject.eu/">LEDGER EU</a>&nbsp;and the NGI initiative will support both the development of a sustainable business model, as well as ensuring that the technical development stays on schedule and delivers a working solution. After the 12-month program, three of the 16 grantees will be selected for additional funding to support market introduction and dissemination of the solution.</p>



<p>Funds granted within the LEDGER project come from the H2020 Programme. The Next Generation Internet initiative is part of the Digital Single Market efforts of the EU Commission.</p>

<p>&nbsp;IDnow increases its growth with the AI-based solution AutoIdent tenfold in the first two quarters</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, June 24th, 2020 – IDnow (www.idnow.io), a leading provider of Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions, sees strong volume growth for its artificial intelligence-based solution. Transactions via IDnow AutoIdent have increased tenfold in the first two quarters of 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2018, IDnow’s AutoIdent has grown from strength to strength and expanded into new industries. In 2020 IDnow sees an exponential growth in volume. From January to June, an increase of over 1000% in the number of transactions was recorded. The customer base covers a wide range of different industries: insurance, banking, mobility, cryptographic currency platforms and telecommunications. The reasons are equally diverse: new business models, security maximisation, digitalisation – companies are increasingly turning to secure and efficient solutions.</p>
<p>“Identity verification in general, but especially AI-based products such as AutoIdent, have great growth potential – particularly in the current crisis, where digital products are in greater demand than ever before. Digitalisation must now move faster, and many new use cases – that have been performed with personal interaction – now require efficient digital products like AutoIdent. With short setup times and easy integration of a single API, this is the perfect product to be secure and compliant on the one hand, and to allow fast and easy onboarding without personal interaction on the other hand,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>
<p>“AutoIdent has a huge international potential, especially due to the rapidly advancing digitalisation in many industries and the resounding success of FinTechs and InsureTechs, the demand for simple, lean solutions is growing. Whether in banking, mobility, telecommunications or economy platform sharing, everyone is interested in a fast, seamless and secure onboarding process that increases conversion rates and customer satisfaction while providing the highest level of security,” Andreas Bodczek continues.</p>
<p>AutoIdent’s artificial intelligence uses the smartphone’s camera, to recognise the country and type of ID document without the need for user input. The technology then captures the machine-readable part of the ID document as well as non-machine-readable areas, such as address fields. In the next step, the artificial intelligence automatically checks the optical security features of the ID documents, such as holograms. With the subsequent biometric video check of the person and “liveness detection”, the identification process is completed for the customer within a few steps. On the basis of the recorded data, the system is able to decide whether the identification is valid, with a reliability that far exceeds the legal requirements.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology guarantee the highest quality and accuracy in identification verification. Furthermore, the IDnow process relies on a hybrid approach that optimally combines the advantages of man and machine. In special cases, the AI is supported by a human identity specialist who acts as an additional verification and security level.</p>

  <p>In the digital era, the rapid rate of change in business, IT and regulatory environments is continually accelerating, making it extremely challenging for organizations to keep pace in terms of their governance, risk and compliance (GRC) capability without the right mindset and tools.&nbsp;The complexity and technical nature of access controls in SAP and other business applications, makes the GRC challenge even greater.</p>
<p>The added complexity of many GRC solutions means that organizations struggle with a lack of business buy-in and accountability for access-related risk.&nbsp;A more agile approach to aligning access entitlements with business roles and adapting to new requirements is needed by GRC practitioners in the face of accelerating change and complexity.</p>
<p>This KuppingerCole webinar covers:</p>
 
 Market trends in Access Control and GRC tools 
 Access Control and GRC challenges for SAP customers 
 Aligning business needs with SAP technical specifications 
 How SAP customers can get value out of GRC investments

<p>Digital Identity to help reduce fraud for credit unions and members&nbsp;</p>
<p>June XX,&nbsp;2020 (DENVER, Colo.) –&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://mwcua.com/">Mountain West Credit Union Association</a>&nbsp;(MWCUA) has finalized a strategic partnership agreement with&nbsp;CULedger to help jump-start the implementation of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass</a>, a digital&nbsp;ID&nbsp;held by credit union members. MWCUA will help secure credit unions to participate in the Digital Trust Registry, the registration component of the program. MWCUA currently has 123 credit unions, 3.8 million members and $51 billion in assets in three states, Colorado, Arizona, and Wyoming. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In MemberPass, credit unions have a turnkey, affordable digital identity solution that will safeguard members’ personal information and provide a touch-free member experience across all channels.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is a simple and secure replacement for identity verification questions, like the member’s birthday or social security number, making members’ experience convenient and stress-free.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also presents an opportunity for your credit union to reduce identity theft by giving control and ownership of personal data back in the hands of your members allowing them the right to share information, how, and where they choose. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“MemberPass,&nbsp;from&nbsp;CULedger, creates for credit unions a contactless and secure environment that members now need and want in the face of the pandemic and other challenges,” said Scott Earl, President, and CEO of the Mountain West Credit Union Association. “We are thrilled to help bring this incredibly valuable solution that provides a secure digital ID to members and protects credit unions from fraud to market.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Digital Trust Registry allows credit unions access to MemberPass technology. Credit unions receive their own public digital ID that is written to the Sovrin&nbsp;Global Identity Network (www.sovrin.org).&nbsp;Sovrin&nbsp;is a global distributed ledger (or blockchain) designed exclusively to support digital trust networks and verifiable digital credentials, which is why&nbsp;Sovrin&nbsp;is&nbsp;CULedger’s&nbsp;partner in building the MemberPass Trust Network. Once registered with the Digital Trust Registry, credit unions can issue MemberPass credentials to their members, and the enhanced security and privacy elements are activated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MWCUA will join other partners in engaging credit unions in joining the Digital Trust Registry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unique privacy-first design creates a competitive advantage for credit unions by allowing members to have one single digital credential that is both portable and interoperable.&nbsp;CULedger’s&nbsp;long-term goal is to enable members to use their MemberPass identification to verify who they are with other highly regulated institutions, including in government and healthcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everything you need to know about zero-trust security, and why you need zero-trust passwordless authentication like&nbsp;Keyless</p><p>Zero-trust models are a radically different approach to network security that can help companies strengthen security and eliminate cyberthreats.</p><p>At Keyless we’re helping enterprises transition to zero-trust security architectures with our breakthrough biometric authentication technology.</p><p>In this piece we’ll&nbsp;cover:</p>  The difference between trust-based and zero-trust security  How to implement zero-trust security  The Keyless solution: zero-knowledge biometrics   Trust vs Zero-Trust <p>Perimeter-based network security models, like firewalls and VPNs, automatically trust users who are inside the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Unfortunately, this approach leaves organizations susceptible to threats launched from within the network; while also failing to protect against incoming threats when systems are being accessed remotely.</p><p>Recent work-from-home orders are highlighting security flaws with the perimeter-based network security approach.</p><p>With the rapid rise of users accessing an organization’s systems remotely, (from outside the security perimeters of corporate firewalls), the chances of a successful breach have increased sharply.</p><p>Since legacy security systems rely on trust, once a hacker gains access to a network, they’re then able to freely move throughout the network until finding sensitive data.</p><p>Malicious attacks aren’t the only issue with legacy security systems. Trust-based models leave organizations susceptible to insider-orchestrated attacks and data&nbsp;leaks.</p><p>Thus the assumption of trust is fundamentally flawed, leaving systems vulnerable to an ever-increasing number of sophisticated attacks. As the classic saying goes “if it can get hacked, it&nbsp;will”.</p><p>With the growing threat of attacks, this is essentially true for all systems that store sensitive data and fail to adequately protect it. Zero-trust models can help organizations restore security and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Read more about why traditional security models are ineffective here.</p> What is zero trust security? <p>First coined a decade ago by an analyst at Forrester Research, zero-trust security models assume that all devices and users can’t be trusted. This assumption carries through after a user has initially gained access to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Based on this assumption that a user cannot be trusted, zero-trust models continuously verify and authenticate users no matter where, when and how they access a&nbsp;system.</p><p>This protects organizations by preventing unauthorized movement within a network’s systems. As such, zero-trust security models protect organizations from the reputational, legal and operational costs associated with large-scale data breaches.</p><p>With cyberthreats increasing in sophistication and scale, zero-trust models can help transform security architectures and protect enterprises by offering new levels of protection, helping to ease the transition into a digital future where remote-work is commonplace.</p> How to implement zero-trust security within your organization <p>As the global workforce moves online, enterprises need authentication solutions that are not only secure, but dynamic and user-friendly at the same&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>We believe that modern access management is about the right people, having the right level of access at the right time, with the least amount of friction as possible.</blockquote><p>The first step towards implementing a zero-trust security architecture should be to adopt secure passwordless authentication. The second would be to implement access controls at every entry point to an organization’s private systems and databases.</p><p>Access controls can be used to prevent lateral movement throughout the network, while ensuring that only privileged users have access to sensitive databases and private resources.</p><p>By establishing trust, (via re-authenticating), as the user moves through the network, zero-trust authentication prevents malicious actors from being able to launch large-scale attacks.</p><p>The zero-trust model also prevents unauthorized users or employees from accessing data that they shouldn’t have access&nbsp;to.</p> The Keyless solution: zero-knowledge biometrics <p>At Keyless, we combine multi-modal biometrics with privacy-enhancing cryptography with biometrics and state-of-the-art anti-spoofing technology to enable a passwordless, phishing-proof way to authenticate users, leveraging a zero-trust framework.</p><p>In doing so, we are able to offer seamless, ‘onelook’, multi-factor authentication for end-users and employees, across all platforms and&nbsp;devices.</p><p>Our solution offers strong multi-factor security, by&nbsp;design:</p>  For the first authentication factor, Keyless verifies users are accessing from a trusted device. If a device is not registered, the user won’t be able to authenticate  For the second authentication factor, Keyless uses facial biometrics to verify users across every touchpoint — a universal inherence factor as an added level of&nbsp;security  Soon, Keyless will involve behavioral biometrics, which serves as another, transparent third factor — across platforms and&nbsp;devices  <p>In other words, users seamlessly authenticate simply by looking into the camera of their registered device. Our network verifies users in less than 100 milliseconds, less time than it takes to type out an email address and password.</p><p>By providing a secure, frictionless way to establish access controls at multiple entry-points, Keyless prevents unauthorized movement through private corporate systems.</p><p>This protects organizations from a range of threats inside the network, like malicious takeovers, insider attacks and data&nbsp;leaks.</p><p>To protect end-users and organizations from other kinds of malicious attacks, like fraudulent attempts to replicate a user’s biometrics, Keyless uses advanced liveness detection and anti-spoofing techniques to ensure that the user is in fact&nbsp;real.</p> Is Keyless the right fit for your organization?   Nothing to remember: Keyless offers passwordless multi-factor authentication with just one look, across all platforms and&nbsp;devices.  Nothing to steal: Keyless relieves organizations from having to store and thus protect and manage user’s biometrics and sensitive authentication data — with nothing to hack, there is nothing to&nbsp;steal.  Enroll once, use everywhere: Keyless is compatible with all devices and systems. This is especially important as we transition to a remote working environment where employees will access networks from their personal&nbsp;devices.  Privacy compliant: Keyless does not store or process personal identifiable information, which helps businesses comply with privacy regulations even as regulations change over time and across jurisdictions.  Built-in anti-fraud protection: Keyless embeds phishing-proof technology and behavioral authentication to minimize the risk of account takeover, phishing, and credential stuffing.

  <p>In his Opening Keynote, Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, will talk about the practical consequences of having a “cloud first” strategy in place. Declaring such a strategy is simple. Successfully executing it is the bigger beast to tame.&nbsp;Martin Kuppinger will look at the success factors for executing a “cloud first” strategy and identify what it needs in the organization, operations, integration, vendor selection, risk assessment, management, security, and identity.&nbsp;He also will look at the various levels of such cloud first strategies, from full multi-tenant public cloud to basic “lift &amp; shift”, as well as the interoperability with the remaining on-premises infrastructure as well as the role Edge Computing will play in future.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve3_2020_06_16_kuppinger"></a>

While the benefits of migrating to cloud are well known, the journey to cloud comes with its own challenges and risks. If not planned properly, this can cause major headaches on the way. The session covers the benefits of a proper cloud strategy, how to set up a cloud journey and the risks that one must be ready to manage on the way.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve3_2020_06_16_rastogi"></a>

<p>Electronic signatures are not a new occurrence. However, under the current circumstances, the value of signing documents online is higher than ever.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The demand for electronic signatures has increased drastically in the last months. Many companies are currently restructuring existing manual processes. Digital signatures such as IDnow eSign make it possible to conclude contracts online in a few minutes without the need for additional hardware. Instead of the required handwritten signature, a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) is created, which has the same legal value.</p>
<p>In addition to high conversion rates, maximum security, and legal conformity, the electronic signature also offers numerous advantages for the end-user. They can conclude a contract within a few minutes, be geographically flexible and without direct, physical contact with an employee, and use the corresponding service immediately. For example, a loan application can be concluded in a few short moments without being harbored by location or direct contact limitations.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Several major players in the facial recognition market – IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft – have halted all sales of facial recognition technology (FRT) to police departments in the United States. Each of these companies made a statement regarding technology’s relationship to public safety.</p>
<p>IBM CEO Arvind Kirshna sent an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/facial-recognition-susset-racial-justice-reforms/" title="IBM CEO Arvind Kirshna's open letter">open letter</a> to several US Senators and House Representatives, stating “IBM no longer offers general purpose IBM facial recognition or analysis software. IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology…for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms…”</p>
<p>Amazon’s <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/policy/we-are-implementing-a-one-year-moratorium-on-police-use-of-rekognition" title="Amazon's corporate blog">corporate blog</a> states that “We’re implementing a one-year moratorium on police use of Amazon’s facial recognition technology.”</p>
<p>Microsoft President <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/GetUrlReputation" title="Brad Smith">Brad Smith</a> said, “We will not sell facial-recognition technology to police departments in the United States until we have a national law in place, grounded in human rights, that will govern this technology.”</p>
 Separating Use of Facial Recognition Technology for Law Enforcement from Other Use Cases 
<p>Each of these statements are backed by a longer and more nuanced explanation by each company. But this leaves many questioning the biometric authentication methods that they use to unlock their phones, or the detection technology on many social media platforms that recognizes faces in photos. Users should remember “facial recognition” is a generic term that is often used to describe dissimilar technologies. These different technologies can be more accurately described as separate categories of facial recognition technology:</p>
<p>Facial Matching is the technology that IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft are most likely referring to, as it has the most applicability to surveillance and identifying a previously unknown suspect. Facial Matching is a one-to-many approach that allows the user of a matching system to input a photo or video footage and discover the identity of someone previously unknown by finding a match in a database of many faces. Facial Authentication requires positive identification of an individual, meaning that the user already knows who the input photo or footage belongs to, but must show proof that the input data is who the user says it is. This one-to-one authentication has vastly different implications for law enforcement and the potential rise of mass surveillance for public safety.</p>
 Potential Upcoming Legislation on Facial Recognition 
<p>Legislation for facial recognition technology is in the pipeline, both in the EU and US. In February 2020, the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2261" title="Assembly Bill 2261">Assembly Bill 2261</a> was introduced in California that would add a section relevant to facial recognition to the CCPA. The general summary of this bill that individuals must give consent to having their facial data collected, and once that data is collected then individuals must have protected rights to knowledge, erasure, etc. This operates on the assumption that collection of data is acceptable or inevitable. The bill prescribes that data processors must make available the technical capacity to independently test for bias and unfair performance differences of facial recognition technology. Data controllers must provide “conspicuous and contextually appropriate notice” anytime a facial recognition service is used in a public space, and must include the purpose it is used for. Consent from an individual to enroll their face in a facial recognition service is required for all purposes except security or safety purposes. Given the current public sentiment towards police, is possible that the bill will not pass into law.</p>
<p>Current EU data protection rules and the Law Enforcement Directive do not permit biometric data, including facial images, to be processed for identifying an individual in the one-to-many approach, except for reasons of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/commission-white-paper-artificial-intelligence-feb2020_en.pdf" title="substantial public interest">substantial public interest</a>. The Commission is still discussing the intersection of AI and facial recognition technology with the appropriate use of biometric data, and has no official statements as of yet. Since 2017, police departments in Germany, France, and the UK have piloted facial recognition in the field and with volunteers. It was determined that in France and Germany, the technologies piloted could not be legally used <a href="https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2019-facial-recognition-technology-focus-paper-1_en.pdf" title="test setting">outside of a test setting</a>.</p>
 Impacts for Business 
<p>The sweeping statements made by industry leaders pose a risk that facial recognition technologies will lose public favor. The distinction between authentication, detection, and identification services is not yet clear in the public sphere, and the public sector is not moving quickly enough to address general concerns of safety and human rights violations. It is the role of the public sector to initiate legislation, but it still relies on private companies to develop or procure technologies. As usual, it is the private sector that drives progress on facial recognition by continuing to bring solutions to the market, and should strive to protect fundamental human rights when doing so.</p>

<p>Civic Wallet Offers Verified Digital Identity and the Ability to Send Money to Friends Globally,&nbsp;All Covered by a $1 Million Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee</p>



<p>New Health Key by Civic Will Bring Health Verification to Large Companies&nbsp;In Partnership with Circle Medical</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO (June 16, 2020) — Civic Technologies, a leading innovator in digital identity solutions, today announced that Civic Wallet, previously only available in private beta, is now generally available in the App Store and Google Play. Civic Wallet offers a safer way to store and transact with digital identity and currency around the world. Civic also announced that in response to the market need for proof-of-health verification, it will offer the ability to provide secure and regulation-compliant health checks for employers, called Health Key by Civic.</p>



<p>“We built Civic Wallet because we wanted to be the first company to get it right for the consumer,” said Vinny Lingham, CEO and co-founder of Civic. “By design, Civic Wallet puts you back in the driver’s seat with more control over your digital identity and money with no more seed phrases or passwords to remember. And, we’re looking forward to offering proof-of-health verification as a new, privacy-focused element of your digital identity.”</p>



<p>Civic Wallet offers an easy way to pay friends and family around the world. Civic Wallet holders&nbsp; are able to send and receive funds to usernames, addresses and even to QR codes after creating a verified identity. Digital currency, including BTC, ETH, USDC and CVC, may be sent globally with low fees for a limited time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Civic Wallet holders can immediately bring in their digital currency and start protecting it with the company’s $1 Million Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee†, provided by Coincover and insured by Lloyd’s of London underwriters. All verified Civic Wallets are automatically covered by this protection. This means their digital currency is protected with account and key recovery.</p>



<p>Because Civic Wallet is non-custodial and multisig, users not only have more control over their digital identities and currency, they may also easily restore their account if they lose their phone.</p>



<p>In the event that a user loses access to their Civic Wallet, Civic will work together with its partners to recover access to a user’s funds by moving them to a new account.</p>



<p>About Health Key by Civic</p>



<p>Civic also announced proof-of-health verification for companies with more than 500 employees, called Health Key by Civic. Proof-of-health information will be accessible through Civic Wallet. Civic’s partner, Circle Medical, will supply testing for interested San Francisco Bay Area companies and additional regional testing partners will be coming online to support customers in other locales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As healthcare providers, we are always looking out for the safety of our patients, including protecting their information and privacy,” said George Favvas, co-founder and CEO of Circle Medical. “Civic is not only compliant from a regulatory standpoint, but they are also deeply committed to doing what’s right for their users.”</p>



<p>When a user signs up with Civic Wallet, they are authenticated as a real person, using both AI and blockchain-based technology. Once verified, Civic Wallet holders have more control over the information they share with third parties. For example, Civic Wallet users may share their Health Key but not provide their name or address to a requesting company.</p>



<p>Civic Wallet is built to protect personally identifiable information (PII), and no PII is stored directly on a blockchain, only an attestation of the information. This is one of several layers of protection designed to shield Civic Wallet holders from bad actors. Civic Wallet is also built to comply with international GDPR and CCPA data privacy regulations.&nbsp;</p>

However, the onset of digital transformation has driven a need for faster, cost-effective innovation and with it the increased utilization of third-party resources. Consequently, organizations have a greater need to manage third-party access to data, systems, and facilities. This includes contractors, vendors but also partners, affiliates, volunteers, and even service accounts and bots. Modern organizations are much more collaborative and open structures than those of even just a few years ago and continue to change.

<p>Welcome to this week’s round-up of the latest data breaches, leaks, and privacy intrusions. This week: Honda operations halted in the wake of a major ransomware attack, a data breach at the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, and concerns about SIM-swapping attacks following a hack at Coinsquare.</p> Honda Operations Halted Following Major Ransomware Attack <p>On Tuesday, Honda operations around the globe were halted after the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/honda-ransomware-snake/">hit by a ransomware attack</a> that affected production, sales, and development. Reports indicate that “Snake” ransomware was most likely used to encrypt files and hold them for ransom. The attack affected the company’s ability to access internal systems and impacted production outside of Japan, including operations in the UK, United States, Turkey, and Italy.</p><p>"Honda can confirm that a cyber-attack has taken place on the Honda network. Work is being undertaken to minimize the impact and to restore full functionality of production, sales and development activities,” Honda <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52982427?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bbbc.news.twitter%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D&amp;at_medium=custom7&amp;at_custom1=%5Bpost+type%5D&amp;at_custom3=%40BBCTech&amp;at_custom2=twitter&amp;at_custom4=FFF504CC-AA52-11EA-B622-1CC34744363C&amp;at_campaign=64">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>Snake ransomware is usually used to target industrial control systems. Once inside a network, Snake ransomware can wreak havoc and shut down systems until the ransom is paid. According to the company, there have been no signs of data being compromised and production has resumed at most plants.</p><blockquote><p>At this time Honda Customer Service and Honda Financial Services are experiencing technical difficulties and are unavailable. We are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>— Honda Automobile Customer Service (@HondaCustSvc) <a href="https://twitter.com/HondaCustSvc/status/1270048801307234304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2020</a></blockquote> <p></p><p>Ransomware attacks have grown ubiquitous, plaguing cities, hospitals, and businesses and forcing victims to dole out thousands of dollars in ransom, usually paid out in cryptocurrency. In January, Travelex, the world’s largest foreign exchange bureau, was <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/twidb-travelex-ransomware-attack/">held ransom for $6 million</a> by hackers in an attack that shut down all of its airport exchange kiosks. A few months earlier, a <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/this-week-in-data-breaches-credit-karma/">coordinated ransomware attack</a> in Texas took down IT systems across almost two dozen towns.</p> Customers Exposed in Coincheck Data Breach <p>Coincheck, a large Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-coincheck-victim-domain-data-breach">suffered a data breach</a>. Hackers gained unauthorized access to the company’s domain registration account and then used that access to send emails to customers asking for information. Some 200 customers replied to the fraudulent emails, exposing their names, addresses, phone numbers, and ID documents, information that can be used to commit identity fraud.</p><p>In effect, the breach served as the basis for a sophisticated phishing attack. “Due to this event, a third party who made unauthorized access...fraudulently sent some emails from our customers during the period from May 31 to June 1, 2020...we have also asked the domain registration service operator to investigate, and we will promptly inform you when new information is discovered in the future,” the company said <a href="https://corporate.coincheck.com/2020/06/02/97.html">in a statement</a>. Although no customer funds were impacted, Coincheck has suspended crypto remittances indefinitely.</p><p>This isn’t the first time that Coincheck has been hacked. In January 2018, 500 million NEM tokens were stolen from the exchange. Following the hack, Japan’s financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency, ordered Coincheck to improve its security practices and the company eventually repaid all affected customers.</p> Stolen Coinsquare Data Being Used for SIM-Swapping Attacks <p>According to a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/n7wnvb/hackers-coinsquare-data-bitcoin-sim-swapping">report by Motherboard</a>, hackers who stole data from Coinsquare are planning on performing SIM-swapping attacks using the information. The stolen data includes over 5,000 email addresses, phone numbers, and home addresses stolen from Coinsquare, a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange.</p><p>Coinsquare maintains that the information was stolen from a third-party, not directly from the exchange itself. Regardless of how the data was exposed, it now poses a risk to customers. Reports of SIM-swapping attacks have become increasingly common, from a string of Instagram account takeovers to a handful of victims who have had their <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5bpg7/sim-hijacking-t-mobile-stories">checking accounts drained</a>. SIM-swapping is used by identity thieves and fraudsters to take control of phone numbers in order to gain unauthorized access to accounts that use SMS-based two-factor authentication.</p><p>How does it work? First, a fraudster contacts a mobile carrier’s customer support and tricks them into transferring someone else’s phone number to a SIM-card that they control. This allows the attacker to intercept two-factor authentication codes and gain unauthorized access to the victim’s online accounts. Once they have access to important accounts, they can steal more personal data or money.</p><p>To learn how to protect yourself from SIM-swapping attacks, check out our <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/how-to-protect-your-phone-from-being-hacked/#protect-against-sim-swapping">guide to protecting your phone from hackers</a>.</p> Check out more of our in-depth security and privacy guides:   <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/how-to-protect-your-privacy-online/">How to Protect Your Privacy</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/how-to-protect-your-identity/">How to Protect Your Identity</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/ultimate-guide-to-data-breaches-and-identity-theft/">The Ultimate Guide to Data Breaches</a>   Bloom: Your Data, Your Credit, Your Privacy <p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all in one simple app. No more centralized data storage.

<p>UK demand for IDnow, a German identity verification startup, grows with BP, Macropay and UK government the latest to explore AI and video identity software</p>
 London and Munich, June, 9th 2020, IDnow, a fast growing European identity verification provider, is in talks with the UK government about creating “immunity passports” for people who have recovered from COVID-19. 
<p>The deal could see IDnow’s technology used to determine how recently someone has been tested and whether they can return to work. The use of video identity verification software will firstly confirm the document that the person is using is valid and, secondly will enable a short interview to be conducted with the person.</p>
<p>IDnow, which is headquartered in Munich, Germany, provides AI-based technology that can check all security features on ID documents, enabling the identities of more than seven billion customers from 193 different countries to be verified.</p>
<p>Roger Tyrzyk, Head of Sales UK/I at IDnow, comments: “Identity verification is now a high growth market – especially during the current crisis when digital products are in higher demand than ever before. The current requirements from the UK government allows us to play to our strengths in creating innovative technology to support this vital strategy. The impact of the current pandemic has shown the important role digital identity verification can play in helping the UK get back on its feet.</p>
<p>“We expect a new normal after the pandemic, so anticipate further growth as people adjust to the new digital ways of working and living. In fact, it will soon become the norm in all kinds of different industries as they look to use secure video base identity verification products to onboard customers or to perform electronic signatures.”</p>
<p>Since launching its solutions in the UK in November last year, IDnow has also seen enormous demand from organisations for its AI-based product AutoIdent that can check all security features on ID documents. In particular, it has seen increased demand from regulated sectors such as finance and gaming. As these industries face increased regulatory pressure, IDnow’s expert knowledge of German regulation, which is considered one of the most highly regulated markets globally, has become critical.</p>
<p>“Thanks to the reliability of our German technology and given it has to adhere to the BaFin regulations, the highest standards in the industry, we are attracting leading players in the UK’s gaming and financial services sectors looking for compliant and steadfast identity verification services,” says Roger.</p>
<p>Nigel Birrell, CEO, Lottoland, adds: “In our business, flexible customer service, security and legal compliance are crucial. With its online identification solution, IDnow offers us the very best in all areas.</p>
<p>“Many customers use our services via smartphone and fill out their tickets using our app while on the move. With IDnow AutoIdent, we can now accept orders independently from our service centre around the clock, worldwide. This will enable us to meet increasing global demand and provide our users with a perfect customer experience from the moment they sign up, without making any compromises regarding legal compliance”.</p>
<p>IDnow has secured deals with some major UK companies including BP, Macropay, Holvi, Allied Irish Banks (AIB) and GVC since it launched in London following a successful $40 million financing round.</p>
<p>Paul Kenny, Head of Lifecycle Optimisation at AIB, commented: “As a bank, we have to meet a lot of regulatory requirements. IDnow is a trusted partner in the fields of security and compliance and helps us deliver fast and efficient onboarding for our customers.”</p>
<p>Besides the London Office at Canary Warf, the company will now move into its new Manchester city centre premises, in line with the Government’s social distancing guidance in the coming weeks. This will see a new team on-site driving new business, UK focused marketing and the firm’s core business functions. In the meantime, the team is working remotely supporting its growing customer base in line with IDnow’s home office policy.</p>
<p>Roger concludes: “In recent weeks, our entire team has been working from home. What looked like a big challenge turned out to work smoothly right from the start.&nbsp; As a company we have seen positive effects – not least an increase in productivity in many areas. Therefore, whilst we have physical premises for our UK team, we will be offering employees the option of home working to a much greater extent in the future.”</p>

<p>Like with many industries, digitization has a big influence on the mobility sector. The demand for digital services has grown rapidly in the last years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Modern digital solutions grant users a great deal of flexibility and comfort. The primary focus is usually on time-saving and user experience.</p>
<p>Traveling has become much easier for people who don’t own a car – which is a significant trend in urban areas.&nbsp;Services like Car Sharing, Ride-Hailing, or Car Subscriptions have become more and more popular in the last years. However, those services require a secure and fast identity verification process to guarantee the user is of legal age and allowed to drive while guaranteeing a perfect user experience.</p>
<p>Identity verification for the new generation</p>
<p>To start the onboarding process, users need to identify themselves, verify their driving license and age. IDnow AutoIdent is able to verify users within minutes – a perfect solution for the Now Economy.

<p>Yesterday, our co-founder Fabian Eberle had the opportunity to discuss how privacy-enhancing technologies and biometrics are being leveraged to protect users against identity theft and financial crimes.</p><p>The panel discussion, moderated by Tarah Wheeler from <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/">New America</a>, allowed Fabian, Husayn, from <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a>, and Ellison, from <a href="http://enveil.com/">Enveil</a>, to dive deep into how privacy-enhancing solutions can help strengthen cybersecurity in the next ten years and&nbsp;beyond.</p> These were the key takeaways from yesterday’s panel:   Biometrics are an inherently weak authentication factor on their&nbsp;own  Privacy-enhancing technologies will help protect us against identity theft and&nbsp;fraud  Seamless biometric authentication doesn’t need to compromise security  Deep Fakes can be used to generate biometric training data in privacy-preserving way  Private biometric authentication can help with cross-jurisdictional compliance  To get the next ten years right, we need to be transparent  <p>You can watch the panel here, or continue reading for a&nbsp;recap…</p> Biometrics are an inherently weak authentication factor on their&nbsp;own <p>Biometrics are insecure when used as a single authentication factor, but when combined with other factors and privacy enhancing technologies, biometrics can be used to seamlessly and securely identify users, protecting them from the growing threat of financial fraud and identity&nbsp;theft.</p><blockquote>“…. Biometrics, when done right, are the answer to solving the authentication trade-off in aligning seamless user experience with strong security and built-in privacy protection.” — Fabian</blockquote><p>Advancements in behavioural biometrics, multi-factor authentication and privacy-enhancing technologies are allowing us to develop authentication and identity management solutions that are virtually impenetrable to cyberthreats, while also seamless for the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Our solution has in-built multi-factor authentication. In order to verify that a user is who they claim to be, we launch a series of challenges, some of which are naked to the user’s eye. In the first challenge, we validate whether the device the user is authenticating from is registered or not. If the device is registered, we move onto the next challenge, where we confirm that samples of the user’s unique biometric templates match those stored across our&nbsp;network.</p><p>Our solution is much more robust than passwords and SMS one-time-codes — both of which are susceptible to social engineering attacks like sim-swapping and phishing.</p><p>But, as stressed yesterday, multi-factor authentication is not enough on its own to protect users against fraud and identity theft. We must also leverage advanced privacy-enhancing technologies when dealing with private data — especially biometrics.</p> Privacy-enhancing technologies will help protect us against identity theft and&nbsp;fraud <p>Emerging solutions that are leveraging privacy-enhancing technologies like <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-secure-multiparty-computation-dc3fb9365458">secure multi-party computation</a> (sMPC) and homomorphic encryption are potential solutions to fighting cybercrime and improving privacy&nbsp;online.</p><p>Both Fabian and Ellison discussed how <a href="http://keyless.io/">Keyless</a> and <a href="http://enveil.com/">Enveil</a> use these advanced cryptographic techniques, while also touching on how such techniques can be applied to data protection in a broader sense. As the first cybersecurity platform to ever combine biometrics with privacy-enhancing technologies like sMPC and <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-shamir-s-secret-sharing-e864efbf3648">Shamir’s Secret Sharing</a> algorithm, we’re glad to see other leaders in privacy and security advocating for the widespread use of these technologies.</p><blockquote>“What we’re pioneering with Keyless are several breakthroughs in the area of secure, private, and distributed biometric authentication that are based on more than 10 years of research in biometrics and cryptography.” — Fabian</blockquote><p>Our unique combination of privacy-enhancing technologies with biometrics allow us to securely store and verify biometric data without needing to expose the raw contents of the data at any time during the authentication or verification process. In doing so, we’re able to provide a seamless, biometrically-enabled alternative to passwords.</p><p>Ellison also discussed the benefits of homomorphic encryption. Her data security platform, <a href="https://www.enveil.com/">Enveil</a>, is using the technology to allow third parties to share data in a way that preserves privacy.</p><p>The advanced cryptographic technique allows data to remain encrypted while it’s being shared with and processed by third parties. In other words, companies can share, collaborate and leverage data to find solutions to common problems — without ever needing to view the raw contents of the data. Such solutions will enable governments, banks and organizations to combat international cybercrime without needing to jeopardize privacy and security.</p> Seamless biometric authentication doesn’t need to compromise security <p>As we mentioned earlier, biometrics on their own are a weak means of authenticating users. This is because a user’s biometric features never change, meaning that if they’re compromised, they can’t simply be altered to prevent fraud and identity&nbsp;theft.</p><p>To protect users from even the most sophisticated threats, we need to ensure that we’re able to recognise and detect when fake biometric data is being&nbsp;used.</p> Liveness detection and anti-spoofing <p>We leverage advanced liveness detection and anti-spoofing technology to rule out the possibilities of an imposter using either a photo or stolen biometric data — like photos or videos. This technology allows us to pick up on subtle movements that indicate whether a person is truly present in front of the device’s&nbsp;camera.</p> Physical vs Behavioural biometrics <p>Our protocol allows for the combination of physical biometrics (facial recognition and fingerprint technology) with behavioral biometrics. Behavioural biometrics is a new modality of biometric technology that allows us to verify users based on the way they interact with their devices — whether that be through unique keystrokes, or unique swiping patterns.</p><p>By incorporating multi-modal biometrics, our solution allows for unconscious, continuous authentication. This is what makes our solution unique — in that it is seamless for the user — while simultaneously secure and privacy-enhancing.</p> Deep Fakes can be used to generate biometric training data in a privacy-preserving way <p>As expected, the conversation yesterday led to the risks of Deep Fakes. With the rising adoption of biometrics, Deep Fakes could become a real security threat. That’s why it’s crucial to combine traditional biometrics with new biometric modalities that protect users from fraudulent biometric attacks.</p><p>While the risks of deep fake tech are certainly worth preparing for, our co-founder Fabian also discussed how Keyless is leveraging the technology to train our machine learning algorithms. By using GANs (generative adversarial network), we can enhance the reliability of our product in ways that were not previously possible.</p><p>For example, we can ensure our algorithms are able to accurately detect and verify users from a more diverse landscape. This is especially important, as facial recognition machine learning systems have previously proven to be ineffective and biased when identifying users when only trained with datasets from limited demographics.</p> Cross-jurisdictional identity management is possible with biometric authentication solutions <blockquote>The global demand for privacy has never been greater than it is today — Ellison</blockquote><p>Regulations like GDPR and PDS2 are ushering the world into a new era of privacy — yet they also pose problems for enterprises and organizations that need to process personal data in multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>The other issue highlighted by the panel yesterday, is that regulators in different regions each need to be educated on the benefit these breakthrough privacy-enhancing technologies have when it comes to protecting personal data against security&nbsp;threats.</p><p>At Keyless, we help organizations comply with data privacy regulations by providing a secure multi-factor authentication solution that relieves companies from the burden of storing data, like usernames and passwords, on centralized servers. In doing so, we are helping companies to actively reduce cyberthreats caused by compromised credentials, thus making unauthorized access virtually impossible.</p> Distributed vs centralized data&nbsp;storage <p>Our solution also helps organizations become less of a target for cybercriminals, as the “honeypots” of usernames and passwords are no longer stored on centralized databases with the organization.</p><p>At Keyless, we use distributed cloud architecture to store encrypted biometric data. The key here is that no single node in our network has access to a full decrypted biometric template — making our authentication solution private by&nbsp;design.</p><p>Husayn from <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> advocated for giving users full control of their data as a solution. An interesting point, that we completely agree with. However such a solution may not work cross-jurisdictionally in the short-term, while we wait for corporations and governments to change their perception around data ownership.</p> Transparency is key when it comes to secure and private data management <p>Lastly, the key to protecting identities is balancing transparency with security. As highlighted by Ellison, we can do this by being transparent about the protocols and algorithms we use, how we implement them, and by allowing third party auditing of our source code and platform.</p><p>At Keyless, we’re looking forward to helping enterprises, organizations and users from around the world improve privacy and security. With our privacy-enhancing authentication and identity management solutions, we can actively reduce cyberthreats, improve security and transform the authentication user-experience.</p><p>It’s our mission to allow anyone to seamlessly access any digital service from any device, at any time, while keeping personal credentials safe, private, and under control. We’re excited to continue working on this as we rapidly move into a world powered by digital technologies.</p><p>Do you have further questions about any of the technologies mentioned in this article, or about how Keyless can help fight financial crime and identity theft?<br>If you do, please feel free to ask away in the comments.</p> Interested in trialing Keyless to enable secure work from&nbsp;home? <p>If you’re interested in how Keyless™ authentication can help deliver secure and seamless digital experiences, whether for your end-users or for an ever more important and dynamic digital workplace, or if you’d simply like to learn more about our platform, then please feel free to get in touch with our&nbsp;team.</p><p>You can email us at <a href="mailto:info@keyless.io">info@keyless.io</a></p><p>We’re always keen to have a chat about how we can help businesses on their journeys towards a complete zero-trust security&nbsp;model.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/key-takeaways-on-the-future-of-identity-and-security-at-cogx2020-447395d610c1">Key takeaways on the future of identity and security at CogX2020</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech">KeylessTech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Munich, June 4th, 2020 – IDnow, a leading provider of Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions and regulatory expert presents KYC Insider (<a href="http://www.kycinsider.com">www.kycinsider.com</a>), a free information service on regulatory changes around Know-Your-Customer and Digital Identities in Europe. The lead author is Rayissa Armata, a long-standing expert in the field of regulation.</p>
<p>The digital platform “KYC Insider” provides interested readers with background information and current updates on the latest changes by the regulatory authorities via newsletter. Through her daily interaction with regulators and governments and her close contact with IDnow’s clients, author Rayissa Armata has her finger on the pulse of the sector and knows the needs and background of all parties.</p>
<p>“The regulatory landscape in Europe is highly dynamic. There is a variety of regulated industries and differences in each country – a complex sector. At IDnow, we work with companies in a wide range of sectors and have gained a wealth of experience over the years. I would now like to share this knowledge and provide interested parties with up-to-date and exclusive information via our new platform KYC Insider”, says Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow.</p>
<p>“Cooperation with regulatory authorities such as BaFin in Germany (Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) has been essential since the company was founded. When we had the first idea for a video identification service in 2012, it was not yet approved by the authorities. We have now been working closely with the relevant bodies for many years to make our current product portfolio possible” adds Armin Bauer, CTO and co-founder of IDnow.</p>
<p>IDnow has recently been selected by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to participate in a new working group on electronic signatures and infrastructures (ESI). As a member of the Special Task Force 588, IDnow is part of an exclusive group of specialists who started work in April 2020 to fill existing gaps in identity verification standards. The objective of the Task Force is to develop new standards and guidelines for electronic signatures and related trust services.</p>

  Passwords have been used for authentication for decades and continue to proliferate. Yet we know they create friction for users, slow down business productivity, and are a weak form of user authentication. Users are always forgetting them or use weak passwords that are easily cracked by hackers. Many organizations would love to lessen reliance on passwords but many passwordless solutions only provide a partial solution and do not solve the inherent weakness of passwords. Modern enterprises cannot cover the myriad of access use cases today with a passwordless solution alone.

  <p>While governments and public healthcare specialists are looking into the timing and manner of reopening the economy, it is clear that at some point in the hopefully not-too-distant future restrictions will be eased and businesses will return to normal operations. Returning to recently-vacated offices will certainly signify a return to normality, and for most, that will be a welcome relief after working from home for an extended period. However, just as the&nbsp;shift to working from home&nbsp;required organizations to adapt and act differently, so will the return to the office. In this keynote, we discuss the preparation CISOs should consider making to offset a number of security implications that arise from returning your workforce from home and back to the office.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve2_2020_06_02_canisius"></a>

  <p>Security teams were already going through a fundamental shift in how they protect the business, even before the acceleration to remote working due to Covid-19. Given that Identity and Access Management (IAM) is now undeniably the first line of defense for organisations worldwide, how can security leaders turn the challenges, both legacy and new, into opportunities to mitigate risk and add value to the business? And all this in a way that will elevate the position, and change the perception, of security at the same time?</p>
<p>Based on a recent study Barry McMahon from LastPass looks at the challenges facing security teams and details five drivers where Identity and Access Management can support the business needs to benefit both the business and security team. There is also some excellent guidance on how best to engage the senior decision makers and speak in a language they understand.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve2_2020_06_02_mcmahon"></a>

  <p>Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for cybersecurity tasks are attracting greater attention from the private and the public sectors. Estimates indicate that the market for AI in cybersecurity will grow from US$1 billion in 2016 to a US$34.8 billion net worth by 2025. The latest national cybersecurity and defence strategies of several governments explicitly mention AI capabili- ties. At the same time, initiatives to define new standards and certification procedures to elicit users’ trust in AI are emerging on a global scale. However, trust in AI (both machine learning and neural networks) to deliver cybersecurity tasks is a double- edged sword: it can improve substantially cybersecurity practices, but can also facilitate new forms of attacks to the AI applica- tions themselves, which may pose severe security threats. I argue that trust in AI for cybersecurity is unwarranted and that, to reduce security risks, some form of control to ensure the deployment of ‘reliable AI’ for cybersecurity is necessary. To this end, I offer three recommendations focusing on the design, development and deployment of AI for cybersecurity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve2_2020_06_02_taddeo"></a>

  <p>The year 2020 will see a transition to a new decade. So will cybersecurity. Gone are the days of networks isolated behind a company firewall and a limited stack of enterprise applications. The current paradigm demands a wide variety of apps, services, and platforms that will all require protection. Defenders will have to view security through many lenses to keep up with and anticipate cybercrime mainstays, game changers, and new players.<br>Tried-and-tested methods — extortion, obfuscation, phishing — will remain, but new risks will inevitably emerge. The increased migration to the cloud, for instance, will exacerbate human error. The sheer number of connected assets and infrastructures, too, will open doors to threats. Enterprise threats will be no less complex, mixing traditional risks with new technologies, like artificial intelligence (AI) in business frauds.<br>Security predictions for 2020 reflect experts’ opinions and insights on current and emerging threats and technologies. Report paints a picture of a possible future landscape driven by technological advances and evolved threats to enable enterprises to make informed decisions on their cybersecurity posture in 2020 and beyond. The future looks complex, exposed, and misconfigured — but it is also defensible.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve2_2020_06_02_pires"></a>

<p>The Mobility Industry experiences rapid changes like few others. With the help of new technologies getting from A to B is becoming much more comfortable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But what are the new trends ahead of us? How will the mobile industry look like in the upcoming years? These are all questions that concern cities and regions and, above all, the automotive industry. Management consultancy Roland Berger identified four megatrends in the mobility sector:</p>
 
 New mobility services 
 Autonomous driving 
 Digitization 
 Electrification 
 
<p>Those trends will have a significant impact on the traditional automotive industry, which will create both challenges and opportunities for the providers.</p>
<p>Industry experts suggest that there will be fully automated cars by 2022, which will at first primarily affect the car-sharing market. This development will be driven primarily by a young, technophile generation that attaches importance to comfortable and environmentally-friendly mobility alternatives. Not only the environment but also people with no driving license or people with specific handicaps will benefit from this technology. By 2030, 40 percent of all passenger-kilometers will be driven by autonomous cars.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the passenger numbers will increase, and the number of vehicles decreases. But there is still a huge opportunity for the automotive sector: Due to the constant usage, the cars will be replaced much more frequently in the future, leading to rising sales.</p>

<p>For the last few months we’ve been working on a Scottish Government project to develop a prototype for the sharing of verified attributes. You can see the latest <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/05/13/digital-identity-scotland-prototype-draws-to-a-close/">official announcement about this&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">Verified attributes</a> are created when and where a responsible body has used robust processes to ascertain and/or check a fact about a person. Verified information about people (for example, their age, address or any number of other facts about them) is hugely valuable because, if the right ways of doing things are put in place, it can be used to get things done — and it can be used repeatedly, for many different purposes, without the need for the original information to be collected again or to be checked&nbsp;again.</p><p>Current approaches to data require such recollection or checking of data every time the information needs to be used. This forces citizens to jump through far too many time-consuming, frustrating and sometimes costly hoops — providing the same information again and again to the different bodies (often even to the same body); having to travel to far away locations to present paper documents so that someone can verify them, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>It also adds costs and builds in delay for service providers because they have to go through an information-gathering and checking process before they can get on with the job at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>Being able to access verified attributes enables both citizens and service providers to cut both costs and risks. If these verified attributes can be shared and brought together to round out the information that is known about the person, it can be used time and again for different purposes (thus cutting costs and risks many times over). At the same time, as more of this information gets bundled together, the richer it gets, thus expanding the range of things that can be done with&nbsp;it.</p><p>But these benefits don’t arise automatically. Lots has to be done to enable them to flow. Here are some of the hurdles that need to be cleared for an ecosystem of verified attribute use to flourish.</p>  ways have to be found to ensure that the attribute is indeed verified (i.e. kept up to date and accurate). It’s no good saying that a person has a driving licence today if they were disqualified from driving yesterday.  ways have to be found to find the right sources of these verified attributes and for them to share either the data itself or a verification that the data is correct. This needs to be done safely, efficiently and securely.  ways have to be found to protect the privacy of those whose verified attributes are being stored or used. The solution we are working on is to store these attributes in the individual’s own personal data/attribute store that remains fully under their control: where only they can ‘see’ inside their data store, and only they can decide if information is to be shared, with who, for what purposes.  ways for individuals to easily and effectively exercise this control, for example, via processes managing consents and permissions.  <p>That’s what the Attribute Prototype we’ve been working on was focused on, and we’re happy to say it’s worked well. As the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/05/13/digital-identity-scotland-prototype-draws-to-a-close/">official blog says</a>, “we have successfully developed a fully working prototype [which] has proven the technical feasibility and provided ample opportunity for testing the usability of the proposed service”.</p> Why is this important? <p>If we look across all of the different departments, functions and activities of the Scottish Government it is sitting on an invaluable data asset of verified attributes about citizens — data that could be used to radically reduce the costs of service provision while improving its quality: making services better and cheaper at the same time in ways that make life easier for citizens while empowering them with their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Attribute Prototype has shown that a strategy to achieve these benefits in Scotland is indeed doable. But lots more still needs to be done. For example standardised ways of describing the data (e.g. metadata about where it came from, who verified it, when, and so on) need to be developed. We need to develop data directories that help people find the data they need quickly and easily. Mechanisms of consent and the communications need further development. The process of consent should be so easy that it becomes intuitive while ensuring that citizens remain fully in control of their data, able to understand what they are doing and&nbsp;why.</p><p>We are confident that at least some if not all of these questions will be answered by the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/creating-new-opportunities-with-personal-information-d749c007091e">Smart Entitlement Strategy that we are also working on</a>. We are also kicking off further co-design work with <a href="https://www.dhi-scotland.com/">Digital Health Institute</a> to find better answers to user journeys and consent processes. As the announcement says, this is a really exciting time. Developing these capabilities helps us enormously with the rest of our work on the ground with citizens and front line teams to improve specific services and citizen journeys. A real, achievable opportunity is emerging to make a profound, lasting change in the way personal data works for citizens and&nbsp;society.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/our-verified-attribute-prototype-is-built-fda62c301063">Our Verified Attribute Prototype is Built</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/buehler">Roland Bühler</a></p><p>AI-based conversational interfaces developed plenty of hype for use cases within marketing, sales, and service management. Various types of solutions are on the market, offered by both small start-ups and large, international, established enterprises.</p>
 More than a hype 
<p>Conversational interfaces experienced hype in 2016, followed by some disillusionment in the next years, as many solutions were technical gadgets rather than delivering real value. This is about to change, as many solutions are more mature now - and implemented as a part of digitalization projects within marketing, sales, or service management. It is expected that the market for conversational AI building platform will grow significantly within the next several years.</p>
 Customer Centricity 
<p>Marketers and service management experts see conversational interfaces as a key topic when it comes to customer-centric approaches. Furthermore, conversational interfaces are becoming more popular among organizations for internal communication and service management.</p>
<p>Digitalization will change the way people communicate with organizations and the way organizations set up sales and service processes.</p>
<p>Connecting with data pools will be crucial in order to enable communications that customers expect in future—personalized, individual information in real time is crucial in this case to meet user experience expectations.</p>
<p>Conversational interfaces have been developed from technical gadgets to integrated parts of customer journeys and/or business processes.</p>
 Various use cases 
<p>In a heterogenous market there exist various “flavors” of conversational AI building platforms. Capabilities differ depending on the focus of each solution. The KuppingerCole Market Compass considers various use cases:</p>
 
 
 Marketing/sales 
Probably one of the most popular use cases when it comes to conversational interfaces is marketing and sales, in order to answer product- or service-related questions from consumers/customers. 
 
 Customer service 
Another popular use case—in many cases closely connected to marketing/sales-focused use cases—is customer service. Conversational interfaces might help to facilitate customer service, e.g., by providing real-time answers. This can be combined with human-based service centers or replace them. 
 
 Human resource marketing 
More and more organizations use conversational interfaces to empower human resource marketing, e.g., to answer questions related to job vacancies or directly handle the application process. 
 
 Internal communication 
Conversational interfaces can be used for internal purposes as well, e.g., in addition to internal wikis or intranet pages. This might help in finding the right document template or contact persons based on conversational AI. 
 
<p></p>
<p></p>
 &nbsp; 
 Which solution is fit for purpose? 
<p>Some vendors offer solutions with a narrow focus on conversational interfaces and offer connectors to integrate with other systems. Others offer comprehensive suites covering other aspects, such as data management, marketing automation, and customer relationship management. An organization’s individual situation will determine which approach fits better. There is no right or wrong. In some cases, there already exists a best-of-breed approach, which means that it makes sense to integrate a solution with a narrow focus on conversational interfaces into an existing systems landscape. In other cases, the right way might be to implement conversational AI building platforms within a project with a larger scope, e.g., including more marketing automation or service management components. In every case, it is crucial to consider a clear business case, including change management procedures.</p>
 Focus of this Market Compass 
<p>This Market Compass covers solutions that provide conversational AI building platforms with a focus on chatbot solutions. Furthermore, the systems considered in this report have machine learning (ML) capabilities in order to continuously improve conversational capabilities. In addition, this report is focused on solutions that enable integration into existing consumer/customer touchpoints, such as websites, portals, e-commerce, and CRM solutions.</p>

  <p>When it’s “business as usual”, it seems strange to think about disruptions and disasters. With competing priorities and the pressure of everyday demands, planning for worst-case scenarios can feel alarmist and macabre. But as anyone experienced in disaster preparedness will tell you, the best time to prepare for unexpected disruptions to your business is before they happen. And in today’s digital workplace, the ability to support remote employees and ensure secure access to work resources is an essential component of a business continuity plan.</p>
 Why a business continuity plan? 
<p>When we talk about business continuity, we mean the ability of your organization to keep functioning as normally as possible when the unexpected happens. The “unexpected” could be anything from a natural disaster like a wildfire or hurricane, to a public health event like a pandemic, to the sickness or death of a CEO or key employee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building a business continuity plan undoubtedly requires time and resources. Business Continuity Planning has many facets – organizational, along the supply chain, but also many IT aspects, with IT running the business. Let’s focus on the IT side of BCM. You’ll need to complete an inventory of all physical structures, technology, personnel, data, and documentation in use. Essentially, you’ll need a complete view of what your business and its employees need to function every day. Then you’ll need to understand how each potential disaster or unexpected event could impact all of those elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever the event, having a business continuity plan in place makes the organization more resilient. Leaders and employees can act with confidence and disruptions to business activities are minimized.&nbsp;</p>
 Key questions to consider when planning for business continuity in IT environments 
<p>Many businesses have already transitioned some or all of their operations to the cloud. If that’s true of your business, operating in the cloud means some aspects of business continuity may already be addressed. SaaS providers usually employ automated backups, redundancy, encryption and other preventative measures that complement disaster preparedness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But businesses need to go further. When thinking about business continuity, key questions include:</p>
 
 Who has access to which resources/data/apps/documents/services? 
 What devices do they use, or can they use, inside or outside a physical office? 
 How can they maintain that access no matter where they are? 
 How can employees share that access as needed, either internally or externally? 
 How can we ensure that the authorized employee is the only one who can access their resources? 
 How can we <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2020/04/how-identity-and-access-management-reduces-the-risk-of-a-breach.html/">prevent against cyberthreats </a>– internal or external – while still making access easy for employees? 
 If an employee suddenly leaves or dies, how can we take over their accounts and ensure we have access to anything business-critical that they were responsible for? 
 
<p>All of these needs boil down to how identity is managed and secured in your business.&nbsp;</p>

 How an identity solution supports business continuity 
<p>A holistic <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/solutions/secure-remote-workforce-iam">identity and access management</a> (IAM) strategy of course has benefits beyond business continuity planning. But when preparing your business for the unexpected, an identity solution that integrates access and authentication can keep employees working efficiently while maintaining a high level of security. Putting a solution in place in advance is ideal, but solutions like LastPass can also be deployed quickly and securely in the midst of an event, too.</p>
<p>Some of the ways an identity solution supports business continuity include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2020/04/maintain-control-over-access-no-matter-where-the-team-is-working.html/">Single sign-on manages access</a> in a centralized way so IT has insight into who has access to what, from where 
 <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2020/04/sharing-passwords-while-working-remote-no-problem.html/">Enterprise password management ensures oversight</a> of shadow IT and enforceable policies across all password-protected accounts 
 <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2020/03/the-importance-of-mfa-in-a-remote-workforce.html/">Multi-factor authentication requires additional factors</a> to prove a user’s identity while the use of biometrics and contextual factors makes the process smooth for employees 
 Password vaults can be recovered, and access can be reassigned in the event of a departure or death 
 Account access and passwords can be shared securely between employees, including when they’re remote 
 
<p>In short, the features available in a <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/products/identity">holistic identity solution</a> addresses many key aspects of business continuity planning in the digital age. Employees can maintain secure, streamlined access to work resources, no matter where they are or what device they need to use to connect to work. IT can maintain oversight and control of employee access. If an employee’s accounts need to be recovered, IT has a failsafe in place. The risk of a data breach is reduced thanks to secure password requirements and the use of strong authentication protocols.</p>
<p>An identity solution is of course only one tool in your toolbox when planning for business continuity. But when it comes to maintaining secure, simplified employee access and strong authentication, in the “normal” times and in the midst of a crisis, an identity solution is essential.</p>

<p>Welcome to this week’s round-up of the latest data breaches, leaks, and privacy intrusions. This week: data of millions of EasyJet customers stolen in a massive data breach, billions of Thai internet records leaked online, and unemployment insurance fraud surges in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> Data of 9 Million Customers Stolen in EasyJet Breach <p>EasyJet disclosed last week that the personal and travel data of 9 millions customers was stolen in a data breach discovered in January, making it one of the largest breaches since a breach at Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific in June 2019 that impacted 9.4 million customers. Both Cathay Pacific and British Airways <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/british-airways-data-breach-fine/">were fined last year</a> by regulators following major breaches. </p><p>In the latest breach to hit the airline industry, hackers absconded with the credit card details of over 2,000 EasyJet customers. EasyJet said that it has notified those affected and shut down unauthorized access to its systems. In a <a href="https://www.easyjet.com/us/infoalert">notice to customers</a>, the company said, “EasyJet has been the target of an attack from a highly sophisticated source...we are now notifying other customers impacted by this incident, particularly in light of the increased risk of phishing emails since the outbreak of Covid-19.”</p><p>The breach included names, email addresses, and credit card details. Travel details, such as departure dates and destinations, were also accessed in the breach. EasyJet said there has been no indication yet of credit card fraud stemming from the breach. Affected customers have also been offered 12 months of free credit monitoring.</p> 8 Billion Thai Internet Records Leaked <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/24/thai-billions-internet-records-leak/">TechCrunch reported</a> that a large Thai mobile network, AIS, took down a massive database that was leaking billions of real-time records on Thai internet users. Anyone who came across the unsecured database would have been able to see exactly what users were doing online in real-time.</p><p>It took AIS over a week to take down the database, and came only after a security researcher alerted Thailand’s cyber emergency response department. “We can confirm that a small amount of non-personal, non-critical information was exposed for a limited period in May,” a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch.”</p><p>While AIS said that the leak did not contain any personal information, the exposed database did contain DNS queries and Netflow data, information which makes it possible to determine what websites and apps users are accessing. As TechCrunch points out, this information could in turn potentially be used to identify the activity and sources of journalists in a country that is notorious for government censorship. </p><p>The security researcher who found the database, Justin Paine, <a href="https://rainbowtabl.es/2020/05/25/thai-database-leaks-internet-records/?=may-23-2020">said that</a> the data could be used to identify internet-connected devices, which antivirus software users were running, and the social media platforms they used. Tools like HTTPS Everywhere or a VPN make it difficult to track internet activity by encrypting requests and traffic, so it might be a good time to look into these if you haven’t already.</p><p>Check out our comprehensive <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/how-to-protect-your-privacy-online/">privacy guide</a> to find out more about these tools and get more information on how to protect yourself online.</p> Fraudsters Target Unemployment Insurance <p>With the expansion of unemployment benefits and a massive surge in unemployment claims as millions have been laid off or furloughed due to the coronavirus, fraudsters are exploiting the influx of claims by filing for benefits in other peoples’ names, hoping to sneak by as state systems are swamped by applications in what the New York Time is calling a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/us/coronavirus-unemployment-fraud-secret-service-washington.html">vast fraud network targeting US unemployment systems</a>.” </p><p>States around the country, from <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/huge-washington-unemployment-fraud-warning-154200996.html">Washington</a> to <a href="https://www.masslive.com/coronavirus/2020/05/massachusetts-unemployment-checks-could-be-delayed-as-state-responds-to-nationwide-scam.html">Massachusetts</a>, are now warning their residents to be on the lookout for signs of fraudulent claims. In Washington state alone, thousands of residents have become unwitting victims of the scheme. Officials there estimate that fraudsters have already cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Cases have also been identified in nine other states.</p><p>If you receive notice that an unemployment claim has been filed in your name, contact the fraud hotline of your state unemployment office immediately.

<p> Die Schweiz erhält mit SARS-CoV-2 einen Schuss vor den Bug (Frachter Helvetia der schweizerischen Hochseeflotte).</p>



<p>Von <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolfrauschenbach/">Dr. rer. publ. Rolf Rauschenbach</a></p>



<p>Dass die öffentliche Verwaltung im
Rahmen der bestehenden Strukturen nicht adäquat und zeitnah digitalisiert
werden kann, ist inzwischen auch in Bern erkannt worden. In einer kürzlich vom
Eidgenössischen Finanzdepartement (EFD) und der Konferenz der
Kantonsregierungen (KdK) veröffentlichten Studie werden drei Varianten
vorgestellt, wie dieser Herausforderung begegnet werden soll. Bei einer näheren
Betrachtung stellen sich diese jedoch als ungeeignet dar. Die Schweiz muss sich
mittels einer Totalrevision der Bundesverfassung neu gründen.</p>



<p>Welche gesundheitlichen, wirtschaftlichen,
politischen und sozialen Folgen SARS-CoV-2 für die Schweiz haben wird, ist noch
offen; zweifellos werden sie tiefschürfend sein. Natürlich ist kurzfristig
alles zu tun, um die Schäden so gering wie möglich zu halten. Gleichzeitig ist
es angebracht, sich schon jetzt Gedanken für die Zeit danach zu machen. Dies
aus zweierlei Gründen: Erstens fördert die aktuelle Krise Schwächen der bestehenden
Infrastruktur zu Tage, die auch während Normalzeiten einen hohen Zoll fordern.
Zweitens, weil wohl nur eine Krise von der aktuellen Dimension den Schwung auszulösen
vermag, der erforderlich ist, um die seit langem angestauten Probleme
anzugehen. Auch wenn in der laufenden Debatte das Gesundheitssystem und dessen
mangelhafte Digitalisierung im Vordergrund stehen, ist die Digitalisierung der
öffentlichen Verwaltung mit ähnlichen Herausforderungen konfrontiert. </p>



<p>Problematische Ausgangslage</p>



<p>Zur Illustration kann aus dem
«Evaluationsbericht der Wirksamkeit der Organisation E-Government Schweiz bei
der Umsetzung der E-Government-Strategie Schweiz» zitiert werden, der im
November 2018 für den Planungsausschuss der Geschäftsstelle von E-Government
Schweiz erarbeitet wurde:</p>



<p>«Die Wichtigkeit von E-Government ist auf
allen Ebenen erkannt, und der Bedarf an einer staatsesebenenübergreifenden
Organisation ist eindeutig gegeben […]. Erwartungen und erzielte Wirkung
stimmen in der Wahrnehmung vieler Beobachter nicht überein. Die Ansprüche sind
substanziell gestiegen und die gesamte Organisation kann diesen nicht genügen […].
Es fehlt eine politische Vision und eine Willensbekundung zu E-Government […].
Die politische Verankerung von E-Government Schweiz ist nicht ausreichend. Die
organisatorische Ansiedlung dieses Fachthemas ist bei einem auf IT fokussierten
Bundesamt thematisch und hierarchisch nicht passend […]. E-Government ist ein
Fachthema mit Transformationscharakter und sollte nicht in einem mit Informatik
betrauten Bundesamt angesiedelt sein. E-Government ist prinzipiell ein Thema
der Verwaltungsabläufe zugunsten von Bürgern und Unternehmen, sowie zwischen
Verwaltungseinheiten, welches eine starke politische Komponente aufweist und
alle Staatsebenen betrifft […]. Es bearbeiten zu viele Akteure zu kleine
Aufgabenfelder in diesem Themenkomplex, was zu einer gegenseitigen Behinderung
und reduzierten Schlagkraft führt, auch wegen dem Bedarf an gegenseitiger
Abgrenzung und der fehlenden Ganzheitlichkeit der Ansätze […]. Dabei ist
insbesondere der Bau von separaten Portalen, Apps und Identitätslösungen sehr
kritisch zu hinterfragen […].»</p>



<p></p>



  Die geplante Zielorganisation steht auf wackeligen Füssen.  



<p>Drei Lösungsvarianten</p>



<p>Diese Einschätzungen lassen an Deutlichkeit nichts zu wünschen übrig und haben weiterhin Gültigkeit. Vor diesem Hintergrund gaben das EFD und die KdK eine Studie in Auftrag, um Lösungsansätze zu erarbeiten, wie Bund, Kantone und Gemeinden die strategische Steuerung und Koordination ihrer Aktivitäten, Initiativen und Projekte zur digitalen Transformation wirksamer gestalten können. Der entsprechende Schlussbericht «Digitale Verwaltung: Projekt zur Optimierung der bundesstaatlichen Steuerung und Koordination» liegt seit Oktober 2019 vor. Darin werden drei Varianten sowie ein möglicher Umsetzungsplan vorgeschlagen. Diese Vorschläge werden im Weiteren dargestellt und beurteilt. Anschliessend wird eine alternative Vorgehensweise skizziert.</p>



  Variante 1 «Politische
Plattform mit Standardentwicklung» ist vom Ambitionslevel moderat und
entspricht einer gezielten, punktuellen Weiterentwicklung des Status quo. Die
Zielorganisation
wird Aufgaben übernehmen in den Bereichen Strategie-Erarbeitung,
Standardsetzung, Bereitstellung von strategischen Basisdienstleistungen,
Innovations- und Wissensaustauschförderung, Setzung von Anreizen und Beratung.
Allerdings hat die Zielorganisation selbst keine Entscheidungskompetenz; alle
Entscheidungen werden wie bis anhin erst in Antrags- und Beschlussverfahren der
beteiligten institutionellen Akteure für verbindlich erklärt.  



  Variante 2 «Politische
Plattform mit verbindlicher Standardsetzung» unterscheidet sich von Variante 1
dahingehend, dass hier die Zielorganisation bestimmte Standards
gesamtschweizerisch nicht nur entwickeln, sondern verbindlich festsetzen kann.
In allen anderen Aufgabenbereichen wird die Zielorganisation weiterhin nur als
politische Plattform ohne verbindliche Entscheidungskraft über Antrags- und
Beschlussverfahren mit den beteiligten institutionellen Akteuren funktionieren.
Damit die Zielorganisation Standards für Bund, Kantone und Gemeinden für
verbindlich erklären kann, ist eine entsprechende Verfassungsänderung
erforderlich.  



  In Variante 3 «Behörde / hoheitlicher
Akteur» wird die Zielorganisation mit erheblich grösseren Kompetenzen
ausgestattet. Neben der verbindlichen Standardsetzung wird die neu zu
schaffende Behörde im gesamten Mandats- und Budgetrahmen mit einer autonomen
und verbindlichen Entscheidungskompetenz ausgestattet. Die Zielorganisation ist
hier als gesamtschweizerische Behörde mit eigener Rechtspersönlichkeit sowie
entsprechenden Verantwortlichkeiten, Rechenschaftspflicht, Governance und
Finanzhoheit im ihr zugeordneten Mandats- und Budgetrahmen konzipiert. Wie für
Variante 2 ist auch hier eine Verfassungsänderung erforderlich, wird doch die
Autonomie von Gemeinden, Kantonen, Bund und anderen Institutionen der
öffentlichen Hand erheblich reduziert.  



<p>Zaghafter Umsetzungsplan</p>



<p>Im Schlussbericht wird keiner der drei
Varianten der Vorzug gegeben. Die Vorteile der weiter gehenden Varianten 2 und 3
werden durch die Schwierigkeiten der politischen und juristischen Umsetzbarkeit
wieder in Frage gestellt. Daher schlagen die Autoren einen schrittweisen
Umsetzungsplan vor, der vorsieht, die Varianten sequenziell zu realisieren.
Dabei sollen es sogenannte Exit Points erlauben, die Umsetzung der Varianten 2
oder sogar 3 abzubrechen, sollten sich diese als nicht erforderlich herausstellen.
Konkret würde Variante 1 «Politische Plattform mit Standardentwicklung» bis
Ende 2021 realisiert. Bei Bedarf würde anschliessend bis Ende 2024 die Variante
2 «Politische Plattform mit verbindlicher Standardsetzung» umgesetzt. Sollte
sich auch diese Lösung als ungenügend herausstellen, würde ab 2025 die
Schaffung einer Behörde in Angriff genommen.</p>



<p>Beurteilung: Viel zu langsam…</p>



<p>Wie sind diese Lösungsansätzen zu beurteilen?
Wenn wir uns die eingangs zitierten Herausforderungen vor Augen halten, ist
klar, dass Variante 1 völlig ungeeignet ist, öffentliche Verwaltungen bezüglich
Digitalisierung voranzubringen. Mit dieser Variante wird einzig der bereits als
problematisch erkannte Status quo fortgeführt. Die Varianten 2 und 3 sind zwar
radikaler im Ansatz, doch die Vorstellung, dass mit deren Umsetzung erst in
zwei beziehungsweise fünf Jahren begonnen würde, erscheint angesichts der heute
bestehenden Ineffizienz und Systemmängel sowie des rasanten technologischen
Wandels geradezu grotesk. Mit den heutigen Strukturen leisten wir uns nicht nur
ein Flickwerk an Systemen und Prozessen, sondern laufen Gefahr, den immer
grösser werdenden Rückstand nicht mehr aufholen zu können. Während die
Digitalisierung der öffentlichen Verwaltung schon vor der COVID-19-CPandemie schleppend
verlief, bietet sich nun die historische Chance, die digitale Transformation
der öffentlichen Verwaltung mit höchster Priorität und vereinten Kräften anzugehen.
</p>



<p>… und der Herausforderung unangemessen</p>



<p>Heisst dies, dass sofort eine Behörde
gemäss Variante 3 zu schaffen ist? Auf den ersten Blick erscheint dieser Ansatz
verheissungsvoll. Der neue hoheitliche Akteur wäre innerhalb der föderalen
Strukturen eine institutionelle Figur sui generis. Andere Behörden, die in
letzter Zeit geschaffen wurden (Swissmedic 2002, Finma 2007), decken eng
begrenzte Sachgebiete ab und setzen hauptsächlich Bundesrecht um; kantonale
oder gar kommunale Behörden sind von ihnen kaum direkt betroffen. Dies wäre
jedoch im Falle der neuen E-Government-Behörde anders: sie würde über alle
Politikfelder hinweg technische und organisatorische Standards und Prozesse
festlegen sowie strategische Projekte finanzieren, welche die digitale Realität
der Bundesbehörden, der Kantone und Gemeinden weitgehend vordefinieren. Damit
würden die für föderale Strukturen typischen Autonomien stark eingeschränkt
beziehungsweise es wäre zu erwarten, dass Gemeinden und Kantone die Arbeit der
neuen Behörde politisch blockieren würden. Es ist unklar, inwieweit sich die
Autoren des Schlussberichts dieser Problematik bewusst sind, denn in ihren
Ausführungen zu den möglichen konkreten Aufgaben der neuen Zielorganisation sind
sie erstaunlich vage. So werden Interoperabilitätsdienste, gemeinsame Register
und elektronischer Dokumentenaustausch als mögliche zukünftige Projekte
genannt, ohne zu erklären, was die substantiellen Unterschiede zwischen diesen
Konzepten im vorliegenden Kontext sind. Auch beim Begriff Standardsetzung und
-entwicklung bleibt unklar, in welchen Bereichen die Behörde standardisieren
soll – und in welchen nicht. Bei der Digitalisierung sind Standards essenziell.
Einmal festgelegt, lassen sich daraus Anforderungen an Software, Hardware,
Organisation, Governance etc. zu einem guten Teil direkt ableiten. Zudem werden
Standards nicht isoliert entwickelt und festgelegt, sondern müssen innerhalb
ihres Anwendungsbereichs mit anderen, bereits bestehenden Standards abgestimmt
werden. Über kurz oder lang führt dies zu einer umfassenden Standardisierung
aller relevanten Systeme und Prozesse. Standards sind also de facto viel mehr
als nur Standards, natürlich immer unter der Voraussetzung, dass sie auch von
allen umgesetzt werden.</p>



<p>Mit anderen Worten: Variante 3 basiert auf
dem Grundlagenirrtum, dass sich ein föderales, multidepartementales, dem
Rechtsstaat und direktdemokratischen Prozessen verpflichtetes Staatswesen mit
einer zusätzlichen, technokratischen Behörde digital transformieren lässt. Wie
in allen anderen Lebensbereichen erkennbar ist, verändern sich Werte, Prozesse
und Strukturen im Zuge der Digitalisierung grundlegend. Dabei erweisen sich die
technischen Herausforderungen oft als die geringfügigsten; die ebenfalls notwendigen
organisatorischen und kulturellen Veränderungen erfordern meist einen viel
grösseren Ressourceneinsatz. Der Staat kann sich dieser Dynamik und den
entsprechenden Herausforderungen nicht entziehen oder diesen mittels einer
Abkürzung aus dem Weg gehen.</p>



<p>Totalrevision der Bundesverfassung unumgänglich</p>



 Mittels einer Totalrevision der Bundesverfassung könnte sich die Schweiz auf der grünen Wiese neu gründen.  



<p>Soll das schweizerische Staatswesen für das
21. Jahrhundert fit gemacht werden, muss es von Grund auf erneuert werden.
Dabei stehen nicht die Prinzipien des Föderalismus, der direktdemokratischen
Partizipation, des Rechts- und Sozialstaats zur Diskussion, sondern deren
konkrete Ausgestaltung. Sie müssen im Rahmen einer Revision der
Bundesverfassung neu interpretiert werden. Inhaltlich sind dabei folgende drei
Fragen zu klären:</p>



  Welche staatlichen Aufgaben sind digitalisierbar?  Auf welcher föderalen Ebene werden diese Aufgaben am besten erfüllt?  Inwieweit müssten Kantone und Gemeinden fusioniert bzw. neuformiert werden, damit diese ihre Aufgaben selbständig erfüllen können?  



<p>Für die umfassende Neuregelung der
Digitalisierung auf Verfassungsebene wäre das Instrument der Teilrevision der
Bundesverfassung nicht zulässig, da das Gebot der Einheit der Materie verletzt
würde. Dagegen bietet sich die Totalrevision an, deren Ablauf im konkreten Fall
wie folgt aussehen könnte: </p>



  Bundesversammlung und -rat setzen eine Taskforce ein, die innerhalb von 6 Monaten folgende Aufgaben übernimmt: Entwicklung eines Grobkonzepts, wie die Totalrevision durchgeführt werden soll (rechtliche Aspekte, Organisatorisches, Personalfragen, Finanzierung etc.). Sie entwickelt auch geeignete Instrumente, um die Totalrevision partizipativ zu gestalten.  Sofern National- und Ständerat mehrheitlich für die Ausarbeitung einer totalrevidierten Verfassung sind, ist zwar keine Abstimmung mit Volk- und Ständemehr erforderlich; diese wäre jedoch zur erhöhten Legitimation des Vorhabens empfehlenswert.  Stimmen Volk und Stände der Ausarbeitung einer totalrevidierten Verfassung zu, beginnt die eigentliche Arbeit des Parlaments. Mittels Unterstützung der Verwaltung, Wissenschaft sowie möglichst aktiver Partizipation der Bürgerinnen und Bürger formuliert es die neuen Verfassungsbestimmungen.  Die totalrevidierte Verfassung ist Volk und Ständen vorzulegen. Da bei einer Annahme auch Kantone und Gemeinden neu fusioniert bzw. neuformiert würden, sind auch diese Reformen durch Volksabstimmungen zu legitimieren.  



<p>Zweifellos sind die Herausforderungen einer Totalrevision um ein Vielfaches grösser als jene der oben diskutierten Varianten 2 und 3. Der seit langem überfällige Quantensprung in der effizienten Erfüllung von Staatsaufgaben dürfte indessen anders nicht zu schaffen sein. Die direkten gesundheitlichen und wirtschaftlichen Konsequenzen der COVID-19-Pandemie werden auch für die Schweiz epochal ausfallen. Gelingt es jedoch, die Krise mit der Digitalisierung der Staatsaufgaben erforderlichen Totalrevision der Verfassung zu verbinden, wird die Schweiz nach Corona-Pandemie besser aufgestellt sein als je zuvor. </p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2 gives Switzerland a shot across the bow (Helvetia freighter of the Swiss deep-sea fleet).</p>



<p>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolfrauschenbach/">Dr. rer. publ. Rolf Rauschenbach</a></p>



<p>The fact
that public administration cannot be adequately and promptly digitized given the
existing structures has now also been recognized in Bern. In a study recently
published by the Federal Department of Finance (FDF) and the Conference of
Cantonal Governments (KdK), three options are presented for meeting this
challenge. On closer examination, however, they turn out to be unsuitable.
Switzerland must reinvent itself by means of a total revision of the Federal
Constitution.</p>



<p>The health,
economic, political and social consequences SARS-CoV-2 will have for
Switzerland still remain to be seen; there is no doubt however, that they will
be profound. Naturally, everything possible must be done in the short term to
keep the damage as low as possible. At the same time, it is appropriate to now start
thinking about the future that ensues. This is for two reasons: Firstly, the current
crisis is revealing weaknesses in the existing infrastructure, which has proven
costly even during normal times. Secondly, because only a crisis of the current
dimension might be able to provide the momentum needed to tackle the problems
that have long been accumulated. Although the current debate focuses on the
health system and its lack of digitization, the digitization of public
administration faces the same challenge.</p>



<p>Problematic
starting position</p>



<p>By way of
illustration, we can quote from the ‘Evaluation Report on the Effectiveness of
the Organization E-Government Switzerland in Implementing the E-Government
Strategy Switzerland’, which was prepared in November 2018 for the Planning
Committee of the Secretariat of E-Government Switzerland:</p>



<p>“The importance of e-government is recognized at all levels and there is a clear need for an intergovernmental organization […]. Many observers do not agree with expectations and the impact achieved. The demands have risen substantially, and the entire organization cannot meet them […]. There is a lack of a political vision and an expression of will for e-government […]. The political anchoring of E-Government Switzerland is not sufficient. The organizational establishment of this topic is thematically and hierarchically inappropriate for a federal office that focuses on IT […]. E-Government is a topic with transformational character and should not be located in a federal office entrusted with IT. In principle, E-Government is a topic of administrative procedures for the benefit of citizens and companies, as well as between administrative units, which has a strong political component and affects all levels of government […]. Too many actors are working on too small a range of tasks in this complex of issues, which leads to mutual obstruction and reduced effectiveness, also because of the need for mutual demarcation and the lack of a holistic approach […]. In particular, the construction of separate portals, apps and identity solutions must be critically examined […].”</p>



  The planned target organization stands on shaky ground.  



<p>Three solution variants</p>



<p>These assessments leave nothing to be desired in terms of clarity and remain still valid today. Against this background, the FDF and the KdK commissioned a study to develop solutions as to how the Confederation, the cantons and the municipalities can make the strategic management and coordination of their activities, initiatives and projects for digital transformation more effective. The corresponding final report “Digital Administration: Project to optimize federal steering and coordination” was published in October 2019. It proposes three variants as well as a possible implementation plan. These proposals will be presented and evaluated in the following section. An alternative approach is then outlined.</p>



  Option 1 “Political Platform for the Development of Standards” is moderate in its level of ambition and corresponds to a targeted, selective furthering of the status quo. The target organization will take on tasks in the areas of strategy development, standard setting, provision of strategic basic services, promotion of innovation and knowledge exchange, setting incentives and consulting. However, the target organization itself has no decision-making authority; as in the past, all decisions will only be declared binding in the decision-making procedures of the cantons and other institutional actors involved.  Option 2 “Political Platform with Binding Standard Setting” differs from option 1 in that the target organization can not only develop certain standards throughout Switzerland, but also set them bindingly. In areas other than standard setting, the target organization will continue to function only as a political platform without binding decision-making power. In order for the target organization to be able to declare standards binding, an amendment to the Federal Constitution is necessary.  In Option 3 “Authority / Sovereign Actor”, the target organization is given considerably greater powers. In addition to binding standard setting, the new authority will be endowed with autonomous and binding decision-making powers within the entire mandate and budget framework. The target organization is conceived here as a nationwide authority with its own legal personality and corresponding responsibilities, accountability, governance and financial sovereignty within the mandate and budget framework assigned to it. As with option 2, a constitutional amendment is also required here, as the autonomy of municipalities, cantons, the Confederation and other public institutions is considerably reduced.  



<p>Fainthearted
implementation plan</p>



<p>The report
does not give preference to any of the three options. The advantages of the
more far-reaching options 2 and 3 are again called into question by the
difficulties of political and legal feasibility. Therefore, the authors propose
a step-by-step implementation plan, which envisages that the options are
implemented sequentially. So-called exit points should make it possible to
cancel the implementation of options 2 or even 3 if they turn out unnecessary.
Specifically, option 1 “Political Platform for the Development of Standards”
would be implemented by the end of 2021. If necessary, option 2 “Political
Platform with Binding Standard Development” would then be implemented by
the end of 2024. Should this solution also prove to be insufficient, the
creation of an authority would commence from 2025 on.</p>



<p>Evaluation:
Way too slow…</p>



<p>How are
these approaches to be judged? If we consider the challenges cited at the
beginning, it is clear that option 1 is completely unsuitable for advancing
public administrations with regard to digitization. This variant merely
continues the status quo, which has already been proven as problematic. While options
2 and 3 are more radical in their approach, the idea that their implementation
would not begin for two and five years respectively seems incongruous in view
of the inefficiency and system deficiencies that exist today and the rapid pace
of technological change. With today’s structures, we cannot afford to have a
patchwork of systems and processes that run the risk of not being able to catch
up with the ever-growing backlog. While the digitization of public
administration was slow before the COVID 19 pandemic, we are now presented with
a historic opportunity to tackle the digital transformation of the public
administration with the highest priority and combined forces.</p>



<p>… and
inadequate to the challenge</p>



<p>Does this
mean that an authority according to option 3 must be created immediately? At
first glance, this approach seems promising. The new sovereign actor would be a
sui generis institutional figure within the federal structures. Other authorities
that have been created recently (Swissmedic 2002, Finma 2007) cover narrowly
defined areas and mainly implement federal law; cantonal or even municipal
authorities are hardly directly affected by them. However, this would be
different in the case of the new e-government authority: it would set technical
and organizational standards and processes across all policy areas and finance
strategic projects that largely pre-define the digital reality of the federal
authorities, the cantons and the communes. This would severely infringe upon autonomies
typical of federal structures and it could be expected that municipalities and
cantons would politically block the work of the new authority. It is unclear to
what extent the authors of the final report are aware of this problem, as the
statements on the possible concrete tasks of the new target organization remain
rather vague. Interoperability services, common registers and electronic
document exchange are mentioned as possible future projects, without explaining
what the substantial differences between these concepts are in the present
context. With regards to the concept of standard setting and development, it
also remains unclear in which areas the authority should standardize – and in
which it should not. Standards are essential for digitization. Once they have
been defined, requirements for software, hardware, organization, governance
etc. can to a large extent be derived directly from them. Furthermore,
standards are not developed and defined in isolation, but must be coordinated
with other, already existing standards within their area of application. Sooner
or later this leads to a comprehensive standardization of all relevant systems
and processes. Standards are therefore de facto much more than just standards,
provided of course that they are implemented by everyone.</p>



<p>In other
words, option 3 is based on the fundamental misconception that a federal,
multi-departmental state system committed to the rule of law and direct
democratic processes can be digitally transformed with an additional,
technocratic authority. As can be seen in all other areas of life, values,
processes and structures change fundamentally in the course of digitization.
The technical challenges often prove to be the least significant; the organizational
and cultural changes that are also necessary usually require a much greater
deployment of resources. The state cannot escape these dynamics and the
corresponding challenges or take a shortcut to avoid them.</p>



<p>Total revision of the Federal Constitution unavoidable</p>



 By means of a total revision of the Federal Constitution, Switzerland could reinvent itself on a greenfield.  



<p>If the
Swiss state system is to be made fit for the 21st century, it must be
completely overhauled. The principles of federalism, direct-democratic
participation, the rule of law and the social state are not under discussion
here, but the exact form that they would take. They must be reinterpreted in
the context of a revision of the Federal Constitution. In terms of content, the
following three questions must be clarified:</p>



  Which state tasks can be digitized?  At which federal level are these tasks best performed?  To what extent would cantons and communes have to be merged or restructured so that they can fulfil their tasks independently?  



<p>The
instrument of partial revision of the Federal Constitution would not be
permissible for a comprehensive reorganization, as the single-subject rule
would be violated. The suitable instrument would be a total revision of the Federal
Constitution; in this specific case, the procedure could be as follows: </p>



  The Federal Assembly and the Federal Council shall set up a task force which, within 6 months, shall undertake the following tasks: Development of a rough concept of how the total revision is to be carried out (legal aspects, organizational matters, personnel issues, financing, etc.) It also develops suitable instruments to make the total revision participatory.  If a majority of the National Council and the Council of States is in favor of drawing up a totally revised constitution, no consultation with a majority of the people and the cantons is required; however, this would be advisable to increase the legitimacy of the project.  If the people and the cantons approve the drafting of a totally revised constitution, the actual work for the parliament begins. It formulates the new constitutional provisions with the support of the administration, academia and the participation of the citizens.  The totally revised Constitution shall be submitted to the People and the Cantons. Since, if adopted, the cantons and communes would be merged or reformed, these reforms must also be approved by popular votes.  



<p>There is no
doubt that the challenges of a total revision are many times greater than those
of options 2 and 3 discussed above, but the long overdue quantum leap in the
efficient fulfilment of state tasks is unlikely to be achieved otherwise. The
direct health and economic consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic will be
epochal for Switzerland. However, if the crisis can be successfully combined
with a total revision of the constitution, which is necessary for the digitalization
of government tasks, Switzerland will be in a better position than ever before
after the corona pandemic.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/ashford">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>As soon as national lockdowns began to limit the spread of Covid-19 it was clear that the world would never be the same again, and last week’s Microsoft Build conference has highlighted what some of those changes will be, starting with the event itself being fully virtual for the first time.</p>
 Remote working set to increase longer-term 
<p>While remote working was becoming increasingly popular in the run-up to the Covid-19 crisis, few organizations were well equipped to accommodate this. In the past two months, however, just about every organization has had to find a way of enabling employees to work remotely and everyone has adapted.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Microsoft and other software makers have responded with more tools and support for secure remote working than ever before. As a result, remote working or home working will increase several-fold and become far more common than it was in the past as employees and businesses count the cost and time savings and other benefits.</p>
<p>For more on working from home during the pandemic crisis, see the blog post by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/working-securely-at-home-during-the-pandemic">me</a> and my colleagues <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/tolbert/top-5-work-from-home-cybersecurity-recommendations">John Tolbert</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/home-office-in-the-times-of-pandemic">Matthias Reinwarth</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-donts-of-it-in-the-times-of-crisis">Alexei Balaganski</a></p>
 Cloud first strategy to become common 
<p>The only way many organizations have been able to continue business in the face of restrictions imposed by national lockdowns is to embrace cloud-based services, often way ahead of schedule and without any trial period.</p>
<p>Covid-19 has become the unexpected catalyst for rapid cloud adoption, which has in turn proved the value proposition for many organizations that have been sitting on the fence. Covid-19 has forced the hand of conservative organizations unwilling to make the leap. But now that they have, the value proposition is clear, and these organizations are highly likely to pursue a “cloud first” strategy in future without bothering with lengthy proof of concept trials.</p>
<p>The pandemic crisis has shown the power and agility of the cloud, according to Rajesh Jha, executive vice president, experiences and devices at Microsoft. Similarly, it has shown organizations how to enable business processes in a new world and new ways of doing things.</p>
<p>For a discussion on the benefits of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/why-iam-from-the-cloud-is-the-new-normal">Identity and Access Management delivered from the cloud</a>, please see this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/why-iam-from-the-cloud-is-the-new-normal">video</a> by KuppingerCole principal analyst, Martin Kuppinger.</p>
 Spotlight on innovation 
<p>According to Microsoft, another significant effect of the pandemic crisis has been an increase in requests from organizations for help in becoming digital organizations and thereby more resilient.</p>
<p>In the face the crisis, there has been demand for rapid innovation, according to Julia White, corporate vice president, Azure at Microsoft, with a huge increase in uptake of Microsoft’s low code <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/powerplatform/">Power Platform</a> aimed at enabling rapid development.</p>
<p>In a post Covid-19 world, organizations are expected to become more “tech-intensive” and pursue innovation through adoption of a wide range of development tools, including low code development tools, as well as adopting cloud services and open-source code.</p>
<p>All this means that the need for developers has never been greater because they play a critical role in driving innovation. “There are lots of [legacy] systems that need to be modified, so innovation is going to be extremely important,” said White. Although Microsoft already provides support for organizations seeking to modernize their applications, Microsoft expects to see an uptick in demand for these services.</p>
 Upskilling to become a key focus 
<p>The drive toward digital transformation, the need for innovation and greater use of the cloud means organizations need to become more focussed on upskilling their workforce to keep up with the rapid pace of change in business and supporting technology.</p>
<p>For its part, Microsoft is continually adding modules to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/">Microsoft Learn</a> platform to acquire, update and certify Microsoft skills, with a reported 25% increase in active users since the start of the pandemic crisis.</p>
 A new way of doing business 
<p>Taken together, it is easy to see how the forced adaptation to enabling business under lockdown will have lasting effects on the way organizations operate in future and how their employees work and collaborate to get more done at a faster rate than ever before.</p>
<p>For a discussion on the topic of collaboration, please see a discussion by some of my colleagues on the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/five-golden-rules-for-efficient-virtual-collaboration">five golden rules of virtual collaboration</a> and the measures necessary for <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/how-to-ensure-your-video-conferences-security">securing online communication platforms</a>.</p>
<p>In retrospect, Covid-19 will not only be remembered as the catastrophe that resulted in the tragic loss of life, but also as the catalyst for rapid cloud adoption and accelerated innovation that enabled a new way of working and doing business, and there will be no going back.</p>
<p>For more about coping with the pandemic crisis and cloud adoption, see our <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/">research</a> and our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/kcmasterclass-resilience-pandemic">KuppingerCole MasterClass on Business Resilience Management in a Pandemic Crisis</a>. For actionable guidance, our team of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/advisory">advisors</a> can assist you in developing tactics and strategies.</p>
 Virtual events will become more common 
<p>Like KuppingerCole and all other organizations that have hosted <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/virtualevents">live events</a> in the past, Microsoft has had to “re-imagine” Microsoft Build, but indications are that virtual events are likely to become more common in a post-pandemic world.</p>
<p>Covid-19 has been the catalyst for developing ways of presenting events virtually, and now that ways have been found to do so technically and proven to be so successful, all that remains is to refine ways of making virtual events as interactive, social, personal and intimate as live events.</p>
<p>As a result, the first-ever virtual Microsoft Build has attracted more developers and analysts than ever before to become truly global 25 times more registrations compared with previous years. Clearly, the personal connections of live events are missing and all the chance encounters you can have.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole also believes there might be fewer physical events in future, but that key events such as the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021">KuppingerCole European Identity Conference</a>, especially where networking is essential, will remain physical or become hybrid. We also expect there will be post-pandemic demand for face-to-face meetings – some things can’t be replaced by going completely virtual. On the other hand, we are continually adding new virtual formats, beyond <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/webinars">webinars</a>, such as our own <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/virtualevents">Virtual Conferences</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/virtualacademy">Master Class</a> online training, delivering tailored content and formats for everyone.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Over the past years, Microsoft has spent significant effort to make Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) the central platform for identities in Microsoft environments and beyond. Microsoft now announced several new capabilities that help to support further use cases.</p>
 New features in Azure AD 
<p>One of these is the support for FIDO2 security key sign in for hybrid environments, consisting of both Azure AD and on-premises Active Directory. FIDO2 as a standard allows using a variety of authenticators, including biometric authentication, with various applications. This extension allows for using a broad range of authenticators in environments that include both flavors of Microsoft Active Directory.</p>
<p>Several new features address the specific needs of providing access for first-line workers. These include delegated user management capabilities, SMS sign-in with one-time passwords, and “single sign out” for shared devices.</p>
<p>Other new features include improvements in the self-service interfaces, for conditional access, and for access to 3rd party applications. The latter is of specific relevance for many organizations because it allows accessing all types of applications including legacy applications from Azure AD and the My Apps portal. For many customers, licensing enhancements within the free Azure AD edition for SSO and MFA will be of major relevance.</p>
<p>At the Build 2020 conference, Microsoft announced additional features, such as the integration of Azure AD APIs into Microsoft Graph for providing a single API for all Microsoft 365 services. Also, the integration capabilities with social identity providers (IdPs) and with target applications for CIAM (Consumer IAM) use cases are extended, plus many more new features being added to Azure AD. More information is available in Microsoft’s blogs on <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/bg-p/Identity">Azure AD</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/">security</a>.</p>
 Azure AD first, on-premises Active Directory second? 
<p>Without going into too much detail regarding all the announcements Microsoft has made, the evolution of Azure AD raises strategic questions. One of these questions is whether and when it is time to make Azure AD take over the central role on-premises Active Directory still plays in most organizations.</p>
<p>The simple answer is that it is high time to prepare for that shift, whenever an organization intends to or already actually does use Azure AD. If so, then Azure AD should become the strategic system, instead of on-premises Active Directory, which increasingly will move into a legacy state, with users being synchronized from Azure AD, not to Azure AD.</p>
 Azure AD: Strategic element of IAM or just a target system? 
<p>The even more important question is whether Azure AD is just a target system within IAM (Identity and Access Management) or a central element of the IAM infrastructure and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37p6G9WNmNk">future Identity Fabric</a> of organizations.</p>
<p>There is no simple answer to that question. This depends on many factors. However, the question must be asked. The potential of Azure AD in becoming a cornerstone of the future IAM infrastructure of businesses is apparent, but it depends on factors such as whether Office 365 is used or not (if not, the relevance of Azure AD will be lower), such as the current technologies in place, such as strategic sourcing, and many more. However, with every addition to its capabilities, Microsoft is increasing the competitiveness of Azure AD in the IAM market. Thus, customers should carefully evaluate the potential future role and make a well-thought-out decision on this.</p>
