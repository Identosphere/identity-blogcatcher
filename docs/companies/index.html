 The Block Perspective — March&nbsp;2023  European Crypto Regulatory Climate and its Impact on Crypto Ecosystem <p>Welcome to the first edition of The Block Perspective, Shyft’s monthly thematic overview! Here, we will be diving deep into some of the most pressing issues and trends in the industry, offering fresh insights and analysis from our team of experts. From the latest regulatory developments to real-world use cases and market trends, we will give you a comprehensive view of the blockchain landscape and the opportunities it presents.</p><p>Today, we are excited to delve into the European crypto regulatory landscape and explore its current state and future implications for the industry. We will examine the specifics of these regulations, from the EU’s MiCA proposal to 5AMLD, and explore how they shape the broader crypto market. Let’s not wait for any further and dive straight into this complex and ever-changing landscape and gain a better understanding of the future of digital assets in&nbsp;Europe.</p> The Delicate Balance: Europe’s Crypto Conundrum <p>Europe faces a pivotal task in crafting crypto regulations that protect privacy, autonomy, and innovation while preserving user experience. The contentious MiCA proposal presents a significant challenge, sparking debate and potentially jeopardizing blockchain’s foundational principles.</p><p>Achieving the optimal balance is vital to prevent hindering innovation, talent growth, and user privacy. Privacy-enhancing technologies and DeFi platforms offer viable solutions, necessitating strong collaboration between policymakers and industry stakeholders to ensure a seamless user experience.</p><p>Ultimately, Europe must champion cooperation and bolster cutting-edge solutions to effectively navigate this regulatory terrain. By doing so, Europe can unlock the full potential of cryptocurrencies, uphold their distinctive values, and maintain a user-centric approach that respects privacy. This will create a win-win situation for users, regulators, and industry stakeholders, fostering a thriving crypto ecosystem.</p> Dynamics of the World’s Largest Crypto&nbsp;Market <p>A year ago, Europe was proclaimed the world’s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/europe-is-now-world-s-largest-cryptocurrency-market">largest cryptocurrency market</a>. The Central, Northern, and Western Europe regions, in particular, had become responsible for one-fourth of all global cryptocurrency activity, amounting to more than US$1 trillion in digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Large crypto transactions by institutional investors rose from US$1.4 billion in July 2020 to more than US$46 billion in June 2021. Much of this phenomenal volume stemmed from transactions worth more than US$10&nbsp;million.</p><p>One way to decipher the popularity of digital currencies in European countries is through the percentage of the invested population. For instance, as high as <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/crypto-popularity-in-europeans-union-nations/">10–20%</a> of the population in several European countries invested in crypto assets, including Slovenia, Croatia, Luxembourg, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Slovakia, Austria, Portugal, Czech Republic, Estonia, Netherlands, Lithuania, and&nbsp;Ireland.</p><p>Realizing the growing market of cryptocurrencies in Europe, a long list of digital asset exchanges is making a b-line to enter the lucrative European market. In fact, according to a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/11/as-crypto-crashes-coinbase-bets-big-on-europe/">report</a> published in January 2023, Coinbase, one of the most well-known crypto exchanges at a global level, was looking forward to “leveraging its status as the lone public crypto exchange in a do-or-die play to increase market share across&nbsp;Europe.”</p><p>With renowned crypto businesses and investors looking forward to augmenting their positions in major European markets, it is high time we take a closer look at the European crypto regulatory climate.</p><p>Existing regulations and legislations play a key role in shaping an industry ecosystem. And crypto assets are no exception. We will now look at the prevailing crypto regulatory ecosystem in some of the major European economies.</p> Germany <p>Considered one of the world’s most crypto-friendly countries, Germany started treating cryptocurrencies as financial instruments in 2011. And although this isn’t equal to making cryptocurrencies legal tender, Germany did greenlight crypto’s use for payment purposes, even before most of the world started taking digital assets seriously.</p><p>Any German crypto company, whether it wants to offer its services to German residents or not, must obtain a license from <a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/FinTech/Geschaeftsmodelle/DLT_Blockchain_Krypto/DLT_Blockchain_Krypto_node_en.html">BaFin</a> or the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority. However, when it comes to companies located outside Germany, they only have to obtain a BaFin license when actively soliciting German residents. And in case German residents register on their platforms voluntarily, they aren’t required to seek a license from&nbsp;BaFin.</p><p>Having implemented 5AMLD in 2020, crypto businesses are also required to enforce strict KYC/AML controls and report all suspicious transactions to BaFin as and when they come across&nbsp;one.</p> France <p>The French crypto <a href="https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/16/textes/l16b0826_texte-adopte-commission#D_Article_5_bis">regulations</a> want companies to register with the Financial Markets Authority to demonstrate their compliance with basic money laundering and governance norms. However, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/13/france-to-tighten-crypto-registration-rules-next-january/">reports</a> published in mid-February 2023 show that no operator has yet received such a license, hinting at procedural burdens associated with the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Despite this, <a href="https://decrypt.co/122455/france-moves-ahead-tighter-crypto-rules-new-entrants">sixty</a> companies have opted for simpler registration under the country’s prevailing two-tier system. Reportedly, these companies will not be affected by the new compliance requirements coming into&nbsp;effect.</p><p>The prevailing two-tier system seeks crypto businesses to apply for a simple registration with local financial regulator L’Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) to operate and could also opt for full licensing with more disclosures. However, it is also a fact that none of the French companies has yet opted for a full licensing process.</p><p>To explain this briefly, the regulation of Digital Asset Service Providers — known as DASPs or PSANs in French — is a two-tiered regime. The first tier seeks mandatory registration of providers of services in crypto custody and crypto-fiat exchanges. The second tier, known as the optional license, is for any digital asset service provider that requests such licenses and meets underlying requirements.</p><p>Essentially, crypto-custodians and crypto-fiat exchanges in France must register with the Authority. However, full licensing isn’t a must, at least for&nbsp;now.</p> Spain <p>The Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing is one of the most crucial <a href="https://www.mariscal-abogados.com/regulation-of-cryptocurrencies-in-spain/#:~:text=Companies%20working%20with%20cryptocurrencies%20in,money%2C%20financial%20instrument%20or%20value.">regulations</a> for crypto start-ups in Spain, which also requires virtual asset service providers to register with the Spanish Central&nbsp;Bank.</p><p>The second pertinent legislation in this matter has to do with the recent circular of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV). The circular — aimed at protecting potential investors — requires companies that advertise crypto as an investment object in Spain to comply with several requirements.</p> Netherlands <p>The Netherlands is a European country, with 12% of its total population invested in crypto. The country’s crypto-fiat exchanges and custodian wallet providers fall under the supervision of De Nederlandsche Bank or the Dutch National Bank. Initial Coin Offerings in the Netherlands come under financial supervision only if they qualify as securities or units in an investment fund.</p><p>The Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act (<a href="https://www.mariscal-abogados.com/regulation-of-cryptocurrencies-in-spain/#:~:text=Companies%20working%20with%20cryptocurrencies%20in,money%2C%20financial%20instrument%20or%20value.">WWFT</a>) is the key crypto regulation in the Netherlands, which mandates all crypto-related entities to register with the DNB. In 2020, the WWFT was amended to incorporate rules that stemmed from European law, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5).</p> Slovenia <p>Keeping up with its image of being one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions globally, Slovenia has simplified the licensing mechanism for VASPs. Instead of going through a tiresome and intensive licensing process, crypto companies can enter their data into the register created and administered by Slovenia’s National&nbsp;Bank.</p><p>Although, in general, Slovenia accords a six-month deadline for crypto-related businesses to register with Slovenia’s Central Bank, the provided time is comparatively lesser for crypto exchanges and custodian wallet providers, as they have been given only three&nbsp;months.</p><p>The penalizing provisions for non-compliance may lead to fines from 6,000 Euros to 120,000 Euros for both private individuals and companies.</p><p>While, so far, we’ve seen what some of the European nations are doing in the crypto regulatory space, we must remember that the European Union has plans to introduce an EU-wide crypto regulatory mechanism. Expectedly, this regulatory framework, known as MiCA, would take away the regional aberrations and make the crypto ecosystem homogeneous.</p> Adoption of the Draft MiCA Regulation by the European Parliament <p>On Monday, March 14th, the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee <a href="https://www.simmons-simmons.com/en/publications/cl0vtj84109uh0a82m8a1caqe/the-draft-mica-regulation-adopted-by-the-european-parliament">adopted</a> its mandate to negotiate new rules relating to crypto-assets. The key provisions in the draft included the overarching themes of transparency in the ecosystem, communication, authorization, and control of operations.</p><p>To understand the impact that MiCA could bring to the European Crypto Regulatory Climate and the continent’s crypto ecosystem, we must look at the regulation in&nbsp;detail.</p> What Does MiCA Recommend? <p>The European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of the European Union agreed on MiCA on June 30th, 2022. MiCA stands for Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, which is seen as the first comprehensive regulatory regime made specifically for crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Since the regulation is yet to come into effect, we would concentrate on the <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-7694-2022-INIT/en/pdf">procedural document</a>, which serves as the basis for the three institutions to negotiate among themselves.</p> How MiCA Defines Crypto Assets and What it Means for the Crypto Ecosystem? <p>Crypto assets — according to MiCA — are digital representations of value or rights that could be transferred and stored electronically. The tool to accomplish the transfer and storage is Distributed Ledger Technology.</p><p>This definition covers a lot more ground than what we generally understand from the term crypto assets. It is because the term crypto asset, defined in MiCA, does not refer to cryptography.</p><p>However, this definition was adopted by the Council of the EU without changes. The opinion of the contradicting experts and bodies was that digital asset could be a more appropriate term if the Council went by their definition.</p><p>Many cited the UK Crypto Assets Task Force’s definition of the crypto-asset to be more appropriate — “a cryptographically secured digital representation of value or contractual rights that uses some type of DLT and can be transferred, stored, or traded electronically.”</p> Asset Categories according to&nbsp;MiCA <p>The Markets in Crypto Assets regulation has put crypto-assets into four categories: Asset-Referenced Token, e-Money tokens, Utility Token, and a category for all other crypto-assets that do not fall within the above&nbsp;three.</p>  Asset-Referenced Tokens are essentially stablecoins. However, these tokens could use assets other than fiat currencies for stabilization.  E-Money tokens are stablecoins that use one single fiat currency for value referencing.  A Utility token — as evident from the name — provides access to a good or service that the token issuer has up for&nbsp;offer.  The fourth category of tokens may include all other types of assets that do not fall into the above-mentioned categories. These could be exchange tokens or security tokens, or something else.  <p>The crypto industry players must understand the categories they fall into and how the regulations would work in shaping their categories.</p> What Would MiCA Mean for Asset-Referenced Tokens? <p>The issuer of any asset-referenced token would have to establish themselves in the European Union and obtain mandatory authorization to offer such tokens to the public in the EU or admit them for trading on a crypto-asset exchange.</p><p>One of the benefits of MiCA being a bloc-wide regulation is that authorization — once granted — would stay valid throughout the EU. The prerequisites of authorization for asset-referenced tokens include specified capital requirements: the higher of 350,000 Euros, 2% of the daily average of the reserve over the preceding six months, and a quarter of the fixed overheads of the preceding year.</p> What Would MiCA Mean for E-Money&nbsp;Tokens? <p>MiCA suggests that for any institution to become the issuer of an e-money token, it must have authorization as an electronic money institution or credit institution.</p><p>The European Banking Authority will not be the lead regulator if at least 80% of the token holders and transaction volume are concentrated in the home state. Instead, the home regulator will stay as the supervisory authority.</p> What Would MiCA Mean for Non-Stablecoins? <p>Tokens, not asset-referenced or e-money, are expected to face a relatively lighter regime. However, the issuer of such non-stablecoin crypto assets must obtain relevant regulatory approval of a white paper with specified content and form requirements.</p><p>However, certain non-stablecoin crypto-assets must not obligatorily fulfill white paper requirements. These non-stablecoins include crypto assets offered for free, automatically created as a reward during the validation process, a utility token for goods/services already in existence or operation, can be used for goods and services in a limited network for merchants, etc.</p> 5AML — Fifth Anti-money Laundering Directive <p>The Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, or 5AMLD, has expanded the anti-money laundering obligations beyond what its predecessor (4AMLD)&nbsp;did.</p><p>Before 5AMLD, there was no set of AML and CFT-related requirements for crypto companies operating in the European Union or serving residents of its member states, but that changed with its introduction in 2018. However, the member states were given sufficient time to implement the directive, with January 2020 being the deadline.</p><p>Since then, all crypto businesses within the European Union, including those operating a crypto exchange, custodian e-wallets, or more, must register with the local regulatory authority where they operate or plan to offer their services. They must also monitor and report all suspicious transactions to relevant authorities.</p> Shocking U-Turn: EU Parliament Reintroduces Crypto Payment Restrictions <p>The European Parliament has reached a consensus on the final text of an anti-money laundering bill set for a vote on March 28, which, to much dismay of the broader crypto community, brings back restrictions on crypto payments involving self-hosted wallets.</p><p>The updated bill caps commercial cash transactions at €7,000 and imposes a €1,000 limit for crypto transactions involving self-hosted wallets, with the cap applying only if the customer or beneficial owner cannot be identified.</p><p>MEPs have further tasked the European Commission with evaluating the commercial payment rule in three years to ensure alignment with the European Union’s digital identity framework and the requirements of the newly proposed Anti-Money Laundering Authority.</p> The Overall Ramifications: What it Was &amp; What it Could&nbsp;Become? <p>Before MiCA was conceived, crypto-assets were not imagined as part of monolithic European legislation.</p><p>Establishing a harmonized regulation across the continent would help market players diversify their businesses through definitive crypto asset strategies. It will offer healthy protection mechanisms to non-regulated crypto assets, related service providers, and consumers. However, the web of compliance requisites will become more intricate for the service providers.</p><p>The businesses would have to improve their operational efficiency to keep the public informed about their pricing process and trading volumes in real time and settle all trades within the same day trades have happened. Exchanges would have to keep their funds separate from that of their&nbsp;clients.</p><p>The registration might become yet more complicated if the MiCA authorities ask crypto businesses to get their businesses insured. It could mean enhanced levels of operational hassle and increased involvement of traditional finance organizations like banks and insurance agencies.</p><p>To conclude, any regulatory framework in any industry may end up doing two things. First, it could make the industry more efficient and fair by enabling a variety of participants to expand and diversify in an organized manner.</p><p>On the other hand, it may disrupt the existing equilibrium and pace of growth. It may turn the process unnecessarily complicated and inherently inefficient. However, only time will tell how the European crypto regulations will steer the&nbsp;market.</p> Crypto Mindfulness <p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>We hear it all the time: “Humans are the weakest link in cybersecurity”. Unfortunately, this contemptuous characterization of human nature is deeply ingrained in the industry. While human error is still the driving force behind a number of security breaches and incidents, the modern cybersecurity landscape has become too broad and sophisticated to be managed by individuals alone. By modernizing and implementing the right tools, however, we may be able to reduce and improve the impact of the human factor on cybersecurity.</p>
 The Alternative? Passwordless Authentication 
<p>Security could be dramatically enhanced by modernizing authentication systems and introducing new technologies. It is much easier to blame the end user for a security breach than to address the larger and more challenging issue of getting rid of legacy systems. Luckily, the continued momentum of passwordless authentication technologies is one of the key trends in the identity and access management (IAM) space.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, there has been a significant uptake in the adoption of passwordless authentication solutions in both enterprise and consumer use cases. Passwordless is becoming the new normal, and the use of passwords is becoming less and less relevant. For enterprises, this means a new opportunity to build new authentication architectures and leverage the potential of standards such as FIDO.</p>
 FIDO as a driving force 
<p>The non-profit organization FIDO ("Fast IDentity Online") Alliance was launched in 2013 to develop and promote authentication standards. As a result, the FIDO Alliance has introduced a set of open, scalable and interoperable specifications to reduce the reliance on passwords.FIDO2 is the latest specification released by the Alliance, offering a more flexible approach that supports a range of authentication factors, including biometrics, security keys and other devices. WebAuthn is a web standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that implements the FIDO2 specifications for web applications.</p>
<p>The role of FIDO2 and WebAuthn in passwordless authentication is to provide a secure, standardized, and user-friendly approach to authentication on the web that eliminates the reliance on passwords and improves user experience at the same time. FIDO2 and WebAuthn use public key cryptography and strong authentication to enable passwordless authentication while reducing the risk of password-related attacks, such as phishing and credential stuffing.</p>
<p>FIDO has also worked with companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple to integrate and adopt FIDO standards across their operating systems. More recently, these companies have announced plans to support passkeys on their platforms. For example, Apple's latest update, iOS 16 for iPhones as well as macOS Ventura for Macs, now supports passkeys, while Google introduced support for passkeys in December 2022.</p>
 The adoption of passkeys 
<p>In a nutshell, a passkey is a type of authenticator that works by generating a unique cryptographic key pair. The private key is securely stored on the user's device (such as a USB key or mobile phone), while the public key is shared with the FIDO server. During authentication, the passkey generates a digital signature using the private key and sends it to the server along with the user's credentials. The server then verifies the signature using the public key, and if the signature is valid, the user is granted access.</p>
<p>The use of passkeys by these companies is likely to contribute to the widespread adoption of a passwordless future. As a consequence, the transition to phishing-resistant forms of authentication will continue to gain momentum. Companies need to evaluate the assurance level they seek for their relying applications and, if appropriate, leverage the benefits of passwordless technology. Nevertheless, by eliminating passwords and providing users with a more modern authentication system, organizations can strengthen security and lessen the impact of the human factor.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>The European Union (EU) has consistently demonstrated its innovative approach to technology and data protection through the implementation of groundbreaking laws such as the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679&amp;qid=1679610648554">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281">Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS) regulation</a>. These legal frameworks have set the bar high for data protection, privacy, and digital identity standards, establishing the EU as a global leader in these domains. As a result, many countries around the world have been inspired to follow suit, adopting similar regulations and best practices that align with the EU’s progressive stance on ensuring security, interoperability, and trust in the digital age.</p>
<p>This conversation with Viky started with a discussion around the history and evolution of eIDAS. One part of eIDAS is related to electronic identification and electronic identity, and the other is related to trust services, which include electronic signatures, timestamps, electronic seals, preservation of electronic signatures over a long period of time, and certificates for website authentication. As part of the legislative process, the European Commission conducted an assessment of the eIDAS regulation after several years of implementation to determine if any changes or adjustments were necessary. This assessment took place from the regulation’s inception in 2014 until 2020. During this period, it was observed that only 14 member states had notified electronic identification schemes in place, which means that only around 59% of citizens had access to an electronic identity mechanism. Out of these 14 electronic identity schemes, only seven were mobile. As a result, it became apparent that the regulation was not meeting the expectations and needs of citizens, who increasingly prefer to use mobile devices for accessing services and information.</p>
<p>We then shifted the conversation to talk about <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">The European Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework</a> and how it’s going to be implemented in 4 pilot projects across various use cases. They are composed of representatives from different member states and the private sector. The mix of participants, including both member states and the private sector, was one of the main requirements.</p>
<p>The European Commission launched a call for applications and selected four winning consortia:</p>
 
 The first is the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EUDI Wallet Consortium (EWC)</a>, which focuses on mobile travel credentials and organizational digital identity. It covers all European Union countries, including Ukraine, and has participants from over 60 countries in both the public and private sectors. 
 Next is the <a href="https://www.nobidconsortium.com/">NOBID Consortium</a>, which is primarily focused on payment issuance and acceptance. 
 The third consortium is <a href="https://www.digital-identity-wallet.eu/">Potential</a>, with various use cases such as electronic registration, account opening, electronic driving licences, and electronic prescriptions. 
 Lastly, the fourth consortium, <a href="https://dc4eu.eu/">DC4EU</a>, is focused on educational credentials and professional qualifications. 
 
<p>These consortia aim to cover the main use cases that could lead to the widespread adoption of the eID Wallet and the new European electronic identity ecosystem.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Viky and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
 
 Understanding eIDAS 2.0: its history, lessons learned and implications. 
 How the current ecosystem of trust providers will change and adapt under new eIDAS 2.0 regulation. 
 The EUDI Wallet Architecture Reference Framework (ARF), and how it aligns with eIDAS. 
 Person Identification Data (PID) Providers, and the differences between Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers and Non-Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers. 
 Exploring the 4 Large Scale Pilots, their use cases and their use of PID. 
 Some of the various associations collaborating alongside eIDAS and the large scale pilots (e.g., <a href="https://www.etsi.org/">ETSI</a>, <a href="https://cloudsignatureconsortium.org/">CSC</a>, <a href="https://inatba.org/">INATBA</a>). 
 Trust lists, trusted issuers/verifiers and governance! 
 Current and upcoming challenges and opportunities. 
 
<p>I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I did. There is tons to learn for anyone interested in how a digital identity program start from a legal framework, and be coordinated across multiple nation states and actors.</p>

<p>One of the most critical aspects of standardizing Sign-In with Ethereum is allowing wallets to interpret messages for better UX and increased safety when users sign into apps and services. </p><p>We're now happy to announce a significant step forward in Sign-In with Ethereum adoption with a direct integration into MetaMask.</p><p>Previously, when users were prompted to sign a SIWE message, they were given a human-readable message to sign, as installed by the app-specific developers. This included things such as:</p>  The intent of the user (wanting to sign in)  Additional statements (such as agreeing to a Terms of Service), and  Other information, such as the domain where the user was and a nonce  <p>However, until SIWE adoption became more prevalent, it was challenging to include additional UI/UX enhancements within the wallet layer to create an even better user interaction for signing in. When wallets expect a standardized message format for signing, they can build much better UX to create “Sign-In” experiences more closely aligned with what we expect in traditional web applications.</p><p>Now, when an app or service follows the<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> Sign-In with Ethereum standard</a>, MetaMask can parse that message and give the user a friendlier interface – prompting them to “Sign-In” rather than sign a message:</p><p>The required fields are still prominently displayed for the user, but the intent has now been clarified: this is a "Sign-In request." </p><p>The intention of the message, and the action the user is taking, are made much more evident. This is a leap forward for user safety in Web3, where users could previously be easily confused about whether they were signing into a service versus authorizing a malicious actor to transfer assets out of their account. Now, in Metamask, users can expect to see a “Sign-In” button and a user experience much more similar to what they would expect in a Web2 application. </p><p>Another prominent feature of this integration that improves user safety in Web3 is domain binding. Domain binding is present to make sure users don't become the victim of phishing attacks when sites ask users to sign in, but the message doesn’t match the website they’re actually on. If this happens, the user is prompted with a warning and they must explicitly select to move ahead, accepting the risks of a potential phishing attack. </p><p>These efforts to provide user-friendly security and safety enhancements across Web3 wallet experiences should increase the sense of confidence that users have interacting with dapps.</p><p>We look forward to working with additional wallet providers to continue offering user protections and benefits through Sign-In with Ethereum, and with developers in the space looking to integrate the standard.</p><p>For developers, we recently <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">released SSX</a> as the easiest way to get started with Sign-In with Ethereum and incorporate these newly improved signing-in experiences with MetaMask for end users. At Spruce, we will continue to make Sign-In with Ethereum as easy as possible to integrate and continue extending SIWE capabilities beyond authentication to enable users to control their identity and data across the web.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-ssx/">  Announcing SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything  We’re happy to announce the release of SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything - the easiest way to get started with decentralized identity and install Sign-In with Ethereum  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>Through this collaboration with MetaMask to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, we are happy to address some of the major concerns we repeatedly hear in Web3 - user safety and user experience - and look forward to future enhancements to come.</p>

  <p>After a two year absence of a data privacy law framework for transferring personal data from the EU to the U.S., President Biden signed an <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/10/statement-us-secretary-commerce-gina-raimondo-enhancing-safeguards">Executive Order</a> on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (the "Order") on October 7, 2022, that will usher in a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (the "Framework").</p>

<p>The Framework will regulate how US intelligence agencies may collect data from EU citizens and create new mechanisms to address EU citizens' claims that personal information was collected or handled in violation of the Framework.</p>

<p>The Framework, which was first announced as an agreement in principle by Biden and European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen in March 2022, is intended to re-establish the legal regime governing trans-Atlantic data flows, after the previous regime, the Privacy Shield, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") ruling in the Schrems II case.</p>

<p>Although the Executive Order authorises implementation measures for this new Framework under U.S. law, ultimately, the European Commission will now need to issue an adequacy opinion to approve the Framework.</p>

<p>The Framework is anticipated to be formally adopted by the EU in the summer. However, it's likely to be made on the condition that the US Government implements all the new requirements, which may take a while.</p>

<p>Under the first step of that approval process, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has agreed the measures introduced by the Executive Order achieve two things:</p>

  It goes a long way towards addressing the GDPR compliance issues highlighted in the Schrems ruling with respect to the US Government's bulk collection of EU originating personal data. 
	 It forms the bedrock of the new data protection framework that will eventually deem the US an 'adequate' country from an EU data protection law perspective. 
 <p>The EDPB, which brings together the data protection supervisory authorities of all EU member states, flagged specific concerns that will need to be resolved prior to the EU's formal adoption of the Framework including (but not limited to):</p>

  Improving the data protection principles to be observed by US data importers in relation to handling EU originating personal data (currently a copy and paste of the principles of the previously invalidated Privacy Shield framework). 
	 Evaluating the US Government's response to redress requests made by EU citizens, in relation to bulk data collection. 
  Conclusion 

<p>The new Framework will fill a significant gap and promises to provide businesses greater legal certainty in transferring EU personal data to the U.S. — for example, to cloud services providers. Moreover, approval by the European Commission will signal that U.S. privacy law protections are sufficient for transferring personal data to the U.S.</p>

<p>In the meantime ForgeRock will continue to help customers with managing their GDPR compliance obligations by offering EU standard contractual clauses backed up by Transfer Impact Assessments.</p>

<p>Learn how Fission models its work and communication style on the distributed systems we help build and support.</p> The Case for Fewer Meetings <p><a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf">A study</a> by the University of California, Irvine and Humboldt University on the cost of interrupted work found that while work was still complete and accurate after the person was interrupted, that person demonstrated increased levels of stress and speed while trying to get their work done.</p><p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296322000364?via%3Dihub">in an extended analysis</a> of 10 years of published research on flexible work practices, it was determined that employee productivity increased by over 70% when meetings were reduced by 40%.</p><p>So if stress levels decrease and productivity increases when there are fewer meetings, and it's already a big challenge for a distributed company to find a time when everyone can meet for a weekly all-hands meeting, why not look at a different approach? </p> FissionCast <p>Several months ago we did just that. Our VP of Engineering keeps track of any team news or project updates being shared on Discord and community calls, and at the end of the week he records a podcast. He reports on each working group's progress, which is helpful if you haven't had an opportunity to follow what your co-workers are working on. </p><p>Team members are also encouraged to share their own updates using Loom recordings. Looms allow you to record your screen, so if you wanted to walk team members through a process or demo a project, you can do that while making it more personable and engaging. You can also do a traditional recording and share an update that way. We record our Looms and ping our VP of Engineering in Discord when we're done, and then he compiles them together and peppers them throughout the podcast.</p><p>FissionCasts are shared on Friday afternoons, so folks can watch them on Friday or Monday at their convenience. One of the strengths of FissionCast is not just letting people catch up when it works for them, but also how. Some watch the video at 2x speed, and others will skim the transcription and notes. It keeps us connected without having to block everyone's calendars and coordinate across timezones!</p><p>FissionCasts are also shared in an internal post on our discussion forum, Discourse, which is helpful for adding relevant links and continuing the conversation asynchronously via comments. We can also tag the post for easy filtering in the future.</p> Supporting Employees <p>A survey by Buffer found that the majority of remote workers are supported by regular 1:1 meetings and they have systems for remote team collaboration and communication. A slimmer majority reported that they have regular 1:1 meetings as well as opportunities to socialize with coworkers. </p><p>At Fission, we use <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/distributed-work-discord/">Discord for async communication</a> and have regular 1:1 meetings with our supervisors. We use Zoom or Discord pairing when we need to chat something through for work, and we socialize virtually through occasional get-togethers in Gather (and by playing Among Us)! We also have one to two in-person retreats or co-working meetups during the year, but more on that in our next installment!</p> <p>How does your remote team handle meetings across time zones? What suggestions do you have for hosting productive meetings? Let us know in the comments!</p>

							<p>One of the biggest news stories in tech in 2023 concerns ID verification. This is a feature that social media giants like Twitter and Meta have rolled out recently, with the hopes of gaining benefits like:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  User verification  <p>&nbsp;</p>  Authenticity within their platform  <p>&nbsp;</p>  New revenue streams (since both online ID verification programs require users to pay a recurring fee)  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, these emerging programs aren’t the only way to ensure a more authentic and secure online social media presence. A free online identity verification service like <a href="https://dentity.com/">Dentity</a> provides authentication across multiple online platforms including social media, marketplaces, and more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Opting for a more secure online presence is just one reason to explore these ID verification programs. Today we’ll help by comparing the two popular ID verification services – Twitter Blue and Meta Verified – then show you how using Dentity helps you better protect your privacy and provides control of your online identity.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Why are Social Media Platforms Opting for ID Verification?  		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>There are many reasons why social media platforms have started offering more in-depth ID verification for their users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>User Safety</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For years, experts have insisted that ID verification online helps keep social media users safer. Fraud is rampant across social media, with <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/01/social-media-gold-mine-scammers-2021">scams</a> involving user impersonation becoming increasingly popular.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It takes almost no work for a malicious user to impersonate another person (either real or fake). Then, they can use that profile to perpetrate romance scams, cryptocurrency scams, and almost any other illegal or dangerous act imaginable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Platform Authenticity</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Increasing user security isn’t the only reason why social media platforms are opting for ID verification. Platform authenticity has become critical since advertiser dollars make up such a large percentage of a social media company’s revenue stream. After Elon Musk’s failed rollout of the initial version of Twitter Blue, advertising spend on the platform <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ad-spending-twitter-falls-by-over-70-dec-data-2023-01-25/">dropped by 71%.</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Revenue</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to protecting users and ensuring increased platform authenticity, ID verification has the potential to become a new and lucrative revenue stream for social media companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, in order for Twitter to replace its advertising revenue, it would need more than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2022/11/14/twitter-would-need-64-million-subscribers-to-replace-existing-revenue-and-cover-existing-losses/?sh=736e443ba95f">60 million subscribers</a> to its Twitter Blue program, making it difficult to achieve without aggressive marketing. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Comparing Online ID Verification in 2023</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With more than <a href="https://datareportal.com/social-media-users">137 million people</a> joining social media last year alone, using some form of user verification is essential. However, each social media platform is approaching it in its own way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s how their programs stack up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter Blue</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After a rocky launch of <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts">Twitter Blue</a>, platform officials announced that they were restarting the program in December 2022. Advertised as a “premium subscription service”, Twitter Blue offers users a variety of enhanced platform features for an annual fee of $114.99 for iOS users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To use Twitter Blue, users must sign up, pay the fee, then be verified via a confirmed phone number. After that, a blue checkmark is applied to their account as a sign that they have been verified.&nbsp; No government-issued ID is required to get a blue check mark on Twitter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Any changes to the user’s name, handle, or profile photo will result in the temporary loss of the blue checkmark until the phone number has been reconfirmed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meta Verified</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/19/meta-is-rolling-out-a-new-paid-verification-subscription-service-for-instagram-and-facebook-users.html">Meta Verified</a> was rolled out as a subscription service starting in February 2023. The service costs $179.99 annually on iOS and offers users the chance to submit a government-issued photo ID to Meta in exchange for a blue verification badge on Facebook and Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While this service does offer the benefit of allowing users to prove that they are who they say they are, its cost is not insignificant. This means that many people will simply choose not to enroll. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/biggest-benefits-risks-in-meta-twitter-verification-subscriptions.html">some cybersecurity experts</a> are worried that cybercriminals will still be able to impersonate users, adding more credibility to these authenticated accounts that may make an unsuspecting victim more likely to trust them and put themselves at risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dentity</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, ID verification is now available online in a format that can be used across social media, virtual marketplaces, dating apps, and more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While you will have to pay nearly $295 annually to be verified on both Twitter and Meta, Dentity is an entirely free online identity verification service designed to keep people safe online.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Through our secure process, users can easily prove their identity using an ID, then share their unique online ID verification with anyone who requests it. This means that it’s easy to prove that you are who you say you are when you’re meeting someone for a first date, buying something online, or even just getting to know a new friend digitally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once your identity is verified, the information stays in your digital wallet – no more sharing your ID with a company only to find it vulnerable following a hack or data breach.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Why Use Dentity? 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>So, why use Dentity? Dentity’s easy-to-use and <a href="https://blog.dentity.com/why-peer-to-peer-verified-identity-matters/">secure authentication system</a> is just one reason why so many people are choosing this form of online ID verification.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dentity is also: &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Completely free vs. nearly $300 annually for both Twitter and Meta  Accessible across multiple platforms, including Twitter and Meta  Safe and secure, making your information completely private  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>After you get verified on Dentity, you can access a profile containing your authenticated information. From there, you can send this information to whomever you want and request details from others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Going on a first date? You can send your match your name and phone number, so they know you are who you say you are. Hiring someone off Facebook or Craigslist? Use Dentity to ensure they are a real person.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With Dentity, there’s no need to pay for multiple verification services across different social media platforms. There’s just one secure service that will never lose your data or charge you for the privilege of proving your identity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://app.dentity.com/sign-up">Try it for yourself today</a>.</p>

				 <p>By Jason Garneau</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/a-deep-dive-into-the-indicio-networks/">Last month,</a> Lynn Bendixen and James Schulte took a deep dive into Indicio’s three networks (DemoNet, TestNet, and MainNet), discussing how these Hyperledger Indy-based blockchain networks provide support for decentralized identity ecosystems. Each of these networks are composed of nodes, each of which contain a copy of the blockchain ledger that is used to verify decentralized identity credentials. Each network node is created and maintained by an individual or (as is more typical) a company or organization, and until now, spinning up and maintaining a node required them to build a server from scratch and host it on their own hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now have a simpler solution, one that takes the technical challenges out of creating and maintaining a Hyperledger Indy network node—or an entire network of nodes. It’s called Indicio NoDe (Node on Demand), and it’s available through Google Cloud Marketplace.</p>
<p>With Indicio NoDe, anyone can easily participate in a decentralized identity network — or build their own network — using Indicio’s pre-built, turn-key solution and be up and running within minutes. It’s an effortless way to create the infrastructure for digital transformation.</p>
<p>Indicio NoDe eliminates the need to build a network node from scratch, which requires dedicated server hardware and specialized technical knowledge. By acquiring their network node from the Google Cloud Marketplace, companies save significant time and resources compared to building their own solution. They can also bypass the entire product development cycle and focus their time and energy on integrating the solution into their existing systems. Furthermore, companies can pay for NoDe in conjunction with their current Google Cloud services, creating additional cost savings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And with your node hosted on cloud infrastructure maintained and monitored by Google, you can be confident that the latest security patches are applied and emerging threats are mitigated.</p>
<p>As decentralized identity ecosystems drive digital transformation and create cost-saving seamless processes, Indicio NoDe from Google Cloud Marketplace provides an easy entry point to participating in and creating infrastructure for verifiable data. Our mission at Indicio is to make using verifiable credentials as easy as possible—and with Google Cloud Marketplace, decentralized identity has taken a giant step forward.</p>

This regulation was provisionally agreed upon in June 2022, and its final approval is expected shortly after&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>If the EU implements the Transfer of Funds regulation, it will require Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to verify their users’ identities and exchange their data with counterparty VASPs during crypto transactions.</p><p>VASPs will have three options to comply with this&nbsp;mandate:</p><p>(i) Obtain and exchange user data manually with their counterparty VASPs.</p><p>(ii) Opt for an automated Travel Rule Solution that stores their user data on third-party or their own&nbsp;servers.</p><p>(iii) Choose an automated Travel Rule Solution that enables VASPs to exchange user data in a Peer-to-Peer exchange&nbsp;mode.</p><p>The first two cases will impact the user experience and privacy, making users leave the platform altogether in search of a VASP that cares about them. So, what should VASPs&nbsp;do?</p><p>Of course, choose a Travel Rule Solution of the third kind, as it can help them comply with FATF requirements while preserving user privacy. We have an ideal solution to suggest — Shyft Veriscope. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Click here</a> to learn about&nbsp;it.</p> What if MiCA is Approved? <p>If approved, crypto companies will have to mandatorily meet governance and consumer-protection norms, as prescribed under MiCA. On a positive note for VASPs, the MiCA legislation is expected to take effect one to three years after its approval, giving them some time to&nbsp;prepare.</p><p>EU legislators believe introducing a cryptocurrency licensing regime is a significant step forward for the EU. It will enable them to regulate the rapidly evolving crypto market while ensuring consumer protection and market stability.</p><p>In this challenging regulatory climate, Shyft Network has made protecting the user experience and privacy its core objective and urges regulators and industry stakeholders to work towards regulations that act in the users’ interest.</p> Working on the Successful Implementation of&nbsp;MiCA <p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) is also ramping up preparations for the forthcoming MiCA regulation by hiring staff with expertise in crypto. As per a recently published vacancy notice, the Paris-based agency seeks someone with a deep understanding of crypto-asset products and services and several years of experience supervising financial institutions.</p><p>Recently, the Paris Blockchain Week 2023 saw discussions on the implications and potential impacts of the forthcoming MiCA regulation. Gundars Ostrovskis, who was involved in developing the MiCA documentation, insisted it would benefit companies and users by providing regulatory certainty and market integrity.</p> Final Note <p>While the efficacy of MiCA remains a hot topic of debate among crypto enthusiasts, it is important to note that the proposal has yet to receive approval from the European Parliament. The outcome of the EU legislators’ decision on MiCA will be revealed on April&nbsp;18th.</p><p>And even if it receives approval, the impact on the crypto ecosystem — whether positive or negative — will only be evident with time. As such, regulators and industry stakeholders must prioritize user experience and privacy when crafting regulatory frameworks for the cryptocurrency sector.</p><p>In doing so, they can safeguard users from potential harm while promoting transparency and trustworthiness within the industry.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Today in this edition of Unexpected Google admins, I’d like to introduce Tom Daly. He started his career in technology as the AV guy in his high school where his favorite job was setting up overhead projection machines. When he grew up he co-founded and was CTO of <a href="https://account.dyn.com/">Dyn</a>, an internet performance management and web application security company. It was purchased by Oracle in 2016.</p>

<p>I met Tom at Fastly where he had built their network. I soon learned that he is a networking and infrastructure wizard - who has a brain that is equal parts technologist and business savant. He knows better than anyone about how internet plumbing works and what it takes to keep it functioning. </p>

<p>After leaving Fastly, he focused on his angel investments (including <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/">YeshID</a>) and most recently stepped into the CEO role and Google Administrator role at <a href="https://www.bignetwork.com/">Big Network</a>.</p>

<p>What is your role/company?</p>
<p>I'm the CEO of <a href="https://www.bignetwork.com/">,Big Network</a>. Big Network creates private and secure cloud networks that enable businesses to simply connect their public and private clouds to on-premise infrastructure, devices, and people across the globe.</p>

<p>We are 16 people. We are a remote-first employer. We have folks in New Hampshire, New York, France, Slovakia, Ukraine, and the Philippines. </p>

<p>Why/How did you get designated as the Google Administrator? How long did you hold this role?</p>
<p>We are too small to have a dedicated IT person. We are a team of technologists, yet none of us wanted to assume the role of IT. </p>

<p>My slack profile used to say “internet janitor.” If you're the CEO of a startup and nobody else wants to do the job, it’s your job. If the toilets need plunging, then I’m going to plunge the toilets. If I have to offboard some users from Google, I’m going to do it. That’s how it works.</p>

<p>I have delegated more of the operational role of IT to our COO. But in terms of policy design, implementation, and security, I still play a foundational role.</p>

<p>What is the strangest thing you encountered using Google Workspace?</p>
<p>Google is not prescriptive about how to set up a workspace for your business. What you need from Google Workspace looks different depending on your business and stage of growth. The most surprising thing to me is that there isn't a playbook for best practices for each stage of your company for how to set up your security, workplace deployment, etc.</p>

<p>Google assumes everyone is a power user. Google should have a training course before they grant you super admin rights as a founder. Thanks for signing up for Google Workspace - you now have to take 4 hours of webinars on how to not suck at being a Google super admin. Instead, you have lots of dials and nobs and a manual that says “good luck.” </p>

<p>Any funny mishaps you want to share?</p>
<p>No, mostly annoying. </p>
<p>[Editor note: This question will be changed into the future to say “Any annoying mishaps you want to share.]</p>

<p>It’s probably the cynical network engineer coming out in me. Networking used to be the major approach for security for the company and employee base. Which I am a little familiar with. Now it is identity and access management. And it is really important for me to learn this completely new approach, but also I should probably really focus on my other 20 roles at our startup.</p>

<p>For instance, now there are so many things to consider when you're offboarding. Obviously, you don’t want them to have access to any of your systems. But what should you do with email backups? Or drive backups? Who do you delegate the calendar to? If you don't have a playbook established upfront for that, then you actually just end up creating a mess. </p>

<p>So then you find yourself in a scenario of “here’s a half a dozen suspended accounts” because you don’t want to complicate your life with delegation. And yep, I am paying a license fee for them. Suspend is Google’s way of suggesting you punt that decision-making down the road. I know the account is suspended, so I know it's secured. That can just live on as long as you want. And Google's going to keep collecting their <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/pricing-updates-and-more-flexible-payment-options-google-workspace">,$21.60 user/month</a> happily. But what business value is actually being derived at this point? It is just a really expensive backup solution.</p>

<p>I'm also surprised at the sheer number of service accounts that I've found inside of our organization. We have workloads running inside GCP that always take service accounts. We have some integrations with third-party apps that form our core IT for the business. And they're requiring service accounts and we just give them one. It is fast and like magic. How thoughtful were we in granting API level permissions to these service-level accounts? Not very.</p>

<p>A lot of this stuff predates me in the business. It is really easy to go through user accounts and know that a person isn’t there. But it is really hard to know if something is an enterprise accounting application and do they depend on this permission flag that might be too permissive for them to be using.</p>

<p>What is one thing you wish you had set up / known earlier in your IT career?</p>
<p>When I was at Fastly, HR knew me as Thomas Daly. And IT knew me as Tom Daly. And the two systems just constantly fought against each other because no one knew which was the source of truth. </p>

<p>So my advice when you start a company: immediately integrate your IT system with your HRIS system. Your life gets better the moment you do. </p>

<p>Which parts of Google Workspace did your org outgrow first?</p>
<p>We are a zoom shop for video conferencing. And slack for chat and chatops standpoint. We just started with them because we were comfortable with them and also because Google Meet and Spaces were just not where they needed to be. </p>

<p>Google Workspace is mainly used for Identity, email, drive, sheets, docs, and slides.</p>

<p>Did you ever find active accounts for users that did not exist or had left the company?</p>
<p>Yep, absolutely. Which relates to the topic of hygiene.</p>

<p>In the early startup days, you pull your friends in to help. There were a couple of folks that we gave a company email to so they could communicate to the world as Big Network. </p>

<p>As we've formalized the business operations, employee agreements, and consultant agreements, we’ve realized that Big Network “friends” either need to have a formalized relationship with us or be booted off our network. We still love them. But when you realize they haven’t looked at their account since 2021, you have an open connection into your business waiting to be exploited.</p>

<p>What is your advice for founders who find themselves with the Google Super Admin title?</p>
<p>I think the big thing that founders need to understand is that Google is very unopinionated in how you should do things.</p>

<p>You have to be super thoughtful upfront about what type of access you are giving applications. All of these SaaS apps you use have a similar goal which is to get on a monthly subscription and to retain that money. So the easier they make it for you to click a button and integrate &amp; authenticate between applications the less likely you will remove their application. So the higher likelihood you will keep paying your bill. </p>

<p>You end up building this IT house of cards. You get business with your business and have more customers and more employees. And surprise, you are human, and you are going to forget that this little building block of an application over there. Why did you give it permission to Google Workspace or another application?</p>

<p>You have to be thoughtful about how you are constructing your business operations IT stack. I mean, I still have Google Admin anxiety about our stack. Like “I’m going to click this button over here…what’s going to go wrong?”</p>

<p>What advice would you give from a security perspective?</p>
<p>First, two-factor authentication for everything. It is non-negotiable. Standardize on an authenticator with your users like Duo, Google Authenticator, Authy. It is also helpful to make sure your OTP can be accessed from multiple devices, so you need a plan for a missing cell phone.</p>

<p>Second, and this is a bit outside Google Workspace, figure out machine secrets management. You have to be thoughtful about how you're going store non-human, machine-readable secrets that your engineers and operations staff will need. That’s a whole different ball of wax, baling wire, and duct tape, and probably a different blog post.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p> A New Pamocracy is Growing Inside Your Organization 
<p>When you were not looking, the number of privileged identities you manage went from thousands to millions </p>
<p>OK everybody is doing it right now, so I asked the analyst’s new best friend, Chat GPT, to define Privileged Access Management. Here is what it said: “Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a critical security discipline that provides a framework to manage and monitor privileged access to sensitive systems and data. PAM solutions aim to prevent unauthorized access, reduce the risk of cyberattacks, and ensure compliance with industry regulations.” Well, you can’t argue with that, I could have written that myself – in fact I’m sure I have!</p>
<p>But as anyone put in charge of managing identity and privileged use activity knows, the picture is a little fuzzier in real life. As my <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kuppingercole.com%2Fresearch%2Flc81111%2Fprivileged-access-management&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7C26333608ee9043c3f5fc08db2705ced8%7C898d3826262f46f0be34f5de261bc54a%7C1%7C0%7C638146678113418628%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=53wedgl4WxkPXnp9UMZR9cbt01C52FkphJRkuDGVz80%3D&amp;reserved=0">Leadership Compass PAM 2023</a> shows, there is a lot going on in the market which makes choosing and using PAM to achieve anything close to ChatGPT abstraction. The results of Leadership Compass showed that vendors are responding in diverse ways to meet the demands of buyers, who it must be said often express confusion on the best type of product to choose.</p>
 PAM no longer just manages human identities 
<p>Those at the top end of the Leadership scale, including the traditional “big” players, are keeping up with a changing market by adding new capabilities to platforms while also simplifying purchasing, deployment, and daily usage of the software – the bit that developers sometimes forget! Clean dashboards are replacing CLIs and code - automation and wizard tools are on the increase - all good. Smaller players with the advantage of creating lean, clean cloud native software from scratch have been instrumental in driving the bigger players to make many of these usability changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest change is a recognition that PAM is now quite removed from its traditional definition and in this aspect ChatGPT gets it pretty spot on when its says "A framework to manage and monitor privileged access to sensitive systems and data". For a long time, PAM was about managing admins and superusers and controlling access to endpoints or other network devices, usually for maintenance purposes.</p>
<p>The market now knows that PAM is a technology that must manage not just human identities but those associated with machines, workloads and applications. Other areas of enterprise computing such as multi-cloud, microservices, code repositories, software defined networks and more have transformed how we see identity and what identities are allowed to do to get things done.</p>
 The laws of Pamocracy 
<p>In effect this means that millions and millions of identities require agile and fast access to something, somewhere that could be considered privileged. In my <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kuppingercole.com%2Fevents%2F2023%2F04%2Fwelcome-to-pamocracy&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7C26333608ee9043c3f5fc08db2705ced8%7C898d3826262f46f0be34f5de261bc54a%7C1%7C0%7C638146678113418628%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=9G7PrDPe1%2Bdpz142uYEryJc0jPwhN5l44eVeaCan7M8%3D&amp;reserved=0">forthcoming webinar</a> I talk about the new <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kuppingercole.com%2Fevents%2F2023%2F04%2Fwelcome-to-pamocracy&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7C26333608ee9043c3f5fc08db2705ced8%7C898d3826262f46f0be34f5de261bc54a%7C1%7C0%7C638146678113418628%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=9G7PrDPe1%2Bdpz142uYEryJc0jPwhN5l44eVeaCan7M8%3D&amp;reserved=0">Pamocracy</a> which is my term for describing this massive expansion of privileged access in a world where everything is connected to everything else. But like any other kind of power group, it must be controlled by policies, laws and regulations to make it work in the interest of the whole enterprise.</p>
<p>While this has been happening, new players and friends have entered the PAM market. Smaller vendors are realizing that there is money to be made addressing PAM niches – such as DevOps, Cloud and even database access. For them, the trends of decentralized purchasing means that some organizations are witnessing purchase of limited PAM for certain departments, even when a cross enterprise PAM platform is in place. As more PAM vendors move to SaaS, this will be more common. The irony is that managing theses decentralized PAM SaaS or on demand iterations will need controlled access too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And at the outer edges of the market, I am starting to see some aspects of Data Governnace and Privacy emerge into the PAM domain. Vendors in that space are starting to offer PAM-like capabilities. Maybe they don’t call it that – or even realize they are offering it, but it’s happening.</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Aidonker Francisco and I am from Ecuador. I joined Ontology in September 2019.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I studied computer engineering and computer science at the Universidad Agraria del Ecuador. My hobbies include listening to music, coding and playing strategic video games. I also have six beautiful cats! I like to talk about everything and form strong relationships with the Ontology community.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I am a moderator for the Ontology Spanish Community and I also create Spanish-language content for the Ontology blog! Day to day, I create content and infographics for the blog, translate content, and promote user engagement within the community!</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>Ontology’s community is what makes it stand out. Ontology has been in the crypto ecosystem for a long time and has the potential for huge growth in the future. Having survived in the industry for five years, despite many unfavourable industry conditions, Ontology has maintained steady growth and created a strong community, which is something other blockchain projects can learn&nbsp;from.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Educating the community. I use my knowledge of the project to teach others how Ontology can benefit them and the crypto ecosystem as a whole, as well as how identity is essential nowadays. I feel that this is a very important role and I like being able to share my love for the project with other&nbsp;users.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>The huge growth and expansion of the Ontology community have been a key moment in my career. I am now part of a brilliant team and have developed a deep knowledge and enthusiasm for the Ontology&nbsp;project.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited about the future developments that Ontology will see over the next few years. Ontology is evolving every day. Even after five years of constant development, Ontology is continuing to build new services for users and institutional clients, which is something to be proud&nbsp;of.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>It’s great how Ontology is bringing more important tools into the Web3 space, such as its tools to protect privacy and identity. Web3 as a whole is a space with so much potential for innovation, which can benefit everyone. Ontology’s role here is to make it as accessible as possible to everyone while protecting their privacy and freedom as they explore Web3. Ontology helps to integrate both the Web2 and Web3 worlds and eases the process of onboarding new users to&nbsp;Web3.</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-community-moderator-aidonker-c3bbcf51d53a">Meet the Team: Community Moderator, Aidonker</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> A maturity level matrix for Identity Fabrics 
<p>The term and concept of Identity Fabrics has become popular in recent years. We observe widespread adoption of the concept as the foundation for further evolving IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management) infrastructures. To provide a guideline for organizations, KuppingerCole Analysts have developed a maturity model for Identity Fabrics, as we have done for other areas of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an72527/maturity-level-matrix-for-iam">IAM</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an72555/maturity-level-matrix-for-cyber-security">cybersecurity</a>.</p>
 What makes up maturity of an Identity Fabric 
<p>When working on such maturity models, the first question to ask is what makes up maturity in that segment. For Identity Fabrics, there are five main areas:</p>
 
 Supported identities: The scope of an Identity Fabric must extend beyond the workforce. Ideally, it covers all types of identities, human and silicon ones, but at minimum all human identities, including customers and consumers. 
 Convergence: Identity Fabrics are about a holistic perspective across all functional areas for IAM. This does not mean that there should be only one tool used – it can be more, but they need to be integrated. 
 Integration: Integration is required at all levels, from the user interface to a consistent set of APIs, the Identity API layer, and to data. Again, this does not mean “only one database”, but the accessibility of data across all functional areas. 
 Flexibility: Identity Fabrics are flexible by default. This requires modern architectures, based on microservices and – unless delivered as Saas only – flexible deployment models, but again also a comprehensive set of APIs. 
 Supported systems and services: Identity Fabrics must support the hybrid reality of organizations, from modern SaaS to legacy applications. 
 
<p>With Identity Fabrics being defined as a comprehensive, modular, and flexible approach for all IAM, not every IAM infrastructure qualifies as an Identity Fabric.</p>

<p>Based on these baseline requirements, even the level 1 (“initial”) raises the bar a bit higher than some might expect. The blueprint must cover all areas of IAM. It requires a unified UX (user experience) at least for the main capabilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: A CMMI model targeted at Identity Fabrics. There is a minimum level of maturity required to call the IAM infrastructure an Identity Fabric.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the architecture and the interfaces must be “modern” in the sense of having flexibility in deployment and providing a consistent set of APIs, so that the the API layer can then be used by other services such as modern digital services to request and consume identity services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: The KuppingerCole Identity Fabrics model as the foundation for developing organizations’ own Identity Fabrics concepts.</p>
<p>This does not mean that there is no place for existing, traditional IAM solutions. They can form a part of the Identity Fabric and deliver services, until modernization can take place. Moving towards an Identity Fabric is a journey. Traditional IAM solutions can even be utilized for a longer period for providing connectivity to parts of the legacy IAM infrastructure.</p>
 More on this at EIC 2023 
<p>Identity Fabrics are a key topic at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity Conference 2023</a>. My colleagues Christopher Schütze, Dr. Phillip Messerschmidt, and I will run a pre-conference workshop on “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5239">Building the roadmap for your future IAM</a>”, where the concept of Identity Fabrics plays an essential role. In the Identity Fabrics track, I will give a presentation on the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5271/1">Identity Fabrics Maturity Model</a>. I’ll be around for the whole conference (no surprise…), so don’t miss the opportunity to meet &nbsp;me in Berlin.</p>

				  Simplifying the Creation of Trusted Ecosystems 
<p>The Creation of trusted ecosystems can be a complex and challenging, especially in education. In our latest webinar, we introduced the <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/trustcontinuum/">Trust Continuum</a>™ methodology to simplify the creation of trusted ecosystems. Our approach aligns with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">Trust Over IP 4-Layer model</a> and has proven successful across multiple industries.</p>
 StudentReader.io’s Decentralized Education Product 
<p>The webinar featured Laura Brugioni, founder of <a href="https://studentreader.io/">StudentReader.io</a>, who discussed their decentralized education product – a course reader for <a href="https://atalaprism.io/">Atala PRISM</a> – the Foundations of Decentralized Identity. The result of the course reader emphasized the need for comprehensive training material on SSI and the endless possibilities for this technology to be used in education and across sectors.</p>
 Creation of the Right Conditions for Trusted Ecosystems to Form and Flourish 
<p>Continuum Loop is working with StudentReader.io to create the right conditions for their trusted ecosystem to form and flourish. Our Trust Continuum™ methodology provides a valuable tool for simplifying the creation of trusted ecosystems. We emphasize collaboration, adaptability, and a commitment to creating sustainable and prosperous ecosystems.</p>
 Governance Frameworks for Trusted Ecosystems 
<p>During the webinar, we highlighted the importance of simple, executable governance frameworks that can be adapted to each ecosystem’s unique needs. Our tools are all Creative Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0), making them available for anyone to adopt and adapt.</p>
 Understanding, Exploring, Designing, Building, and Nurturing Ecosystems 
<p>We also discussed how various ecosystems could be understood, explored, designed, built, and nurtured. By leveraging the Trust Continuum™ methodology, we can create dynamic ecosystems that are flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances.</p>
 Q&amp;A Session 
<p>We were thrilled to receive so many great questions from our attendees. Unfortunately, we couldn’t address them all during the Q&amp;A period, which began at the 45-minute mark. However, we wanted to ensure we answered all questions, so we’ve provided them below.</p>
<p>Where else will you be funding scholarships?&nbsp; What places – what courses? What about other languages?</p>
<p>StudentReader.io is working to create more programs with Atala Prism (languages, etc.) and working to duplicate the pattern with other programs. We want to fund scholarships across various fields.&nbsp; By working closely with educational institutions and subject matter experts, we will identify high-impact courses that hold the potential to create meaningful change in students’ lives. We recognize the importance of linguistic diversity and are committed to expanding our offerings in multiple languages. As we grow, we plan to work with experts in different regions to create and publish course content in various languages, making education accessible to a broader audience. StudentReader.io is continually exploring strategic partnerships, such as the one with Atala Prism, to enhance our platform’s capabilities and reach.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of complicated tech here – wouldn’t it be easier to write a cheque?</p>
<p>We can ensure greater transparency and accountability in scholarship distribution by leveraging blockchain technology, allowing for more efficient funds management and increased trust among all stakeholders.</p>
<p>We appreciate the engagement and enthusiasm of our audience and look forward to future opportunities to connect and share insights on creating trusted ecosystems!</p>
 Creating Trusted Ecosystems Across Multiple Industries 
<p>Thank you to Laura for sharing more about StudentReader.io, and we encourage you to check out <a href="https://book.io/">book.io</a> for minting the NFTs – it’s coming soon! With the right conditions in place, any ecosystem can flourish, and we look forward to continuing our work in creating trusted ecosystems across multiple industries.</p>

 Ontology and Ethereum Ecosystem Further Opened&nbsp;Up <p><a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology </a>is proud to announce <a href="https://goshen.network/">Goshen Network</a>, a distinguished Layer 2 (L2) project incubated by the Ontology Foundation. The collaboration between two parties promotes the interactivity between the Ontology and Ethereum ecosystem and provides a better solution for developers and users in the entire Web3&nbsp;world.</p><p>The future trend of Web3 is to provide fast, efficient, and cost-effective solutions through smooth interaction between multiple public chains. <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/mainnet-3rd-anniversary-special-ontologys-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm-debut-f92111436a8e">Ontology EVM</a> has broken down the barrier between Ethereum and the Ontology chain, and Goshen aims to present an improved alternative to the expensive and slow transactions of Ethereum while maintaining high levels of security.</p><p>Goshen’s optimistic rollup has an exquisite design that is simpler and more compatible than other existing L2 projects. The project has modular development components and balances performance and security to deliver a better solution for&nbsp;users.</p><p>Its unique RISC-V fraud-proof system is used to support on-chain computing and collaborative interaction challenges, ensuring the security of both architecture and implementation, and bringing high overall security.</p><p>Goshen’s full compatibility with Ethereum is not the only reason for its convenience in deploying and reusing toolchains within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its partnership with Ontology, which shares the same values on decentralized identity and reputation, also contributes to a smoother user experience. Moreover, Goshen’s smart contracts will be fully open source for developers in April, demonstrating both Goshen and Ontology’s commitment to transparency and collaboration within the developer community. Ontology’s own open-source code also reinforces this partnership and shared&nbsp;vision.</p><p>With five years plus technology precipitation and in-depth research on L2, Ontology recognized Goshen’s L2 framework design and its technical compatibility. At the same time, Ontology’s EVM, along with its full set of <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/building-decentralized-society-own-your-value-c5be7088ac95">OWN infrastructure</a> solutions, <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a> framework, and product suites, which are compatible and interoperable with Ethereum, will bring additional value to Goshen. Additionally, Ontology has a mature global community and users in DeFi, NFT, wallets, and other areas, which helps Goshen to extend its testing to a larger&nbsp;scale.</p><p>In the future, ONT will be introduced into Goshen’s governance, running for a role in the decentralized packaging network and getting a share of the L2 network fees. The collaboration between Ontology and Goshen is expected to offer improved outcomes for users and developers in the Web3 world, creating a better future for blockchain technology.</p><p>To celebrate the collaboration, Ontology is going to launch various campaigns together with Goshen, covering developers, users, and community members with their own special NFT incentives. Detailed rules for these campaigns will be announced soon separately</p><p>The collaboration between Ontology and Goshen is expected to bring great improvements to the Web3 world, providing better solutions for users and developers. Join our community now and let’s scale Ethereum and Ontology together!</p> About Ontology <p><a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a> is a project designed to bring trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions.

 History of Legal Entity Identifiers 
 <p>History of Legal Entity Identifiers Timeline</p> 
<p>The structure of LEI issuers and issuance starts with Local Operating Units (LOUs). LOUs then work in partnership with Registration Agents (RAs), and Validation Agents (VAs) to provide local support and issuance of LEIs.</p>

<p>To find out more about the history of LEIs, take a listen to the Let’s Talk About&nbsp;Digital Identity podcast episode, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/history-of-lei/" title="LEI and the History of Identities for Businesses">LEI and the History of Identities for Businesses</a>. Clare Rowley from the GLEIF joined this special episode to discuss LEIs from conception through to the current ecosystem.</p>
 What is an LEI? 
<p>The LEI is a 20-digit alphanumeric code, which can be broken down into three sections. Example of LEI code and breakdown below:</p>
<p></p>
 Current LEI Ecosystem 
 
 The LEI database captures the structure of an organisation, making it a one-stop-shop to understand who you’re dealing with, who owns the company, the legal entity, and where the entities are registered. 
 The LEI is the only globally standardised entity identifier. 
 There are now 294+ global compliance and regulations requiring use of an LEI, including in Australia, India and Europe. 
 LEI adoption has increased significantly over the past 6-8 months. Largely due to the use of LEIs in AML, KYC, risk management and client onboarding. 
 
 What problems have been realised so far? 
<p>Robust business credentials are a major obstacle, particularly for SMEs in developing economies, the LEI provides organisations of all sizes a way to identify themselves, in a highly assured way.</p>
<p>The use of LEIs provides transparency leading to, financial stability, reporting, easier compliance and regulations, better risk management, less friction, and better decisions.</p>
<p>There are various benefits to banks and organisations, for using LEIs, especially for onboarding and compliance services, for example improved customer experience.</p>
<p>Banks and financial institutions are increasingly getting involved with LEI issuance and management, by becoming Validation Agents.</p>
<p>The LEI has seen increased adoption outside of traditional financial markets, for example, the US Customs and Border Force trialling the LEI as a global identifier for import and export.</p>
<p>There are major cost savings bought by LEI adoption and investment. The McKinsey Company found; the use of LEIs in certain banking environments could annually save the global banking system, 2-4 billion in client onboarding.</p>
 What are we doing to push forward the LEI ecosystem? 
<p>The RapidLEI and Ceviant partnership aims to improve access to trade finance and partnerships, especially for SMEs.</p>
<p>Verifiable LEI (vLEI) is the next step of the ecosystem, creating the ability to validate individuals, organisations, and Official Organisational Roles, confirming they are able to act on behalf of the organisation.</p>
<p>The LEI is not a compliance requirement alone, rather it is a highly assured organisation identity. Providing a way for organisations to identify themselves globally, while also improving robust and streamlined processes for governance, authentication, authorisation, and delegation.</p>
 Legal Entity Identifier Webinar Q&amp;A 
<p>The Q&amp;A session at the end of the webinar provided further insight, based on questions of those in attendance.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What is the process to get an LEI?
 
 What documentation is needed? 
 The LEI application process 
 
 
 How long does LEI issuance take? 
 How do the RapidLEI APIs improve LEI issuance? 
 When an LEI is present in KYC and onboarding, is other documentation required? 
 What are the main value benefits of having an LEI?

Or, jump straight into the text content&nbsp;below.</p> Remote Setup <p>We do setup for Mumbai, the testnet for Polygon. It’s similar for other remote&nbsp;chains.</p><p>We assume you’ve already <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/install.md">installed Ocean</a>.</p><p>Here, we&nbsp;will:</p>  <a>Configure Brownie&nbsp;networks</a>  <a>Create two accounts</a> — REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY1 and&nbsp;2  <a>Get fake MATIC on&nbsp;Mumbai</a>  <a href="http://15be">Get fake OCEAN on&nbsp;Mumbai</a>  <a href="http://f939">Set envvars</a>  <a href="http://ce78">Setup in Python</a> — Alice and Bob wallets in&nbsp;Python  <p>Let’s go!</p> 1. Configure Brownie networks (One-Time)  1.1 Network config&nbsp;file <p>Brownie’s network config file is network-config.yaml. It is located in the&nbsp;.brownie/ subfolder of your home&nbsp;folder.</p>  For Linux &amp; MacOS, it’s: ~/.brownie/network-config.yaml  For Windows users, it’s: C:\Users\&lt;user_name&gt;\.brownie\network-config.yaml   1.2 Generate network config file (if&nbsp;needed) <p>If you already see the config file, skip this&nbsp;section.</p><p>If you don’t, you need to auto-generate by calling any brownie function from a Python console. Here’s an&nbsp;example.</p><p>First, in a new or existing console, run&nbsp;Python:</p> python <p>In the Python&nbsp;console:</p> from ocean_lib.example_config import get_config_dict <p>It will generate the file in the target location. You can check the target location to&nbsp;confirm.</p> 1.3 Contents of network config&nbsp;file <p>The network configuration file has settings for each network, e.g. development (ganache), Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, and&nbsp;Mumbai.</p><p>Each network gets specifications for:</p>  host - the RPC URL, i.e. what URL do we pass through to talk to the&nbsp;chain  required_confs - the number of confirmations before a tx is&nbsp;done  id - e.g. polygon-main (Polygon), polygon-test (Mumbai)  <p>development chains run locally; live chains run remotely.</p><p>The example network-config.yaml in Brownie's GitHub repo is <a href="https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie/blob/master/brownie/data/network-config.yaml">here</a>. It can serve as a comparison to your local&nbsp;copy.</p><p>Ocean.py follows the exact id name for the network's name from the default Brownie configuration file. Therefore, you need to ensure that your target network name matches the corresponding Brownie&nbsp;id.</p> 1.4 Networks Supported <p>All <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">Ocean-deployed</a> chains (Eth mainnet, Polygon, etc) should be in Brownie’s default network-config.yaml except Energy Web Chain&nbsp;(EWC).</p><p>For Windows users: it’s possible that your network-config.yaml doesn’t have all the network entries. In this case, just replace your local file’s content with the network-config.yaml in Brownie's GitHub repo,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie/blob/master/brownie/data/network-config.yaml">here</a>.</p><p>For all users: to use EWC, add the following to network-config.yaml:</p> - name: energyweb<br>  networks:<br>  - chainid: 246<br>    host: https://rpc.energyweb.org<br>    id: energyweb<br>    name: energyweb  1.5 RPCs and&nbsp;Infura <p>The config file’s default RPCs point to Infura, which require you to have an Infura account with corresponding token WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID.</p><p>The next step depends on whether you have an <a href="https://www.infura.io/">Infura</a>&nbsp;account.</p> If you do have an Infura&nbsp;account   Linux &amp; MacOS users: in console: export WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=&lt;your infura&nbsp;ID&gt;  Windows users: in console: set WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=&lt;your infura&nbsp;ID&gt;   If you do not have an Infura&nbsp;account <p>One option is to get an Infura account. A simpler option is to bypass the need for an account: just change to RPCs that don’t need&nbsp;Infura.</p><p>You can bypass manually: just edit your brownie network config&nbsp;file.</p><p>Or you can bypass via the command-line. The following command replaces Infura RPCs with public ones in network-config.yaml:</p>  Linux users: in the&nbsp;console:   sed -i 's#https://polygon-mainnet.infura.io/v3/$WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID#https://polygon-rpc.com/#g; s#https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/$WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID#https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com#g' ~/.brownie/network-config.yaml   MacOS users: you can achieve the same thing with gnu-sed and the gsed command. (Or just manually edit the&nbsp;file.)  Windows users: you might need something similar to <a href="https://www.marek.tokyo/2020/01/remove-string-from-file-in-windows-10.html">powershell</a>. (Or just manually edit the&nbsp;file.)   1.6 Network config file&nbsp;wrapup <p>Congrats, you’ve now configured your Brownie network file! You rarely need to worry about it from now&nbsp;on.</p> 2. Create EVM Accounts (One-Time) <p>An EVM account is singularly defined by its private key. Its address is a function of that key. Let’s generate two accounts!</p><p>In a new or existing console, run&nbsp;Python.</p> python <p>In the Python&nbsp;console:</p> from eth_account.account import Account<br>account1 = Account.create()<br>account2 = Account.create()<br><br>print(f"""<br>REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY1={account1.key.hex()}, ADDRESS1={account1.address}<br>REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY2={account2.key.hex()}, ADDRESS2={account2.address}<br>""") <p>Then, hit Ctrl-C to exit the Python&nbsp;console.</p><p>Now, you have two EVM accounts (address &amp; private key). Save them somewhere safe, like a local file or a password&nbsp;manager.</p><p>These accounts will work on any EVM-based chain: production chains like Eth mainnet and Polygon, and testnets like Goerli and Mumbai. Here, we’ll use them for&nbsp;Mumbai.</p> 3. Get (fake) MATIC on&nbsp;Mumbai <p>We need the a network’s native token to pay for transactions on the network. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/get-eth/">ETH</a> is the native token for Ethereum mainnet; <a href="https://polygon.technology/matic-token/">MATIC</a> is the native token for Polygon, and <a href="https://faucet.polygon.technology/">(fake) MATIC</a> is the native token for&nbsp;Mumbai.</p><p>To get free (fake) MATIC on&nbsp;Mumbai:</p>  Go to the faucet <a href="https://faucet.polygon.technology/">https://faucet.polygon.technology/</a>. Ensure you’ve selected “Mumbai” network and “MATIC”&nbsp;token.  Request funds for&nbsp;ADDRESS1  Request funds for&nbsp;ADDRESS2  <p>You can confirm receiving funds by going to the following url, and seeing your reported MATIC balance: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/&lt;ADDRESS1 or ADDRESS2&gt;</p> 4. Get (fake) OCEAN on&nbsp;Mumbai <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN</a> can be used as a data payment token, and locked into veOCEAN for Data Farming / curation. The READMEs show how to use OCEAN in both&nbsp;cases.</p>  OCEAN is an ERC20 token with a finite supply, rooted in Ethereum mainnet at address <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48">0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48</a>.  OCEAN on other production chains derives from the Ethereum mainnet OCEAN. OCEAN on Polygon (mOCEAN) is at <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x282d8efce846a88b159800bd4130ad77443fa1a1">0x282d8efce846a88b159800bd4130ad77443fa1a1</a>.  (Fake) OCEAN is on each testnet. Fake OCEAN on Mumbai is at <a href="https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/token/0xd8992Ed72C445c35Cb4A2be468568Ed1079357c8">0xd8992Ed72C445c35Cb4A2be468568Ed1079357c8</a>.  <p>To get free (fake) OCEAN on&nbsp;Mumbai:</p>  Go to the faucet <a href="https://faucet.mumbai.oceanprotocol.com/">https://faucet.mumbai.oceanprotocol.com/</a>  Request funds for&nbsp;ADDRESS1  Request funds for&nbsp;ADDRESS2  <p>You can confirm receiving funds by going to the following url, and seeing your reported OCEAN balance: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/token/0xd8992Ed72C445c35Cb4A2be468568Ed1079357c8?a=&lt;ADDRESS1 or ADDRESS2&gt;</p> 5. Set&nbsp;envvars <p>As usual, Linux/MacOS needs “export" and Windows needs "set". In the&nbsp;console:</p>  For Linux &amp; MacOS users: in the&nbsp;console:   # For accounts: set private keys<br>export REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY1=&lt;your REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY1&gt;<br>export REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY2=&lt;your REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY2&gt;   For Windows users: in the&nbsp;console:   # For accounts: set private keys<br>set REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY1=&lt;your REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY1&gt;<br>set REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY2=&lt;your REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY2&gt;  6. Setup in&nbsp;Python <p>In your working console, run&nbsp;Python:</p> python <p>In the Python&nbsp;console:</p> # Create Ocean instance<br>from ocean_lib.web3_internal.utils import connect_to_network<br>connect_to_network("polygon-test") # mumbai is "polygon-test"<br><br>import os<br>from ocean_lib.example_config import get_config_dict<br>from ocean_lib.ocean.ocean import Ocean<br>config = get_config_dict("polygon-test")<br>ocean = Ocean(config)<br><br># Create OCEAN object. ocean_lib knows where OCEAN is on all remote networks<br>OCEAN = ocean.OCEAN_token<br><br># Create Alice's wallet<br>from brownie.network import accounts<br>accounts.clear()<br><br>alice_private_key = os.getenv('REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY1')<br>alice = accounts.add(alice_private_key)<br>assert alice.balance() &gt; 0, "Alice needs MATIC"<br>assert OCEAN.balanceOf(alice) &gt; 0, "Alice needs OCEAN"<br><br># Create Bob's wallet. While some flows just use Alice wallet, it's simpler to do all here.<br>bob_private_key = os.getenv('REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY2')<br>bob = accounts.add(bob_private_key)<br>assert bob.balance() &gt; 0, "Bob needs MATIC"<br>assert OCEAN.balanceOf(bob) &gt; 0, "Bob needs OCEAN"<br><br># Compact wei &lt;&gt; eth conversion<br>from ocean_lib.ocean.util import to_wei, from_wei <p>If you get a gas-related error like transaction underpriced, you'll need to change the priority_fee or max_fee. See details in <a href="https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/core-gas.html">brownie&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> Conclusion / Next&nbsp;step <p>You’ve now set up everything you need for testing on a remote chain, congrats!

<p>Choosing messaging apps over landlines and electric scooters instead of gas-guzzling cars, tech-savvy Gen Zers and Millennials think and experience life very differently to Gen X and Baby Boomers.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Although their priorities on money differ, there’s one common thread that pulls the generations together: each wants to be in a healthy financial position to enjoy the lifestyle they want both now and in the future. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Like generations before them, to reach their goals, digital native Millennials and Gen Zers are fast turning to budgeting apps such as <a href="https://www.quicken.com/">Quicken Inc’s</a> <a href="https://www.quicken.com/simplifi/">Simplifi</a> which helps people stay on top of all their finances in under five minutes a week.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Driven by <a href="https://www.finicity.com/manage/wealth/">consumer-permissioned data</a> from sources including Mastercard’s <a href="https://b2b.mastercard.com/open-banking-solutions/">open banking platform</a>, <a href="https://www.quicken.com/simplifi/">Simplifi</a> pulls together a wealth of data ranging from checking, savings, stock portfolios and retirement accounts in addition to the other account types that Simplifi integrates into a single, easily customizable dashboard.  &nbsp;</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>“Putting an emphasis on how we categorize data helps to optimize time spent by customers on tracking their finances,” said Kristen Dillard, Quicken’s vice president of product management. “Now users can see their investment balances, account types and holdings in real time, while personalizing the look, feel and function of the app.”  &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a one-stop shop that gives users a big picture view of their finances and lets them choose how they track their money, set spending plans, pay bills, and channel money into rainy-day funds.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>“People are looking to do the same basic thing across generations. They worry: ‘How do I balance my bills with the fact I need to save for retirement, or how do I make sure I spend my money on things that really matter to me, or how do I make sure that inflation isn’t getting the best of my finances,” says Dillard.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>To tune into its mobile-first Millennial and Gen Z users, Quicken looked to the fitness and gaming industries for inspiration on how to help Simplifi customers personalize their experiences.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Younger users want ease and flexibility when it comes to budgeting. Some might like to track every dollar, similar to tracking every carb and calorie, while others might just want a view of how much cash they can spend on entertainment or travel. Simplifi lets each user decide exactly how they want to slice and dice their spending and savings each month, while push notifications warn if they max out their set budgets.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>For generations who have grown up gaming, receiving rewards for paying bills on time and reaching net worth goals makes the process fun, encouraging them to stick to their financial health plans. </p>







<p>“Everybody’s approach to personal finances is unique. You have to allow customers to see that data and manage that data in a way they want,” says Dillard.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Younger generations expect everything to be in an app. They’re mobile first, they expect to do everything on the go, and they expect efficiency and ease.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>With Millennials and Gen Zers less likely to take lifelong jobs with plump pension plans, Simplifi helps prepare for the future by pulling in wealth data that let users easily track multiple retirement accounts.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s definitely a different mindset between younger and older generations. In 30 years, will we see the same trend we’ve seen with older customers where they end up in a better financial place? Adopting the right financial tools can be the first step to achieving those goals. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Every app development ecosystem worth using needs its own do-everything CLI tool with a short, catchy name. Git has <code>git</code>, Node.js has <code>npm</code>, Rust has <code>cargo</code>, Vue has <code>vue</code>... And Holochain has <code>hc</code>. This article introduces you to this tool and the things you can do with it.</p> Not just for scaffolding <p>In the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/scaffolding-my-first-happ-in-10-minutes/">previous article</a> of this series, I introduced you to the <code>hc scaffold</code> command. That was a glimpse of what <code>hc</code> can do, but didn’t really explain what it was or how you might use it after you finished scaffolding.</p><p>It is of course, as you’ve just learned, Holochain’s version of that do-everything CLI tool that I claimed that every good project must have. You can use it to package/bundle, test, and run Holochain applications.</p><p>If you want to know what sorts of things it can do, you can always go <code>hc help</code> from inside the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holonix-the-beginning-of-your-happ-development-journey/">Holonix dev environment</a>. But it wouldn’t make for a very interesting or helpful article if I ended there, so I’m going to dig into all the subcommands with you. (Note: I’m going to skip <code>hc scaffold</code> because I covered that in the previous article.)</p><p>In the scaffolding article we built an entire hApp from scratch. It wasn’t complicated — it only had one DNA, one coordinator zome, and one integrity zome, and a basic web-based client UI. (if I’m already getting confusing, don’t worry; I’ll define those terms below — or you can read the article). Let’s unpack each of those components in turn by exploring the tools you’ll use to work with them.</p><p>Note: In all of these examples I’ll be working on an app called <code>gardenswap</code>. So the first thing I’m going to do is create a project directory with the same name. I’m going to diverge a bit from the usual <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/quick-start/project-structure/?ref=blog.holochain.org">project structure</a> of a scaffolded hApp, because at time of writing <code>hc</code> doesn’t let me create all the files in existing directories.</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain]$ mkdir gardenswap
[holonix:~/Holochain]$ cd gardenswap</code>  <code>hc dna</code>: working with DNAs <p>If you’ve read the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Core Concepts</a>, you’ll know that zomes (short for chromosomes) are the code modules that make up a DNA, and come in two flavours: integrity zomes, which define the ‘shape’ of valid data, and coordinator zomes, which contain business logic. Zomes are just WebAssembly files, which means you can theoretically write them in any language that compiles to WebAssembly — but right now we only provide Rust-based SDKs for writing <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi?ref=blog.holochain.org">integrity</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk?ref=blog.holochain.org">coordinator</a> zomes.</p><p>The contents of the DNA are specified in a DNA manifest file, a simple text file that <code>hc dna</code> will use to bundle everything up into a DNA file, ready to distribute.</p> <code>hc dna init</code>: creating a DNA manifest <p>But I’m getting ahead of myself here. When you’re creating a project from scratch (that is, not using <code>hc scaffold</code>), you’ll want to create an empty project directory and DNA manifest to put your zomes into. <code>hc dna init</code> will do that for you. If I enter the Holonix shell and type this command:</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc dna init dnas/gardenswap/workdir</code> <p>It will ask you for a DNA name (I used <code>gardenswap</code>) and a network seed (I just went with what it suggested), then it will stub out a <code>dna.yaml</code> file for you. Here’s what’s inside that file:</p> <code>manifest_version: '1'
name: gardenswap
integrity:
  network_seed: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  properties: null
  origin_time: 2023-03-10T17:42:14.028653Z
  zomes: []
coordinator:
  zomes: []</code> <p>It’s not a complicated file, but if you’re new to Holochain, it’s probably not obvious what these fields are for. Let’s go into each one.</p> <code>manifest_version: '1'</code> <p>This tells <code>hc dna</code> and the Holochain conductor what manifest format you’re using (currently there’s only version 1).</p> <code>name: gardenswap</code> <p>This line gives your DNA a name, which will appear in application launchers. The name can contain spaces and other characters and should be written to help a curious application participant understand what it’s doing on their machine. Here’s an example from DevHub, our official hApp package manager hApp:</p><p>Next comes the <code>integrity</code> section. Everything in this section affects the DNA hash. Any modifications to this section — either by hand-editing the manifest and rebuilding the DNA, or by specifying new values when you clone a DNA — will cause the DNA hash to change. And when that happens, any cells using that new DNA hash will enjoy their own network, separated from the original.</p> <code>integrity:
  network_seed: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  properties: null
  origin_time: 2023-03-10T17:42:14.028653Z
  zomes: []</code> <p>The <code>network_seed</code> value is the easiest way to create a clone; it changes the DNA's hash without affecting its behaviour. Everybody who inputs the same network seed will get the same DNA hash, so they can find each other on their new little network. You can think of it as sort of a network-wide password.</p><p>It’d be fiddly for app users to edit this by hand. So you, dear developer, can specify a network seed when your front-end calls the conductor’s <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#variant.CreateCloneCell"><code>CreateCloneCell</code></a> API endpoint. You can take human input, or you can auto-generate it and find some way of sharing it among people who want to join the clone network.</p><p>The <code>properties</code> value is just a spot for you to throw some YAML data into. It’ll get reserialised into MessagePack and then made available to your application code (both zomes via <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/latest/hdi/info/fn.dna_info.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>dna_info</code></a> and clients via <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppResponse.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#variant.AppInfo"><code>AppInfo</code></a>) for deserialisation. You can use this field to store ‘environment variables’ that change a coordinator or integrity zome’s behaviour — examples are an admin’s public key for permission management, a credit limit for a community currency, or default page sizes for indexing.</p><p>The <code>origin_time</code> value is a bit obscure; it defines the ‘birthdate’ of a DNA. This is the earliest allowable timestamp for any <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/?ref=blog.holochain.org">actions</a> that people write to their source chains, and it also gets used to make gossip more efficient.</p><p>Lastly, <code>zomes</code> is an array of structures that define your integrity zomes. You can’t see anything in the above stubbed file, so here’s an example from the hApp I scaffolded in the last article:</p> <code>- name: gardenswap_integrity
  hash: ~
  bundled: "../../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/gardenswap_integrity.wasm"</code> <p>The <code>name</code> field gives your integrity zome a friendly name within the manifest, so coordinator zomes can refer to it as a dependency.</p><p>The <code>hash</code> field is optional, and serves as a sanity check to make sure that the zome being referenced is actually what you expect it to be.</p><p>The <code>bundled</code> field looks straightforward — just the path of the compiled WASM file — but it’s just one of three ways of referring to the zome:</p>  <code>bundled: "&lt;path_to_wasm&gt;"</code> will embed the zome’s WASM in the DNA bundle.  <code>path: "&lt;path_to_wasm&gt;"</code> doesn’t embed the WASM, and instead expects it to be available at the specified path when the user installs the DNA.  <code>url: "&lt;url_to_wasm&gt;"</code> doesn’t embed the WASM either, downloading it from the specified URL at install time.  <p>For both <code>bundled</code> and <code>path</code> I’d recommend relative paths to make life easier for both devs and end-users.</p><p>Finally, we find the <code>coordinator</code> section.</p> <code>coordinator:
  zomes: []</code> <p>It only has one value, an array of <code>zomes</code> — just as with integrity zomes, these are structures that define your coordinator zomes. These structures have one extra field: <code>dependencies</code>, an array of integrity zomes (referenced by their <code>name</code> fields) upon which this coordinator zome depends. If the DNA has only one integrity zome, this field can be omitted.</p><p>What does a ‘dependency’ mean in this case? Simply that this coordinator zome writes and reads entries and links whose types are defined in the listed integrity zomes. Note that, internally, these names are mapped to indices, so you’ll want to specify the dependencies in the manifest in the same order they’re imported into your coordinator zome’s code.</p><p>In the manifest file:</p> <code>- name: "gardenswap_coordinator"
  bundled: "../path/to/compiled.wasm"
  dependencies:
    - name: "profiles" # dependency number 0
    - name: "posts_integrity" # dependency number 1</code> <p>In your coordinator zome’s <code>lib.rs</code> file:</p> <code>/ ... other namespaces to be imported ...
use profiles::*; // dependency number 0
use posts_integrity::*; // dependency number 1
// ... rest of file ...</code>  <code>hc dna pack</code> and <code>unpack</code>: bundling and unbundling a DNA file <p>Once you’ve compiled your zomes and written your DNA manifest, it’s time to pack it up for distribution. <code>hc dna pack dna.yaml</code> does that for you, adding the <code>.dna</code> extension the manifest’s <code>name</code> field for the final filename. If you’d rather specify a name of your own, use the <code>-o</code> argument.</p><p>And if you find a DNA that you want to inspect or modify, <code>hc dna unpack &lt;name&gt;.dna</code> will do that for you. Again, you can specify an <code>-o</code> argument; this time it lets you choose a directory to unpack the assets into. If that directory already exists and you don’t care what’s in it, you can use the <code>-f</code> flag to force overwriting.</p><p>hApps are meant to be hackable; that’s why every <code>pack</code> command has a corresponding <code>unpack</code> command. In this way a UI developer or skilled user who doesn’t want to get into Rust can take a look at what other people have built and remix it for their context.</p> <code>hc app</code>: working with hApps <p>One level broader than a DNA is a hApp. It’s just a bundle of DNAs that comprise the full back-end functionality of an application. You can treat DNAs as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices?ref=blog.holochain.org">microservices</a>, tightly-scoped modules that do one thing and do it well.</p> <code>hc app init</code>: creating a hApp manifest <p>The first step, as you may have guessed, is to stub out a hApp manifest file.</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc app init happ-workdir/</code> <p>It asks you for a name and a description, then generates the file for you in <code>happ-workdir/</code>. Let’s take a look inside the <code>happ.yaml</code> file.</p> <code>manifest_version: '1'
name: gardenswap
description: A place for sharing seeds, plants, and extra produce
roles:
- name: sample-role
  provisioning:
    strategy: create
    deferred: false
  dna:
    bundled: ./path/to/my/dnabundle.dna
    modifiers:
      network_seed: null
      properties: null
      origin_time: null
      quantum_time: null
      version: null
      clone_limit: 0</code> <p>In addition to the familiar manifest version number and name fields, there’s a description field; this lets app launchers show something human-friendly to the person installing it.</p><p>After that come the roles of each DNA in the hApp. Each role defines a thing the hApp does, then says “this is the DNA that’s going to fill that role”. You can think of them as similar to <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">interfaces</a> in TypeScript or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">traits</a> in Rust, albeit without a formal definition of what functionality they’re expected to provide.</p><p>Each role has a name:</p> <code>roles:
- name: sample-role</code> <p>The conductor will use this field both in display and in generating cell IDs — unique identifiers for each cell, or running DNA instance paired with an agent key. Below you can see an example from a hApp that my colleague Matthias created, <a href="https://wordcondenser.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Word Condenser</a>, which helps people come up with good names for things. The hApp has two roles, <code>lobby</code> (where we come together and find out what things people are trying to name) and <code>craving</code> (where we express a need for a new word). There are three <code>craving</code> cells. Their DNA names, circled in red, are different; but their role name, circled in blue, is identical.</p><p>Next we define how the cell is going to be provisioned when someone installs the hApp.</p> <code>  provisioning:
    strategy: create
    deferred: false</code> <p>Currently the only supported strategy is <code>create</code>, and the <code>deferred</code> field is ignored. But in the future you’ll be able to specify whether the cell should be created immediately or later, cloned on installation, created only when a cell with the same DNA hash doesn’t already exist, or not provisioned at all and simply made ready for cloning.</p><p>After this you specify what DNA is going to fill the role.</p> <code>  dna:
    bundled: ./path/to/my/dnabundle.dna
    modifiers:
      network_seed: null
      properties: null
      origin_time: null
      quantum_time: null
    version: null
    clone_limit: 0</code> <p>In addition to the path to the bundled DNA that you created with <code>hc dna pack</code>, along with an opportunity to override the DNA’s default modifiers (except the list of integrity zomes). This lets you reuse other people’s DNAs in your own hApp, creating a new network space via the network seed or other modifiers.</p><p>Three fields bear further description:</p>  <code>modifiers.quantum_time</code> lets you tune the way gossiping works for historical data; large numbers are better for DHTs that won’t see much activity. It’s safe to leave this as <code>null</code>.  <code>version</code> is an optional sanity check that makes sure the DNA you’re pointing to is what you expect it to be. It can be a single DNA hash or multiple DNA hashes in cases where there are multiple compatible versions of a DNA that could work in that role, e.g. while developing the app and experiencing a lot of DNA hash changes. The DNA hash is calculated before this manifest overrides any of its modifiers.  <code>clone_limit</code> lets you put a cap on how many clones can be created from this DNA in this role. <code>0</code> prevents clones from being created. Make sure your limit is reasonable — large enough to allow real-world use cases but small enough to limit resource consumption. Every cell takes up a bit more storage, memory, network, and CPU cycles.   <code>hc app pack</code> and <code>unpack</code>: bundling and unbundling a hApp file <p>Similar to <code>hc dna</code>, once you’ve created your hApp manifest you can bundle it into a hApp file and decompose a hApp file into its manifest and DNA(s). You can also specify DNA manifest files rather than bundled DNA files and give the <code>--recursive</code> flag, which directs the tool to bundle all missing DNAs from their manifests first, then bundle them all into the hApp file. This works by looking for the referenced bundle first, and if it can’t be found, it’ll look for a <code>dna.yaml</code> manifest in the same directory as the missing bundle and bundle it into a file with the expected name.</p> <code>hc web-app</code>: working with web-based hApps <p>Once you’ve got your hApp all bundled up, you can bundle it with a web-based client for distribution to the Launcher or the future Holo hosting network. By now, I bet you’ll be able to guess what sub-commands it has — <code>init</code>, <code>pack</code>, and <code>unpack</code>. Let’s try the first one.</p> <code>hc web-app init</code>: creating a web hApp manifest <p>Once again, I’m going to put the web hApp manifest file into a work directory. The scaffolding tool puts it into the same <code>workdir/</code> directory, but as the <code>hc</code> tool currently doesn’t let me do that, I’ll give it its own:</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc web-app init webhapp-workdir</code> <p>Again it asks for a name — and that’s it! Let’s look at the new <code>web-happ.yaml</code> manifest file.</p> <code>manifest_version: '1'
name: gardenswap
ui:
  bundled: ./path/to/my/ui.zip
happ_manifest:
  bundled: ./path/to/my/happ-bundle.happ</code> <p>The bundled UI is just a zipped-up web app with, at the very least, an <code>index.html</code> file. You can use whatever front-end framework you like, or just hack away in vanilla JavaScript. The only requirement is that you precompile everything into something a web browser can use. (We’ll get into how to make your UI talk to the hApp in a future article.)</p> <code>hc web-app pack</code> and <code>unpack</code>: bundling and decomposing a web hApp <p>These two subcommands operate on a web hApp manifest and <code>.webhapp</code> file in the same way that <code>hc app</code> operates on a hApp manifest and <code>.happ</code> file. Again, <code>hc web-app pack --recursive</code> recursively bundles a missing hApp from a manifest (and likewise any missing DNA bundles specified in the hApp manifest).</p> <code>hc launch</code>: trialling your hApp locally <p>When you move from single-instance to distributed computing — whether cloud apps or peer-to-peer apps like Holochain — you gain some things and you lose some things. Scaling problems disappear, but you have to say goodbye to the simplicity of having only one program manipulating only one data store.</p><p>Holochain has a number of tools to help you reason about and test your application. There’s a Node.js-based framework for creating automated, multiplayer scenario tests, called <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tryorama</a>, but that’s outside the scope of this article (I’ll introduce it in a future one).</p><p>For now I’ll introduce a couple subcommands for manually testing your hApps. The simplest one is <code>hc launch</code>, which creates conductor setups for one or more ‘users’ of the hApp and uses a command-line version of the Launcher to show their UIs. The nice thing about this is that you're testing with the same binary as your users will be using. And it live-reloads the UI as you're working on it!</p><p>You can launch a hApp simply by entering <code>hc launch &lt;name&gt;.webhapp</code> on the command line. These arguments give you some more control:</p>  <code>--num-sandboxes &lt;number&gt;</code> spawns multiple agents.  <code>--network-seed &lt;seed&gt;</code> passes a network seed to all cells.  <code>--holochain-path &lt;path&gt;</code> lets you specify an alternative conductor binary on your system, if you’re testing your hApp against different Holochain versions.  <code>--ui-path &lt;path&gt;</code> lets you point to a directory full of web assets if you’re launching a UI-less <code>.happ</code> file with a UI of your own.  <code>network &lt;mode&gt;</code> lets you specify the transport implementation; you can choose from the default <code>quic</code>, <code>mdns</code> for local peer discovery, or <code>mem</code> for single-machine in-memory transport. If you choose <code>quic</code>, you can specify a bootstrap service URL with the <code>-b</code> argument. Note that this is a subcommand, not a standard argument; there’s no preceding <code>--</code> , and it has to come after all arguments, including the name of your <code>.webhapp</code> file.  <p>There are other parameters for more esoteric needs; enter <code>hc launch help</code> to learn more.</p><p><code>hc launch</code> also spawns a useful tool in your browser: the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-playground?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain Playground</a>. This tool, created by Guillem Cordoba, is sort of a hApp inspector; it gives you a view into the DHT of each DNA in the hApp, as well as the source chains of each locally running cell. It’s great for both learning and debugging.</p> <code>hc sandbox</code>: creating and running conductor configurations for testing <p>If you find your needs grow beyond what <code>hc launch</code> can offer, <code>hc sandbox</code> gives you more control over how test instances are created. It generates conductor configurations (sandboxes) that are persisted to disk across test runs, along with the databases that store hApp data. This lets you create test fixtures, although it isn’t recommended to check them into source control because there are some machine-dependent paths and the databases will keep accumulating more data across runs.</p><p>Before we get into all the subcommands, some things are common to a number of them:</p>  The argument <code>--force-admin-ports &lt;port0&gt;[,&lt;port1&gt;...]</code> specifies WebSocket ports for the sandboxes’ admin APIs. If they aren’t specified, the conductors will each autoselect an unused port. (Note: the admin API lets you control the conductor itself, and is typically used only by hApp launchers, not hApp UIs. You can find documentation on all the endpoints in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/main/docs/client.adminapi.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">JavaScript client library’s documentation</a> or the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rustdoc</a>).  The argument <code>--holochain-path &lt;path&gt;</code> specifies what conductor binary to use when spawning instances.  By default, sandboxes are created in your system’s temp directory. If you want a consistent place to store them (for example, if you want to check them into source control), the <code>--root &lt;dir&gt;</code> argument will work for both <code>hc sandbox create</code> and <code>hc sandbox generate</code>.  As you create or generate sandboxes, the names of the directories in which they’re stored are random, but the full paths to them are stored in an <code>.hc</code> file in the directory in which you run the commands. <code>hc run</code> will find that file and use those paths. If you’re creating sandboxes to be checked into source control, check the <code>.hc</code> file in as well; otherwise add it to your project’s source control system ignore file.   <code>hc sandbox create</code>: create empty sandboxes for later population <p>This subcommand simply creates conductor configurations without any hApp configuration in them. This can be useful if you’re building and testing something that controls a conductor — for instance, if you’re developing a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher?ref=blog.holochain.org">hApp launcher</a> or a hApp that <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/electron-holochain?ref=blog.holochain.org">embeds both the UI and the conductor in an Electron shell</a>.</p><p>In addition to the <code>--root</code> argument and <code>network</code> subcommand I described, <code>hc sandbox create</code> has a couple other arguments:</p>  <code>--num-sandboxes &lt;number&gt;</code> creates multiple sandboxes.  <code>--directories &lt;directory0&gt;[,&lt;directory1&gt;...]</code> lets you specify named sandbox directory names rather than the default randomly generated ones. Make sure that you give as many directory names as the number of sandboxes, or it’ll generate random names for the remaining ones!   <code>hc sandbox generate</code>: create hApp sandboxes <p>This subcommand goes one step further, letting you put a hApp into your generated sandboxes. It takes the path to your bundled hApp, along with <code>--root</code> and <code>network</code>, and the following arguments:</p>  <code>--app-id &lt;id&gt;</code> is just a string to identify the hApp by.  <code>--num-sandboxes</code> and <code>--directories</code> work like they do for <code>hc sandbox create</code>.  <code>--run [&lt;port0&gt;[,&lt;port1&gt;...]]</code> runs the sandboxes right away, with an optional comma-separated list of app interface ports. Make sure the number of ports matches the number of sandboxes, or the remaining sandboxes won’t be run.   <code>hc sandbox run</code>: run those sandboxes you created <p>Okay, so you’ve generated a bunch of conductor sandboxes, along with hApp, admin API, and network transport configurations, and now you want to run them together and see how they do!</p><p>You’ve got a few choices for specifying which sandboxes to run:</p>  <code>--all</code> runs all the conductor sandboxes it finds in your current directory’s <code>.hc</code> file.  <code>--last</code> runs only the last sandbox listed in <code>.hc</code>.  <code>--existing-paths &lt;path0&gt;[,&lt;path1&gt;...]</code> runs only the sandboxes in the specified paths.  A space-separated list of indices as the last argument looks in your <code>.hc</code> file and runs only the lines specified. These indices are zero-based.  <p>Finally, you can give a list of app API WebSocket ports with the <code>--ports &lt;port0&gt;[,&lt;port1&gt;...]</code> argument; a <code>0</code> for any port will cause the port number to be auto-selected. These port numbers will be saved for the next time you run the sandboxes. See the note above about making sure you specify enough ports for the number of sandboxes you want to run!</p><p>The app API, in contrast to the admin API I mentioned earlier, is how your hApp’s client (such as a UI) accesses the hApp itself. You can find more info in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/main/docs/client.appapi.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">JavaScript client lib documentation</a> or the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rustdoc</a>.</p><p>Now your hApp is running a few copies of itself on your machine! The copies are already communicating with each other using the transport protocol you specified when you created the sandbox configs, and they’re listening for clients using the ports you just specified. I’ll explain how to connect your client to those ports and use the app API in a future article on the JavaScript client lib.</p> <code>hc sandbox call</code>: access a running sandbox’s admin API <p>Now that you have a bunch of sandboxed conductors running your hApp, you can also call their admin APIs using a command-line interface. All of the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/main/docs/client.adminapi.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">admin API endpoints</a> are there as kebab-cased subcommands, and you get to pass API call payloads as command-line arguments and see responses as JSON rather than awkward MessagePack blobs.</p><p>A description of these endpoints is beyond the scope of this article, but read the afore-linked documentation and make liberal use of <code>hc sandbox call help &lt;api-endpoint&gt;</code> to learn how to use each of them. And stay tuned for that future article on the JavaScript client lib.</p> <code>hc sandbox list</code>: list available sandboxes <p>This one’s a real simple one; it just lists the sandboxes in your current folder’s <code>.hc</code> file alongside their indices for use in <code>hc sandbox run</code>. You can get more info about the sandboxes’ conductor configs with the <code>--verbose</code> argument.</p> <code>hc sandbox clean</code>: remove sandboxes <p>This command is even simpler; it deletes the sandboxes whose paths are listed in your current folder’s <code>.hc</code> file and removes the <code>.hc</code> file.</p> That’s it! <p>These CLI dev tools are often called ‘Swiss army knives’, and this one is bristling with blades and screwdrivers and other things. It may not be clear yet how to use all of them, but I encourage you to bookmark this article — you’ll likely want to refer back to it as you start digging more deeply into hApp development.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/02/22/the-future-of-financial-services-developing-your-open-banking-strategy/?sh=5924c9177b1b">The Future Of Financial Services: Developing Your Open Banking Strategy</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/alexanderradchenko/">Alexander Radchenko</a>, Chief Executive Officer at <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/">Intellectsoft</a>, writes in Forbes on why financial institutions need to pay attention to open banking. How does open banking differ from regular banking? Open banking uses technology, such as APIs, to offer nonfinancial and financial businesses a network of financial products like accounts and transaction methods. This means third-party providers are allowed access to payment products so they can design and build new user experiences. In 2018, the European Union introduced thePayment Services Directive (PSD2), legislation which “required banks to put the power back into the hands of customers by requiring banks to open up access to their data to third parties.” These third parties can provide a range of services, from managing the financial needs of small businesses to helping people budget.</p>
<p>Radchenko notes that open banking’s ability to speed up payments is critical to current businesses. Today’s customer does not have the time or patience for lengthy processes, and points to statistics such as <a href="https://www.forter.com/blog/infographic-customers-wont-tolerate-friction-filled-checkout/">“Half of Americans agree they’re less likely to buy something online if the entire checkout process takes longer than half a minute.”&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The key to open banking is to be able to create and sustain trusted connections between your bank and third parties that need to access your data. But creating these trusted relationships can be more complex than most people think. Having a third-party service directly access financial data through an API raises non-trivial privacy and security issues for consumers. This is why open banking needs verifiable credentials to flourish—as we explain in our recent article about consent-based data sharing with <a href="https://indicio.tech/create-seamless-account-access-and-consent-based-data-sharing-with-indicio-proven-finance/">Indicio Proven Finance.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/23884/driving-financial-inclusion-for-small-businesses-in-jordan-with-open-banking">Driving Financial Inclusion for Small Businesses in Jordan with Open Banking</a></p>
<p>Dylan Thiam, Head of Marketing &amp; Content at TESOBE / Open Bank Project, explains how open banking has exploded in Jordan. At the end of November the Central Bank of Jordan published legislation requiring all banks to “open Account Information and Payment Initiation services to authorized third-party providers by the end of 2023.”</p>
<p>One of open banking’s key value propositions is that it can deliver critical business services to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) which are otherwise unavailable from large banks.</p>
<p>For example, in Jordan, <a href="https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/112806.html">only 10% of all bank and microfinance institution (MFI) loans go to MSMEs</a> due to either their lack of documentation and credit history or banks being unable&nbsp; to handle smaller loans and financing. Given that SMEs make up <a href="https://www.giz.de/de/downloads/GEMJ_EN.pdf">96% of the corporate economy</a> in Jordan, the impact of these new rules on the economy will likely be significant.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-cfpb-open-banking-rule-8915627/">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Open Banking Rule</a></p>
<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a US Government agency tasked with making sure consumers are treated fairly by banks, lenders, and other financial institutions. Recently, the CFPB unveiled its Open Banking Rule, which would push the financial services industry toward open banking and require financial institutions to provide six&nbsp; categories of customer information, including customer identity information (address, name, etc) and transaction information to authorized third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The motivation behind the ruling is, according to CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, to boost market competition in the financial sector by “empowering people to break up with banks that provide bad service.” By enabling the consumer to have control over their data, Chopra says that consumers can more easily take their business anywhere, and to smaller or newer organizations that would have otherwise been unable to compete with larger banks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nigeria has become the first African country to adopt open banking regulations.&nbsp; While traditional banking usage is low in Nigeria, the use of mobile money — apps that allow you to send money to peers, make purchases, apply for loans and pay bills, all from money stored in a bank-style account linked to their mobile phone. — is very popular.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This raises interesting use cases, as the end users here don’t necessarily care about traditional “banking” at all, but instead seek better integration between mobile money networks and financial institutions. Every integration enables more access for everyone to their financial institutions and apps of choice, enabling more people that previously couldn’t to benefit and be a part of the local economy.</p>

 Staying compliant in an ever-changing industry requires the right partner by your side. 



<p>Compliance in the gaming industry is no easy feat, especially with an increasing and competitive black market. It is therefore undoubtedly one of the most crucial aspects driving the industry as a whole. With <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gaming-regulation-in-europe-an-overview/">regulatory changes in many European countries</a> tightening and requiring companies to address this issue, along with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">differing requirements across the EU and UK</a> – finding the right RegTech partner is crucial in overcoming those challenges whilst remaining commercially competitive.</p>



 First off, what is RegTech in gaming? 



<p>Regulatory technology, or RegTech, is a rapidly emerging technology that works to streamline the process of meeting regulatory requirements. Playing a heavy hand in financial services, it has become an important component of the gaming industry.</p>



<p>Here are just some of the many ways in which RegTech assists businesses in gaming:</p>



  Helps operators to automate and monitor compliance with regulatory policies more quickly and effectively than ever before  Makes it possible for operators to easily identify irregularities in licenses, as well as in countries where compliance may be difficult  Provides gambling authorities with clear information regarding auditing activities  Allows operators to keep track of changes in regulations without manual updates, giving them the ability to stay compliant and make sure their games are accessible everywhere  Increases efficiency for gaming companies  Protects gaming customers by improving security and mitigating risks associated with fraudulent activities  



<p>By ensuring that operators are following rules and regulations and customers are gambling legally, RegTech promises a more secure gaming experience for customers worldwide all while providing a pleasing user experience.</p>



 Regulatory needs of gaming companies. 



<p>When it comes to the needs of gaming companies a few priorities top the list and therefore aim to be achieved. Some of these needs are major concerns as well.</p>



 Reducing fraud: 



<p>Fraud tops the list for one of the most important priorities of gaming operators. With the global online gambling industry already <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market">valued at USD 63.53 billion in 2022, and an expected annual growth rate of 11.7% from 2023 to 2030</a>, it’s safe to say that the popularity of online gambling is very much present. As more players use their mobile phones to play, gambling is here to stay. But with that comes fraudsters waiting to play their hand. Specifically, many operators are facing challenges with regards to bonus fraud and synthetic fraud.</p>



<p>Bonus fraud, also known as bonus abuse, is fraud that involves signing up to a service multiple times with different identities in order to receive the customer bonus or marketing offer that is advertised. This abuse is costing the online gaming industry around <a href="https://www.intergameonline.com/views/a-tale-of-woe-betting-gaming-and-bonus-abuse">15 percent of its total gross revenue</a>. Along with that comes in synthetic identity fraud with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/08/19/how-businesses-can-fight-the-growing-threat-of-synthetic-identity-fraud/?sh=438a88232887">23% of businesses seeing this type of fraud as the most prevalent fraud scheme in their industry</a>. This is where fraudsters harvest different kinds of information in order to create a brand new fake identity that appears legitimate. As a result, synthetic fraud can therefore be used in combination with bonus fraud.</p>



<p>With such looming threats facing many gambling operators, reducing fraud is one of their top priorities in order to safeguard their company as well as their players.</p>



 Balancing compliance with user experience: 



<p>As gambling companies continue to expand and grow, finding the right balance between staying compliant in a growing and competitive industry and offering a seamless user experience can be challenging. In order to stay compliant with the ever-increasing laws in jurisdictions, companies need to make sure they cover all requirements without sacrificing on customer onboarding.</p>



<p>Therefore, meeting such needs as verifying players’ age and identities efficiently and as frictionless as possible is a must have. Furthermore, as more and more states across the board promote <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">responsible gambling</a>, it is imperative that gambling operators implement such measurements in order to create a safer gambling environment for their players. By so doing, gambling companies can rest-assured that black markets will not prevail, but staying compliant will allow them to scale their market without sacrificing overall player experience and commercial profitability.</p>



 Importance of finding the right RegTech partner. 



<p>With the needs of gambling operators clearly defined, it’s important to find a partner who understands those needs and can assist in solving the issues at hand. Therein lies the importance of finding the right partner to help.</p>



<p>Gambling companies need a partner that listens to these needs and offers solutions that work. With many operators trying to cope with the growth and attempt at scaling all while being compliant with regulators’ ever-changing demands and reducing fraud, it is not a one-man show, but can only be accomplished with the help of a RegTech partner.</p>



 



  



 Features of a reliable RegTech partner. 



<p>As Gambling sales managers at IDnow, we work directly with gambling operators. As a result, we have come up with a list of features that current gambling companies are looking for when it comes to finding the right fit for a RegTech partner in the industry:</p>



<p>Accuracy &amp; Reliability: The number one priority for gambling operators is that the solutions RegTech providers are offering do what they are advertised to do. But not only that, it is imperative that the solutions are accurate and reliable by guaranteeing that identity documents will be screened correctly, so fraud will not pass through. </p>



<p>Honesty &amp; Trust: Honesty and trust are essential when dealing with service providers. Companies want a partner who will inform them openly and honestly about the strengths and weaknesses of the solutions presented. A RegTech partner should show how to minimize risks and describe where you can work with them. Not only will you meet the requirements, but you will also raise the bar for your compliance responsibilities with their help.</p>



<p>Expertise: Experience and professionalism is key when it comes to identity verification. Operators want to know that who they are working with have the expert knowledge on the many regulatory markets and can provide them with the information they need to stay compliant, while still scaling globally.</p>



<p>Speed: As more and more users partake in online gambling, making sure a solution quickly verifies potential players in a fast manner is truly essential, especially when wanting to increase conversion rates.</p>



<p>Simplicity: Along with speed, simplicity is also high on the wish list of gaming operators. Since all players must go through screening before being allowed to play, a solution that offers a minimal frictionless process towards the player onboarding experience is key.</p>



<p>Support: In the end, what will ultimately lead the RegTech solution to success is the implementation. Operators need to know that the company they partner with will provide support in relation to the product along with the resources, timeline and costs required.</p>



 A perfect partnership, a balance of benefits. 



<p>If taking the above desires into consideration, RegTech providers can listen to their potential partners in order to better understand their needs and provide them with the best possible service. But despite the list of features they hope to see in their provider, there are also concerns that come with it. Such concerns include product unreliability, blockage of vast amounts of internal resources, aftersales care and support not met, and the cost of implementation from price, time and resources too high.</p>



<p>Thus, RegTech providers need to provide businesses with what they need in order to alleviate those fears. It’s always a balancing act when it comes to partnerships, and solution providers need to listen and assess the situation in order to showcase the benefits that the operators will receive by partnering with them.</p>



<p>Instead of focusing on the problem it’s better to look at the solution. When operators link up with a RegTech provider the benefits far outweigh the concerns. Such benefits businesses can expect include the scalability they desire paired with high conversion rates, excellent document coverage, faster verification, fraud detection and the support and care they hope for.</p>

<p>After the FATF Plenary in February 2023 two new guidances were issued by the authority:</p>



  <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/countering-ransomware-financing.html">Countering</a><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/countering-ransomware-financing.html"> </a><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/countering-ransomware-financing.html">Ransomware Financing</a> 



 <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-Beneficial-Ownership-Legal-Persons.html">BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF LEGAL PERSONS</a> 
  Countering Ransomware Financing 



<p>The report on ransomware highlights an increase in these attacks between 2020 and 2021 compared to data from 2019. However, despite this increase, ransomware attacks seem to have one of the lowest reporting rates out of all financial crimes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To assist authorities throughout jurisdictions, the report:</p>



  disseminates methods used by criminals to carry out the attacks and money laundering schemes – for example,<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/raas/"> ransomware as a service (RaaS) </a>and attacks on high-value entities seemed to have had the highest success rate; 



 provides a list of red flags which indicate ML where the predicate crime is ransomware. The flags are categorized as follows:
  Banks/Other financial and payment institutions identifying ransomware victim payment; 



 VASPs identifying ransomware victim payment; 



 VASPs identifying ransomware payment receipt/ransomware criminal account; 



 Jurisdictions with higher money laundering risks; 
  



 suggests jurisdictions to increase international communication, acquire skills and develop or make use of tools that allow them to collect relevant information to trace transactions and recover crypto assets; 



 requests a call for action on VASPs’ side to increase the reporting of these attacks; 



 urges jurisdictions which have not yet implemented FATF’s Recommendation 15 into national law to do so urgently. 
 <p>It is noted that payments are almost exclusively requested in virtual assets due to the instantaneous cross-border nature of transactions, VASPs with lax or non-existent AML processes and procedures and the availability of privacy coins and mixers which help in the laundering process of the proceeds.&nbsp;</p>



 Beneficial Ownership Of Legal Persons 



<p>FATF’s Recommendation 24 requires „countries to ensure that competent authorities have access to adequate, accurate and up-to-date information on the true owners of companies”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Standard was subject to revisions aiming at:</p>



  identifying and preventing criminals and sanction evaders from using businesses such as shell companies to hide their illicit activities and illegal proceeds.&nbsp; 



 help jurisdiction assess and mitigate risks related to ML and TF stemming from foreign companies to which they are exposed.&nbsp; 



 helping jurisdictions „identify, design and implement appropriate measures in line with the revised Recommendation 24 to ensure that beneficial ownership information is held by a public authority or body functioning as a beneficial ownership registry, or an alternative mechanism that enables efficient access to the information.” 



 providing guidance on types and sources of relevant information, and mechanism and sources to obtain such information.

				<p>The canvas is a tool to map out a use case for an IDtech product. It’s a visual guide to help align internal and external stakeholders who will be interacting with the product.&nbsp;This post will include some examples of a “filled out” canvas to stoke the imagination and help make these concepts more concrete. We will follow three examples throughout the rest of the post to illustrate how they map onto the questions outlined in the IDtech product canvas.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
			 What is the IDtech Product Canvas NOT for? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>While the first version of this tool was called the “Trust Ecosystem Canvas,” after a round of feedback we’ve made some adjustments to the name of the tool to clarify that it should not be used to map out an entire trust ecosystem.&nbsp;This tool doesn’t show everything needed to illustrate a regulated, multi-stakeholder, trust ecosystem that encapsulates many use cases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The canvas is also not meant to show&nbsp;how all of this works in practice and how to operationalize these concepts. We decided this is beyond the scope of this tool, though we’re actively working on other tools to help builders turn the IDtech Product Canvas into a more actionable product plan. For now,&nbsp;the technical details around credential formats, blockchains, trust registries, API calls, etc. are out of scope.&nbsp;</p>

				<p>What is the problem that you’re solving?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Said another way, what is the use case you’d like to map out on the canvas?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the purpose of this blog post, we’ll be exploring three use cases. For the featured use case, we’ll answer all questions on the canvas to clearly illustrate how to fill out the entirety of the tool. For the secondary examples, we’ll just provide final outputs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Featured use case:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  A local government is looking to increase tourism by issuing a tourist pass  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Secondary use cases:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Increasing security and convenience by issuing digital banking credentials  Streamlining license and credential management for travel nurses

				<p>We think it makes sense to start with the issuer box, then move to the holder, verifier, and provider. The issuer, holder, and verifier are common roles within the traditional “trust triangle” of SSI. While they’re all illustrated as separate stakeholders, it’s possible for an issuer to be the holder, if they’re self-attesting to a credential like a favorite color or t-shirt size. It’s also possible for the issuer and verifier to be the same party, if they’re both issuing and verifying membership to a company rewards program.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s follow a specific example through the canvas, answering the associated questions.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The Issuer

				<p>If you answer the questions from the canvas individually, you’ll get an output like:</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				 
 	 Who is issuing credentials?
 
 	 The city government 
 
 
 	 What credentials are being issued?
 
 	 A tourist pass 
 
 
 	 How and when are credentials issued?
 
 	 When a tourist plans their trip, they request a tourist pass via an online portal 
 
 
 	 What is the issuer’s incentive to participate?
 
 	 To improve the tourist experience and bring additional economic growth and revenue to their region 
 
 
 					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Once you’ve answered each question, you can put all of the answers together, mad-lib style, to form a single sentence that communicates the concept:</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				The city government issues a tourist pass when someone visits their city in order to improve the tourist experience and drive economic activity in their region. 			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Some other examples of final outputs might be:&nbsp;</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				A bank issues a membership credential when they onboard new clients, so they can more securely prove who they’re communicating with in person and online. 			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Or</p>

 New Feature: Enable CEX Trading for Tokenized Securities 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in March 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>As a tokenization platform using mainly public blockchain networks, enabling more liquidity features is one of our priorities. Today, we’re proud to introduce&nbsp;the Centralized Exchange (CEX) feature&nbsp;to our&nbsp;<a href="https://csqny04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/WZ+113/csQNy04/VW4pyT3zNtYvN68yK3dP9r9TW48Yhp74YcDjjN26s6053q8_QV1-WJV7CgRrdN4nvB8n1Y638W4mNwdT6f1Qp6VzQxZ46ZLDqkW1SYNzb38d95rW5Bt--R2YQLX7W81_fZm3_vVcXW1ZRRkh5VL_cgW4GMZPB7W8mfJW8qjGfv8DxQFQW1lZbDm57G8BLW74c1dx378NCcW8dfkg77CkvBtW7qq46t8xQS9SW3Rc_BY2VCdgdW5DW97k1rHthvW3M9P-s81w0rsW13C6Lb4GJqjYW6znj3Q4sd_bGW7c_jpq5H7hXzN5ZZqjWPKZWsVKj_d35PNRD3W5P5csj6m0JT136NK1">T-REX platform</a>&nbsp;to facilitate liquidity. This&nbsp;makes your ERC3643 tokenized securities technically compatible with any centralized exchange&nbsp;using the same blockchain network as your tokenized securities.</p>
<p>The CEX feature complements our innovative bulletin board solution&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/">Billboard</a>&nbsp;to provide additional liquidity solutions to issuers. Once activated, investors can&nbsp;trade their digital securities on centralized trading platforms such as exchanges, ATS, or MTF.</p>
<p>(Note: The trading platforms listed in the screenshot below are examples)</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Here is how it works:</p>
<p>1. Sign a commercial agreement: As an issuer, you have the responsibility to ensure that the trading venues are in compliance with your securities. You and the trading venues must sign a commercial agreement enabling the listing of your tokenized securities in their exchange or network.</p>
<p>2. Allow trading venues: Simply enable the ‘Is Allowed’ button for exchanges you have an agreement with.</p>
<p>3. Add deposit wallets: Each of your investors can view enabled exchanges on their Investor Portal dashboard under the ‘Buy/Sell’ module and add their deposit wallets provided by the respective trading venues.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>4. Approve deposit wallets:&nbsp;You’ll receive a new request to approve the deposit wallet via your ‘Deposit wallets” module.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>5. Transfer tokenized securities:&nbsp;Once the deposit wallet address is approved, investors can transfer their tokenized securities to the deposit wallet.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>6. Trade on CEX(s): Transfers take only a few seconds, depending on the network. Once completed, tokenized securities will be managed by the exchange and available for trading on their platforms.</p>
<p>The rollout of the CEX feature marks a momentous milestone for us, and we couldn’t have achieved it without the dedication and tireless efforts of our developers. We are committed to continuously expanding our features to support more secondary market solutions, such as decentralized exchanges and collateralization DeFi protocols,&nbsp;bridging tokenized real-world assets (RAW) to DeFi&nbsp;to unlock the full potential of tokenized securities.</p>

The KERI community has also been growing rapidly in the past few years, spawning a number of open-source projects, such as <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust">WebOfTrust</a>, as well as getting a major adoption by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) in the form of <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable LEI&nbsp;(vLEI)</a>.</p><p>I was first introduced to KERI by Sam Smith, i.e. the author himself, in one of the Internet Identity Workshops in 2020, and my first impression of KERI&nbsp;was:</p><blockquote>Holy cow, that’s a lot of&nbsp;jargon.</blockquote><p>As someone without a background in cybersecurity, KERI was definitely not an easy concept to grasp. It also contains a huge collection of newly defined terms, making a steep learning curve for all but a few cybersecurity professionals and computer scientists. However, as I went down the KERI rabbit hole, I slowly became convinced that KERI is one of the most elegant, if not the most elegant, implementations for identity systems to&nbsp;date.</p><p>Hence, I would like to write an introduction to important jargon for understanding KERI. This introduction is divided into two&nbsp;parts.</p>  Part 1 deals with the term related to Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs) as well as operations and data structures defined in KERI. It also, in a way, provides a summary of the KERI whitepaper.  Part 2 dives into other peripheral topics in the KERI ecosystem such as Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC), Out-of-Band Introduction (OOBI), and Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR).  <p>Note that this blog does not aim to be comprehensive and only introduces each term at its surface level.

A key pair allows a controller to create a digital signature that cryptographically proves the authenticity of a transaction. An identity system binds the three components, and any weak link in such a system presents a vulnerability to cyberattacks.</p>Binding of a controller, authentication factors, and identifiers in identity&nbsp;systems.<p>The binding between a controller and a key pair can be easily made strong by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator">cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG)</a>, which collects sufficient entropy to generate a key pair. As long as the controller has the ability to keep the private key secure, such binding is considered strong. However, how the controller and the key pair are bound to an identifier depends on the types of identity architectures. In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a> by Phil Windley, three types of identity architectures are defined: namely Administrative, Algorithmic, and Autonomic architectures.</p>  An Administrative Architecture relies on an administrator (a person or an organization) to bind an identifier to a key pair of the controller. Such bindings are considered weak as it is inherently vulnerable to faulty operational administration. A classic example of this architecture is the Domain Name System (DNS) with Certificate Authorities (CAs), which suffers from security exploits such as DNS hijacking and requires additional infrastructure to mitigate the&nbsp;risk.  An Algorithmic Architecture relies on a blockchain to register and strongly bind a public key and an identifier. In a system where the identifier is cryptographically derived from the public key, all three bindings are considered strong. Here, the controller of the key pair can assert control over the identifier, and anyone with access to the ledger can algorithmically verify the controller-identifier binding. Most SSI implementations that are built on blockchains fall into this category.  An Autonomic Architecture is similar to an algorithmic architecture where a controller generates a key pair and derives an identifier, providing strong bindings to all components. The difference is that the controller records the binding between the key pair and the identifier in a local Key Event Log (KEL), instead of recording such binding in a globally shared ledger. KERI is an autonomic identity architecture.  <p>In summary, the main difference between KERI and blockchain is that blockchain relies on a network of validators while KERI requires only local operation by a controller.</p><blockquote>Here, we specifically refer to the term “blockchain” as a “distributed consensus ledger” with a global ordering of&nbsp;records.</blockquote> Root of&nbsp;Trust <p>A Root of Trust is defined as a component or process of the system upon which other components rely on. In an identity system, it is something on which the security of the system is dependent, and great care must be taken to design and implement a root of trust. There are two main types of roots of trust, namely primary and secondary roots of&nbsp;trust:</p>  A primary root of trust is irreplaceable and provides trust that is uniquely necessary to the system. Any compromise on the primary root of trust also compromises the trustworthiness of the entire identity system. In a blockchain-based identity system, the primary root of trust is the blockchain. In KERI, on the other hand, the primary root of trust is in a self-certifying identifier—called an autonomic identifier (AID)—that is purely cryptographic and is under the control of an end&nbsp;user.  A secondary root of trust is replaceable and provides trust that may be also provided redundantly by another component. In a KERI-based identity system, a Key Event Log (KEL) is considered a secondary root of&nbsp;trust.  <blockquote>Note 1: A blockchain may be used with KERI and an autonomic identifier (AID). In this case, the blockchain serves as a secondary root of trust for the&nbsp;AID.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: KERI also has additional supporting mechanisms that serve as secondary roots of trust, including a Key Event Receipt Log (KERL), witnesses, watchers, etc.</blockquote> SCID (Self-Certifying Identifier) <p>A SCID (Self-Certifying Identifier) is an identifier that is uniquely and cryptographically derived (e.g. by using a hash function) from a public key of a key pair. It is self-certifying (or more precisely self-authenticating) because it does not rely on any trusted third party. The controller of the SCID can cryptographically prove their control by using the private key of the same key pair to generate a digital signature on a message, and the verifier may extract the public key from the SCID itself to verify the signature.</p><p>In a basic SCID, the mapping between an identifier and its controlling public key is self-contained in the identifier itself. A basic SCID is ephemeral/non-transferable, i.e., it does not support the rotation of its key pair and therefore must be abandoned once the controlling private key becomes weakened or compromised from exposure.</p>Cryptographic binding between a public key and a self-certifying identifier (SCID). AID (Autonomic Identifier) <p>Formally, an AID (Autonomic Identifier) is a self-certifying identifier that is the primary root of trust in KERI. An AID can be considered a variant of a decentralized identifier that does not rely on a blockchain. An essential property of an AID is that it may persist despite the evolution of its key state. In other words, the controller of an AID is capable of rotating their key pair while retaining the&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>A key state of an AID refers to the set of currently authoritative and pre-rotated key&nbsp;pairs.</blockquote><p>There are two types of AIDs, namely transferable and non-transferable AIDs.</p>  A Non-transferable AID—which is also known as an ephemeral AID—is cryptographically bound to a single key pair that is not rotatable. This type of AID is not meant for long-term persistent use and should be abandoned/replaced after its private key becomes compromised. Within KERI, the primary use for non-transferable AIDs is for AIDs of witnesses and other supporting roles.  A Transferable AID is cryptographically bound to two sets of key pairs where one is called the current key pair and the other is called the next key pair. The controller can rotate the key pairs while retaining control over the AID. This process is called pre-rotation and is discussed in more detail&nbsp;later.  Simple examples of non-transferable and transferable AIDs (using a single-signature scheme). AN (Autonomic Namespace) <p>In an identity system, a namespace is defined as a grouping of identifiers for a set of related resources and their attributes. In other words, a namespace provides a systematic way of organizing identifiers by employing some scheme for assigning identifiers to the elements of the namespace.</p><p>A name-spacing scheme uses a prefix or prefixes in a hierarchical fashion to compose identifiers. The following is an example of a namespace scheme for addresses within the USA that uses a hierarchy of prefixes:</p> state.county.city.zip.street.number <p>An AN (Autonomic Namespace) is a namespace that has a self-certifying prefix that can be cryptographically verified as a root control authority over its namespace. Each identifier (i.e., an AID) from an autonomic namespace includes a prefix that is either the public key or is uniquely derived from the public key(s) of the incepting key pair(s). The associated private key may then be used by the controller to authoritatively sign statements that authenticate itself and authorize the use of the&nbsp;AID.</p><p>The following is the Autonomic Namespace Syntax and an example from the KERI whitepaper:</p> aid:prefix[:options][/path][?query][#fragment]<br><br>aid:BXq5YqaL6L48pf0fu7IUhL0JRaU2_RxFP0AL43wYn148/path/to/<br>resource?name=secure#really <p>Here, “BXq5YqaL6L48pf0fu7IUhL0JRaU2_RxFP0AL43wYn148” is the AID&nbsp;prefix.</p> Basic Prefix <p>A basic AID includes a prefix that is composed of a Base-64 (URL safe) derivation code prepended to Base-64 encoding of a public digital signing key. The derivation code is a special character that encodes the derivation process. Abstractly the prefix may be represented as&nbsp;follows:</p>Basic Prefix. (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a>.) Self-Addressing Prefix <p>A basic prefix is bound to a single key pair, which makes the AID non-transferable. For transferable AIDs, it is more useful to bind the identifier to the content digest (i.e. a cryptographic hash) of the inception statement. The inception statement includes the derivation code, the public key, the configuration, and the signature as shown&nbsp;below.</p>An inception statement for an inception event. (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a>.)<p>Abstractly the prefix for an AID may be represented as&nbsp;follows:</p>Self-Addressing Prefix. (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a>.)<p>There are also variants of self-addressing prefixes including:</p>  Multi-Sig Self-Addressing Prefix where the inception statement contains multiple sets of public keys (and the digests of multiple pre-committed keys) for a multi-signature scheme.  Delegated Self-Addressing Prefix, which involves two AIDs—namely a delegating AID and a delegated AID. A delegated AID prefix may be created by including the delegating prefix in the delegated prefix inception configuration data.   KERI DID&nbsp;Method <p>An AID may be represented as a decentralized identifier according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a>, using a <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/did-keri/">KERI DID method</a>. A KERI DID is represented simply as a “did:keri:” followed by the AID&nbsp;prefix:</p> did:keri:prefix  Pre-Rotation <p>A transferable AID is cryptographically bound to two sets of key pairs, each of which plays a role that together establishes complete control authority over the AID. In this case, the control authority over the AID is split between the two sets, as&nbsp;follows:</p>  The Current Key Pair(s) holds the signing authority.  The Next Key Pair(s) holds the rotation authority.  <blockquote>Here, the “s” refers to the case where a multi-signature scheme is employed, where multiple key pairs are required to establish signing and rotation authorities.</blockquote><p>For simplicity, let’s assume that single key pairs (i.e. using a single-signature scheme) are used for the current and next key&nbsp;pairs.</p><p>The current key pair may be used for the day-to-day operation of the AID, such as digitally signing documents and authenticating the AID’s controller via challenge-response protocols. The public key of the current key pair is revealed to external parties so that they can be used to verify signatures.</p><p>On the other hand, the public key of the next key pair is only pre-committed and hidden by a cryptographic digest (hash). The next key pair — both private and public keys— must be kept secure until a key rotation is required. The rotation event revokes the current key pairs that hold signing authority as well as replacing the next key pairs that hold rotation authority. This process is called pre-rotation since the next key pair is simply committed for rotation while the actual rotation event may occur at a later&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>Formally, pre-rotation is a cryptographic pre-commitment of an AID to the next key pair(s) for key rotation.</blockquote><p>In the example below, an AID is derived from the 1st key event that includes the 1st pubic key (current key) and the digest of the 2nd key (pre-committed next key). Once the 1st key pair is rotated, the 2nd public key is exposed and becomes the new current key. Here, the 3rd key pair is also generated, and the digest of the 3rd public key is included in the 2nd key event as the new next&nbsp;key.</p>A simple example of pre-rotation for a transferable AID (using a single-signature scheme).<p>Pre-rotation gives the controller of an AID the ability to recover their authority over the AID even if the current private key becomes compromised or&nbsp;lost.</p><blockquote>Note 1: The `new` current key in an establishment event may not necessarily be the same key as the next key from the `previous` establishment event. In other words, during rotation, the controller may assign a new key pair to be the current key instead of using the previously pre-committed key&nbsp;pair.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: A controller may choose not to replace the next key pair during rotation. In this case, the AID becomes non-transferable.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 3: Pre-rotation makes KERI post-quantum secure. Although Shor’s algorithm can break public key cryptography in poly-logarithmic time, cryptographic hashes are considered quantum-safe. Even if someone may break the current key pair of an AID, the controller of the AID can still recover the control authority by using the next key pair that is hidden by a cryptographic hash.</blockquote> Partial Pre-Rotation <p>When a multi-signature scheme is used to manage an AID, pre-rotation becomes slightly more complicated as multiple key pairs are required to establish signing and rotation authorities. A rotation event on a set of pre-rotated keys may keep some keys in reserve (i.e unexposed) while exposing others as needed. This is known as partial pre-rotation.</p><p>For example, the inception of an AID has three current key pairs called [A0, A2, A3] and three next key pairs called [A3, A4, A5], which are pre-rotated by hashes [H(A3), H(A4), H(A5)]. Here, Ai represents a public key and [H(Ai)] represents a hash of a public key Ai. The key state at the inception of the AID can be shown as&nbsp;follows:</p>  The current keys: A0, A1,&nbsp;A2  Hashes of the next keys: H(A3), H(A4),&nbsp;H(A5)  <p>A rotation event may expose [A3, A4] while reserving [A5] as well as generating [A6] to be a new signing key and [A7, A8, A9] to be new pre-rotated keys. The key state of the AID after the rotation can be shown as&nbsp;follows:</p>  The current keys: A3,&nbsp;A6  Hashes of the next keys: H(A5), H(A7), H(A8),&nbsp;H(A9)  A simple example of reserved (partial) rotation.<p>This example is also known as reserve rotation. There are two main types of partial rotations, namely reserve and custodial rotation.</p>  Reserve Rotation enables pre-rotated key pairs designated in one establishment event to be held in reserve and not exposed at the next (immediately subsequent) establishment event.  Custodial Rotation involves another entity, called a custodial agent, whose role is to hold signing authority (current keys) while the original controller can hold exclusive rotation authority (next keys). The holder of the rotation authority can then at any time without the cooperation of the custodial agent if need be revoke the agent’s signing authority and assign it to some other agent or return that authority to&nbsp;itself.   KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) <p>The Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) is a decentralized public key infrastructure for secure self-certifying identifiers (i.e., AIDs) that aims at minimum sufficiency and maximum security.</p><p>KERI uses a hash-chain data structure for managing public keys and AIDs, so it may be considered a type of “blockchain”. However, unlike traditional blockchains, KERI is not globally ordered and does not have a distributed consensus mechanism. As a result, KERI is not double-spending-proof and cannot be directly used as an infrastructure for crypto-currency or other crypto-assets. On the other hand, KERI is specifically made to be an infrastructure for identity systems and is often considered more scalable, more performant, and more decentralized—compared to blockchains.</p><blockquote>A traditional blockchain with a distributed consensus mechanism is globally ordered in the sense that all participating nodes (validators or miners) share an identical ledger, which is an ordered list of transactions.</blockquote><p>Each word in KERI has the following meaning:</p>  Key — asymmetric key cryptography.  Event—a series of key events that are related to the management of public keys and identifiers, including key rotations.  Receipt—signed receipts from witnesses of key events that provide an additional threshold structure  Infrastructure—an open-source framework for building decentralized identity&nbsp;systems.  <p>As its name suggests, KERI is all about key events, which are related to the management of persistent self-certifying identifiers (i.e., AIDs). A data structure that represents a key event—including signatures on its body—is called a Key Event Message. There are two types of key events in KERI, namely Establishment and Non-Establishment events.</p> Establishment Event <p>An Establishment Event is a key event that `establishes` changes in the key state of an AID, which includes the current set of authoritative and pre-committed key pairs for an AID. There are two sub-types of establishment events, namely inception and rotation&nbsp;events.</p>  An Inception Event is an establishment event that provides the incepting information needed to derive an AID and establish its initial key&nbsp;state.  A Rotation Event is an establishment event that provides the information needed to change the key state which includes a change to the set of authoritative key pairs for an&nbsp;AID.  <p>An establishment event message may contain the current key(s) and the digest of the next key(s), signature(s), and other metadata.</p>Establishment Event Message. (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a>.) Non-Establishment Event <p>A Non-Establishment Event is a key event that does not change the current key state for an AID. Typically the purpose of a non-establishment event is to anchor external data to the current key state of the AID, as established by the most recent prior establishment event.</p><p>A non-establishment event message contains the seals of the anchored external data and signatures, which are signed by the current&nbsp;key(s).</p>Basic Non-Establishment Event Message. (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a>.)<p>In KERI, there are four types of&nbsp;seals:</p>  A Digest Seal is a simple digest (cryptographic hash) of external&nbsp;data.  A Root Seal is a hash tree root (the Merkle tree) of external&nbsp;data.  An Event Seal includes the AID prefix, sequence number, and digest of a key event in a Key Event Log (KEL). An event seal anchors one key event to another key event, which may or may not be from the same key event sequence.  A Location Seal includes the AID prefix, sequence number, “ilk” and prior digest from a key event. A location seal is used when two seals in two different events are cross-anchoring each other. This provides a cross reference of one event to another where the other event’s digest must include the seal in the event contents so it cannot contain the first event’s digest but the digest of the preceding event.   Key Event&nbsp;Ilk <p>Note that the key event ilk—or simply ilk—indicates the type of the key event. There are 7 types of ilks defined in the KERI whitepaper:</p>  “icp” for an inception event  “rot” for a rotation&nbsp;event.  “ixn” for interaction event  “dip” for delegated inception event  “drt” for delegated rotation&nbsp;event  “rct” for event receipt&nbsp;message  “vrc” for validator event receipt&nbsp;message  <p>Specific applications may use other event ilk values. The definitions and discussions of receipt and validator will be given later&nbsp;below.</p> Interaction Event <p>An Interaction Event is a type of non-establishment event that is interleaved into the key event history along with establishment events. An interaction event includes an event-specific interaction data payload in the form of an array of one or more&nbsp;seals.</p><p>The purpose of an interaction event is to enable interactions between a controller and validator that are not expressly establishment. Interaction events are signed with the current signing&nbsp;key.</p><p>A Delegating Interaction Event is an example of an interaction event where an AID delegates an establishment event (called a Delegated Establishment Event) of another AID, either inception or rotation.</p> Extended Rotation&nbsp;Event <p>An Extended Rotation Event is a special type of a rotation event that contains interaction event data. Hence, it anchors external data to the AID while also rotating its key state. In other words, it is a key event that combines a rotation event and interaction event in the same key event&nbsp;message.</p><blockquote>An extended rotation event provides enhanced security to normal (non-establishment) interaction events since the signing key is rotated immediately after it is used to sign the key event&nbsp;message.</blockquote> Key Event&nbsp;Sequence <p>A Key Event Sequence is a uniquely ordered sequence of key event messages that are chained together via the digest of the immediately preceding key event message. A key event sequence consists of two key event subsequences, namely an establishment subsequence and an non-establishment subsequence.</p>Key Event Sequence. Sequence composed of interleaved establishment (inception, rotation) and non-establishment (interaction) events. (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a>.) KEL (Key Event&nbsp;Log) <p>Formally, a Key Event Log (KEL) is an append-only verifiable data structure that represents a full key event sequence for an AID. It is an ordered chained record of the key event messages created by the controller of an AID. The key events are chained in such a way that each event message (besides the inception event) includes a cryptographic digest (hash)of the preceding event message. A KEL includes both establishment and non-establishment events, which are interleaved in the key event sequence.</p><p>A verifier may verify the authority of a controller over an AID or the authenticity of signed data by replaying the subsequence of establishment events in a valid&nbsp;KEL.</p><blockquote>Note 1: A KEL is technically a type of “blockchain” in the traditional sense of an ordered list of records that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: A KEL is considered a secondary root of trust in KERI. The primary root of trust is its AID and the entropy from which the AID is&nbsp;derived.</blockquote> Key Event&nbsp;Receipt <p>A Key Event Receipt is a message whose body references a key event of an AID and includes one or more signatures on that key&nbsp;event.</p><p>For example, a key event receipt may be signed by witnesses to provide fault tolerance, security, and availability of key events. (More detail about the witnesses is given&nbsp;later.)</p> KERL (Key Event Receipt&nbsp;Log) <p>A Key Event Receipt Log (KERL) is a KEL that also includes all the consistent key event receipt messages created by witnesses. Each witness’s KERL for an AID is an append-only event log of first-seen verified consistent events. A witness only keeps consistent events and receipts of those consistent events.</p><p>A verifier may verify the authority of a controller over an AID by replaying the subsequence of establishment events in a valid&nbsp;KERL.</p><blockquote>A KERL is also considered a secondary root of trust in&nbsp;KERI.</blockquote> Duplicity <p>For a given AID, Duplicity refers to the existence of two or more versions of inconsistent instances of a KEL. Since every event in a KEL must be signed with non-repudiable signatures, any inconsistency between any two instances of the KEL is provable evidence of duplicity on the part of the signer(s), i.e. the controller of the&nbsp;AID.</p><p>Duplicity could be caused by a misbehaving/malicious controller or by an attacker that gains an access to the controller’s private key(s). In the latter case, if only the current (signing) key(s) are compromised, the controller may recover their authority by rotating the compromised key(s).</p><blockquote>A shorter KEL—which does not differ in any of its events with respect to another but longer KEL—is not duplicitous but merely incomplete.</blockquote> DEL (Duplicitous Event&nbsp;Log) <p>A Duplicitous Event Log (DEL) is a record of duplicitous events with respect to a given KERL. The duplicitous events are indexed to the corresponding event in a&nbsp;KERL.</p> Protocol Operational Modes <p>In the KERI protocol, there are two operational modes that define how key events can be conveyed between the controller of an AID and its validator. These modes are direct and indirect replay&nbsp;modes.</p><blockquote>Here, we may make a reasonable assumption that the controller of an AID is honest as it is usually in the best interests of the controller to act in a trustworthy manner. This is because each key event must be non-repudiably signed by the controller, and any inconsistent alternate version of a key event may be eventually detectable by any validator once given access to both versions. Such “duplicity” may destroy the trustworthiness of the controller and their&nbsp;AID.</blockquote> Direct Replay&nbsp;Mode <p>In the Direct Replay Mode, the controller and the validator exchange the KEL of the AID directly.</p><p>First, the validator must validate that the AID is really under the control of the controller. Since the AID is bound to one or more key pairs, the controller may establish control by sending the inception event message of the AID signed with the corresponding private keys. This inception event establishes the controller’s initial authority over the AID at issuance. This control authority can be subsequently maintained via successive rotation events. As long as the validator maintains a copy of the original event sequence—i.e., the key event log (KEL)—as first received, the validator will be able to detect any later exploit that attempts to change any of the events in that sequence, i.e., duplicity detection.</p><p>Upon reception of a key event, the validator sends a key event receipt message, which includes the validator’s signature, as an acknowledgment. The controller now has a signed receipt that attests that the validator received and verified the key event message. Hence, the validator also acts as a witness to this key event. The controller can keep the receipt in a key event receipt log (KERL). This provides a trust basis for transactions between the controller and the validator. The validator may not later repudiate its signed receipts nor refer to a different key event history in interactions with the controller without detection by the controller.</p><p>Each party could establish its own AID for use with the other in this pair-wise interaction. Each party would thereby in turn be the controller for its own AID and the validator and witness for the other’s AID. Each could maintain a KEL for the other’s AID and KERL from the other for its own AID. This allows each party to be invulnerable to subsequent exploitation with respect to this pairwise interaction.</p>A direct replay mode between Entity A and Entity B in a pairwise interaction. Indirect Replay&nbsp;Mode <p>In the Indirect Replay Mode, the promulgation of key events to a validator may happen even when the controller of an AID is not online and therefore not able to communicate directly with the validator. The purpose of the indirect mode is to provide a highly available trustworthy service for an AID that thereby ensures that any validator may have access to a copy of the original version of the key event&nbsp;history.</p><p>The controller may designate a set of witnesses, called a witness pool, that essentially stores and forward key events to any requestor. This function of the witnesses is called a key event promulgation service. The witnesses also sign the key events to create receipts and keep them in their&nbsp;KERLs.</p><blockquote>Note 1: A witness may also send its receipt to other witnesses. This might be with a broadcast or gossip protocol or not at&nbsp;all.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: It is possible that witnesses may receive inconsistent key events. In general, the witnessing policy of the witnesses is that the first seen version of an event always wins, that is, the first verified version is witnessed (signed, stored, acknowledged, and maybe disseminated) and all other versions are discarded. The exception to this general rule is that an establishment event may recover following a set of exploited non-establishment events. The recovery process may fork off a branch from the recovered trunk.</blockquote><p>An example of the indirect replay mode with a set of witnesses that are designated by the controller is shown&nbsp;below.</p>An indirect replay mode via witnesses.<p>Since the witnesses are designated by the controller, they may not be trusted by a validator. Hence, the validator may designate its own set of Watchers that may provide high availability and security from the validator’s perspective. This watcher service may be called a Key Event Confirmation Service. A simple example where both services are used is shown&nbsp;below:</p>An indirect replay mode via witnesses and watchers.<p>The validator’s confirmation service may be further enhanced to provide duplicity detection and other protections as needed. Additional roles for the key event confirmation service include a Judge and Juror(s).</p>  the Juror(s) performs duplicity detection on key events and key event receipts as well as keeps a duplicitous event log (DEL) for the&nbsp;AID.  the Judge examines KERLs and DELs from witnesses, watchers, and jurors to determine if the controller is trustworthy.  An indirect replay mode via witnesses, watchers, jurors and&nbsp;judge. Related Entities <p>The KERI protocol defines a number of entities that are involved in the management and usage of an AID, some of which have already been mentioned briefly.</p><blockquote>Here, an “Entity” could be a person, organization, autonomous software, or thing, such as an IoT&nbsp;device.</blockquote> Controller <p>A Controller of an AID is a controlling entity that can cryptographically prove the control authority (signing and rotation) over the AID, as well as make changes on the associated KEL. In the case where a multi-signature scheme is used, the controller consists of multiple controlling entities.</p><p>Normally, the controller holds both signing and rotation authorities over the AID. However, the controller may grant its authority to third parties. An example is custodial rotation where the controller grants its signing authority to a custodial agent.</p> Verifier <p>A Verifier of an AID is an entity that cryptographically verifies the signature(s) on an event message related to the&nbsp;AID.</p> Validator <p>A Validator of an AID is an entity that determines that a given signed statement associated with the AID was valid at the time of its issuance.</p><p>Note that a validator must first act as a verifier in order to determine the authoritative key set for verifying/validating the signed statement from the KEL of the&nbsp;AID.</p> Witness <p>A Witness of an AID is an entity that is designated (trusted) by the controller of the AID. The primary role of a witness is to verify, sign, and keep the key events associated with the AID. Designation of witnesses is included in key establishment events. As a result, the role of a witness may be verified using the KEL and KERL of the AID. When designated, a Witness becomes part of the supporting infrastructure for maintaining and verifying the&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>Note 1: As a special case, the controller may serve as its own&nbsp;witness.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: Witnesses are used in a group, called a witness pool. The pool forms a threshold structure that provides protection from the exploitation of a minority of the key- pairs of the ephemeral Witness AIDs in the&nbsp;pool.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 3: the initial set of designated witnesses is specified in the inception event and then may be changed by a rotation&nbsp;event.</blockquote> Watcher <p>The Watcher of an AID is an entity that keeps a copy of a KERL. A set of watchers may be used as a supporting infrastructure for a validator. Unlike witnesses, watchers are not designated by the controller.</p> Juror <p>The Juror of an AID is an entity that performs duplicity detection on key events and key event receipts. Once duplicity is detected, the Juror creates a digital signature on the duplicitous key&nbsp;events.</p><p>Each juror keeps a duplicitous event log (DEL) for each controller and all designated witnesses with respect to a KERL. Any validator may confirm duplicity by examining a&nbsp;DEL.</p> Judge <p>The Judge of an AID is an entity that examines the entries of one or more KERLs and DELs to validate that the event history of the AID is from a non-duplicitous controller and has been witnessed by a sufficient number of non-duplicitous witnesses such that it may be trusted or conversely not-trusted by a validator.</p> Resolver <p>The Resolver of an AID is an entity that provides discovery for the&nbsp;AID.</p> KA2CE (KERI’S Agreement Algorithm for Control Establishment) <p>The key event promulgation service for an AID is provided by a set of witnesses (witness pool) that employs a type of Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm, called KERI’s Agreement Algorithm for Control Establishment (KA2CE). KA2CE provides a service for the key event history of the AID via a KERL (Key Event Receipt Log). The controller must designate a threshold number where a subset of witnesses may at any time be faulty. The objective of the service is to provide a verifiable KERL to any validator on&nbsp;demand.</p><p>In this algorithm, an agreement consists of a specific version of a key event with verifiable receipts (signatures) from the controller and the designated witnesses. An agreement means that each witness in that set has witnessed the same version of that event and each witness’ receipt in that set has been promulgated to every other witness in that&nbsp;set.</p><blockquote>The purpose of using multiple designated witnesses in KERI is to ensure both the availability and the security of the service in the event of faulty witnesses. In addition to faults such as unresponsiveness and network interruptions, allowed faults include what are commonly known as Byzantine faults such as dishonest/malicious witnesses.</blockquote> Cooperative Delegation <p>A controller of an AID may authorize some degree of control authority to another AID. This process is known as delegation.</p><p>A delegation operation involves a pair of events by the delegating and delegated AIDs. Such operation is cooperative in KERI as it requires a cryptographic commitment from both the delegator and the delegate, as&nbsp;follows.</p>  The delegating event contains an “event seal” that includes a digest of the delegated event  The delegated event contains a “location seal” that includes the unique location of the delegating event.  <p>The pair of seals cross-reference the two events participating in the cooperative delegation operation. The delegating AID performs an establishment operation (inception or rotation) on a delegated identifier, as illustrated below.</p>Cooperative delegation.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — March 13th to March&nbsp;19th <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This week, we look at Illinois’ proposed crypto bill, a Federal Judge taking on the SEC over current regulatory uncertainty, the EU’s bill to regulate smart contracts, and Russia’s first CBDC regulation draft.</p><p>But no matter what regulatory measures authorities take to reign in the broader crypto market, they need to keep the end-users in mind. The industry stakeholders, too, have a role to play here, as they are expected to ensure minimal impact on user experience and privacy while complying with relevant crypto regulations.</p><p>Now, let’s dive straight into the&nbsp;recap.</p> Illinois Proposes a Bill to Regulate&nbsp;Crypto <p>Illinois’ proposed crypto bill (House Bill 3479), also called the Digital Assets Regulation Act (DARA), seeks to regulate crypto business activity in Illinois.</p><p>The bill, which has received mostly negative reactions from the crypto industry, grants the state more power to investigate unapproved digital asset transactions and arrest those against the guidelines.</p><p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/lund_dane/status/1635010445672349696?s=20">Image Source</a>)</p><p>In the process of providing regulatory clarity to the fast-evolving cryptocurrency space, the bill is also “making it very difficult for companies to comply” by creating a very tight window for submitting an application and gaining approval.</p> Federal Judge Blames the SEC for “Highly Uncertain” Regulatory Environment <p>Presiding over the SEC vs. Binance US case over Voyager’s acquisition, the bankruptcy Judge Michael E. Wiles laid into SEC for relying on “hyperbole or on ‘straw man’ arguments.”</p><p>Speaking of the regulatory nature of crypto trading platforms and the security nature of crypto, the judge noted, “the Commission itself has not taken any position” on such subjects.</p><blockquote>Judge Wiles also said that although the crypto exchanges have been operating in the space for years, they were left “without being subject to clear and well-defined regulatory requirements.”</blockquote><p>Not to mention, “regulators themselves cannot seem to agree” as to whether cryptocurrencies are commodities and subject to CFTC regulation or securities and subject to securities laws, “or neither, or even on what criteria should be applied in making the decision.”</p><blockquote>“I do not know how any party could possibly be expected to address the SEC’s comments with the limited guidance that the SEC has provided,” leaving everyone to only “guess as to what the arguments might have been,” said the&nbsp;judge.</blockquote> EU Passes Bill to Regulate Smart Contracts <p>The European Parliament passed the 2022 Data Act on March 14 with 500 votes in favor and 23 against it, which includes provisions on smart contracts. It mandates that smart contracts must have access controls, protect trade secrets, and have functions to terminate or&nbsp;reset.</p><p>The new rules will come into force in 2024, and companies will have to adhere to them to serve EU-based consumers.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1636012086697377794?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The essential requirements regarding smart contracts for data sharing are covered under Article 30 of the Data Act. And while the provisions primarily target the Internet of Things (IoT), they could also affect DeFi and crypto if their reach and scope remain&nbsp;unclear.</p> Russia Approves First Draft for CBDC Regulation <p>The Russian Parliament has approved draft laws establishing a system to issue and regulate CBDC in a first reading on March 16. The Russian State Duma also approved the first reading of a bill that makes changes to the Russian Civil Code and defines the digital ruble as “non-cash money.”</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/WhaleChart/status/1637150062466703361?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The two bills, which will go through a review process before being finalized in the second reading that’ll take place in the coming months, mainly cover gaps in regulation stemming from the digitalization of a currency.</p><p>The bill’s current version proposes authorizing the Russian central bank to process users’ personal data without consent. As such, the Parliament has instructed the financial markets committee to ensure that personal data will be protected appropriately in the new digital ruble system for the second&nbsp;reading.</p><p>The legislation establishes a foundational framework for the digital ruble, including setting up a platform to issue the CBDC, developing wallets for storing it, and defining procedures to access the platform and participant rules.</p> Interesting Reads&nbsp;📰 <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/gibraltar-based-xapo-bank-to-enable-usdc-services-amidst-banking-crisis">Gibraltar-Based Xapo Bank to Enable USDC Services Amidst Banking&nbsp;Crisis</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">The Most Googled Questions on FATF Travel Rule&nbsp;Answered</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>On Friday, March 3, 2023, Dock’s mainnet was upgraded in order to launch an Ethereum bridge later this year, enhance security, and improve performance. </p><p>The Dock-Ethereum bridge will enable users to:</p>  Efficiently transfer Ether on Dock’s highly scalable blockchain or move native Dock tokens to the Ethereum blockchain, which can be swapped for other Ethereum-based assets  Dock tokens can be bought on Ethereum and transferred to the Dock blockchain   What Is a Blockchain Bridge and Why Are Blockchain Bridges Important? <p>A blockchain bridge is like a digital connection that allows different blockchain networks to communicate with each other. Each blockchain network has its own unique set of rules and processes for recording transactions, and they often can't talk to each other directly. Blockchain bridges make it easier for people to use different blockchain networks, exchange assets, share information, and access new opportunities.</p><p>Think of it like a bridge between two islands. Without a bridge, people and goods would have to travel by boat or airplane, which can be slow and inefficient. But with a bridge, people and goods can travel quickly and easily between the two islands.</p><p>Similarly, blockchain bridges make it easier and faster to transfer assets and information between different blockchain networks, which helps to increase the efficiency and interoperability of the entire blockchain ecosystem. </p><p>Stay tuned for more updates on the development of our tech!</p> About Dock <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a> is a Verifiable Credentials company that provides Dock Certs, a user-friendly, no-code platform, and developer solutions that enable organizations to issue, manage and verify fraud-proof credentials efficiently and securely.

   ForgeRock Announces Major Expansion of Passwordless Capabilities with the Introduction of Enterprise Connect Passwordless 

<p>Ten years ago, the launch of the FIDO Alliance spurred industry-wide interest in passwordless authentication. In the years since, we've seen a lot of progress on the path toward passwordless including ForgeRock being the first major IAM platform to offer support for FIDO2 Web Authentication (WebAuthn). Now the world's largest device, browser, and operating system manufacturers <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">have jumped on board</a> with support of passkeys. The good news is that more and more consumer websites are introducing support for passkeys. Even better news: it all is becoming simpler and more convenient for the user, and security is vastly improved at the same time — a huge win-win and growing optimism that passwords can be eliminated once and for all.</p>

<p>However, progress in fully eliminating passwords has hit stumbling blocks. Common challenges across enterprises involve integrating legacy applications that will always require a password, migrating user bases gradually at their pace of readiness rather than a big bang approach, and account recovery processes when a device is lost or stolen. Solving these challenges requires more than just having authentication that supports passwordless, but also requires an IAM platform that offers real-time user access orchestration and integration into everything from legacy to modern applications.</p>

<p>Today, I'm thrilled to announce a major step forward on the path toward a completely passwordless world and the realization of ForgeRock's vision of a world where you never login again. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/enterprise-connect-passwordless">ForgeRock Enterprise Connect Passwordless</a> expands on our leading <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless solution</a> and provides simple integrations to solve enterprises' most complex, often legacy-based, use cases.</p>

	<blockquote><p>According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4007059">Gartner</a>, by 2025 more than 50% of the workforce and more than 20% of customer authentication transactions will be passwordless, up from less than 10% today.</p><p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4007059">Gartner</a>, "Take 3 Steps Toward Passwordless Authentication"Refreshed 22 February 2023, Ant Allan, Published 19 October 2021.

<p>Enterprise Connect Passwordless is integrated into our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> and protects the most commonly used and vulnerable enterprise resources, such as servers, workstations, remote desktops, and VPNs. It helps proactively defend against cyber-attacks and unauthorized access by providing a more secure passwordless login experience.</p>

 Eliminating Passwords in Stages 

<p>With ForgeRock, you can move to passwordless at your own pace without facing an all-or-nothing proposition. There are multiple possible stages, each providing a better user experience and simultaneously improving security.</p>

<p></p>
	
<p>Passwordless Factor</p>
<p>For purists out there, you would say this is not passwordless — and I can understand this point of view. However, providing support for biometrics, such as Face ID or Touch ID, as a second factor in MFA is considerably better than the alternatives, such as one-time passcodes transmitted over SMS text messages, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/questionsand-buzz-surrounding-draft-nist-special-publication-800-63-3">which NIST deprecated in 2017</a>. We recommend customers take this step no matter where they are on the passwordless journey.</p>

<p>Passwordless Experience</p>
<p>One of the biggest threats involving passwords comes from users knowing their passwords, which can then be compromised. The idea behind a passwordless experience is removing user knowledge and interaction with passwords, while there still may be passwords involved somewhere in the equation, particularly in legacy applications. The reality is that this stage of passwordless is likely where enterprises will be for some time while there are so many applications that simply are not ready for passwordless. But that's ok — if there is nothing to phish or brute force, then that is significant progress. Our new Enterprise Connect Passwordless offering delivers exactly on this promise.</p>

<p>Complete Passwordless</p>
<p>The holy grail, the point where there are no passwords anywhere in the enterprise. We expect this to occur much faster in the world of consumer identity (CIAM) because typically there are far fewer applications involved and we expect them to support passwordless sooner. ForgeRock is ready to support this now with our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">leading passwordless solutions</a>.</p>

 A Complete Platform Approach to Achieving Passwordless 
<p>No matter the approach planned, having a complete IAM platform that provides flexibility to support your passwordless journey is critical. In addition to supporting a variety of authentication methods, the platform must be capable of orchestration to gradually move users to better and more secure experiences, and also integrate into all types of enterprise resources.</p>
	
<p></p>
	
<p>Authentication Methods</p>
<p>The ForgeRock platform supports an expansive set of authentication methods, such as FIDO2 WebAuthn, passkeys, Oath, push, one-time passcodes (OTPs), biometrics, and others, to enable passwordless using mobile authenticators, smart cards, biometric devices, digital certificates, platforms (Apple ID and Microsoft Hello), browsers, and applications.</p>

<p>Access Orchestration</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">ForgeRock's identity orchestration capabilities</a>, you can tailor drag-and-drop passwordless authentication journeys to provide both strong security and a better user experience. For example, the authentication process can include analyzing risk signals, such as device ID and IP address, as part of the passwordless login process. Organizations can create these journeys with little or no code using pre-built nodes, and reuse these nodes to provide passwordless authentication.</p>

<p>Application Integrations</p>
<p>Building on top of ForgeRock's already rich integration technologies — including broad identity standards support, software development kits, web and Java agents, and Identity Gateway — ForgeRock Enterprise Connect Passwordless integrates with an extensive list of components in the enterprise infrastructure, including Windows, Mac and Unix workstations and servers, RADIUS-based authentication, Remote Desktop (virtual and Windows), VPNs, databases, mainframes, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs, and many more.</p>

 Realize the Benefits of Passwordless With ForgeRock 

<p>The goal of our passwordless strategy is to enable you to mitigate one of the biggest security risks your organization faces — passwords — while delivering great user experiences. We think we've done that with Enterprise Connect Passwordless for our workforce customers and, with our support for WebAuthn and passkeys, for our CIAM customers. Now, customers can realize the benefits of better protection against breaches and drastically reduced costs as a result of far fewer help desk tickets and a reduction in lost productivity.</p>

   ForgeRock CTO Eve Maler answers seven critical questions 

<p>ForgeRock's purpose is to help people simply and safely access the connected world. Passwordless capabilities are helping us do that in exciting new ways, solving problems for consumers as well as enterprise workforces. But passwordless is often misunderstood and over-hyped. I recently spoke with Eve Maler about her perspective on passwordless and the questions she most frequently addresses. Here are seven of them.</p>
	
  What does passwordless authentication really mean? 
 <p>EM: Let's start from the beginning: authentication is defined in terms of factors, and if you mix factors, your authentication gets stronger. So, one factor may be something you know, like a password; another is something you have, like a device that's been associated with you; finally, a factor may be something you are, such as a fingerprint or another biometric that is unique to you.</p>

<p>If you mix any two of those, you get two-factor authentication, or 2FA. If you mix multiple factors, you get multi-factor authentication, or MFA. Passwordless, at its simplest, means the absence of a password for authentication. But I want to get a little more specific.</p>

<p>A password is what is known as a static shared secret, which means that it's a secret that both sides know and that persists over time, perhaps 90 days per enterprise policy, or even possibly many years. Some representation of this password, secured and scrambled, has to be stored on a server, so that when you type it in somewhere it gets checked.</p>

<p>So passwordless relies on something you have or something you are — and no longer something you know. Push authentication is a good example. QR codes and magic links are others. Often, people talk about "passwordless" – even when referring to it as an additional factor on top of passwords to add up to 2FA or MFA. We call this approach a passwordless factor. Unfortunately, as soon as you do that, you have all the frailties of involving a static shared secret. The total experience is not passwordless. Essentially, you can interpret a passwordless factor plus a password as plain old MFA.</p>

  So, how can we do better than passwordless as an authentication factor? 
 <p>EM: If passwordless is done right, it gets you a long way down the path to increasing security –&nbsp;and certainly improving the experience.</p>

<p>We call this complete passwordless, where the user doesn't have the experience of interacting with a static shared secret at all because there isn't one. And it is possible, for example, with a magic link and other methods, to eliminate that static shared secret. Since the user's not interacting with the password, you get rid of all the security risks and usability issues of static shared secrets.</p>

<p>Enabling consumers to encounter complete passwordless is a little bit easier than it is for employees. There's a whole stack of technology that employees interact with — it's not always going to be a web app or a mobile app or some SaaS service. It'll be things like Oracle databases or logging into a VPN, and it's hard to make databases and VPNs stop expecting passwords.</p>

  Passwordless can mitigate certain threats, like man-in-the-middle attacks where a password is grabbed in transit, but is it enough to only eliminate password-based attacks? 
 <p>EM: When it comes to passwords, some prevention is definitely better than none. Our most recent Consumer Identity Breach Report revealed that threats using compromised credentials, particularly unauthorized access, accounted for fully half of all data breaches in 2021. It showed the danger of breaches that release credentials into the wild again and again.</p>

<p>It's been a one-two punch. You know, credentials just have to be stolen once, and from there, they can often be used to perpetrate many more data-rich breaches. And there are many risks, such as medical identity theft, insurance, fraud — massive numbers of account takeovers and lateral movement across all kinds of different environments within an enterprise.</p>

<p>Where complete passwordless isn't possible due to the complexity of IT systems, it's possible to enable what we call a passwordless experience. In these cases, there may be a password behind the scenes but it can remain untouched by human hands, so to speak. Workforce users can avoid actually having to see or experience the password. And that in itself is a big mitigation against some other threats when a password still exists and still works.</p>

  Speaking of workforce, what are key differences in a passwordless journey for a consumer deployment vs. workforce? 
 <p>EM: The widely available consumer devices are much more in play, because, hey, you're not the boss of them, so they get to choose. For example, you can't make your consumers stop using that old Android device that everyone knows is terrible for security.</p>

<p>So, you have to roll with the devices they choose. Luckily, these days the FIDO standards tend to be pre-integrated or pre-enabled in modern laptops, smartphones, and tablets. And there are even a few circumstances where consumers are incentivized to use a security key – a hard authenticator or hard token. It might be a FIDO-enabled YubiKey.</p>

<p>In the enterprise, it's easier to provide interface shims around the workforce users to provide that passwordless experience, letting them avoid interactions with passwords. This makes it safer and it can also result in a great experience if it's designed well. That's exactly what we do with our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/enterprise-connect-passwordless">Enterprise Connect Passwordless</a> offering. It enables passwordless experiences for a lot of use cases in the employee's environment.</p>

  I heard you say that we may not always be able to achieve complete passwordless in the enterprise, but can we get far enough to see a more secure environment? 
 <p>EM: Yes. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. It's possible to be better — and in different, clever ways for different users and for different kinds of services and applications. And that's what I think of as the subtle art of orchestrating the journey, so that you make sure to improve the experience and reduce the friction, along with increasing the security. It's crucial, because everybody's felt the pain of plain old MFA, right? I mean, nobody likes it, even though they're being forced to do it more often.</p>

  You mentioned FIDO. Is FIDO implementation required for passwordless? 
 <p>EM: FIDO is the Fast IDentity Online Alliance. ForgeRock is a sponsor member of FIDO. The FIDO2 WebAuthn standards are the latest in a series of standards that have been created to enable interoperability and security around the use of different authentication methods.</p>

<p>FIDO2 WebAuthn has become very popular, partly because of the adoption by Apple, Google, and Microsoft — the makers of so many popular devices, browsers, and operating systems in the world. It's a big deal because they've decided that FIDO2 WebAuthn is something worth baking into their products and, in some cases, laptops and other hardware enable FIDO-based fingerprint unlock.</p>

<p>Passkeys, otherwise known as multi-device credentials, are the very latest thing from FIDO. For multi-device credentials, you register one device — here I am waving around my iPhone! — and, because I've got my identity connected throughout the Apple ecosystem, I have my iPad and the laptop that I'm speaking to you on — all those things know the same "me." I wouldn't have to pre-register any of these other devices to save me in case I lost my phone.</p>

<p>While passkeys are becoming popular primarily for consumer-facing use cases, like web and mobile apps, enterprise employees are people too. They're often in a bring-your-own-device situation and FIDO helps strong auth and complete passwordless to be more readily applied to these kinds of user-centric environments. FIDO is not strictly required for passwordless. As I already mentioned, there are ways you can integrate to those IT systems that are trickier and maybe older and less configurable and less customizable, so as to remove passwords from the employee's experience.</p>

  How would you advise organizations that want to get started with passwordless? 
 <p>EM: First, I advise them to stick to standards. SAML and OAuth and OpenID Connect — leveraging those standards for secure single sign-on pairs really well with a properly designed passwordless environment.</p>

<p>Of course, single sign-on helps reduce the number of apps that need to be enabled. So that's something to consider. And then picking the population, the risk level, the particular apps that you want to focus on first — go in phases, parcel that out.</p>

<p>While you're doing any kind of rollout, it's really important not to disable existing methods until you've collected enough telemetry to identify emerging issues.</p>

<p>Other things to do: design authentication journeys to be adaptive and responsive. One size really can't fit all. Different organizations have different backends, they have different needs, different risk appetites, different fraud levels. And so, it's important to design the journeys that make sense for your business. And that's where <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">ForgeRock Intelligent Access</a>, commonly known as "Trees," really shines.</p>

<p>And then the last advice I have is to fold fraud management into the authentication experience. A.I. is a companion to orchestration as it does some of that heuristic checking of the environment to make sure it smells right. You can do those checks silently. And if you decide you don't want to be silent and you want to actually approach your user and ask them to prove themselves more thoroughly with transactional authorization, then you can do that.</p>
	
<p>For CISOs and CIOs — for anyone in the enterprise who is looking at the user experience end of it and feeling the pain of fraud — the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">actuality of eliminating passwords</a> is really attractive.</p>

<p>This is one of an occasional series examining misconceptions that people have about personal data empowerment and personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Sometimes in debates about personal data people at opposite ends of the spectrum seem to end up agreeing. Privacy is a case in point. “Privacy is dead!” declare some campaigners. “That’s a terrible thing! Something should be done about&nbsp;it!”</p><p>“Privacy is dead,” agree some Big Tech apologists. “It’s just an inevitable by-product of the way technology is evolving. Get used to it!”. The two sides might disagree about whether privacy being dead is good or bad. But they agree on the underlying point nevertheless.</p><p>This isn’t helpful, and this blog explains&nbsp;why.</p> ‘Resistance is&nbsp;futile’ <p>First, we need to be wary of the ways in which some people use claims about ‘facts’ as stalking horses for the hidden agendas. The claim that ‘privacy as dead’ is a case in&nbsp;point.</p><p>The underlying message of the ‘Privacy is dead, get used to it’ brigade, for example, is that “resistance is futile”. This is the central message of all tyrannies, because tyranny only succeeds when people accept that resistance is futile. The other side of the coin is that tyrannies always fail once people adopt the stance ‘we will resist, no matter&nbsp;what’.</p><p>Either way, this isn’t actually a debate about the facts (in this case the supposedly unstoppable impacts of new digital technologies). It’s about whether we accept, or refuse to accept, something that is toxic and&nbsp;unfair.</p> So what are the&nbsp;facts? <p>Leaving the rhetoric of hidden agendas aside, what are the facts about privacy? In simple terms, it’s true that in order to operate, many digital services have to do things that are potentially invasive of privacy. To provide a location-based service for example, you have to know where the person is located. The question then arises, what does the organisation collecting this data do with&nbsp;it?</p><p>It’s also true that new digital technologies and services are generating data about things that were once intensely private — such as search generating real time data about our personal interests and intentions. Which again, raises profound questions about how such information is used, by&nbsp;who.</p><p>However, it’s also true that even though platforms like Google (Alphabet), Facebook (Meta) and Apple have accumulated eye-watering amounts of data about people, they still actually know surprisingly little about us. That’s because equally eye-watering amounts of data are held by other bodies that these platforms have no access to — bodies like banks, health services, tax authorities and other public services.</p><p>The way our data system is structured means that individuals’ data is dispersed across hundreds of different organisations. Try as hard as they might, via various schemes and initiatives, the digital platforms’ most determined efforts to move into these spaces (via health and financial apps and services for example) have resulted in only minor&nbsp;inroads.</p><p>So, No. The dispersed nature of today’s data ecosystem means that no matter how some people might wish otherwise, privacy is not dead, because no single organisation has access to all the data they need to kill&nbsp;it.</p> What do we mean by ‘privacy’? <p>There are, however, some important subtleties in this debate. It doesn’t help, for example, that ‘privacy’ has become a bit of an Alice in Wonderland word, where people use to mean what they want it to&nbsp;mean.</p><p>For some people, privacy is mainly about civil liberties and the dangers of an all-too-powerful ‘database state’. For others, it’s about ‘surveillance capitalism’ and the activities of big commercial platforms like Facebook and Google. For others, it’s a simple sense that we don’t like people snooping into our&nbsp;affairs.</p><p>These are all real issues, but they are not necessarily the same issues requiring the same solutions. When a word is used to mean whatever a person wants it to mean, debates can quickly get lost in crossed purposes without finding a way&nbsp;forward.</p><p>That’s why we at Mydex stay clear of the word ‘privacy’ if we can. Instead, we focus on the human needs and emotions that debates about privacy relate to, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Safety: not being put at risk of harm or&nbsp;abuse  Agency / control: being able to act effectively in the world as opposed to feeling powerless and&nbsp;helpless  Fairness: not being taken advantage of; not having to submit to another party’s excess&nbsp;power  <p>Also, while privacy and data protection lie at the heart of everything we at Mydex do, we are not pursuing the goals of ‘privacy’ or ‘control’ as ends in themselves. We are just as much pursuing them as means to another end: of enabling individuals to access and use their data to manage and improve their own lives. ‘Privacy’ is not just about abstract principles. It’s about the practicalities of getting stuff done in our lives. It’s about utility: the practical benefits of utility and its emotional benefits, arising from a sense of safety, agency and fairness.</p><p>When you see privacy in these practical human terms, the answer to the question becomes instantly clear. ‘Privacy’ will never die because human beings’ quest for utility, safety, agency and fairness will never&nbsp;die.</p> The Privacy&nbsp;Paradox <p>Another subtlety in this debate lies with the privacy paradox. In survey after survey people say they are extremely concerned about privacy issues, but their day-to-day actions seem to belie this concern. Just look at the way people fail to assert their rights to stop cookies being placed on their computer, or tick boxes giving unnecessary consent to organisations accessing their&nbsp;data.</p><p>For some, this is evidence that people don’t really care about privacy at all: “People say they care because they know they should. But they are dissembling. We don’t need to take what they say at face&nbsp;value”.</p><p>There is, however, another much better explanation of this phenomenon. It boils down to ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness">learned helplessness</a>’. If people begin to believe that no matter how hard they try, they still won’t be able to affect the outcome, then they stop even bothering to&nbsp;try.</p><p>Learned helplessness is compounded by other human factors like salience and so-called ‘hyperbolic discounting’. Some things — like chocolate — offer immediate tangible benefits. With other things however, like saving for a pension, the costs are immediate and tangible but the benefits are diffuse and distant. The more diffuse and distant something becomes, the harder it is for us flawed humans to act on it as we&nbsp;should.</p><p>Protecting our privacy can often seem very diffuse and distant, especially when we are busy trying to access a service to get something done. Knowing this full well, many organisations have developed the art of confusing, bamboozling, overwhelming and obfuscating to such a high degree — with hundred-page gobbledygook small print infested privacy policies and T&amp;Cs, for example — that for many people learned helplessness is now their default mode of behaviour.</p><p>Which takes us back to the ‘resistance is futile’ argument, except this time the statement ‘privacy is dead’ reveals itself not as a statement of fact but as a statement of intent: that they intend to make resistance futile, if at all possible. They want to make people feel as helpless as possible.</p> Conclusion <p>For us at Mydex, personal data empowerment is about a lot more than ‘privacy’. It’s about the human needs and emotions of safety, agency and fairness that underlie it. And it’s about being able to express these needs and emotions practically: being able to collect and use our own data to improve our own&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Given this, there is one aspect about the privacy debate that we don’t like. By focusing only on what organisations do with the data they collect, debates about privacy tends to generate a negative framing: a focus on how to stop organisations doing bad things — which ignores the other, more important side of the coin of how to empower citizens to do positive&nbsp;things.</p><p>In the context of empowering people to use their own data to improve their own lives, ‘privacy’ is a simple, basic sine qua non; a foundation for everything else that follows. Once people are provided with the tools that make it simple and easy to collect and use their own data for their own purposes, ‘privacy’ becomes a no-brainer.</p><p>Far from being dead, it’s only just waking&nbsp;up.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/is-privacy-dead-ef236d38867d">Is Privacy Dead?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Learn more about the latest scam to hit the crypto industry, how it works, how to spot it, and which KYC measures can help prevent it. 



 



<p>Despite the nightmare-inducing name, a “pig butchering scam” is a type of fraud that tends to take place over a long period of time, and combines elements from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a>, crypto fraud, and investment schemes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The name derives from the Chinese expression “Sha Zhu Pan,” which translates as “butchering a pig.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The analogy refers to the process of gaining the victim’s trust or “fattening up” a pig before stealing crypto or funds, i.e., the butchering. The scam often involves a ring of scammers scouring social media and dating platforms for potential victims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The large-scale and long-game scamming technique became widely reported in 2019, and initially targeted men in China. However, scammers quickly broadened their horizons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While there is no specific data on pig butchering scams in the UK, crypto fraud is becoming more common. According to ActionFraud, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/29/everything-is-fake-how-global-gangs-are-using-uk-shell-companies-in-multi-million-pound-crypto-scams">reported losses</a> in all cryptocurrency frauds surged 72% to above £329 million in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These scams are carried out on a large scale, on an industrial scale — like they’re doing fraud in a factory,” said Jan Santiago, the deputy director of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2022/09/09/pig-butchering-crypto-super-scam/?sh=2c610cf1ec8e">Global Anti-Scam Organization</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pig butchering scams have been identified around the world, from the US to Germany. An investigation led by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism discovered that organized crime syndicates use the UK as a virtual ground for their activities, capitalizing on the lax Companies House registration system to execute fraud on a commercial scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Approximately 168 UK-based corporations have been arraigned for operating crypto or Forex trading scams, with half of the scams likely associated with pig butchering fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 How do pig butchering scams in crypto work?&nbsp; 



<p>Pig butchering scams involve scammers contacting prospective victims and gaining their trust by befriending or flirting with them. Earning the victim’s trust can often take several months, depending on the commitment of the criminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pig butchering scammer usually creates a fake social media account on platforms to reach out to prospective victims. Their goal is to find a victim and become their “friend” or “lover” via cordial discussions or through the act of “love-bombing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such a scam may begin with something as simple as a text from an unknown number or a DM on a social media platform or dating site. Scammers also often pose as long-lost contacts to the victim they target. Typically, the scammer (or scammers) poses as an attractive, wealthy, and young individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After exchanging various messages, voice notes, and selfies, among other things, the topic of finance will be brought up. If often appears as natural as having a conversation with friends about current affairs. The scammer may also talk about friends she knows who have earned significantly via crypto or currency trading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, the victim is coerced into converting their funds into crypto, transferring them to a digital wallet or trading platform under the scammer’s control. The scammer may give the victim the impression that they are earning money or even allow them to withdraw some of their initial “profits” to earn their trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later, when the victim tries to withdraw funds, the account imposes fees or taxes on them. Once the victim realizes the platform is not legitimate, their transactions have already disappeared on the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



 How to spot a pig butchering scam.&nbsp; 



<p>All pig butchering scammers run on a similar pattern. Similar to other scams, it helps to avoid transactions requesting upfront payment in crypto. Avoid taking financial advice from someone you have never met.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To avoid being a victim of such a crime, take note of these points:&nbsp;</p>



  Scammers usually contact victims via social media or dating apps. They also send text messages “accidentally” to start conversations with victims. Avoid responding to unsolicited texts and block or report the person sending them.&nbsp;<br>  Fraudsters gradually instill trust in their victims before bringing up the topic of investment. Be wary of any investment advice promising significant profits. Avoid sharing personal and financial information with an online contact.&nbsp;  



  Since scammers want their victims to trust them, some promise extravagant gifts and exorbitant trips abroad. If the so-called scammer’s promises seem unrealistic, it is best to block them.&nbsp;<br>  The scammer will convince the victim to download an investment app and trade with them to demonstrate how it works. The platform will first allow small withdrawals. Later, upon more significant cash withdrawal requests, the platform may impose taxes or fees and inform the victim that their account has been frozen and that paying the fees is the only solution.<br>  The scammer’s recommended site may have a misspelled URL. Always make 100% sure you are using a legitimate website.&nbsp;<br>  As more people become aware of scams, they become less successful. Therefore, the nature of scamming is constantly evolving. Keeping up to date on the latest scam trends will help keep you up to date.

 Tightening security measures against pig butchering scams and fraud in crypto.&nbsp; 



<p>The FBI and Interpol have issued warnings, <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221003">PSAs</a>, and guidelines on how to avoid pig butchering scams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2020, the European Union agreed to create a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">MiCA</a> (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulatory framework to reduce the imminent risks for consumers investing in cryptocurrencies. The established <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">rules</a> mean crypto providers would be liable for investors’ cryptocurrency asset losses. The regulation is expected to enter into force in early 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On 10 January 2020, the FCA <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/cryptoassets">implemented</a> new crypto-focused regulations to oversee companies operating in the sector and to ensure they follow the same AML and CFT regulations as the ones in conventional financial markets. Presently, all cryptocurrency firms based in the UK must adhere to money laundering regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2023, the UK’s National Crime Agency announced plans for a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/crypto-crime-crackdown/">new division</a> to tackle crypto crime called “Crypto Cell.” Just a month later, UK’s HM Treasury also recently proposed a crypto-regulatory <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">regime</a> in its consultation paper.&nbsp;</p>



 How KYC can fight crypto fraud and pig butchering scams.&nbsp; 



<p>Through rigorous KYC measures, such as document validation and biometric authentication, crypto platforms can verify the identity of genuine users to prevent pig butchering scams. Crypto platforms can also integrate systems that are able to conduct detailed pool monitoring of activity associated with each user transaction and set up alerts for suspicious activities to strengthen their fraud prevention techniques overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A robust KYC process can help crypto platforms determine the possible risk linked to a customer, strengthening user trust, reputation, and customer satisfaction. By verifying users’ identities, exchanges can prevent criminal activity like money laundering and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">terrorist financing</a>, and other fraudulent operations like pig butchering scams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Crypto transactions generally cannot be reversed, making them rather appealing to bad actors in their fraudulent pursuits. Pig butchering&nbsp;scams can also be difficult to track and prosecute, as the scammers often operate anonymously and from offshore locations,” said Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow.</p>



<blockquote><p>When operating online, individuals should be vigilant and avoid sending crypto&nbsp;to anyone&nbsp;not met in person, no matter how convincing their story. When it comes to crypto, it is always better to be safe than sorry.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



 Better KYC processes to the rescue.&nbsp; 



<p>Scammers involved in pig butchering scams exploit dating, social media platforms, and messaging applications to draw victims into scams and steal their assets. This has led to warnings from authorities in the US, UK, and other affected countries and regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto exchange platforms must use the KYC process to confirm their customers’ personal data and better understand their activities, verifying their identity, and thus mitigating crypto scams like pig butchering schemes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a>&nbsp;are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">evolving crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today’s terminally-online age, fraud is a growing and ever-present concern for businesses.</p>
<p>Why is fraud detection important? Because successful fraud attempts can cost businesses significantly in time, money, and reputation.</p>
 What Is Fraud Detection? 
<p>Fraud detection identifies and prevents fraud before malicious parties execute illegal or damaging actions. Fraud detection systems use various techniques, including data analytics, machine learning, and behavioral analysis, to identify patterns of suspicious behavior to flag potential fraud.</p>
<p>Fraud is a constant and ongoing problem for many businesses, as it can cause significant financial losses and damage to reputation. By using fraud detection measures, companies can proactively monitor their systems and take steps to prevent fraud before it occurs.</p>
 What Are the Components of Fraud Detection? 
<p>Fraud detection systems use various techniques to identify patterns of suspicious behavior and potentially flag fraud. As fraud threats become more and more sophisticated, the processes used to prevent those threats must match them equally.</p>
<p>Some common components of fraud detection systems include:</p>
 
 Data Analysis: Fraud detection systems rely on big data to identify behavior patterns (like those from account access or shopping) to determine potentially fraudulent activity. 
 Machine Learning: Fraud detection systems use machine learning to analyze the data and identify behavior patterns in ways humans cannot. Furthermore, these algorithms can make real-time decisions to mitigate fraudulent activity before it becomes a problem. 
 Real-Time Alerts: Fraud detection systems are designed to provide real-time alerts when potential fraud is detected. This allows businesses to take immediate action to prevent fraud and limit the damage caused by fraudulent activities. 
 Biometrics: Biometric authentication can go a long way in preventing fraud by requiring that an authorized user is present to OK any particular activity. This limits the ability of hackers, especially those distributed worldwide, from breaking into accounts to commit fraud. 
 Zero-Trust identification: Zero-trust principles state that no user or identity should be implicitly trusted at any point of authentication or authorization. Using zero-trust identity management, you can place many more roadblocks in front of fraudsters that rely on lenient privilege systems. 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Implementing Fraud Detection? 
<p>There are several benefits of using fraud detection systems for businesses. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>
 
 Early Mitigation: Fraud detection systems can identify bad behavior early, meaning mitigation and remediation (if necessary) can happen much sooner–minimizing the impact of fraud if not outright eliminating it. 
 Reduced Costs: In terms of costs, those associated with actual fraud are often much more significant versus those associated implementing fraud detection. This means that it’s a huge revenue loss to cut corners and not deal with fraud at all. 
 Stakeholder Trust: Customers, banks, credit providers, and financial investors trust organizations more when they take fraud seriously. On top of being irresponsible, the refusal to implement fraud detection signals that a company doesn’t value money or personal information. 
 Compliance: Some industries, such as finance and healthcare, have specific regulatory requirements for fraud detection. In these cases, it’s not just a benefit but a requirement. 
 
<p>By implementing advanced technologies and best practices for fraud detection, businesses can reduce their exposure to fraud, increase efficiency, and enhance their competitive market position.</p>
 What Are Some of the Challenges of Implementing Fraud Detection Measures? 
<p>While fraud detection systems are effective at identifying and preventing many types of fraud, businesses also face several challenges when implementing and using these systems. Here are some of the key difficulties against fraud detection:</p>
 
 Sophisticated Fraud: Hackers and fraudsters are constantly adapting tactics to stay ahead of fraud detection systems. The ever-growing online banking and shopping market doesn’t make dealing with these threats any easier, either. Organizations must remain vigilant. 
 Big Data Processing: Fraud detection systems rely on large volumes of data to identify patterns of suspicious behavior, and without proper data collection tools, many detection measures will not be accurate. 
 False Positives: Fraud detection systems can sometimes generate false positives, flagging legitimate transactions as suspicious and causing unnecessary customer delays or inconvenience. This can harm customer experience and potentially lead to a bad reputation. 
 Cost: Implementing and maintaining fraud detection systems can be costly, which makes these systems out of the reach of small- or mid-sized businesses. While the costs of fraud may be higher, that doesn’t much matter if the company cannot afford advanced fraud detection. 
 
<p>While fraud detection systems are essential for preventing fraud, they require ongoing attention and maintenance to remain effective.</p>
 What Are Common Types of Fraud? 
<p>Fraud is a wide-ranging problem, made more so due to the fact that digital spaces and eCommerce sites are particularly ripe for exploitation.</p>
<p>Types of cyber fraud can include:</p>
 
 Identity Theft: This occurs when a fraudster steals personal information, such as their name, date of birth, Social Security number, or credit card details, and uses it to pretend to be that person. This then allows them to make purchases, sign up for credit cards, or access bank accounts as that individual. 
 Phishing Scams: One of the more common forms of cyber attacks, phishing involves sending fraudulent emails, texts, or messages via teleconferencing software that appear to be from a trusted source to trick people into providing their personal information. This information can be used to access unauthorized accounts or commit various forms of identity theft. 
 
<p>These scams are especially problematic in contexts like spear phishing and whaling, which can lead to massive <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/ceo-fraud/">CEO fraud</a>.</p>
 
 Chargeback Fraud: This fraud involves a cardholder challenging a legitimate credit card charge with their bank. Because banks often side with customers, this means that merchants can lose out on revenue, and the individual still keeps their items. On top of that, the merchant and the banks will have to pay significant fees to credit card networks upon successful chargeback, costing them tens of thousands of dollars. 
 Credit Card Fraud: This kind of fraud occurs when a fraudster uses another person’s credit card to make unauthorized purchases. Credit card fraud is often part of larger fraud schemes, like identity theft. 
 Money Laundering: Modern money laundering is heavily influenced by digital banking and commerce, making it that much harder for financial institutions to catch fraudsters. This is why <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws provide several layers of guidance on <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/secure-authentication/">secure authentication</a> and identity verification, especially for large-scale banking and investing.

<p>By Dr Paul Ashley,&nbsp;co-CEO and CTO, Anonyome Labs</p>



<p>This article was originally published in Michael Bazzell’s Unredacted magazine, January 2023. To learn more, view the&nbsp;<a href="https://inteltechniques.com/magazine.html">latest issue</a>.</p>



<p>I’ve been exploring decentralized identity in&nbsp;<a href="https://inteltechniques.com/magazine.html">Unredacted</a>&nbsp;(Issue 2 and Issue 4) so we can better understand this new technology that’s giving users greater control over their personal data and identity. This time, I go straight to decentralized identity’s killer feature: verifiable credentials (VCs). What makes VCs the standout? Simple: VCs are what will make decentralized identity ubiquitous on the internet in the next decade.</p>



 What are VCs?&nbsp; 



<p>VCs are cryptographically protected and privacy-respecting digital documents that convey information about a user. [1] Trusted identity providers (called issuers) create these digital documents. Any physical car or document that a person can carry (e.g. in a wallet) could be replaced with a digital VC—think: digital driver license, digital passport, digital health card, digital travel visa, or even something as mundane as a digital gym membership card or a digital library card.</p>



VC structure



<p>Every credential has an identifier and some metadata but, most importantly, it also has the claims or attributes the issuer is asserting about the holder (user). The issuer digitally signs the credential so verifiers receiving proofs based on the credential can confirm any credential information that is asserted plus the credential’s authenticity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decentralized identity-based VCs are designed to be privacy preserving. The holder (user) maintains absolute control over which elements of their personal information (contained within the credential) they choose to provide. This is very different from physical credentials (e.g. a driver license), where the verifier can always see everything contained within the credential the user presents. Another key benefit of VCs is that the verifier can independently verify them without any communication with the credential’s issuer, which ensures issuers cannot track when the holder uses their credentials.</p>



 How do VCs work?&nbsp; 



<p>You’ll see here the parties involved in VCs, plus the data flow between those parties:</p>







<p>The VC process starts on the left with the issuer. An issuer is an entity (e.g. government or business) that wants to issue VCs. To do that, the issuer must first register some specification information on the blockchain (termed the verifiable data registry). Using the Hyperledger Indy network as an example, the issuer writes their decentralized identifier (DID), the credential schema [2] (which defines the elements of the VC), and the credential definition (linking the issuer DID and credential schema) to the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the issuer has registered information on the blockchain, they can create and issue VCs. It begins with the holder (a user) and issuer forming a DIDComm connection (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0160-connection-protocol/README.md">Aries RFC 0160: Connection Protocol</a>). Over that connection the issuer sends the VC (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0036-issue-credential/README.md">Aries RFC 0036: Issue Credential Protocol 1.0</a>), which will be stored in the holder’s wallet (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0050-wallets/README.md">Aries RFC 0050: Wallets</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point, the holder can present their information from the VC to service providers who require it. To do this, the holder establishes a DIDComm connection to the verifier and transfers the VC proof presentation (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">Aries RFC 0037: Present Proof Protocol 1.0</a>). The verifier must connect to the blockchain to read the issuer DID (which includes their public key), credential definition, and credential schema, so they can verify the presentation proof.</p>



<p>The key privacy-preserving capabilities of this process include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The verifier can determine that the credential has not been altered and is authentic.&nbsp; 



 Verification happens without the verifier communicating with the issuer.&nbsp; 



 The holder (user) can select which information from a credential they present to the verifier.&nbsp; 
 



 What are AnonCreds? 



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://anoncreds-wg.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">AnonCreds</a>&nbsp;or anonymous credentials specification is based on the open source verifiable credential implementation stemming from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>&nbsp;project. Extensive use of AnonCreds worldwide has made it a de facto standard for VCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some important concepts around AnonCreds make it a very attractive solution for VCs, such as:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Anonymity—Using unrevealed identifiers for holder-to-VC binding prevents correlation based on those identifiers. [3] This prevents colluding organizations from correlating user-specific identity information.&nbsp; 



 Revocation—AnonCreds provides a revocation scheme that proves a presentation is based on credentials that the issuer has not revoked.&nbsp; 



 Reduced PII exposure—An implementation of zero knowledge proofs (predicate proofs) helps eliminate the need to share specific PII (e.g. holders can prove they are over age 21 without disclosing their specific birth date).&nbsp; 
 



<p>The current AnonCreds specification matches the existing&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/main/libindy/src/api/anoncreds.rs">Hyperledger Indy SDK (“libindy”)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-shared-rs/tree/main/indy-credx">Indy Credential Exchange</a>&nbsp;(“credx”) implementations, [4] but recently there was a proposal to make AnonCreds a standalone Hyperledger project, which will help it to grow with future enhanced capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One key factor to note is the use of the term proof presentation. This term describes the holder presenting one of three items to the verifier:&nbsp;</p>



 
 all of the data in the credential&nbsp; 



 part of the data in the credential (a partial disclosure)&nbsp; 



 a zero knowledge proof for some data in their credential. 
 



<p>Using ZKPs is a critical aspect of AnonCreds—that is, it is not the actual VC that is presented to the verifier, but rather a cryptographically derived proof that allows the data in the credential to be presented securely. As such, the user can keep more of their PII private while still answering questions such as, “Are you over 21?”, “Do you live in this country?”, or “Do you have a college degree?”</p>



 What are W3C VCs? 



<p>In addition to AnonCreds, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has created the Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1. [5] This W3C recommendation is published and being used in government and commercial applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>W3C VCs are also open source and provide the same basic functionality as AnonCreds—that is, this standard provides holder, issuer, subject, verifier, and verifiable data registry roles and supporting functionality. Some of the main target use cases [6] are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 education—transcripts, test taking, transferring schools, online classes&nbsp; 



 retail—address verification, adult beverages, fraud detection&nbsp; 



 finance—Know Your Customer, money transfer, closing an account, trying a new service, create a bank account from home&nbsp; 



 healthcare—prescriptions, pharmacy, insurance, traveling illnesses, proving legal disability status&nbsp; 



 professional credentials—find a doctor, quality training, job applications&nbsp; 



 legal identity—driver license, immigration, air travel, refugee status&nbsp; 



 intelligent devices—manufacturing, delivery, autonomous.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The W3C VCs standard also supports ZKPs, [7] but not all W3C VCs support being asserted as ZKP responses. The choice of whether to enable this capability is left up to the credential issuer. In order for a holder to assert a ZKP response, they must use a credential that has been created to allow for this purpose. Using W3C VCs for ZKPs requires the issuer to do two things:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Add a proof property to the VC.&nbsp; 



 Where they use a credential definition, also define it in the credential schema property.&nbsp; 
 



<p>So long as those two requirements are met, W3C VCs can be asserted in a zero knowledge fashion, as we covered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AnonCreds and W3C VCs have a lot of similarities and some key distinctions, but that’s a topic for another time. The main point is that both standards describe great implementations of VCs and mainstream platforms will be using both for the foreseeable future.</p>



 



<p>[1] This is the most common case. It is also possible for other scenarios such as the user issuing a credential related to an organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[2] In the future it may be uncommon for issuers to write their own schemas. Instead a standards body could write the schemas and issuers would only write credential definitions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[3] This&nbsp;<a href="https://identitywoman.net/being-real-about-hyperledger-indy-aries-anoncreds/">paper</a>&nbsp;by Kaliya Young challenges the notion of “link secrets” as a viable alternative to including the credential subject information. This opinion is in turn refuted by this&nbsp;<a href="https://daniel-hardman.medium.com/response-to-kaliyas-being-real-post-13fddb9410f0">paper</a>&nbsp;by Daniel Hardman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[4] It is also argued in the&nbsp;<a href="https://identitywoman.net/being-real-about-hyperledger-indy-aries-anoncreds/">paper</a>&nbsp;by Kaliya Young that not having a mature specification is a weakness not allowing sufficient analysis by the industry and it also lacks a standard for interoperability testing.&nbsp;</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>I’m Andrej. I’m originally from Latvia, however, I now live in&nbsp;Germany.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I work in the IT field and my hobby is creating websites. Outside of the tech world, my interests include nature. I love studying and learning about hummingbirds, they’re a unique bird with super strength. I find them very interesting.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I am an ambassador for the Ontology blockchain. I joined the project at its very inception, having invested my savings back in 2017, and in 2021, I became an Ontology harbinger. I also work in a computer company as a technician.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>I would say that the highlight of Ontology’s offering is its Decentralized Identity (DID) products.</p><p>When this technology starts to take root in the real world, it will have an incredible impact. There are so many use cases in our everyday lives for this technology, as well as applications that could potentially change the world. DIDs can completely redefine areas like cybersecurity and the Internet of Things, supply chains, and civic participation, but they’ll also play a huge role in addressing human rights issues and furthering innovation.</p><p>I try to draw the attention of other people to this project as much as possible! I engage in discussions about what blockchain is, how important DIDs are, and how they can be used in hospitals, cars, or government agencies, among other industry uses. There are so many things that can be improved by the introduction of a trusted, verifiable identity. DIDs improve our interactions with both technology and the world around&nbsp;us.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I hope that I can achieve even more great success in my future with Ontology.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I really hope that, by promoting DIDs, this project will help to firmly integrate Web3 with the real world, even amidst the current ‘field conditions’. Everything is based on money now, so when using Web3 services, it will be important that Ontology maintains its strong reputation for security and transparency! The latest events involving the FTX exchange have shown this to be particularly evident.</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-andrej-3de846c6ccd8">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Andrej</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Should you trust your PIN? <p>At YeshID, we are obsessed with making identity and access management as simple as possible. Authentication is an important part of the problem. You know, authentication–that password you must enter multiple times a day? At YeshID, we’re making authentication as easy as tap and go, no passwords! Like Apple Pay. </p>

<p>Is that kind of thing secure? The<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-iphone-security-theft-passcode-data-privacya-basic-iphone-feature-helps-criminals-steal-your-digital-life-cbf14b1a"> ,Wall Street Journal has recently published</a> an article about iPhone theft leading to the loss of thousands of dollars drained from Apple Pay and other financial apps on the device from which money can be extracted by the thieves. The article tells the story of one victim sitting in a bar. A thief hovers near, watching as they unlock their iPhone with a PIN code. (It’s unclear from the article why they didn’t use biometrics; it’s possible the attacker stole the phone momentarily to disable biometrics with too many incorrect tries - only takes a second.) Once they’ve seen the PIN the thieves steal the phone, lock the user out by changing the iCloud password, and scan through the phone for financial details and PROFIT!</p>
<p>
This raises the question: is it safe to use iPhone (or Android) to authenticate to work, bank, and other sensitive accounts? We all do it, but is it safe?</p>

<p>For this attack to work, a few things must happen:</p> 
   The thief must have physical access to the victim. 
   The thief must observe the PIN being entered. 
   The thief must steal the phone and use the PIN to change the iCloud password before the victim can respond. 
   The victim must have Apple Pay, bank accounts, or other financial apps that the thief can defraud.  
 <p>Should you be worried? Are PINs bad? Let’s ask the following questions:</p> 
   How scalable is this attack? 
   Are physical security keys better? 
   Should we get rid of PINs altogether? 
  How scalable is this attack? <p>Scalability matters. A scalable attack, such as phishing, means many bad actors and many victims. This attack requires physical access to the victim’s phone and observing the victim unlocking their phone in a particular way – using the PIN. The resources required for this attack make it opportunistic by nature and impossible to scalable.</p>

<p>Not scalable</p>
 Are physical security keys better? <p>Sure, but. Physical security keys like Yubikey increase digital security. The user must press it or bring it in immediate proximity (using NFC, like a contactless credit card) to authenticate. This authentication method is highly phishing-resistant. If a server is hacked, all credentials are safe thanks to public-private encryption. Not true with passwords. The friction a physical security key adds is usually used to confirm significant actions, like a completely new login. (Technically, these are called “destructive” actions. But let’s not be quite that technical.)</p>

<p>Apple recently introduced support for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213154">,security keys</a>, before allowing actions like changing iCloud password. Normally, an active trusted Apple device and a PIN were sufficient to change the iCloud password. When using security keys, this is not enough.</p>

<p>Security keys require that the thief steal not just the phone but also the key. This increases friction dramatically for thieves (yay), but the friction means users will choose not to use it to unlock their devices–if they can–, because that happens a lot; you know how often! And users will lose access to their accounts if they lose the security key. That’s enough friction to make it unlikely anyone will want to carry one around for everyday, non-significant, non-destructive actions.</p>

<p>Regardless, security keys are not used when using Apple Pay, which means that if the attack is executed before the user can report the device is lost, a security key will not help. According to the article, the thief could complete the attack in minutes. Probably before the victim ever noticed their phone is missing. If you did need to authenticate with the security key every time you buy coffee, it would make the key equally likely to be stolen with the phone.</p>

<p>Not relevant. </p>
 Should we get rid of PINs altogether? <p>iPhones have FaceID. FaceID is more secure than fingerprints, so better than a PIN. Why don’t we get rid of the PIN, then?! </p>

<p>PIN, FaceID, and fingerprint act as proof of life. A real person is using the device, and this person knows (or is) a secret needed to unlock it. These secrets never leave your device, so you must register them on each device separately.</p>

<p>The PIN is a low-friction form of local-password. Unlike the complex and long passwords that you can’t remember (you are using them, aren’t you?), your 4-6 digits PIN is quick and easy to enter. Biometrics are safer than a PIN, but they are more flakey and can fail in various conditions (Fingerprints don’t work well with gloves on, FaceID with sunglasses or bad lighting.) A PIN is a safe fallback. To put this another way: biometrics are a convenient feature for quickly unlocking your phone and are no more secure than a PIN (ever seen that movie where the guy kills the other guy, takes their phone, and uses their face or finger to unlock it? Doesn’t work with PINs!) They can prevent phone thieves from accessing your phone and do that very well, but they are not a replacement for your account (iCloud or Google) password. Getting rid of the PIN will reduce your ability to unlock your phone easily.</p>

<p>In 2016, Apple reported that the average iPhone user unlocks their phone <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/04/18/average-iphone-unlocked-80-times-per-day/#:~:text=According%20to%20Apple%2C%20the%20average%20iPhone%20user%20unlocks%20his%20or%20her%20iPhone%2080%20times%20per%20day%2C%20and%2089%20percent%20of%20iPhone%20users%20who%20have%20access%20to%20Touch%20ID%20have%20set%20it%20up%20and%20use%20it%20to%20unlock%20their%20devices%2C%20saving%20valuable%20time%20over%20entering%20a%20PIN.">,80 times a day</a>, and 89% of them use PIN or TouchID. More recent statistics are all over the place, from 96 (every ~10 minutes) to over 344 times a day. FaceID takes about 0.6 seconds to unlock a device and requires no interruption, whereas PIN takes about 2 seconds. More importantly, the user experience of FaceID is intuitive and unobtrusive, while a PIN is not. Just try disabling biometrics for a few days.</p>

<p>So, why does Apple allow you to change the all-important iCloud password using just the PIN? The answer is it doesn’t. It allows changing the all-important iCloud password using the PIN and an active, trusted device. Meaning this device is, in fact, no different from a Yubikey that is always with you. Until it’s stolen. The trade-off is always security and usability.</p>

<p>No, we should not get rid of PINs. It is a secure way to authenticate to the device physically.</p>

<p>If you’re worried about physical attacks - I strongly encourage considering <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213154">,security keys</a>, and storing them in a safe place. Perhaps also consider investing in bodyguards or jiu-jitsu classes.</p> Conclusion <p>I strongly recommend increasing your PIN to 6 digits and making sure nobody is hovering behind you when you do enter your PIN. Use biometrics!–It is fantastic UX and security.</p>

<p>At YeshID, we allow users to authenticate using passkey, which feels no different from Apple Pay: a safe, completely passwordless way to authenticate. We’re sure you and your colleagues will love it.</p>
 P.S. - love your colleagues as much as we do <p>We’ve heard horror stories from users, telling us “my company forces the PIN to be alphanumeric.” Maybe they are a very high-value target, in which case this might be a good idea. More likely, someone in IT doesn’t have enough empathy for their colleagues.</p>

<p>How many times do you fat-finger your PIN? Let’s say 1-in-10 times you miss pressing the correct 6 digits from a screen of 10 large digits.</p>

<p>Now, imagine a full QWERTY keyboard with an alphanumeric PIN password on your phone. What would your error rate be now? Even if you’re a two-thumb-typer how long will it take you to type a password? 5 seconds? 10? 20?</p>

<p>Security and usability are a trade-off. At YeshID we’re obsessed with user experience and we absolutely refuse to sacrifice security, which is why we tweak every bit of user friction to the specific context. No, really, it’s our core value: <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/our-values#:~:text=Innovate%20until%20experience%20%26%20security%20exist%20in%20harmony.">,Innovate until experience &amp; security exist in harmony</a>. We love our users and we think you’ll love what we do.</p>

<p>The essential use case — what Satoshi knew, but most people have&nbsp;missed</p> TLDR   Computers worldwide cannot all agree on what is true due to the speed of light, which creates a significant delay that affects things like global&nbsp;finance  The current solution for this issue is ‘High-frequency trading’, which involves a single exchange that moves the asset being traded, but there are problems because it has to be in a single&nbsp;country  To avoid the resulting political problems, the two options are to fully decentralize all the exchanges or partially decentralize and sync them&nbsp;up  The best way to sync them up is to stop time, check all the transactions that happened during that time, and then start time again to do the next batch of transactions  We call these batches blocks, and link them on a chain — the blockchain  Instead of dealing with time as a continuous variable, it uses blocks that are long enough to cover the whole&nbsp;world  This way, everyone trades at the same speed, regardless of their location. The Ethereum block is 12 seconds long, which is enough time for everyone to trade at any distance.  This is why the blockchain is vital to the future of global trade — Mattereum provides the missing piece to make it work for physical&nbsp;assets  <p>The last year has seen the crash of the NFT market, crypto winter and the utter dumpster fire of FTX, which has led to the reputation of the blockchain hitting an all-time low. It’s currently seen basically as a tool for grifters to separate fools from money, and it’s common to hear the opinion that there’s nothing useful it can do that a database plus some governance couldn’t already&nbsp;manage.</p><p>This is not surprising, we’re in the turning point of the <a href="https://medium.com/invao/blockchain-quo-vadis-applying-the-perez-surge-cycle-c15ba685c831">Perez Cycle</a> for the blockchain. The technology has gone through a growth frenzy where all the get-rich-quick types jumped aboard, its misuse created a bubble, bankrupted vast numbers and put its reputation in the toilet. The grifters have now fled for AI and the criminals are being rounded up, but the technology remains, ready for stable and mature actors to move in and turn it into something solid, unflashy and profitable. We saw this with the dot com boom, we saw it with apps, the 19th century saw it with railways (the blocktrain?), it’s nothing&nbsp;new.</p><blockquote>Is blockchain technology worth anyone&nbsp;using?</blockquote><p>The question remains, though, is blockchain technology worth anyone picking up and using? After all, not all the subjects of bubbles get to have an afterlife. There was never a viable use case for fancy tulips after February&nbsp;1637.</p><p>So, why bother with the blockchain? I believe it is profoundly important and that its critics are completely missing the point. Here’s why: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity">Special relativity</a> — yes, that special relativity, the Einstein&nbsp;one.</p><p>Special relativity and the political economy of the world create a problem, and there is only one known solution to that problem, and we call it the blockchain.</p><blockquote>“[A person’s] ability to take on Bitcoin was a full measure of a future IQ&nbsp;test”</blockquote><p>Very few people truly understand the blockchain and very very few people understand special relativity, so you’ve got a double-layer problem there. You have to be very smart to understand this problem, there’s no way round it — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salim_Ismail">Salim Ismael</a> of the <a href="https://go.su.org/enterprise-solutions?adgroupid=122958701475&amp;utm_campaign=13060168056&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=520862056461&amp;utm_term=singularity%20university&amp;hsa_acc=5923622692&amp;hsa_cam=13060168056&amp;hsa_grp=122958701475&amp;hsa_ad=520862056461&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-324955049911&amp;hsa_kw=singularity%20university&amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAutyfBhCMARIsAMgcRJQL4M2mDFmPVkv6e0e8snVNFqIQbcbxkLFLejR0pLZn6-oNMea3pBUaAhXREALw_wcB">Singularity University</a> told me “[A person’s] ability to take on Bitcoin was a full measure of a future IQ test”. It took me about two years after reading <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/training/annual-national-training-seminar/2018/Emerging_Tech_Bitcoin_Crypto.pdf">Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper</a> to actually understand the implications, and it hasn’t gotten any easier; because there’s so much bullshit noise around the blockchain for people that don’t understand it, that actually penetrating to the heart of the story has gotten harder and not easier. But at the heart of the story, this is driven by&nbsp;physics.</p><p>Let’s start by thinking about a Zoom call with someone on the other side of the world. There is a probably roughly 1/10th-second delay between you saying something and it going around the world to reach the other person, and that delay is caused by the speed of light. Nothing can go faster than the speed of light, so over really long distances, even a signal travelling at close to the speed of light will end up with a delay. For a Zoom call, it’s not hugely perceptible, but it is there and we notice it. Have you ever tried singing with someone else over Zoom, or reciting something together? Yup, most of that is due to&nbsp;this.</p><blockquote>A modern high-frequency trading system will do more than a million transactions in a&nbsp;second</blockquote><p>So the speed-of-light delay, to get the message all the way around the world is about 1/10th of a second. That doesn’t seem like very long, but a modern high-frequency trading system will do more than a million transactions in a second. So what you have is a 100,000-transaction delay between two computers that are right next to each other doing trade and me doing a trade with a machine on the other side of the world. I agree that I’m going to sell this thing to somebody in Australia, I send the message to Australia; in the meantime, I sell it 100,000 times to a bunch of other people that are in the same data centre that I’m in, because there’s hardly any delay when the computers are right next to each other, certainly compared to the delay you get to Australia. When it arrives in Australia you send me the money, and by the time it comes back they’ve collected the money from 100,000 other people as&nbsp;well.</p><p>To summarise, there is no way of synchronising all of the world’s computers to agree about the state of a piece of property.</p><blockquote>“If you’re just trying to get a distributed system, there are trade-offs,”</blockquote><p>This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spend problem</a>&nbsp;: the double-spend problem is about light latency. In computer science it’s dressed up as a thing called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">CAP theorem</a>. This is a bit of fundamental computer science about distributed systems. The CAP theorem includes the reasoning about signal appropriation and relativity to create a result. CAP stands for consistency, availability and partition tolerance, and it’s the thing which basically says, “If you’re just trying to get a distributed system, there are trade-offs,” because the propagation delay means you can’t just do magic synchronisation, and then if the system partitions into two parts, you have to decide what happens to those two parts: do they continue to run independently, or does one of them turn itself off, or how does it… bla-bla-bla. So, the CAP theorem just neatly encapsulated this understanding, and then all the engineers talking about this stuff say, “Oh well, it’s just in the CAP theorem.” CAP theorem is computer science addressing special relativity.</p><blockquote>The political economy of trade is not heavily studied by people that understand relativity.</blockquote><p>So, the understanding that this blockchain stuff was all based on fundamental physics wrapped in this wrapper called CAP theorem, and in the early days of blockchain conferences, you would stand up and say, “CAP theorem,” and a third of the room would nod. I did an event in 2016/17 in Switzerland, and I stood up on stage and said, “CAP theorem,” and there was one hand in a room of 500 people, because we’d gotten diluted out. The original wizards that understood that all this stuff was driven by physics got diluted out with a mass of people that didn’t understand, and even in the physics community, the political economy of trade is not heavily studied by people that understand relativity.</p><p>This is all very well, but what has this got to do with the blockchain?</p><p>If we just want to solve the synchronisation problem, there is a simple solution, which is we put one computer in one country, and everybody trades using that computer. “Hey, let’s just do it with an SQL database.” For example, the Chicago Board of Trade is in Chicago, and the commodities market runs out of Chicago. Why might this present a problem? Firstly, that’s a single point of failure right there, and it sucks to be Chinese in that model, because you’re always trading at a massive disadvantage, relative to the people who are trading in America. OK, so, now you say, “Well, why don’t the Chinese just put their assets in America, under American law, trading under an American hub, and then they can trade with exactly the same kind of rights as they could trade with because everybody is the same distance from the machine…” In other words everyone has to submit all their assets to American legal control, if they want to be able to trade at parity. That is a huge sovereignty issue, and it makes everyone’s assets vulnerable to the political whims of the host country, so when someone like Trump comes to&nbsp;power…</p><blockquote>You have to be standing in a very specific place to see the&nbsp;elephant</blockquote><p>It’s this intersection between special relativity and political economy that creates the problem and Satoshi completely understood this. You have to be standing in a very specific place to see the elephant. But if you’re standing in that specific place, it’s very, very obvious that this elephant is the only way forward for&nbsp;us.</p><p>So, the solution to the problem is this: we can’t put a single trading machine in a single place and have people trade, because it is politically disadvantageous and therefore people won’t do it. If we have a whole bunch of different local trading mechanisms, all of them have very limited liquidity, because they’re only trading inside of a local region, and what this results in is the balkanisation of global trade. Now, if you have a heavily balkanised global trading system, is war more or less likely between the trading blocks than if we have a global trading system with global liquidity? If there’s a Chinese exchange and an American exchange and a European exchange and a South American exchange and an African exchange and an Indian exchange, and everybody is trading only with their neighbours, all of those exchanges have limited liquidity, and it cuts the interdependence between the trade blocs. it’s more likely to create war, and it also makes it almost impossible to do any kind of large-scale regulation.</p><blockquote>We need a global trading infrastructure</blockquote><p>The alternative is that we need a global trading infrastructure, where commodities are traded on a global system, which doesn’t advantage anybody based on their geographical location or their legal status. The folks are all able to trade equitably, it doesn’t matter what your nationality is, what your citizenship is: you connect to the system, and you can trade. But, relativity gets in the way, because the speed-of-light delay means that you’re always going to be able to trade with your neighbour better than you can trade with somebody on the other side of the world, unless we fix&nbsp;it.</p><p>How do we fix it and make it possible for you to trade with your neighbour and somebody on the other side of the world on the same equitable basis, where neither one has an advantage based on geography? And the answer is we quantise&nbsp;time.</p><p>Time, if you deal with time as a continuous variable, when somebody is next to me then they are trading at two microseconds, and if somebody is on the other side of the world they’re trading at 200 milliseconds. So instead, we create a new quantised unit of time, and the time unit that we’re going to use is called a&nbsp;block.</p><blockquote>This is what Satoshi saw and this is what the blockchain does</blockquote><p>The speed-of-time limit is 1/7th or 1/10th of a second… So if the block is 12 seconds long, the speed-of-light phenomena only apply at very ends of the blocks; 98% of the trade is in the middle of the block, and is unaffected by any kind of locality effect. This is what Satoshi saw and this is what the blockchain does; it takes these 12 second blocks of time and records them in a chain so anything traded in each block is essentially happening at the same time, and that evens out the temporal inequality and enables trade across the world to take place on an equitable basis. That is, once you have cleared the fog of hype and bullshit, what the blockchain does, and it’s going to be hugely important for the future because of what this means for global trade. No other system can do&nbsp;this.</p><p>The blockchain gives us the technology for the global equitable trade backbone, because it allows people to trade without disadvantage based on their jurisdiction or their physical location. However, we’re still going to need an interface between that system and those trades, and the state law inside each of the nation states and inside each of the subunits, like Alabama or Kentucky or Arkansas or whatever it is. We have to have a legal interface between this blockchain global data trading machinery and the law that controls who owns physical assets. So, I built&nbsp;it.</p><p>My company, <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>, enables anyone using its system to attach a transaction on the blockchain to a physical asset in the real world in a way that is legally enforceable in 170 jurisdictions across the world, which pretty much means it’s applicable everywhere. It is a universal translator, but for law. Couple that with the global equitable trade backbone of the blockchain and you have a way to trade anything anywhere, physical or digital, with incredible convenience backed by internationally enforceable law. It’s literally limitless e-commerce for any asset, even high value ones like real estate and bullion, which until now has been horribly&nbsp;risky.</p> That is the future, and we can do it right&nbsp;now. <p>If you are working on an e-commerce project that you think could be enhanced by the Mattereum system get in touch with us via <a href="http://contact@mattereum.com">contact@mattereum.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/why-global-trade-needs-the-blockchain-e1a380f5df2">WHY GLOBAL TRADE NEEDS THE BLOCKCHAIN</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The challenge: to come up with language that describes the value that is enabled through the technical standards that comprise what is known as IDTech (also known as Self-Sovereign Identity or the Decentralized Identity stack). This is independent of the different variations within the technology stack, and more importantly is meant for the vast majority of the business population that have never heard of different standards bodies, protocols or tech stacks, and who quite frankly don’t care and will never exert the effort to learn about them. In many cases these are the exact people who make the final investment go/no-go decision.</p>



<p>After hundreds of conversations and countless hours of research and reading over the past five years, four ‘qualities of value’ have emerged. These are provenance, persistence, flexibility, and portability. If these values are important in your business or operations, then this technology sector will be important for you.</p>



<p>Provenance, the ability to trace where something, whether data or physical object, has come from, and to have confidence the data has not been tampered with. More than just that, it is being able to trace back to the source with the highest level of confidence. This means to be able to automatically (no human intervention) determine what entity issued or attested to the data or physical object and to validate that this party is authorized to make these claims.</p>



<p>Persistence, the ability to act on data and information whether the original source of the data continues to exist or not. A reality of life is constant change. For anyone interacting with technology, the rate of change seems only to go up. With change, older systems become unavailable, but information links may need to persist far beyond the life of the source system. Having a mechanism that provides high levels of assurance on the information integrity under the control of the interested entity define / rephrase? can mean a decoupling of systems, reducing complexity and increasing resilience.</p>



<p>Flexibility, the ability to use the data about an object in ways that extend beyond the original intended use of the data. The most common example of a document that is used widely outside its intended use is the driver’s license, which is also used as a piece of identity documentation for purchasing age restricted products, writing a check (in the US), checking into a hotel and many other uses that have nothing to do with driving a vehicle. This is a broad but simplistic use case. When an individual or organization has the ability to select data from various parties and combine these into a single new claim, presenting this composite claim to any entity while retaining the highest levels of provenance outlined above, this creates new business models and revenue opportunities are found.</p>



<p>Portability, the ability to bring the data “with me”, and to do so in a manner that does not leave a link or connection to the issuer of the data. This is the ability to move this information between systems and vendors. As an individual or business, data portability is of value as a means to prevent capture or lock-in to a specific vendor. Additionally, being able to use the data in a manner that does not leave a ‘bread crumb trail’ every time it is used (or shared) is critical for personal privacy as well as business confidentiality, and has become a requirement under the law with the GDPR and CCPA regulations.</p>



<p>In this first post, I have intentionally kept the concepts at a high level. In the following posts, I will delve further into each of these Values, expanding on them and bringing in examples of where they would apply. I will endeavor to keep technical language and jargon out of the posts where at all possible.</p>

				  Decentralized Ecosystem Governance (DEGov) provides businesses, organizations, and governments with a powerful way to ensure accountability, manage complex information flows, and function offline while keeping verification seamless in verifiable credential ecosystems.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The value proposition for <a href="https://indicio.tech/decentralization-and-the-future-of-enterprise-security/">verifiable credential technology</a> (often called decentralized identity or self-sovereign identity) is cryptographic confidence. We can be sure the information in the credential is the information that was originally issued by the source of the credential: it has not been tampered with or altered in any way and any attempt to do so would be immediately apparent.</p>
<p>This means we can share information seamlessly (without the need to check in with the source of the information or rely on third-party data management); we don’t need complex, direct integrations (the information is stored in the credential only, which is held by the owner of the information); and we can share this information, thanks to features in the technology, in ways that enable consent and are privacy preserving (thereby addressing data privacy compliance).</p>
<p>This capacity to create verifiable data is critical at a time when rampant digital fraud intersects with a rapidly emerging dimension of artificiality to every aspect of human interaction—AI and ChatGPT. We must have a way to trust “who?” and “what?”</p>
<p>If cryptographic confidence provides us with data authenticity and integrity, we still have one crucial element left: how do we trust the issuer of the credential?</p>
<p>Knowing where the credential comes from doesn’t automatically signal that the issuer is an entity we shouldtrust. Not every digital credential is going to come from a nation’s passport office. If we want to use verifiable data to manage digital interaction, there will be many, many issuers multiplied by many, many contexts for interacting, each with a different information flow.</p>
<p>The simple answer to this is to combine cryptographic confidence with “human governance,” in the form of published frameworks that set out who is a legitimate issuer for a given interactive context and what information needs to be presented and verified. But how, exactly, should this trust be facilitated in the technology?</p>

</p><p>Indicio Proven DEGov—a decentralized system for directly establishing whom to trust in a credential ecosystem<br>There are two pathways: one is direct and the other is indirect. The direct solution is to place accountability with the entity that is accountable for how the credential is used. If you want to use a verifiable credential to cross a border, the government presiding over that border should be able to set the rules for that credential’s use. If you want to use a verifiable credential to access your place of work, your employer sets the rules for using that credential to access your workplace or its databases and cloud services. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>In the non-digital world, there are multiple authorities and bodies that certify memberships and qualifications, rules and permissions that answer everything from whether a doctor can practice in a particular field to whether I can learn to drive.</p>
<p>Indicio has been at the forefront of developing machine-readable governance for managing trust when using verifiable credentials. We believe these entities are best placed to facilitate trust for using credentials to meet their identity and data verification needs; and <a href="https://indicio.tech/who-develops-decentralized-ecosystem-governance/">we developed a “governance editor”</a> and a set of procedures to make it easy for this trust facilitation to be turned into machine-readable code that every participant in a verifiable credential ecosystem has access to and stores on their wallet. We call this DEGov — so you don’t have to say “decentralized ecosystem governance.” DEGov is our implementation of a new, open standard for governance that is being developed by the<a href="https://identity.foundation/"> Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) with input from us and many others.</p>
<p>DEGov is powerful because it enables decisions about whom to trust to be made by those who are directly responsible for those rules being followed. In our experience working with government agencies, this is vital; trust cannot be outsourced to a third-party manager.</p>
<p>Equally vital, trust facilitation cannot sleep. Verification must be possible offline. By propagating the rules so that everyone in the entire ecosystem —&nbsp;issuers, holders, and verifiers — has a copy cached in their software, verification is still possible if bandwidth falters or there in an internet outage.</p>
<p>DEGov is also a simple way to write rules for interaction: If the holder of a credential presents X information, then Y happens. These can be scripted to manage precedence in hierarchical governance rules, such as local-state-federal-global. For example, with DEGov, you will be able to coordinate a drone moving through different airspace jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Finally, the rules for interaction should also be capable of being updated quickly. A new issuer may need approval, a credential may need to be revoked, a new requirement may be needed. By using Indicio’s Governance Editor these can all be formulated quickly, published, and pushed out to the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>Indirect trust facilitation through trust registries<br>The second path to facilitating trust in issuers is to outsource the process to a third-party, known as a trust registry. We do not recommend this approach for the following reasons:</p>
 
 It’s unacceptable to governments where information is sensitive. 
 It requires inserting a new layer of complex bureaucracy into an otherwise seamless process, which needs additional trust measures to ensure it isn’t biased. 
 At best, the cost of this bureaucracy is likely to be passed onto participants in the ecosystem; at worst, this cost risks becoming a toll, where the trust registry extracts a rent on what should be a seamless process. 
 
<p>Our view is why make things more complex and frictional when the system can function simply? DEGov is Occam’s Razor for trust in decentralized identity: it cuts away what is unnecessary and in doing so enables governance to be performed by those best placed to know whom to trust and which rules to apply. This is why Indicio is launching DEGov as part of the standard Proven solutions and as a stand-alone product for others who are building open-standards and open-source based verifiable credential solutions.</p>

The Appendices have: <a>DF FAQ</a>, <a>DF Schedule as Table</a>, <a>veOCEAN Flow of Value</a>, <a>Reward Function Details</a>, <a>Contract Deployments</a>   2.1 Overview of veOCEAN &amp; Data&nbsp;Farming <blockquote>Lock OCEAN → get veOCEAN → earn Data Farming&nbsp;rewards</blockquote><p>veOCEAN. You can lock OCEAN to get veOCEAN. The amount of OCEAN you receive when the lock ends will always be equal to the amount you locked; plus there will be rewards in the meantime. To max out rewards, you must max out lock time (4 years) and amount of OCEAN&nbsp;locked.</p><p>Data Farming (DF) incentivizes for growth of Data Consume Volume (DCV) in the Ocean ecosystem. DF is like DeFi liquidity mining, but tuned for DCV. DF emits OCEAN for passive rewards and active&nbsp;rewards.</p>  As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  If you actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), then you can earn&nbsp;more.  <p>For a given week, 50% of the OCEAN rewards go to passive rewards, and 50% go to active&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Typical APYs are 5–20%, but may be as high as 45% and as low as 1%. APYs will vary week to week. The value depends on total OCEAN staked, duration of OCEAN lock, DCV, and other factors.

At it, you can lock OCEAN to get veOCEAN, see your veOCEAN balance, and&nbsp;more.</p><a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean">”veOCEAN” page at Data Farming&nbsp;webapp</a><p>You could follow the url directly, or go to the main Ocean site (<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">oceanprotocol.com</a>) and click the prominent “Earn Rewards” button in the “veOcean &amp; Data Farming”&nbsp;panel.</p>Getting to Data Farming page from main Ocean site (<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">oceanprotocol.com</a>) 3.2 veOCEAN Mechanics <p>The core idea is: lock OCEAN for longer for higher rewards. A locker can be passive, though they earn more if&nbsp;active.</p><p>You receive proportionally more veOCEAN for longer lock&nbsp;times:</p>  lock 1 OCEAN for 4 years (max) → get 1.0&nbsp;veOCEAN  lock 1 OCEAN for 2 years → get 0.50&nbsp;veOCEAN  lock 1 OCEAN for 1 year → get 0.25&nbsp;veOCEAN  lock 1 OCEAN for 2 weeks → get 0.0096 veOCEAN = 2/ (4 *&nbsp;52)  lock 1 OCEAN for 1 week → get 0.0048 veOCEAN = 1 / (4 * 52) [but you only get rewards if &gt;1&nbsp;week]  <p>Critically, veOCEAN cannot be unlocked before the pre-set time. If you’ve locked some OCEAN for a year, you can’t unlock it during that time. The amount of OCEAN you’ll receive when the lock ends will always be equal to the amount you&nbsp;locked.</p><p>You can always extend your lock time or the lock amount. But, lock time can not decreased.</p><p>veOCEAN is non-transferable. You can’t send it to&nbsp;others.</p><p>veOCEAN held decays linearly over time. If you lock 1.0 OCEAN for four years, you get 1.0 veOCEAN at the start. After 1 year, you have 0.75 veOCEAN; after 2 years → 0.5 veOCEAN; after 3 years → 0.25 veOCEAN; after 4 years → 0.0 veOCEAN, and your OCEAN is unlocked&nbsp;[1].</p><p>To keep max out rewards, you must extend lock time periodically, via the veOCEAN page in the DF app (<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/veocean">df.oceandao.org/veocean</a>).</p><p>For more details on veOCEAN, see “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">Introducing veOCEAN</a>”.</p> 4. Data Farming&nbsp;Review  4.1 Webapp for Data&nbsp;Farming <p>The Data Farming webapp is at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">df.oceandao.org</a>. It allows you to perform all the core DF activities like locking OCEAN for veOCEAN, and allocating veOCEAN to data&nbsp;assets.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/datafarming">”Farms” page at Data Farming&nbsp;webapp</a> 4.2 DF&nbsp;Overview <p>DF incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to veOCEAN holders who curate towards data assets with high consume volume. DF’s aim is to achieve a minimum supply of data for network effects to kick in, and once the network flywheel is spinning, to increase growth&nbsp;rate.</p> 4.3 Current DF Reward&nbsp;Function <p>The Reward Function (RF) governs how active rewards are allocated to&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>Rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder: <br>– If the holder is a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508">publisher, 2x the effective stake </a><br>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset) <br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>See “<a>Appendix: DF Reward Function Details”</a> for more information.</p> 4.4 *Future* DF Reward&nbsp;Function <p>The Reward Function (RF) has evolved over DF rounds, as chronicled in the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Data Farming Series</a>&nbsp;posts.</p><p>To drive DCV further, we envision further evolution of DF Rewards. Besides tuning the existing function, we can split the weekly active DF rewards budget into DF sub-streams. New sub-streams could&nbsp;include:</p>  Dapp Data Farming. If a dapp running Ocean uses x$ of gas, pay the dapp developer 25–100% * x (denominated in OCEAN). This could be an excellent way for dapp developers to monetize&nbsp;[2]  Competition Data Farming. At some point, some of the Ocean-run competitions (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth">Predict-ETH</a>) can get streamlined &amp; automated enough to put into weekly DF&nbsp;ops.  And more.  <p>Note: this section was adapted from “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051">Ocean Protocol Update ||&nbsp;2023</a>".</p> 4.5 On Claiming DF&nbsp;Rewards <p>How to claim? Go to the DF Webapp at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/activerewards">df.oceandao.org/activerewards</a></p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/activerewards">”Rewards” page at Data Farming&nbsp;webapp</a><p>Where to claim? All earnings for veOCEAN holders are claimable in Ethereum mainnet. Though, data assets for DF may published in any <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">network where Ocean’s deployed in production</a>: Eth mainnet, Polygon,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>When to claim? There are fresh rewards available every Thursday. If you wish, you can wait for many weeks to accumulate before claiming. (It’s all on-chain.)</p><p>When to do a first claim? From the time you lock OCEAN, you must wait at least a week, and up to two weeks, to be able to claim rewards. The nerdy version: if you lock OCEAN on day x, you’ll be able to claim rewards on the first weekly ve “epoch” that begins after day x+7. This behavior is inherited from <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html">veCRV</a>; <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/ve/veFeeDistributor.vy#L240-L256">here’s the&nbsp;code.</a></p> 4.5 Data Assets that Qualify for&nbsp;DF <p>Data assets that have veOCEAN allocated towards them get DF&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The data asset may be of any type — dataset (for static URIs) or algorithm for Compute-to-Data. The data asset may be fixed price or free price. If fixed price, any token of exchange is alright (OCEAN, H2O, USDC,&nbsp;..).</p><p>To qualify for DF, a data asset must&nbsp;also:</p>  Have been created by Ocean smart contracts, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/v4main/addresses/address.json">deployed</a> by OPF to <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">production networks</a>  Be visible on <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>  Can’t be in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md">purgatory</a>   4.6 Active Work to Drive&nbsp;APY <p>Data Farming is not a wholly passive activity. The name of the game is to drive data consume volume (DCV). High APYs happen only when there is sufficiently high DCV. High DCV means publishing and consuming truly useful datasets (or algorithms).</p><p>Thus, if you really want to max out your&nbsp;APY:</p>  create &amp; publish datasets (and make $ in selling them) — or work with people who&nbsp;can  consume the datasets (to make $) — or work with people who&nbsp;can  go stake on them, and finally claim the&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Driving DCV for publishing &amp; consuming is your challenge. It will take real work. And then the reward is APY. It’s incentives all the way&nbsp;down:)</p> 5. Walk-Through Numbers <p>This section walks through example numbers: OCEAN emissions schedule, and estimated APYs.</p> 5.1 OCEAN Emissions Schedule <p>The baseline emissions schedule determines the weekly OCEAN budget for this phase. The schedule is like Bitcoin, including a half-life of 4 years. Unlike Bitcoin, there is a burn-in period to ratchet up value-at-risk versus&nbsp;time:</p>  The curve initially gets a multiplier of 10% for 12 months (DF Main&nbsp;1)  Then, it transitions to multiplier of 25% for 6 months (DF Main&nbsp;2)  Then, a multiplier of 50% for 6 months (DF Main&nbsp;3)  Finally, a multiplier of 100%. (DF Main&nbsp;4)  <p>We implement the first three phases as constants, because they are relatively short in duration. We implement the fourth phase as a Bitcoin-style exponential: constant, with the constant dividing by two (“halvening”) every four&nbsp;years.</p><p>Let’s visualize!</p><p>Emissions — first 5 years. The image below shows the first 5 years. The y-axis is OCEAN released each week. It’s log-scaled to easily see the differences. The x-axis is time, measured in weeks. In weeks 0–29, we can see the distinct phases for DF Alpha (DF1 // week 0), DF/VE Alpha (DF5 // week 4), DF Beta (DF9 // week 8), DF Main 1 (DF29 // week 28), DF Main 2 (DF80 // week 79), DF Main 3 (DF106 // week 105), and DF Main 4 (DF132 // week&nbsp;131).</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 5&nbsp;years<p>Emissions — First 20 years. The image below is like the previous one: OCEAN released per week, but now for the first 20 years. Week 131 onwards is DF Main 4. We can see that the y-value divides by two (“halvens”) every four&nbsp;years.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 20&nbsp;years<p>Compare halvening &lt;&gt; smooth exponential. The image below shows the blue curve identical to the previous image: OCEAN released per week for the first 20 years. As discussed, the first three DF main phases are constants, and the final DF main phase is exponential in Bitcoin-style “halvening” approach. For comparison, the black curve shows if all DF Main was implemented with four smooth exponentials (one per phase). Note how for DF Main (fourth phase), the black curve slices through the blue curve. Blue is far simpler to explain (e.g. constant phases), and lower risk to implement.</p>Blue: OCEAN released to DF per week — first 20 years. Black: compare to four smooth exponentials<p>Total OCEAN released. The image below shows the total OCEAN released by DF for the first 20 years. The y-axis is log-scaled to capture both the small initial rewards and exponentially larger values later on. The x-axis is also log-scaled so that we can more readily see how the curve converges over&nbsp;time.</p>Total OCEAN released to DF — first 20&nbsp;years 5.2 Example&nbsp;APYs <p>The plot below shows estimated APY over time. Green includes both passive and active rewards; black is just passive rewards. As of DF29, wash consume is no longer profitable, so we should expect a large drop in DCV and therefore in active rewards. So passive rewards (black) provides a great baseline with upside in active rewards&nbsp;(green).</p><p>APYs are an estimate because APY depends on OCEAN locked. OCEAN locked for future weeks is not known precisely; it must be estimated. The yellow line is the model for OCEAN locked. We modeled OCEAN locked by observing linear growth from week 5 (when OCEAN locking was introduced) to week 28 (now): OCEAN locked grew from 7.89M OCEAN to 34.98M OCEAN respectively, or 1.177M more OCEAN locked per&nbsp;week.</p>Green: estimated APYs (passive + active). Black: estimated APYs (just passive). Yellow: estimated staking<p>The plots are calculated from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F4o7PbV45yW1aPWOJ2rwZEKkgJXbIk5Yq7tj8749drc/edit#gid=1051477754">this Google&nbsp;Sheet</a>.</p><p>OCEAN lock time affects APY. The numbers above assume that all locked OCEAN is locked for 4 years, so that 1 OCEAN → 1 veOCEAN. But APY could be much worse or more if you lock for shorter durations. Here are approximate bounds.</p>  If you lock for 4 years, and everyone else locks for 2, then multiply expected APY by 2. If you lock for 4 years and others for 1, then multiply by&nbsp;4.  Conversely, if you lock for 2 years and everyone else for 4, then divide your expected APY by 2. If you lock for 1 year and others for 4, then divide by&nbsp;4.  The numbers assume that you’re actively allocating veOCEAN allocation towards high-DCV data assets. For passive locking or low-DCV data assets, divide APY by 2 (approximate).   6. On Implementing DF&nbsp;Main <p>Ratchet Principle. As DF main involves a huge amount of OCEAN, we take extra precautions and follow the principle <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">“ratchet up value-at-risk over time”</a>. What this means: rather than sending all this OCEAN directly to the vesting contracts, we “buy time” to more thoroughly verify the&nbsp;system</p><p>Changes for DF29. For DF29, the implementation changes can be surprisingly small: (a) increased OCEAN rewards to 150,000 (b) multiplier for DCV bounds auto-sets to 0.1%, which makes wash consume unprofitable. As usual, we deploy DF rewards with a combination of manual dispensing and Github Actions (Web2 automation).</p><p>Implementation over time. Then we can ratchet up value at risk as we deploy more components, and put OCEAN into them. Here’s the order of operations.</p>  Deploy canary, wire it up. First we will deploy a “canary” vesting contract for DF Main 1. Wire it together with the rest of DF stack, including Gelato for Web3 automation. Send the contract a small amount (1000 OCEAN). It will dispense through components to DF passive &amp; active rewards addresses. (Weekly payouts will draw from this plus the main DF payment multisig; the latter being far&nbsp;larger.)  Verification. This allows us to test the system live, in production yet with a small amount of funds at risk. At the same time, we will initiate a bug bounty program and security audit for all these components.  Weekly rewards keep rolling. OCEAN payouts for DF29, DF30, etc will be as scheduled for DF main. A tiny amount will come from the “canary” vesting contract, and the rest will be topped up manually by the Ocean core&nbsp;team.  Deploy the rest. Once the verification is complete, then we will deploy the remaining contracts and move the remaining OCEAN accordingly.  <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/team-sailfish/issues/40">This Github issue</a> has details of the&nbsp;plan.</p><p>Final outcome. In completing the implementation work above, OCEAN vesting will be fully automated and on-chain. Then we will tackle decentralizing DF-main reward calculations, leveraging advances in decentralized compute infrastructure. This will serve the Ocean ecosystem well in the decades that follow, with more transparency, stability, and composability.</p> 7. Conclusion <p>Data Farming (DF) incentivizes for growth of Data Consume Volume (DCV) in the Ocean ecosystem. Its final phase is DF Main. DF Main emits 503.4M OCEAN worth of rewards and lasts for&nbsp;decades.</p><p>DF Main starts Mar 16, 2023 in DF Round 29. DF29 has 150K OCEAN rewards available (a 2x increase from DF28). As DF Main progresses, rewards will increase to 300K (another 2x), then 600K (another 2x), then beyond 1.1M OCEAN/week (near 2x) then decaying over&nbsp;time.</p><p>As of DF29, wash consuming will no longer be profitable. So, organically-generated Data Consume Volume will be the main driver of active DF&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Typical APYs are&nbsp;5–20%.</p><p>Full implementation of DF Main will be over many months, after which DF will be decentralized. DF Main lasts for&nbsp;decades.</p><p>Final caveat: we reserve the right to make reasonable changes to these plans, if unforeseen circumstances emerge.</p> Appendix: Data Farming&nbsp;FAQ <p>Q: I staked for just one day. What rewards might I&nbsp;expect?</p><p>At least 50 snapshots are randomly taken throughout the week. If you’ve staked just one day, and all else being equal, you should expect 1/7 the rewards compared to the full 7&nbsp;days.</p><p>Q: The datatoken price may change throughout the week. What price is taken in the DCV calculation?</p><p>The price is taken at the same time as each consume. E.g. if a data asset has three consumes, where price was 1 OCEAN when the first consume happened, and the price was 10 OCEAN when the other consumes happened, then the total DCV for the asset is 1 + 10 + 10 =&nbsp;21.</p><p>Q: Can the reward function change during a given&nbsp;week?</p><p>No. At the beginning of a new DF round (DF1, DF2, etc), rules are laid out, either implicitly if no change from previous round, or explicitly in a blog post if there are new rules. This is: reward function, bounds, etc. Then teams stake, buy data, consume, etc. And LPs are given DF rewards based on staking, DCV, etc at the end of the week. Overall cycle time is one&nbsp;week.</p><p>Caveat: it’s no at least in theory! Sometimes there may be tweaks if there is community consensus, or a&nbsp;bug.</p> Appendix: DF Schedule as&nbsp;Table <p>The table below cross-references DF round number (DF i), start date, phase &amp; week, sub-phase &amp; week, and OCEAN rewards /&nbsp;week.</p> Appendix: veOCEAN Revenue &amp; Flow of&nbsp;Value <p>Community Fees to veOCEAN holders. Earlier, we established how veOCEAN holders earn passive and active rewards through Data&nbsp;Farming.</p><p>veOCEAN holders actually have a second source of revenue: community fees. Specifically: Every transaction in Ocean Market and Ocean backend generates transaction fees, some of which go to the community. 95% of the community fees will go to veOCEAN holders; the rest is used to buy back &amp; burn OCEAN. All earnings here are&nbsp;passive.</p><p>Flow of Value. The image below illustrates the flow of value. On the left, at time 0, the user locks their OCEAN into the veOCEAN contract, and receives veOCEAN. In the middle, the veOCEAN holder receives OCEAN rewards every time there’s revenue to the Ocean Protocol Community (top), and also as part of DF rewards (bottom). On the right, when the lock expires (e.g. 4 years) then the user is able to move all their OCEAN around&nbsp;again.</p>Flow of&nbsp;value Appendix: DF Reward Function&nbsp;Details <p>Earlier, we described the Reward Function (RF) in text.

<p>On March 13, 2023, at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, KILT <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/public-pressure-integrates-kilt-identity-blockchain-to-verify-nfts-and-users-on-its-music-92d9c77515af">announced its first use case for public credentials with Public Pressure</a> who will use KILT to verify NFTs on their Marketplace collections.</p><p>NFTs are unique digital assets that have become popular as a way for creators to sell their digital works of art, music and other creative content. To see how public credentials add utility to NFTs, let’s take a look at a music NFT example. (You can also watch <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cZRBWXMzm6sxsCQCHnbnUFFyFWRL24rm/view?usp=share_link">the video</a> here, or view <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11m1FiWir0t8ny_c_ARSFqOccwOdGl3H_/view?usp=share_link">the slides</a>&nbsp;here.)</p> How Music NFTs&nbsp;Work <p>Martin, an artist, writes a song and wants to create a music NFT from it. First, he goes to a music NFT platform like Public Pressure and submits his&nbsp;track.</p><p>Every NFT uses a smart contract — a small program on a blockchain — that contains information about that NFT. This enables decentralized and secure interactions without intermediaries, allowing ownership to be changed in a transparent way.</p><p>Public Pressure uses a smart contract to make an NFT of Martin’s song and puts it on a blockchain.</p><p>The smart contract of a music NFT holds the creator, the content, and the owner. In this example, Martin is still the owner, as he has just submitted his track on Public Pressure.</p><p>Alice wants to buy Martin’s track. Using the platform, Alice instructs the smart contract to change the ownership of the&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>From this point, when anyone checks the information on the blockchain it will show Alice as the&nbsp;owner.</p><p>Normally that is the extent of the functionality of an NFT. Using KILT Protocol, even more utility can be added by introducing public credentials which allow users to add any information — such as comments, votes or likes — to any NFT, enabling social interaction on NFTs across all&nbsp;chains.</p><p>To see how it works, let’s go back to how music NFTs were created. An artist, Paul, composes a track and sends it to the music NFT platform, which creates a music NFT on the blockchain, as&nbsp;before.</p><p>This time, Public Pressure also issues a public credential on the KILT blockchain to certify that the track was created by Paul. This credential can be linked to the NFT even though the NFT is on another blockchain.</p><p>Anyone can add a public credential to any NFT; whether they own it or not. So artists or their record label can add certificates of authenticity, or DJ Lisa can add a public credential to say the track is part of her playlist, potentially increasing the value of the&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>And since each credential is signed with a unique DID, you can check that the person who issued the credential is who they claim to&nbsp;be.</p><p>So using this system, Mike can issue a public credential on the KILT blockchain saying he likes an NFT, even when the NFT is on another chain like Ethereum.</p><p>When Mary goes to the Public Pressure marketplace and checks the information on the NFT, the platform will show the information from the smart contract of the NFT on one blockchain, as well as the information from the public credential on the KILT blockchain. Mary can see that the NFT of the Chill Tune created by Paul is owned by Tom, and that Mike liked&nbsp;it.</p><p>How can a music NFT and its smart contract on any blockchain be connected in a safe way to public credentials related to that NFT on the KILT blockchain?</p><p>The connecting link is the <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/asset-dids">AssetDID</a> of the NFT, a unique identifier that describes any digital asset on any blockchain. This is generated from publicly available pieces of information: the blockchain the NFT is on, the NFT Standard, the smart contract address and the NFT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>In this way, every existing and future NFT on any blockchain can be referenced by an AssetDID and a public credential issued on KILT can be linked to any NFT on any chain via that AssetDID.</p><p>There’s no limit to the number of public credentials that can be linked to the same&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>To summarize how KILT enables social interaction on NFTs across all chains: any NFT holds information about itself in its smart contract on the blockchain. Simultaneously public credentials related to that NFT live on the KILT blockchain.</p><p>The public credentials are linked with the NFT via the AssetDID. They remain linked even if the NFT ownership changes, because the AssetDID of the NFT always remains the&nbsp;same.</p><p>In this system, anyone with a KILT DID can add any information to any NFT as a public credential. Any existing or future NFT automatically has a unique AssetDID. This system works with any blockchain and any smart contract. The information in a public credential linked to an NFT is available to everyone to read, as it is on a decentralized public blockchain that cannot be censored or&nbsp;stopped.</p><p>Public credentials for music NFTs represent a critical breakthrough for artists, fans and labels. Credentials always stay with the NFT even if ownership of the NFT changes, adding utility and value while fighting&nbsp;fraud.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a blockchain protocol for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers.</p><p>Discover more on the<a href="http://www.kilt.io/"> KILT website</a>, brainstorm KILT use cases in<a href="https://discord.com/channels/847445252663148565/856523327011291137"> Discord</a>, or follow KILT on<a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol"> Twitter</a> and<a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat"> Telegram</a> to keep up with the latest&nbsp;news.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/unlocking-the-power-of-nfts-with-kilts-public-credentials-d0e16cb2501c">Unlocking the Power of NFTs with KILT’s Public Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

We designed Trinsic v2 to be superior in performance, scalability, and extensibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Up to this point, we have continued to support Trinsic v1. However, Sovrin Foundation announced updates to its policies which affects all existing Trinsic v1 users. Due to these policy updates, we have made the following decisions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  All v1 users will need to migrate any Sovrin StagingNet activity by March 31, 2023.  We will sunset the entire Trinsic v1 platform on September 15, 2023.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>For more context surrounding these decisions, keep reading.</p>

				<p>Sovrin’s <a href="https://sovrin.org/announcement-removal-of-90-discount-on-testnet-transactions-by-1-may-2023/">updated policy announcement</a> includes a declaration that they intend to reset the StagingNet (renamed “TestNet”) on May 1st, 2023. This means that existing applications, integrations, and credentials on that network will be broken, as all existing DIDs, schemas, etc. will be removed on that date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to this removal, Sovrin is raising the prices of StagingNet by 10x. Up to this point, Trinsic has covered all StagingNet costs on behalf of our customers to support Sovrin. Because the new 10x-higher StagingNet ledger fees are not sustainable, we will be removing the option to use Sovrin StagingNet going forward. For anyone wondering which network they should use, we recommend the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  For non-production testing, development, or prototyping work, we recommend Indicio TestNet.  For production credentials and verification, we recommend continuing to use Sovrin MainNet.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the changes listed above, all Trinsic v1 users will need to migrate any Sovrin StagingNet activity by March 31. This will give us a 30-day buffer before Sovrin resets the StagingNet on May 1st. We also encourage you to migrate v1 traffic away from Trinsic v1 and Sovrin MainNet as soon as possible. We’re willing to work as closely with you as needed to migrate your activity to Trinsic v2 and minimize any disruption to your current users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is an important demonstration of the risk that Hyperledger Indy networks with centralized governance pose. With the vote of a few Trustees, all applications built on Sovrin StagingNet are compromised. If they felt so inclined, they could 10x the prices of MainNet if they wanted to—or make a host of other changes that could affect your product.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because Trinsic v1 is based on Hyperledger Indy/Aries, which is tightly coupled and largely dependent on Sovrin, we’re limited in what we can do. This dependency is a primary reason we developed Trinsic v2, which is DID method agnostic and supports a variety of alternative blockchains and ledgerless solutions, including ION (plus, it still supports Sovrin for public DIDs as well). We urge our v1 partners to consider <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/learn/migrate/">migrating to Trinsic v2</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We want to help you in this process. For support in migrating to a more stable development environment, please <a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">contact us</a>. If you have additional questions about this announcement, do not hesitate to reach out.</p>

			<p>As the cryptocurrency industry continues to gain traction, Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs) play a critical role in shaping the digital financial landscape. However, the industry faces considerable challenges due to illicit activities such as drug trafficking, arms trading, and darknet market involvement. This article examines the risk exposure of top VASPs based on data from three different studies and highlights how Coinfirm Analytics can help you manage these risks effectively.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Risk Exposure in Drug Trafficking
 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Data from 2022 on the top 10 and 200 VASPs reveals that the Top 10 VASPs have a four times lower risk exposure for inbound transactions related to drug trafficking, and more than seven times lower risk exposure for outbound transactions compared to the Top 200 average. This underscores the importance of choosing reputable VASPs that prioritize risk management and compliance.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		   
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Risk Exposure in Weapon Trading 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>The 2022 data on the Top 10 and 200 VASPs also shows that the Top 10 VASPs have a two times lower risk exposure for inbound transactions related to weapon trafficking and trade, and 4.3 times lower risk exposure for outbound transactions. This further supports the notion that established crypto market players are better equipped to protect themselves against illegal activities.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
															 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		   
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Risk Exposure in Darknet Market Involvement 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>By analyzing inbound and outbound transactions from 2022, the study found that the Top 10 VASPs have significantly lower risk exposure to addresses associated with suspicious activities compared to other providers. The risk exposure to addresses related to the darknet market was 3.7 times lower for inbound transactions and more than 6.6 times lower for outbound transactions.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
															 
				 
				 
				 
			 Addressing VASP Risk Exposure 		 
				 
				  
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>The importance for businesses and individuals involved in the cryptocurrency industry to take proactive measures to minimize risk exposure. <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/products/coinfirm-analytics/">Coinfirm Analytics</a> provides a comprehensive risk management solution tailored for institutions, enabling them to closely monitor transactions and wallets, while analyzing and verifying risk using the world’s largest<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>attributes database.

<p>Today in Regulatory Update, we look at the recent developments in South Dakota, India, and Europe regarding cryptocurrency regulations. In South Dakota, Governor Noem vetoed House Bill 1193, which adopted the definition of money excluding cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the Indian Ministry of Finance released a notice letter informing the public that virtual currency activities are now subject to AML law. Lastly, the European Commission announced the launch of a European Regulatory Sandbox for<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> Blockchain </a>that will run from 2023 to 2026 and support 20 projects annually.</p>



 🇺🇸 The Impact of Governor Noem’s Veto on Crypto Regulation in South Dakota 



<p>In South Dakota, House Bill 1193 was delivered to Governor Kristi Noem on March 7th, 2023, which adopts the definition of money as “a medium of exchange that is currently authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government”, excluding thus cryptocurrencies; however, it includes CBDCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Governor rejected the bill for several reasons:&nbsp;</p>



  The exclusion of cryptocurrencies would put “South Dakota citizens at a business disadvantage”; 



 CBDCs would become the only viable digital currency; 



 The US government is still in the exploration phase of adopting a CBDC. Thus the bill would regulate “something that does not yet exist”&nbsp; 
 <p>The bill can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/23995">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Governor Noem’s veto letter can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://governor.sd.gov/doc/HB-1193_Veto-Letter.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 🇮🇳 The Impact of AML Regulations on Virtual Currencies in India 



<p>On March 7th, the Indian Ministry of Finance released a notice letter informing the public that virtual currency activities are now subject to AML law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The named activities are:</p>



<p>(i) „exchange between virtual digital assets and fiat currencies;&nbsp;</p>



<p>(ii) exchange between one or more forms of virtual digital assets;&nbsp;</p>



<p>(iii) transfer of virtual digital assets;&nbsp;</p>



<p>(iv) safekeeping or administration of virtual digital assets or instruments enabling control over virtual digital assets; and&nbsp;</p>



<p>(v) participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer’s offer and sale of a virtual<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/digital-asset/"> digital asset.</a>”</p>



<p>All obliged entities under Indian AML law must perform KYC on their clients, transaction monitoring, abide by record keeping timeframe of 10 years, provide reports of the client data to regulators upon request and many more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notification letter can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2023/244184.pdf">here</a>.</p>



<p>The Prevention of Money Laundering Act of 2002 (PMLA) can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/moneylaunderingact.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 🇪🇺 The European Regulatory Sandbox for Blockchain 



<p>The European Commission announced the launch of a European Regulatory Sandbox for Blockchain, which will run from 2023 to 2026 and will support 20 projects annually. The first call closes on April 14th, 2023.</p>



<p>“Sandboxes are controlled environments where companies can test their products and services while engaging with relevant regulators.”</p>



<p>The selection process will be based on the following:</p>



  the maturity of the business case,&nbsp; 



 legal/regulatory relevance&nbsp; 



 their contribution to the EU’s wider policy priorities.&nbsp; 
 <p>The most innovative regulator participating in the sandbox will be awarded a prize every year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details about the project can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/launch-european-blockchain-regulatory-sandbox">here</a>.</p>



<p>Details about documentation required in the application process can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSISANDCOLLAB/Key+documents">here</a>.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Henk Marsman, Public Speaker, and Principal Consultant at SonicBee. 
<p>In episode 87, Oscar is joined by Henk Marsman, specialist and public speaker around ethics of digital identity and Principal Consultant of Identity and Access Management at SonicBee. Henk and Oscar explore why local municipalities may need their own digital identity schemes – including how these local schemes differ from national schemes and how they help people missed by national schemes, alongside some examples of live local identity schemes. They also discuss some disadvantages of local identity schemes and how they could be incorporated into wallet-based identification, like eIDAS 2.0.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>
<blockquote><p>“Put the human at the centre, what the individual’s needs, what the individuals want to achieve … and that is basically the ethical perspective, or the value perspective on digital identity solutions that we have in the world today.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Henk Marsman combines deep knowledge on digital identity with an ethical view on the impact on individuals and society of digitalisation of identity. His research on the ‘ethics of digital identity’ is still ongoing. Henk is involved in initiatives related to national digital identity (including eIDAS2.0), municipal digital identity and specifically for undocumented persons. Next to that he’s supporting organisations through his work at SonicBee, a Dutch IAM boutique firm, in digital identity projects. He has worked for 5 years at a top-three Dutch bank (Rabobank) as the global service owner for the Identity and Access Management services, and prior to that was senior manager with Deloitte, leading the Dutch IAM practice.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining us to this episode of Let’s Talk about Digital identity. And something that we have not talked before is, digital identities in local governments. For that very interesting topic, we have a special guest who is, Henk Marsman.</p>
<p>He combines deep knowledge on digital identity with an ethical view on the impact of digitalisation of identity, on individuals and society. His research on the ethics of digital identity is still ongoing. Henk is involved in initiatives related to national digital identity, including eIDAS 2.0, municipal digital identity, and specifically for undocumented persons. Next to that, he is supporting organisations through his work at SonicBee, a Dutch IAM boutique firm in digital identity projects. He has worked for five years at a top three Dutch bank, Rabobank, as a global service owner for the Identity and Access Management Services. And prior to that, he was senior manager with Deloitte, leading the Dutch IAM practice.</p>
<p>Hello Henk.</p>
<p>Henk Marsman: Good morning, Oscar. Nice to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s great having you, Henk.</p>
<p>So, Henk, let’s talk about identity. But very first, I want to hear a bit about yourself and especially your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Henk: Yes, that’s a good start Oscar, thank you for that. I’ve had several occasions looking back at how I ended up in this world, because there no formal training for becoming an Identity and Access Management expert. For me, it started actually when I was doing a half year of exchange study in Finland. Where a professor, in Turku, with a lot of abbreviations on a slide, and we were supposed to pick one and write an essay on it. And I chose the TTP one, which stood for Trusted Third Parties, and that let me in the world of online trust services / public key infrastructure. So, I did my graduation thesis on the same topic, and from that on I was in Cyber Security and PKI basically, and over the years through planning and through accidents, that was henceforth.</p>
<p>I still remember, one time in a consulting firm I was on the bench, there was a project ongoing and there was a free seat at the Sun Identity Manager Boot Camp. Sun was still a company at that time. And I didn’t really want to go, but it was a free seat, so I had to go. And then within half a year I moved over to another company, and it was Deloitte. I accidentally made the remark that I had to do this boot camp on Identity Manager, and from that point onwards I was their Identity Manager Champion. Because as we say in the Dutch, in the saying ‘In the land of the blind, a person with one eye is king.’ So, I’ve been in this area for over 20, 25 years, in consulting.</p>
<p>I spent five years at Rabobank, because I also wanted to see the other side of the table, where you actually need to improve year over year, work with teams and the internal politics of an organisation.</p>
<p>And then after five years, I decided to move back into consulting again. So, I’m with SonicBee, a boutique Identity and Access Management shop in the Netherlands. And besides doing the regular IAM consulting at organisations, I also spend some time on research and study on Digital Identity and the ethical aspects of it when you look at the digital identity solutions on a national level, sometimes even at the global level.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, super interesting. And yes, we know that from your research you have been, as you said, exploring the national level of digital identities. But also the local government, which is something particular we are very curious to hear more about that.</p>
<p>So first of all, what are local digital and legal identities?</p>
<p>Henk: Yeah, I came across that because, as part of my research I was intrigued by the gap between; on the one hand the promise of digital identity – stating that everybody has a trustworthy digital identity, we’ll have inclusion, and we can bank beyond banks, we can perhaps even provide a legal identity to persons, although that’s a completely different topic. And on the other hand, the cases where we saw that digitisation, but also digital identity solutions sometimes enhance exclusion, and enhance the inequalities that are already existing in society.</p>
<p>Because when we look at these type of digital identity solutions, it’s no longer in the corporate domain, with the employers, employees and third parties that need access. This is the domain of citizens and residents and how a state provides services to their population. And through my research, I came across the topic of Legal Identity and Digital Identity. And I got in conversation with a couple of municipalities where people were working, on the one hand on smart city type of projects to see how municipal services could be digitised. Which is for most governments, but also for lots of the municipalities, a strategic imperative to also enable their services to the residents and the citizens through digital channels. And on the other hand, also looking at how vulnerable groups in the population could also make use of those services, also through the digital channels, so using a digital identity.</p>
<p>And what I’ve seen so far is that, on a national level, there are like, there’s the supranational and the national regulation and the legislation, and there are a lot of national Digital Identity Initiatives. But on the municipal level, you really encounter the community aspect of it. So, where we can say on a national level, if you’re a Dutch citizen and these are your criteria, you can request a digital identity in these and these manners. And then you can file your taxes online, or request a permit for rebuilding a house, or engaging with the government on other topics and aspects.</p>
<p>But in a municipal level, you quite quickly encounter kind of the, what I would say is, the messiness of society. So, we can’t get everything in clear boxes. So, on the municipal level, you will encounter the people that don’t fit into the definitions and the boxes, that were created on a national level, to, kind of, organise society, or try to organise society by states. So, municipalities kind of struggle on that mid-level; between the local communities and the people that are actually living there, and the national directives and legislations, and they have to combine those two. And for that you see that, in a lot of cases, municipalities and cities rely on national digital identity solutions.</p>
<p>So, for example, in the passports of two of my children are expiring. So, I use my national digital identity, in the Netherlands that’s DigiD. I log into my municipality here and I make an appointment to renew their passports. That is one way.</p>
<p>But in the city, there are also people who struggle with those digital means. They sometimes also have an immigration status, which is what they call irregular, or they don’t have the means to do this digitally. And that is where you see that on the city level, there is much more effort and emphasis on also providing a physical interface for those people. Providing the services, to these residents, in the city.</p>
<p>And that’s where you see local governments and municipalities also sometimes struggle with groups of people, that cannot easily make use of a national level, digital identity solutions. But they still want to enable them, through digital channels, for their services. And that’s where municipalities try to create city cards or municipal discount cards. And especially, in a lot of cases, oriented towards the more vulnerable group. So, discount cards for groups in a community that live on a certain percentage of the minimum income, or by some other aspect. People who need to put in more efforts to get along in, kind of, regular society. And they get discounts through those type of cards.</p>
<p>Oscar: You mentioned, to see a bit of an example. Maybe you can tell me some examples in some cities, but those discount cards, are physical or digital, or there are both?</p>
<p>Henk: Most of the cases that I’ve been reading up, they’re physical. Because in those cases also the municipalities make use of the desks in city hall to issue these cards, to identify the people who need them, out of their central administration.</p>
<p>One of the initiatives, actually two initiatives, that I’m now involved with – we’re looking at also a digital version. So, an app on your phone or a wallet on a smartphone, that people could use for the same type of functionality. And I think that, that is one of the areas that will be quite interesting to see what’s happening there. Because there are a lot of wallets, the technology is already there.</p>
<p>For example, in one of the municipalities, we’re now in the conversation with a coalition of people who are representing more vulnerable groups, but also regular residents in the city. Which you know, the purpose of a digital ID or an identification card, would be to provide a way for people to show their identity. Regardless of their immigration status, because all – we’ll touch upon undocumented persons or irregular immigrants later on – because for some of the services is like accessing a library or a museum, perhaps even opening a bank account, you need to be able to show that you are a resident of the municipality, and not necessarily share a lot of other attributes. And this can be done through a card, but also through a wallet.</p>
<p>Of course, then there are other challenges that you need to address as well, because if the solution that is going to help these groups of people is digital, that means that it will be exclusion to people who cannot get along on those digital means.</p>
<p>So, there was a case in a city, where they were looking at an app on a phone to register for food and stay in pensions for homeless people. And it turned out that the phone that was used to make use of that app, sometimes was also used as a means for payments or the phone was lost. And then you see that that was kind of a prerequisite or requirement, to make use of a digital version in those types of solutions, there should also always be a combination of a physical and a digital solution. If the purpose is to provide access to public services for the general population in the city.</p>
<p>And that is also one of the things that struck me in the research; that there are a couple of angles to this topic of digital identity. And some of them are really coming out of the area of providing services, and they are more the service provider-oriented views. Which, sometimes, tend to be very focusing on, increasing the operating effectiveness, and making the delivery of service more efficient.</p>
<p>And the other aspect that, sometimes, is not completely served by the first perspective is that; if you put the human at the centre, they do this human centred development and analysis of what is going on, and what is needed. Then you see, all of a sudden, a completely different perspective. Where there is a huge variety in humans, in the population, in communities, especially in municipalities that cannot always make use of a digital ID. So, these two perspectives are also sometimes in tension with each other, and the research shows that the purpose or the overarching objective for a digital identity solution for a great extent, determines the success of this and the outcome of this.</p>
<p>So, going quickly back to a country level, but where one country deploys a digital identity solution out of surveillance purposes. So, they want to make sure that the people in the country are really citizens, not just residents. And it’s really focussed on, border control so, making sure that we don’t get the wrong people in. And that can be criminals, can be terrorists, but it can also be people who basically have no reason in this country. Such a solution will be designed on surveillance and monitoring, and more on exclusion, keeping the wrong people out, than inclusion.</p>
<p>Whereas if you set up a system like that to provide the basic services to all residents in a community, or in a country. And such a system will be much more designed and implemented based on inclusion, and will serve somewhat different purpose.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, this you mention, physical, digital, sometimes both – this discount card or this wallet, that for these people becomes the main document, correct?</p>
<p>Henk: For some people as well, yes. So, if I take my situation, I’m in the luxury position of, at least in the Netherlands now, I have a passport, I have a Social Security Number which we call Citizen Service Number. And in the Netherlands, the government has made the legal arrangements in such a way that, basically, all the primary or basic services that you can have here. So that’s health care, education, that is legal support, etc. They are connected to its legal rights of being permissible in the Netherlands, or being allowed to be here legally. For people who do not have that for various reasons, that makes it really difficult to get this health insurance, to visit the hospital, and get medical assistance, for example.</p>
<p>So, the cracks in the system is where this legal framework cannot cover every situation, and groups of people who are falling in those cracks. So, for example, undocumented persons, who do not have a Dutch passport, sometimes they have a passport from their home country, but they don’t have the residency status in the Netherlands. For these groups of people, a municipal identity or a city ID, could be a solution in situations where they are struggling now very, very much. And they struggle, for example, in what I mentioned, that’s accessing healthcare, because in the Netherlands, when you visit the hospital, you need to bring your insurance card. In order to get your insurance card, you need to get that insurance, and to get that insurance, you need to identify and have this Social Security number or a Dutch citizen number. Well, if you don’t have that, then the house of cards comes falling down.</p>
<p>But for these people, in some cases, they are also unable to identify them according to the regulatory framework. For example, when they’re on a bike at night, and their light does not work, and the police stops them. And in the Netherlands, you are not obliged to carry ID documentation, but you are obliged to be able to show it when police ask for it. So for these people, that’s a very scary moment, because if they can’t show the proper identity document at that point in time, because their bike light was broken, then they are at the risk of being detained under the laws for immigration and other people staying in the Netherlands, for example.</p>
<p>And the last example here, is that there is a universal human rights described that provides the right to education for minors. So, in this case, in the Netherlands, if a minor does not have this Dutch Citizen ID, the Social Security ID, they are still able to go to school up until they’re 18 years of age. But it gives still a lot of trouble in the administration, and after they are 18, the day they turn 19, they’re struggling with access to higher education.</p>
<p>That is where you see that kind of, the national regulatory framework covers about 95%, maybe 99% of all the cases. But there’s still a lot of people in this country, who do not, are not getting covered by the legal framework. And in the Netherlands, that can go up to 80 or 100,000 people. Of course, because in the case of undocumented persons, they’re not documented. So, we don’t know exactly how many there are, but it’s a significant amount of people. And they also play a significant role in in, for example, the great economy.</p>
<p>So, nannies and housecleaning. Now if you – during Corona that became very apparent, if you’re really forced to exclude them from society through these measures, then it has, of course, to a certain extent an economical impact. But you also push people out of the society, where their basic human rights are guaranteed. And that is for me personally, one of the triggers to say, well, let’s get engaged on this topic. Because I can walk into a hospital with a stomach-ache, and they will see me, and my expectation was that anybody in my country could do that, and it turns out not to be the case. Because of all kinds of regulations and identification, being able to identify yourself, whether it’s with a physical card or digital, is one of the stumbling blocks in that process.</p>
<p>So besides doing well-paid consultancy at large corporations on Identity and Access Management. I, but also my employer SonicBee, really sees this as something to engage in on society. To also and where we can make the growth a little bit better. How ambitious, or how almost over the top nice that seems, but that being part of society for us as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, absolutely super important and you have been illustrating very well both of the problems. So why it is needed? Why there’s motivation from the local governments? And how is it affecting is helping some people? But some people are still underserved, as you say. </p>
<p>If you can tell us, some examples from some cities, how has it been done?</p>
<p>Henk: Yes, there’s actually quite a lot of examples of cities who are already providing a city aid to their residents. And one of the most striking I found is the one in New Haven in America, the United States of America. That is a community with a large number of immigrants, and in the United States, the whole system of federal law and local law works slightly different than what I’m used to in the Netherlands, or we have in Europe.</p>
<p>The problem they have in that community was that these immigrants just had regular job, sometimes making a lot of money, but because they had struggles with identifying themselves, they could not open a bank account. So, they walked around on the street with sometimes a lot of cash that led to robbery and mugging, that led to unsafety in the community. So, the New Haven City Council said we need to address this, because these people need to be able to open a bank account in some way, so we can make the community as a whole safer. So, they issued the Elm City Resident Card, as they called it, and that really was designed to protect those 10 to 15000 undocumented immigrants. And that has been evolving over time.</p>
<p>Something similar is present in New York, where they have the ID New York that was started in 2015. Also, to provide access to city services, especially for vulnerable populations. And the trick they did there is that they did two really good things, in my opinion. Well, in the opinion of most of the analysis reports that I’ve read on it as well. They did it through a coalition, so instead of designing it for people, designed it with people. So, it was a broad coalition of representatives out of these vulnerable groups. And the other thing is also that it was not restricted to those vulnerable groups. So, it’s a generic city ID that was created there. And it showed also by the uptake because in one and a half years they had 800,000 users or holders of these cards.</p>
<p>With the vulnerable roots, one of the safeguards there is that it’s only for identification. In 2018 / 2019, there were two challenges to this is city ID or to ID New York solution. One was the change of administration, and the new administration had a completely different focus on immigrants and immigration and wanted to use or abuse their system. To find immigrants and deprive them of some of their rights that they had at that moment. And the other challenge was that financial service providers said it would be a good idea to connect financial services to these identity cards. And that was stopped, that initiative, because the coalition stood up and said, well, you know, financial service providers have different incentive than a city council providing public services to the residents, in the community. And also, for those financial services who will start gathering data, sharing data, analysing data to, you know, get the best financial offer to this person. But a lot of these people are in vulnerable groups and providing them really nice discounts. But then making them pay the credit rate for the next five years is not in their best interest. So that is not something that we want to do.</p>
<p>So, one of the lessons learned from that New York initiative was also to keep it with identity, do not combine it with other services like financial services. Because then you get different incentives and different players in, kind of, the ecosystem of search in municipal ID. And also, one of the things that New York does is that they destroy all evidence of the initial registration within two years. To also make sure that privacy of these people that that register, and you can register, of course, with a U.S. passport, but you can also register with less, I would say, assured identity documents.</p>
<p>So, all the way up to if you’re homeless, with a homeless residence will vouch for you and will provide you with a document stating that you have been staying overnight in their homeless residence for at least 15 days. That will make you eligible to apply for the city ID. And with that city ID again, you can identify yourself, access to basic services. And one of the things that really also showed in New York was that besides enabling vulnerable groups to access services, it also gave them a sense of belonging. So, it also did something in that community where identification was a prerequisite for services, and through that connecting with society and being part of society.</p>
<p>And there are quite a few others, there’s also one in Zurich, Switzerland. Where they started specifically for people without identity documents. So they call this Sans-Papiers, paper people without papers, without documents. And there, for example, you saw that they took the space there was between; what the regulator on a national level stated, and what their responsibilities as a municipality are, to provide these people with a card for identification. To make it easier for them to participate in society, to get specific discounts, etc..</p>
<p>And again, they’re a coalition working on this ID, where in New York they also worked closely together with the police department. It was also the case here, and together with the Red Cross and other actors in the city trying to figure it out. What are the stumbling blocks for vulnerable groups in our population? Can we provide them with an identification solution and can that identification solution also be in the form of a digital identity?</p>
<p>And I think on that aspect, in these situations, I’m not 100% sure to what extent there are already digital. I’ve seen in my conversations here in the Netherlands in a number of municipalities that, digital has some benefits in this case, so, an app or a wallet on a smartphone, because a lot of people have a smartphone, but not everybody.</p>
<p>So, on the one hand, again, you have this perspective of let’s get everybody this wallet and they can use it everywhere and the world will be a better world. On the other hand, such a perspective bypasses the fact that a community of people is very diverse. And if you, we actually had it with access to health care, we said, you know, talking to some health care providers, some GP’s saying, what if we create this this city ID card in an app and it would allow people, undocumented persons to identify. And their response, as practitioners in the field working with these people, said ‘That’s a great idea. But for that very small group of people who cannot do that because they’re not digital literate or they don’t have a smartphone, or it won’t be even more exclusionary to them.’ And that got us thinking and saying, if the objective is to work on the community and include people to a larger extent, then you need to really look at the idea identification and not focus only on the digital art of digital identification.</p>
<p>Although it’s a fascinating topic, it’s a cool development. With eIDAS 2.0 we’ll see a major changes in the next two years, in Europe. But the design principles should be human centric, and I love the quote of one of their one of the NGOs, one of the civic institutes working on it, says ‘Nothing for us, without us’. Because identification can become really core to travelling the society, and the municipality, and being able to access services or not.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely. In these very clear now you have a explained these specific example in United States, Switzerland, also earlier in the Netherlands, they are definitely filling the gaps. Excellent outcomes. But could we also think if this type of local government ID have also some issues, some disadvantages? So, by what you see.</p>
<p>Henk: I mean in the sense of the challenges for these local initiatives, think one of the challenges or potential issues is of course, that when an administration changes or a national law changes, that means that you could be forced to adjust locally, especially if you provide a digital identity solution for vulnerable groups. Those principles of privacy and data control and data storage are critical, so that can be a challenge there. And that is kind of, I think, also to check that it’s a municipality or the community in the population, but it’s also a highly political environment. Of course, in a city council.</p>
<p>And one of the other challenges that we’ve seen here is that the idea is very appealing to provide everybody and methods of identification, regardless of what the national legal framework says. As the national legal framework may tie ID to immigration status. Well, some of the rights people have are not tied to immigration status, but that does leave the question of who will identify a person. So in the case of one of the cities that I’m engaged with now, we’re having that question saying, well, there are, for example, homeless people or undocumented persons or people who do not have this national ID or citizen ID. So who is going to vouch for their identity based on what? And will this identity be added to the national identity register?</p>
<p>Because in the Netherlands we have a person’s registration, and we already know that. The last question will be definitely a no, because that would be creating a backdoor in our national identity register. And of course, that would be very interesting for people with malicious intent. So, you would get a lot of fraud attempts there.</p>
<p>The question before that is basically if we can enable people to get access to all services they are entitled to. Even when they lack a national identity documents, then the challenge that we had of accessing the services actually moves upstream in the process to the question of, okay, so now they connect to social services, but who is actually identifying them? And does that need to be a city like a city council, or can it be a civic organisation? Or should it be a combination of both? And what are the minimum criteria?</p>
<p>So, within New York there are a number of requirements that you can use to get this ID, but for example, if you a slightly different focus, but it’s top of mind for me at the moment. If you look at Aadhaar the biometric national identity solution in India, which has been quite successful, they have a list of over 32, what they call breather documents. So, registering in the system, you have basically 32 options which range from passport to drive for license. And if all else fails there, if there is no document, then you can get two officials from your village, or your city and when they vouch for your identity, you will get registered.</p>
<p>Those type of questions then come up and you’re basically working on the; on the one hand, working on the fabric of society. So what does this notion of identity mean for society, and how can we make sure that it’s, on the one hand formally properly arranged, but on the other hand flexible enough? Because we are dealing with humans and once we start excluding them, then we really are sometimes violating basic human rights. With what I’ve also seen in my research that is actually happening various instances around the world.</p>
<p>So those could still be challenges and of course also expertise around this topic, which is something that a local government would need to build up and sustain over time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes indeed, thank you for explaining that. Absolutely, there’s still a lot of work to be done. One more question related to, you mentioned eIDAS 2.0, especially the wallet that has been in many people’s radars.</p>
<p>How would this type of identity, local government identities, can be incorporated into wallet-based identification? So, other existing, let’s say, or already planned, like eIDAS 2.0.</p>
<p>Henk: Yeah, I think that question is, I think there are two questions in there. One is, can you use a wallet? And I think there are many wallet types or hold type solutions already available in the market. So, in that sense it’s in that area, it will be more a question of, you know, which technology, which solution do we select and is it safe and also privacy safe?</p>
<p>What is happening in, on a European level with eIDAS 2.0. So, the ambitions for a European digital identity, based on a wallet solution, is that ties into the national governments because they have the – the national government has the authority over their citizens and their residents. So, eIDAS 2.0 is putting down a legal framework that ensures that there is a legal backing for a national digital identity, in a wallet.</p>
<p>So, for example, the Dutch government is now working on – how are we going to get our national identity? So, the National Identity Register enabled for an identity wallet under eIDAS 2.0. They are also working on a wallet solution, so that in two years’ time everybody who is a Dutch registered citizen can download the app, download the wallet, basically stored their national identity data in there, of course, are some questions around identification and authentication in that process. And then use it in the Netherlands, but also in Germany and in France, because the eIDAS legal framework will provide the legal backing for that cross-border order acceptance of those solutions. It can also be used on a city or municipal level, except for those people who are not part of the National Identity Register.</p>
<p>And that’s where it comes back to vulnerable groups in the community, where on a state level or a national level, I have this feeling that it’s easier to stick to general classes, and order, and regulations. Whereas on a municipal level, you really need to work on the translation to society with all the variety and all the and the people, the individuals and the groups of individuals in there. Even though on paper, on a national level, there are solutions for them, and they should be either out or in. You find that in reality some people are in-between and on a city level you need to deal with them because they still have basic rights, that you need to provide them regardless of whatever status they hold.</p>
<p>And I think for that, the eIDAS 2.0 will – well, my question is, whether eIDAS 2.0 does will make that a better world or not? Because again, this is a solution that is based on a national identity registers. Well, at least the aim is to make it an easy-to-use solution, but it means the majority of people using it will rely on it. That also means the majority of service providers will accept it, and perhaps move to a direction that they prefer that specific type of use.</p>
<p>So, there is the risk of enlarging again, the inequalities that you have in society there. And there have been cases already also where we’ve seen that these types of solutions, although they start as an option, as a voluntary solution, and you don’t have to join. Once you get into an ecosystem and other services are built on it or connected to it. So, kind of the generativity kicks in, of these types of solutions, then it becomes increasingly difficult to opt out. And I think as a commercial service provider, there’s a different perspective, different values at stake than as a public services organisation like a municipality.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. Final question for you, Henk. For all the business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Henk: That’s a good question. I think if I could give one actionable item is; put on your calendar to take on whatever digital identity solution you’re working. Take 5 minutes or maybe 10 minutes and basically take the perspective of the individual human. Realise that there is a huge variety in individuals. Everybody is unique, so generic solutions will only go that far. And if you put the human at the centre, what the individual’s needs, what the individuals want to achieve.</p>
<p>And that’s, for example, not only access to a bank account, but it is also independence, autonomy, agency, free will, also living a life that’s worth living, being able to flourish. Just spend a little bit of time on that perspective and then go back to everyday work, but take that perspective in mind that especially around identity solutions and also digital identity and digital identification in the end, there is a person on the other side of the line, which is a human, a flesh and blood, And that perspective, I feel, needs to be included more in the solutions that we build. And that’s also why I think we should have more conversations on the values that are at stake, the impacts of the solutions that we built. And that is basically the ethical perspective, or the value perspective on digital identity solutions that we have in the world today.</p>
<p>So I would put that on the calendar, take 5 minutes picture the human and what they need, what they want, what they are entitled to, what their privileges are, what their duties are, what their virtues are, maybe even. And then continue with the important work that I think most practitioners in this field are doing that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great reminder. Thanks a lot, Henk, for this super insightful conversation. I commend you for all the work you’re doing on this. Please finally, let us know for the ones who would like to follow the conversation with you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Henk: Yeah, I’m quite active on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/henkmarsman/">LinkedIn</a>, so I post a lot there and I like a lot there on this topic. That also has a link to a personal blog site of mine, which is <a href="https://henkmarsman.wordpress.com/">henkmarsman.wordpress.com</a>. I call it ThroughIdentity, because in my when I started on my research, I came across a lot of identity solutions and I thought we need to think these things through, right up to the end.</p>
<p>So it became, thinking through digital identity, and that ‘thinking through digital identity’ in brief is now ThroughIdentity. And also, on <a href="https://www.sonicbee.nl">sonicbee.nl</a> or just SonicBee sites itself, there are <a href="https://www.sonicbee.nl/en/resources/">blogs and articles</a> by me and by colleagues that people can follow. And those are the 2 or 3 main channels.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Thanks a lot, to Henk for this conversation and all the best.</p>
<p>Henk: Yes, Thank you to Oscar. Thank you for having me. And all the best also, with the blogs and with Ubisecure.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> 
<p>On March 8th, 2023, the UK Government introduced a new <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430">Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (2)</a> into parliament.&nbsp; The government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/british-businesses-to-save-billions-under-new-uk-version-of-gdpr">announcement</a> of this bill claimed that “British Businesses to Save Billions Under New UK Version of GDPR”.&nbsp;&nbsp; What does this mean in practical terms for businesses and consumers?</p>
 
 Nothing has changed - yet 
<p>This announcement needs to be put into context.&nbsp; Firstly, the political context is that the government has been under pressure to show some tangible benefits from Brexit.&nbsp; In September 2022, the UK Government announced “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-retained-eu-law-revocation-and-reform-bill-2022">The Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill 2022</a>”.&nbsp; This requires the government to “..sunset the majority of retained EU law so that it expires on 31st December 2023..” and assimilate it into UK statutes where appropriate to ensure the supremacy of UK rather than EU law.&nbsp; Secondly, in the context of the legislative process, nothing will change until the bill has passed through three readings in the House of Commons and then three readings in the House of Lords followed by Royal assent.&nbsp;&nbsp; During this process there may be many changes and amendments.</p>
 UK Data Protection Act 2018 
<p>In 2018, when the UK was still a member of the EU, the obligations under EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) were incorporated into UK law through the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/pdfs/ukpga_20180012_en.pdf">UK Data Protection Act 2018</a>.&nbsp; The new proposed legislation is tabled in the form of a set of amendments to that act.&nbsp; This makes the details of the proposal difficult to understand without a detailed knowledge of the chapter and verse of that act.&nbsp; To clarify this the government has published a set of <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-03/0265/en/220265en.pdf">explanatory notes</a> that explain the intent of the changes.&nbsp; These show that the bill covers a range of areas and some of the highlights are set out below.</p>
 Clarification 
<p>One purpose of the bill is to provide clarification in several areas:</p>
 
 It provides greater clarity about what is personal data and the reasonable steps that a data control needs to take to decide whether data could identify a living individual. 
 It clarifies the different lawful grounds for which private companies can process personal data at the request of public bodies.&nbsp; 
 It will provide the Information Commissioner with a sufficiently clear framework of objectives and duties in relation to its data protection responsibilities, against which to prioritize its activities and resources, evaluate its performance and be held accountable by its stakeholders. 
 &nbsp;It clarifies language to help researchers in their use of personal data. It allows for the re-use of personal data for the purpose of longer-term research studies. 
 It clarifies the rules on international transfers and cross-border flows of personal data. This is intended to facilitate international trade by providing a clearer and more stable framework for international transfers of personal data. The reformed regime aims to continue ensuring high standards of protection when people’s data is transferred overseas, and the data protection tests will focus on the data protection outcomes provided for data subjects, irrespective of form. 
 
 Outcomes rather than controls 
<p>The governments considers that the current legislation focusses too heavily on prescribed controls rather than risk-based outcomes:</p>
 
 The current legislation also prescribes a series of activities and controls which organizations must adopt to be considered compliant. This can lead to a ‘box-ticking’ compliance regime, rather than one which encourages a proactive and systemic approach. 
 It streamlines the requirements on organizations to demonstrate how they are complying with the legislation. 
 It also amends the exemption which organizations can use to charge a reasonable fee for or refuse to respond to a request from a data subject to where a request is deemed to be ‘vexatious or excessive’. 
 It will support appropriate data-sharing across the wider health and adult social care sector by setting standards about how information is shared, which make it easier to compare data, across the sector. 
 It will simplify the oversight framework for the police use of biometrics and police and local authority use of surveillance cameras. 
 
 Privacy and Electronic Communications 
<p>It also makes changes to the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, relating to confidentiality of terminal equipment (e.g., cookie rules), unsolicited direct marketing communications (e.g., nuisance calls), and communications security (e.g., network traffic and location data).</p>
 Digital Verification Services 
<p>There is currently no existing legislation relating to the regulation of private organizations providing digital verification services in the UK. &nbsp;The bill aims to increase trust in and acceptance of digital identities across the UK. &nbsp;It will establish a regulatory framework for the provision of digital verification services in the UK and enable public authorities to disclose personal information to trusted digital verification services providers for the purpose of identity and eligibility verification.</p>
 Smart Data schemes 
<p>Smart Data is defined as the secure sharing of customer data, upon the customer’s request, with authorized third-party providers (ATPs). &nbsp;Organizations that are neither the customer nor original service provider (APPs) can then use this data to provide innovative services for the consumer or business.&nbsp; The bill is intended to enable:</p>
 
 Rebalancing the information asymmetry between suppliers and customers. 
 Customers to make better use of their personal data, e.g., enabling accurate tariff comparisons and providing access to better deals. 
 Customers to benefit from a more competitive marketplace, including through lower prices and higher quality goods and service delivery. 
 New services in and across the sectors, to help consumers save and manage their money and services. 
 
 Electronic Registers 
<p>This Bill would remove the requirement for paper registers to be held and stored securely in each registration district and enable all births and deaths to be registered electronically. This will remove the current duplication whereby births and deaths are registered both electronically and in paper registers.&nbsp; Currently the person registering a birth or death must physically sign the register in the presence of the registrar.&nbsp; It also makes it possible, at some time in the future, for the person registering to sign something else.</p>
 Trust services and eIDAS. 
<p>‘Trust services’ include services specifically relating to electronic signatures, electronic seals, timestamps, electronic delivery services, and website authentication. The eIDAS Regulation requires that such trust services meet certain criteria - standards and technical specifications - to allow for interoperability across the UK economy.</p>
 
 The bill recognizes conformity assessment reports that have been issued by EU conformity assessment bodies accredited by the national accreditation body of an EU member state, and that these reports can be used to grant a trust service provider qualified status under Article 21 of the eIDAS Regulation, and for the purposes of regular auditing requirements under Article 20(1). 
 It also gives the power to the secretary of state in the future to revoke this should the continued unilateral recognition of EU qualified trust services no longer be appropriate. 
 
 Opinion 
<p>On the face of it this bill looks to provide useful clarification around the processing of personal data.&nbsp; It supports a risk-based approach to personal data processing rather than a prescriptive one.&nbsp; It enables greater use of IT within the public sector and control over the use of data by law enforcement.&nbsp; It provides control over digital identity verifications providers and smart data sharing.&nbsp; However, I do not see how this legislation will save UK businesses millions of pounds.&nbsp; It is a shame that there is no mention of the opportunities from tamper proof registers of personal data held by public bodies for security and durability.&nbsp; It may help SMBs that operate solely within the UK, but I doubt that it will help multinationals.&nbsp; These organizations have to deal with the plethora of privacy legislation around the world and this bill risks adding another to this burden.&nbsp; Much will depend upon whether the EU will recognize that compliance with the UK rules set out in this bill will satisfy GDPR in the context of Schrems II to allow personal data transfers and processing in the UK.</p>
<p>The mastermind behind Schrems II, privacy advocate <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5257/1">Max Schrems</a> will be speaking at the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2023 on Tuesday, May 9. You can get a ticket at Early Bird price until March 31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is one of an occasional series examining misconceptions that people have about personal data empowerment and personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Sometimes, when we talk to people about all the good things we’re doing, they shake their head and say, “But there is no demand for personal data stores!”. This is especially the case with policy makers and investors. We think they’re wrong and this blog explains&nbsp;why.</p> Latent versus&nbsp;actual <p>By definition, before something becomes mainstream — when it’s just starting out for example — at that point it is not mainstream, which means (again, by definition) that it hasn’t yet proved ‘there is demand for it’. The big question, of course, is why hasn’t this great idea gone mainstream yet? Because it’s on the way but not there yet? Or because it never&nbsp;will?</p><p>Whenever there is a need or opportunity that hasn’t been met yet there is latent demand for something that will meet this need&nbsp;… as opposed to expressed demand that’s clear for all to see, because many people are already using the service in question. Expressed demand is easy to see. Latent demand&nbsp;isn’t.</p><p>Take the motor car. It was around for decades before it went mainstream — so much so that many people went on record to say ‘it will never take off’. Then it did, after Henry Ford made cars much cheaper to buy and easier to&nbsp;run.</p><p>Or online search. Before Google came along, would you have answered a definite Yes to the question ‘is there demand for online search?’. For quite some time there was very little evidence of demand, mainly because available solutions were clunky, fragmented, difficult to access, and so on. Then Google came along and soon billions of people were doing online search as part of their daily&nbsp;routine.</p><p>It’s only when some pioneer makes it simple, easy and cheap that latent demand turns into actual demand, and that’s where we think our society is at with personal data stores: the big difference being between ‘what is’ and ‘what could be’. For example, if you think that managing your personal data is always going to be incredibly difficult and complicated, you might conclude that nobody wants to bother, and therefore there won’t be any demand for services like personal data stores that help them. But this is nonsense, as we <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/do-people-really-want-to-manage-their-data-bac784b98be1">show in this&nbsp;blog</a>.</p><p>There is huge pent-up, latent demand for personal data stores because they make it simple, easy and cheap (e.g. free) for people to access and use their data to improve their lives. The more we able to help them do this, the more latent demand will turn into expressed demand, on a huge scale. Like online search. Like motor&nbsp;cars.</p> Demand for&nbsp;what? <p>In many conversations about personal data, people get confused about what need or opportunity is actually being met. For example, if you frame the issue of demand in abstract terms of ‘demand for privacy protection’ or ‘demand for control’ you risk missing the&nbsp;point.</p><p>Demand for ‘privacy’ or ‘control’ for its own sake is different to demand for tools and services that help people and organisations do more with data at less cost. That’s what Mydex is focused on: unleashing pent-up, latent demand from two directions: helping citizens gather, store, manage, share and use the data they need to manage their lives better, and helping service providers cut their costs of collecting and using the data they need to provide better services more efficiently.</p><p>When you look at the size of the economic opportunities that personal data stores open up — for breakthrough personal and organisational gains in productivity, service quality, innovation, and so on — the scale of potential demand for personal data stores is breathtakingly large.</p><p>But, as we show in our White Paper on the Surprising Economics of Personal Data, for many years these opportunities have been ‘<a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/">hidden in plain sight</a>’ — not seen, not because the demand doesn’t exist, but because people have been looking for it in the wrong&nbsp;places.</p> Chicken and egg&nbsp;problems <p>There are however, some powerful reasons why latent demand hasn’t yet turned into actual demand. These relate to chicken-and-egg barriers that block progress.</p><p>The first such chicken-and-egg barrier revolves around the value that can be generated by data sharing. The only reason for individuals or organisations to share data is if it can be used to add value in some way. But if services capable of adding this value don’t yet exist, there is no point in sharing data. And if data isn’t being shared, then it’s almost impossible for such services to grow and flourish. As we said, chicken and&nbsp;egg.</p><p>The second chicken-and-egg problem relates to the first. Actually going through the process of data sharing can be technically difficult. You need to define what data is to be shared, find safe mechanisms to send, receive it and to store it. And so on, all of which can end up being hard work. The harder it is, the less benefit there is in it, the less point there is in investing time and effort making it easier. Chicken and egg&nbsp;again.</p><p>Such chicken-and-egg barriers represent a real challenge that Mydex is working hard to crack. This is especially the case in our work on ‘clusters’, where there is good reason for a group of organisations and their customers to cooperate in data sharing to cut out FERC (friction, effort, risk and cost) and deliver better outcomes.</p><p>The more we do this work, the more the benefits of using personal data stores to facilitate data sharing become obvious, and the easier it becomes to do so. In this way we are slowly but surely lifting these chicken/egg logjams, turning latent into actual&nbsp;demand.</p> How to measure&nbsp;demand? <p>Another reason why people struggle to see the demand for personal data stores is that they measure ‘demand’ in the wrong way. A common assumption amongst many is that ‘demand’ for something is proven when a ‘market’ emerges where lots of people pay lots of money for&nbsp;it.</p><p>But in the case of personal data stores, PDSs are free to citizens and no ‘market’ for data is being created. The economics of personal data stores don’t work by turning data into a commodity that is bought and sold like potatoes. The economic benefits of PDSs are unleashed when data is shared (not sold or rented) via a process (not a product) within a relationship (not a marketplace) to reduce friction, effort, risk and cost (where no actual money changes&nbsp;hands).</p><p>So if you think the only way to measure demand is by the amount of money that changes hands in a market, you will never see any ‘demand’ for personal data stores, even as they completely transform the workings of the entire&nbsp;economy!</p> Conclusion <p>At what point does an ostensible statement of fact become a disguise for something else — a statement of&nbsp;intent?</p><p>It is very easy to turn the statement ‘there is no demand for personal data stores’ into a self-fulfilling prophecy: “If there isn’t any demand for them, why bother doing anything to make them happen?”. That is how some people use this meme. Because of their own vested interests, the last thing they want to see is demand for PDSs taking off. So, given the opportunity, they talk it down. “Ah!”, they say, “it will never happen, so don’t bother trying!”.</p><p>For us, the demand question is easy to answer. Just ask yourself: generally speaking, do people and organisations want to spend more or less time doing day-to-day chores? Do they want services to be poor quality, expensive and hard to access or high quality, cheap and easy to access? If, generally speaking, people want things to be better and cheaper, there is demand for personal data stores, because that’s what they&nbsp;enable.</p><p>But there’s also an element of truth in the pushback too. Currently, demand for PDSs is low because of those chicken-and-egg logjams we’ve just discussed.</p><p>The work we’re doing now is designed to lift these logjams: demonstrating how PDSs can solve systemic running sores that are causing immense problems for citizens while holding the economy back. The more we do so, the more we can see ‘demand’ grow; the more we see the latent becoming the&nbsp;actual.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/is-there-any-demand-for-personal-data-stores-80b9e57adb0a">Is there any demand for personal data stores?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  The FATF Travel Rule is a set of virtual asset-related recommendations by the Financial Action Task Force, first published in&nbsp;2019.  The 39-member Financial Action Task Force sets global standards to stop the movement of illicit&nbsp;funds.  The threshold amount at which the FATF Travel Rule kicks can vary between jurisdictions, depending on the specific requirements set by the member&nbsp;states.  <p>Financial institutions and authorities worldwide are keen to combat the menace of illicit funds. However, the emergence of cryptocurrencies made them rethink their approach, as this new means of digital payments enabled everyone to send funds without disclosing their identities.</p><p>Although the intention behind the privacy-oriented feature of cryptocurrencies was good at large, the hoard of malicious actors saw it as a sure-shot way to launder their ill-gotten funds without being detected. However, their excitement was rather short-lived.</p><p>Having sensed the risks beforehand, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) laid out KYC/AML recommendations for crypto transactions in June 2019. And although only a few countries, so far, have enforced the Crypto Travel Rule, it’s only a matter of time before that&nbsp;changes.</p><p>Are you wondering what exactly the FATF Travel Rule is? We got you covered, as in this article, we provide in-depth answers to the most googled questions on FATF Travel Rule. Let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Q1: What is the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>The FATF Travel rule is a crucial crypto AML/CFT measure aimed at empowering Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with a robust mechanism for efficient sanction screening and suspicion crypto transaction detection.</p><p>It requires VASPs to obtain, hold, and transmit required originator and beneficiary information immediately and securely whenever virtual asset transfers are conducted.</p><p>FATF stands for the Financial Action Task Force, a 39-member body that sets international standards to ensure effective crackdowns on illicit funds for national authorities. These illicit funds may generate from drug trafficking, illegal arms trade, cyber fraud, and similar&nbsp;crimes.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">What is KYC in Crypto, and Why do Crypto Exchanges Require&nbsp;it?</a></p> Q2: Who Does the FATF Travel Rule Apply&nbsp;to? <p>The FATF Travel Rule applies to both Virtual Assets and VASPs. According to the FATF, Virtual Assets are “digital representations of value that can be digitally traded or transferred and can be used for payment or investment purposes.”</p><p>However, the definition does not include digital representations of fiat Currencies, securities, and other financial assets.</p><p>VASPS can be any business entity or an individual engaged in any sort of crypto-related business activity, be it a crypto exchange, crypto lending platform operator, crypto custody service provider, or&nbsp;more.</p> Q3: What Does the FATF Travel Rule Refer to for Cryptocurrency? <p>The FATF has been monitoring the virtual asset ecosystem for a while to manage and mitigate risks that emerge from virtual assets. However, the FATF demands cooperation from individual countries, as it holds them responsible for ensuring strict AML/CFT-related compliance among Virtual Asset Service Providers operating within its&nbsp;borders.</p><p>FATF has set its recommendations with appropriate compliance measures in it. And it wants the licensing and registration of VASPs to happen within the boundaries of these monitoring systems.</p><p>By Virtual Asset, <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Virtualassets/Virtual-assets.html#:~:text=The%20term%20'virtual%20asset'%20refers,safeguards%20as%20the%20financial%20sector.">the FATF implies</a> a digital representation of value that is possible to digitally trade or transfer. These assets may also qualify for payment or investment purposes. However, Virtual Assets, as the FATF defines them, do not include digital representations of fiat currencies, securities, and other financial assets already covered in the FATF recommendations.</p> Q4: Can FATF Impose Sanctions Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>Yes, FATF can impose sanctions under the Travel Rule. However, only those competent authorities that meet the requirements set by the FATF can impose sanctions and not self-regulatory bodies. However, competent supervisory or monitoring bodies must first conduct risk-based supervision before imposing sanctions.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML and KYC Compliance in Crypto&nbsp;Industry</a></p> Q5: What are Crypto Travel Rule Requirements? <p>The foremost requirement under the Crypto Travel Rule is that the VASPs must screen, record, and communicate the originator’s and beneficiary’s information for transactions exceeding a certain amount as agreed upon by the FATF member states. However, the amount can&nbsp;vary.</p><p>For instance, in the United States, the threshold is US$3,000. Once the transaction crosses this threshold, the Originator VASP has to send personally identifiable information (PII) to the Beneficiary VASP and vice&nbsp;versa.</p> Q6: How does Crypto Travel Rule Compliance Work? <p>To comply with the Crypto Travel Rule, both Originator and Beneficiary VASPs must exchange the originator and beneficiary information for every virtual asset transaction. The originator refers to the user sending the crypto, and the beneficiary refers to the user receiving the&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>The Originator VASP must share the originator’s name, wallet address, and physical address (National Identity Number, Customer Identification Number, date, and place of birth) with the Beneficiary VASP.</p><p>The Beneficiary VASP, too, must share similar information about the beneficiary, such as the beneficiary’s name, wallet address, and physical address or national identification number with the Originator VASP.</p> Final Note <p>Although the FATF Travel Rule does not cite any particular Travel Rule Solution or promote any specific method to exchange user data, VASPs must opt for a way that enables them to comply with minimal impact on user experience and privacy. And the only way to do so is to choose an automated Travel Rule Solution that does not store the data on third-party servers or its&nbsp;own.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope checks both boxes, as it enables VASPs to exchange user data among themselves in a peer-to-peer mode and comply with the FATF Travel Rule frictionlessly. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Click here</a> to know all about the Shyft Veriscope.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				  Digital identity can be difficult for organizations to get right. Recently, Indicio hosted a Meetup with academic and digital identity expert Phil Windley, author of the recently published “Learning Digital Identity,” to talk about the basics of digital identity and some of the pitfalls companies and individuals can run into.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>One of the leading thinkers in digital identity, <a href="http://phil.windley.org/">Phil Windley</a> brings a wealth of experience in industry and academia, and is the co-founder and organizer of the Internet Identity Workshop, one of the world’s most influential and long-lived identity conferences.</p>
<p>While his new book, “<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-digital-identity/9781098117689/">Learning Digital Identity,</a>” is mostly geared toward a business and technical audience, it is replete with important insights for how we all should think about digital identity, namely:</p>
<p>1) Everything we currently experience with digital identity is so much worse than it has to be: it’s less convenient than it could be and it’s less secure — and often the security involved requires tedious repetition.</p>
<p>2) At the same time, creating better digital identity is a lot harder than it looks. As Windley notes, people are constantly popping up with the “answer” — usually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">universal identifier</a> tied to a biometric — which just ties a digital signature to a physical body. This is bad: “Universal identifiers are a 20th century tech that we have no business bringing into the 21st,” he says, “there are just too many privacy and other issues with them.”</p>
<p>3) We shouldn’t just “leave it to the experts.” There’s complexity and nuance in how digital identity is accomplished; if something is representing you, you should know on some level how it works.</p>
<p>When getting into the more technical topics, Windley breaks governance&nbsp; — basically the rules that dictate how an identity system works — down further into two categories, confidence, and trust.</p>
<p>The difference between trust and confidence</p>
<p>Windley describes trust as a place where we are vulnerable, we’ve put ourselves at risk, we’re depending on the actions of someone else for the right outcome to occur. For example, looking at someone’s ID as they pass a checkpoint is to trust that the papers are genuine and contain correct information, and have been issued by the appropriate authorities using established identity assurance procedures.</p>
<p>Confidence on the other hand is knowing (or having a high degree of certainty) that something will happen. Within digital identity, cryptography should be understood as confidence. It</p>
<p>can tell us that a digital credential was issued to the person presenting it and has not been revoked or tampered with.</p>
<p>Cryptographic confidence can’t tell us whether or not the entity issuing the credential is&nbsp; trustworthy or whether the attributes the credential&nbsp; contains have anything to do with the individual presenting it. These factors require human governance to ensure trust.</p>
<p>In other words, effective digital identity depends on combining&nbsp; trust and confidence and this requires appropriate governance. What constitutes appropriate governance? There cannot be a one-size fits all framework for digital identity given the multiplicity of use cases, jurisdictions, and competing needs from different governance authorities. The governance required for a grocery store loyalty program will require fewer rules than the governance necessary for large financial transactions.</p>
<p>Governance is an intense topic of community discussion and Indicio is currently contributing to the creation of a specification for <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Ecosystem Governance</a> (DEGov) at the Decentralized Identity Foundation. DEGov is a way to manage trusted issuers of digital identity credentials and complex information flows across differing ecosystems and jurisdictions through easy-to-implement machine-readable governance files.</p>
<p>If you want to hear more on this topic from Phil Windleywe highly recommend the recent Indicio <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5c6QjM2vOA">Meetup Recording</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about DEGov you can see how it works, and view a demo of the Indicio solution, the <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">Governance Editor</a>.</p>

<p>There is a consensus across industry and governments that organizations should start planning how they will maintain security of IT systems and data given likely advances in quantum computing.&nbsp; Going forward, our cryptographic estates are likely to be less stable, requiring more regular algorithm updates (see <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/10/the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-crypto/">The end of the Golden Age of crypto? | Entrust Blog</a>).</p>
<p>One piece of advice that is regularly proposed is to improve <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4019118">cryptographic agility</a>. This is smart advice, recognizing that becoming “post-quantum safe” is a multi-faceted and ongoing activity involving people, processes, and technology. I would argue that even without the post-quantum (PQ) threat to classic cryptography, robust, holistic, and efficient cryptographic agility reduces risk.</p>
<p>What is cryptographic agility, and how do you know if you have it? <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7696">RFC 7696</a> talks about cryptographic algorithm agility, and it offers sound guidance at a software development level.&nbsp; I feel that this is insufficient to understand the “macro” cryptographic agility of an organization, such as the risk assessments, security controls, retraining, software supply chain, and so on. What if I want to understand how cryptographically agile my organization is? When thinking about this, consider the opposite situation. What attributes would hinder an organization’s cryptographic agility? Examples could include the following:</p>
 
 Not having a central Policy Management Authority responsible for establishing clear policies and procedures on how and where cryptography should be used. 
 No clearly defined accountability of compliance to corporate cryptographic standards across business units. 
 Limited or no inventory of meta data for sensitive business information assets. 
 Limited or no inventory of cryptographic assets and artifacts (crypto libraries, keys, secrets, etc). 
 Lack of resources/staff with knowledge of how cryptography is used to manage risk, and how to adhere to policies and controls. 
 Supplier contracts with no provisions for cryptographic standards or agility. 
 Having a wide range of cryptographic libraries, keys, and key management systems deployed across your organization with no centralized visibility or reporting capability. 
 Performing all cryptographic management manually, without automated management of cryptographic assets. 
 
<p>Many of these points relate to governance. No one can comply to a policy that does not exist, and a cross-organizational policy must be defined by a suitable body. So, step 1 to becoming cryptographically agile is to establish an accountable Policy Management Authority with appropriate terms of reference. This would typically be a cross-business and multi-skilled body that already meets regularly, is suitably empowered, and includes a remit for a longer-term roadmap against emerging threats. Indeed the first action on U.S. federal government departments from Presidential Memorandum M-23-02 (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M-23-02-M-Memo-on-Migrating-to-Post-Quantum-Cryptography.pdf">Migrating to Post-Quantum Cryptography</a>) was to “designate a cryptographic inventory and migration lead for their organization.”</p>
<p>How is cryptographic policy implemented and audited? Cryptography is often embedded into IT systems, applications, network equipment, device chipsets etc., across functions, with budgets often delegated to lines of business. Should a centralized cryptography team become accountable across this estate? How are budgets for cryptography refreshes managed? Having clear accountability, responsibility, and audits of compliance is essential to cryptographic agility.</p>
<p>Once you have appropriate governance, you can examine your estate. What data is protected with encryption? Where is it? For how long must it be stored securely? You need to understand what types of data you are protecting. You also need to itemize your current cryptographic estate and maintain up-to-date software and hardware for all critical systems. What algorithms and libraries are you using, and do these comply with your policies? You can only manage what you have visibility of, so technology to discover cryptographic assets could be helpful here but is not the sole remedy. Because of unscannable cryptographic assets, manual capture of changes must also be encompassed.</p>
<p>Policies are implemented by people, so you need trained staff. Developers should be embedding cryptographic agility for in-house applications and services. Senior executives should be aware of the PQ cryptography risk, which should be on the emerging risk register, and multi-year budgeting for the wholesale changes in the landscape should be assigned now. This will ensure the risk is managed appropriately as a cross-organizational change management program. Having stakeholders trained at the appropriate level is essential to organizational cryptographic agility.</p>
<p>Legal and procurement teams need to understand the impact on contracts with customers and suppliers. It is likely that cryptographic agility will become a contractual obligation as, for example, applications are outsourced to cloud providers. Is your payroll supplier currently monitoring the PQ threat? Does your PKI vendor have a PQ roadmap?</p>
<p>Agility is hindered by complexity, but you can act now to make the PQ migration journey easier. For instance, if you centralize, simplify, and consolidate disparate PKI, key management (such as KMIP servers) and code signing systems/services, it will greatly aid the implementation and testing of the new algorithms, associated firmware etc. as well as audit and accreditation. This must flow from a central policy, to reverse the proliferation of disparate cryptographic systems and libraries that will cripple agility.</p>
<p>Cryptographic agility will be enhanced through automation. Automating the update of keys and certificates will increase efficiency and reduce cost of maintaining appropriate security controls.&nbsp; Wherever possible, centralized key and certificate management systems should push key and certificate updates to target systems. This will also reduce ongoing operational costs and reduce manual errors, which therefore should have a positive impact on system availability as well as security posture.</p>
<p>Cryptographic agility will be critical as organizations manage risk by maintaining security of IT systems over the next decade and beyond. Entrust recommends that assessing your current organizational cryptographic agility, holistically, would be a great starting point with regard to the PQ risk so you understand the scale of your changes and how you can improve your current cryptographic agility posture. These are the key measures that we deliver through our Post-Quantum Cryptography Readiness Assessment. Once you have a baseline of your current state, you can define a roadmap to modernize your cryptographic estate and continuously improve your cryptographic agility to effectively manage risk into the future.&nbsp; Your migration to post-quantum cryptography can be managed as a change and not a crisis.</p>

<p>SelfKey DAO:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revolutionizing Web3 Interactions</p>
 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>The rise of technology has made a great impact all around the world. It changed the way we communicate, work, and study. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), most of our daily tasks are made considerably easier, and access to information has never been more effortless. However, in order to benefit from all the wonders of AI, we have to become part of its world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of our private information had to evolve from physical papers to digital identities, which are stored in centralized systems. But while traditional, centralized systems are convenient, they put our private data in danger due to their weak security measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, solutions are being developed to change the way we authenticate ourselves online and the way we perform individuality-based activities on Web3. Technology can help protect our private information, just as much as it can be used to compromise it. The key is to remember that we can use AI for our benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will thoroughly elaborate on DAOs, SelfKey’s DAO (including specific terms like KEY, SELF, and NFTs), and how user engagement in the DAO will be beneficial for individuals in the long run.</p>

For instance social media, messaging apps, online forums, and video conferencing. The web has opened up endless opportunities for people to share information, ideas, and experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as with any aspect of human behavior, there are also challenges and risks associated with operating in the online world. One of the biggest concerns is the safety of our personal data.&nbsp;</p>
 The risks we take when performing individuality-based activities online 
<p>When we engage in individuality-based activities online that involve sharing personal information, we expose ourselves to a variety of potential risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, personal information shared online can be accessed either by AI or human identity thieves, putting our privacy and security at risk. Even seemingly small details such as our names, birthdates, or email addresses can be used to compromise our security. This can lead to AI attempting to create fake identities using our leaked personal data.&nbsp;</p>
 What can we do to avoid those risks? 
<p>Being cautious about what we share online and keeping our privacy safe is very important. However, it is equally important to make sure that the individuals we engage with are not fake, AI-generated entities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols within a DAO can be the most secure means of verifying that individuals are genuine, real persons. Not only that, but within a DAO, there is no single entity to govern and control our personal data. What a DAO strives to achieve is equality and fairness among its users, as well as maintain the security of their individuality.</p>
 DAOs vs centralized systems 
 A brief description of DAO&nbsp; 
<p>A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a type of organization that usually operates using blockchain technology. This facilitates decentralized decision-making and transparent governance without the need for a centralized authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAOs are typically run by a group of individuals who hold tokens or cryptocurrency. Individuals can also vote on decisions related to the organization's operations. For instance: funding proposals or changes to the organization's rules.&nbsp;</p>
 How DAOs are revolutionizing individuality-based operations 
<p>DAOs&nbsp; are changing the way individuals operate by innovating the concept of decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In traditional organizations, individuals cannot materialize their ideas or concerns, due to the centralized systems based on hierarchies. DAOs, on the other hand, allow members to participate in decision-making processes and contribute to the organization's goals through decentralized governance mechanisms.</p>
<p>By using blockchain technology, DAOs enable trustless collaboration and eliminate the need for intermediaries. This method makes it easier for members to join and participate in collective decision-making. Additionally, it creates a more inclusive and democratic environment where each member can have an equal say and contribute to the organization's success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, DAOs are empowering individuals to come together, build communities, and work towards common goals, without sacrificing their individuality or autonomy.&nbsp;</p>
 DAOs and individuals 
 DAOs suffer from lack of user participation 
<p>Despite their potential benefits, DAOs can suffer from a lack of user participation. Because DAOs rely on decentralized decision-making, they require active participation from members to ensure that decisions are made in a timely and effective manner.</p>
 How will user participation help DAOs “stay alive” 
<p>User participation is critical to the success and sustainability of DAOs. Without active participation from members, DAOs may struggle to make decisions, coordinate actions, and achieve their goals. Moreover, low participation can lead to apathy or disengagement. In turn, this can weaken the community and reduce the value of the DAO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, active user participation can help DAOs stay alive by:</p>
 
 Promoting engagement. 
 Building a strong community. 
 Ensuring that decisions are made in a timely and effective manner. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, user participation is essential for DAOs to remain viable and achieve their goals over the long term.</p>
 The benefits of participating in DAOs 
<p>Participating in DAOs offers numerous advantages for individuals looking to collaborate and contribute to a community-driven effort. It provides opportunities for innovation and community building while offering financial incentives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the benefits include:</p>
 
 Democratic decision-making 
 Rewards 
 Increased security 
 Unique contributions 
 Transparency 
 
 SelfKey’s DAO 
<p>After explaining the general concept of DAOs, let's examine SelfKey’s DAO objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuality is a vital aspect that the SelfKey DAO is focused on. In SelfKey’s Protocol, every member’s uniqueness is valued in order to help protect their digital identity from theft and forgery. We aim to create a safe environment with the help of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a>, where valued members can operate using trustless and secure methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selkey’s DAO aims to provide secure and private digital identity solutions. With strong credentials in cryptography and blockchain technology, Selkey’s DAO’s goals include protecting users' privacy and giving them control over their data. Credentials are lacking in the crypto industry, and they’re a need in order to keep users’ information safe from being doxxed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, SelfKey’s goal is to develop a method for individuals to engage with one another in a decentralized, trustless environment, while their private data and individuality remain safe and secure.</p>
 Important Terminology in SelfKey’s DAO 
 What is KEY? 
<p>The KEY <a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-a-utility-token/">utility token</a> is the centerpiece of the SelfKey Protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has several uses, such as:</p>
 
 Being a means of payment for services within the SelfKey Protocol. 
 Being used to stake credentials on. 
 Being utilized to govern and empower members of the SelfKey DAO. 
 Providing the necessary tools for users to take control of their digital identity and secure their privacy. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As more individuals join the SelfKey Protocol, the potential uses of KEY will only continue to expand, further cementing its importance as a vital component of the decentralized digital identity revolution.</p>
 What is SELF? 
<p>While KEY remains the vital utility token to stake on credentials, SelfKey has proposed SELF tokens in order to help an individual keep track of what they have staked and for what period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of SELF’s attributes:</p>
 
 SELF tokens can be minted by individuals who properly staked on a real identity. 
 Essentially, SELF can be used as a sort of measurement of reputation. 
 SELF tokens have utility as a reputation signal - they should strengthen legitimate credentials and they may help weed out illegitimate credentials. 
 They are issued by users themselves. 
 They do not have any intrinsic value. 
 SELF tokens may also have utility as a governance mechanism. Those who use, accrue reputation, or are acting as a sort of “identity mining” to secure the platform will receive governance influence. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as the user will stake on a credential which is valid, the user will accumulate reputation to said credential in the form of tokens.</p>
 SelfKey’s NFTs 
<p>At SelfKey, active members have the opportunity to earn NFTs by participating in the community and contributing to the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the unique features of SelfKey's NFTs is that they are highly customizable. This means that individuals can tailor their NFTs to their specific needs and preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey places a great emphasis on individuality, recognizing that each person has their own unique identity and set of circumstances. It is a platform that truly values individuality, and is dedicated to helping people take control of their own identity and data. This is reflected in the customizability of its tokens and the overall design of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
 How to participate in the SelfKey DAO 
<p>Participating in the SelfKey DAO and earning tokens offers many benefits, such as:</p>
 
 The ability to have a say in the project's direction. 
 Voting rights on proposals. 
 Access to exclusive community events. 
 The opportunity to earn rewards through active participation in the DAO. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SelfKey DAO provides a platform for community members to be more engaged and invested in the success of the SelfKey Protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how to do it:</p>
 
 First, a user must perform a KYC check in order to properly authenticate themselves as a real person and the person whom they claim to be. Afterwards, they will join the DAO. 
 The user will then be able to stake KEY tokens on their KYC credentials. Afterwards, they will be able to start accumulating SELF tokens. 
 SELF tokens can be used to purchase NFT packs with particular customizations. 
 Alternatively, the user can mint their SELF tokens and use them for whatever purpose they find useful and fit. 
 Finally, users can contribute to the SelfKey DAO by performing tasks based on grants issued by the ecosystem. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, active participation and engagement in the SelfKey DAO can bring significant benefits to the SelfKey Protocol and its members. By being actively involved in the decision-making process, members can help shape the direction of the project, making sure that it aligns with their interests and needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, engagement can help build a stronger sense of community among SelfKey users, fostering a supportive environment for learning and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, a thriving SelfKey DAO requires active participation from its members, and those who are willing to engage will reap the benefits of a more robust and inclusive ecosystem.</p>
 Conclusions:&nbsp; 
<p>Unfortunately, most people still rely on centralized systems. However, efforts are being made to empower them to take charge of their personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SelfKey DAO aims to assist individuals in gaining full control of their private data, enabling them to safely engage in Web3 transactions based on their individuality. Despite being a small ecosystem at present, it is secure and has the potential to reach new heights with the help of user participation and engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the SelfKey DAO develops, users will derive more benefits from it. Ultimately, it is user contribution that will enable SelfKey to achieve its long-term goals.</p>

<p>Tokenization in the financial card space is not new. Generally speaking, the technology was first applied to electronic payments in the late 1990s. However, trends in e-commerce and data privacy, along with the relentless evolution of hacking methodologies and technologies, are moving tokenization into the retail and banking spotlight. Also, EMVCo — the global technical body that facilitates worldwide interoperability of secure payment transactions by developing and publishing EMV® standards — has leaned heavily into tokenization in the last several years because the technology “limits potential risk from payment data compromise” and “promotes the development of new payment technology and scenarios where the risk of using a PAN would be deemed too high.”</p>
<p>So while it is not a new technology, sophisticated new strategies for improving fraud prevention, enriching user experiences, and streamlining compliance are evolving today and leading to a surge in demand for cloud-based tokenization technologies and services. In fact, what was a $3.4B (USD) market in 2021 is projected to reach $8.6B worldwide by 2027 for a CAGR of more than 21%.</p>
<p>Enabling global growth in e-commerce</p>
<p>Before COVID-19, global e-commerce accounted for 15% of total retail sales. But limitations on in-store shopping during the pandemic prompted more consumers to engage in online and mobile shopping. Today, e-commerce now drives more than 22% of retail sales worldwide. Leading financial organizations, such as Morgan Stanley, predict that the $3.3T (USD) in global e-commerce could easily reach $5.4T by the end of 2026.</p>
<p>Almost every card transaction that occurs in a payments ecosystem is enabled by the same digital elements: a primary account number (PAN), an expiration date, and a CVV2 security code. Of course, that data is targeted by cybercriminals who, unfortunately, tend to have more money and larger teams of coders than the organizations trying to fend them off. The attacks are so relentless that retailers and others selling products and services online must carefully consider every transaction. Even if PANs and CVV2 codes are encrypted, they’re vulnerable.</p>
<p>This is one of the realities driving growth and innovation in tokenization. By replacing a cardholder’s PAN with a one-time unique identifier, the information is rendered useless to a hacker. Retailers — or other online product and service providers — retain a token that represents the sensitive data. Every time a transaction is initiated, that representative token is used to verify the account. Even in the event of a lost or expired card being replaced, most issuers use lifecycle management systems that automatically update tokens when a new card is issued.</p>
<p>All of this helps create highly personalized payment experiences by enabling consumers to save their payment preferences for future transactions. Also, it’s important to note that every merchant will use a different token when storing a consumer’s credit card information. So, there’s no risk of a widespread information leak that would require consumers to cancel their cards completely. The same principle applies to mobile wallets. When credit card data is saved in a digital wallet, the PAN is replaced with a token that’s shared with the issuing bank. If a phone is lost or stolen, there’s no payment data stored on the device and the token that is stored is useless to any unauthorized users. This means that no card details are jeopardized if a smartphone is lost and stolen, as real payment data isn’t held by the device. These capabilities also give consumers the ability to manage their digitized cards on a per-merchant or per-device basis.</p>
<p>Tokenization is also popular with retailers, such as Amazon or Best Buy, who want to create exceptional in-app user experiences. This year, many experts predict that no less than 10% of all retail sales will be conducted through mobile apps. So, it’s important to bring both security and exceptional user experiences to branded apps.</p>
<p>How is tokenization different than encryption? </p>
<p>We hear this question frequently and it’s important to note some clear distinctions. Encryption protects data through the use of a mathematical cipher. This renders the data unintelligible to those who do not have access to securely managed keys. All of the data elements — such as financial card information and transaction details — are transmitted. If hackers successfully intercept encrypted transmissions, they have the data. But they can only read that data if they have also stolen the right keys. (In the future, they could also use quantum computing to break the encryption).</p>
<p>Tokenization doesn’t obfuscate data; it removes it from the interaction entirely. It replaces sensitive data with a token that represents the financial card data. If it’s stolen, it’s worthless to a hacker. The real data is stored in a digital vault and can only be retrieved when the correct token is presented. This makes common hacking attempts, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, ineffective. In the case of mobile or online payments, this protects the consumer’s financial information and greatly simplifies PCI DSS compliance.</p>
<p>Aligned with the age of exceptional UX</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why tokenization is becoming a global standard for online and mobile payments. For merchants and issuers, there is a strong financial return on investing in tokenization. For example, Visa reported in 2022 that card transaction fraud has declined by 28% because of tokenization and that transaction approval rates increased by about 3%. The decrease in false negatives is a massive financial and brand experience win for both merchants and issuers. Tokenization is a boon for consumers, as well. The technology is proven to provide the best protection for their financial card data — and it allows them to develop safe and familiar relationships with the merchants they prefer. It helps enable seamless shopping experiences.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it seems the world will move to a place where every card-not-present will be tokenized and sensitive card data will not be at risk. Until then, it’s important for more issuers and merchants to understand the value of tokenization and for the remaining non-adopters to put systems in place. In the meantime, leading providers like Entrust will continue to evolve the technology and make it increasingly more intuitive, more intelligent, and easier to implement.</p>

<p>It’s with great pride that we announce our colleague Mike Ounsworth has been named an award finalist in the Microsoft Security Excellence Awards 2023 in the category of Security Changemaker.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the fourth year Microsoft is recognizing partners for their outstanding work in the security landscape. All finalists are members of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/misapartnercatalog">Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA),</a> an ecosystem of independent software vendors and managed security service providers that have integrated their security products and services with Microsoft’s security technology. Entrust has been a member of MISA since its inception.</p>
<p>Mike was nominated in the category of Security Changemaker for his leading role in creating the post-quantum cryptography standards that are the future of data protection. The migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is an industry-wide challenge and Mike’s leadership, collaboration and contributions to the research and development of standards, which will help the industry meet this challenge head on.</p>
<p>Entrust provides a variety of cryptographic mechanisms to support a range of Post Quantum Cryptography migration strategies because we recognize different environments may require different approaches for a successful migration. With strong support from Entrust’s Research and Development team, Mike is pushing for the development of multiple forms of Post Quantum and traditional hybrid techniques to enhance security and migration flexibility. In partnership with leaders in the IETF and academic crypto communities, he has worked to integrate PQC into IETF Internet Protocols with a specific focus on X.509 PKI infrastructure.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — March 6th to March&nbsp;12th <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! This week, we have covered the debate on crypto regulations in the US House of Representatives, India enforcing KYC/AML requirements to crypto businesses, and the UK’s FCA Chair calls stringent crypto regulations a must to prevent money laundering risks.</p><p>We would also like to reiterate that while it is important to establish regulations that promote investor protection and combat illicit activities, it is equally important to ensure that they are balanced with users’ privacy and experience. By doing so, regulators can help to create an environment that fosters innovation, adoption, and responsible use of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Let’s dive straight into the recap&nbsp;now!</p> US House of Representatives Continue to Discuss Crypto Regulations <p>During the first hearing of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion, titled “Coincidence or Coordinated,” several Republicans criticized the Biden administration and the Security and Exchange Commission’s approach to regulating crypto&nbsp;space.</p>(<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/House-of-Representatives-United-States-government">Image Source</a>)<p>They highlighted the need for comprehensive legislation. And according to the subcommittee chairman French Hill, R-Ark, enforcement actions or regulatory guidance, no matter how extensive they are, can never be a substitute for “the unique role of Congress to legislate.”</p><p>The White House published a framework for managing digital assets in the U.S. in September, followed by an executive order issued by President Joe Biden in March&nbsp;2022.</p> India Applies AML Provisions to Crypto Transactions <p>According to a notification issued by the Indian Finance Ministry on March 7th, local crypto exchanges and entities that deal with Virtual Digital Assets or VDAs will have to conduct KYC due diligence on their&nbsp;users.</p>(<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cUmPg-oIWNXRZXt7-p3Da137OED3Q4Gq51KcB5QGT04/edit?usp=sharing">Image Source</a>)<p>Entities reporting under this law would be required to maintain a record of all transactions of more than US$12,200 for at least five&nbsp;years.</p><p>Local industry stakeholders believe that amidst the concerns about a possible ban on virtual assets, such inclusion of crypto transactions under the AML provisions has legitimized the industry.</p> UK FCA Chair Believes Crypto Regulations Need to be Appropriately Tough <p>The United Kingdom’s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), is “midway through a quite ambitious reset” with the Financial Services and Markets Bill going through the Parliament, said FCA chair Ashley&nbsp;Alder.</p>(<a href="https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/governance/organisation/7855611/fca-to-expand-uk-footprint-as-part-of-new-strategy">Image Source</a>)<p>While addressing the perception of whether “speculative crypto is gambling” and “it should be regulated and taxed as such,” Alder said that the financial regulation in this area needs to be appropriately tough.</p><p>On the other hand, when asked whether these regulations would “undeservedly” legitimize crypto, Alder said that he believed issues like money laundering could not be tackled without regulations.</p><p>He stressed that the Financial Services and Markets Act would give the FCA necessary regulatory powers over the crypto industry when&nbsp;passed.</p><p>The Australian Treasury is taking more time to understand the emerging innovations and risks better, while it does not deny the need for&nbsp;action.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/imf-develops-comprehensive-policy-framework-for-crypto-assets">IMF Develops Comprehensive Policy Framework for Crypto&nbsp;Assets</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/sygna-and-shyft-veriscope-partner-to-enhance-crypto-travel-rule-interoperability-and-compliance">Sygna and Shyft Veriscope Partner to Enhance Crypto Travel Rule Interoperability and Compliance</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Younger consumers – especially Gen Z – value the promise of simplified experiences that digital identities bring</p>
<p>The Future of Identity report from the Entrust Cybersecurity Institute explores global consumers’ attitudes toward three emerging identity topics: passwordless authentication, hybrid identities, and ownership over personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Across geographies, consumers are focused on their digital and hybrid identities, and the myriad ways new technologies shape our relationships to the world around us. However, when we took a closer look at our findings, we noticed key differences among generations. The youngest consumers we surveyed are digital natives aged 18, while the oldest are aged 75. Considering the vast differences in upbringing and cultural attitudes each generation has in relation to technology, these diverse (and at times, conflicting) opinions make sense.</p>
<p>Younger generations (especially Gen Z) value seamless, technology-driven identity credentials and solutions. They aren’t opposed to online identity verification to simplify a digital experience that requires it − in fact, they largely prioritize convenience above control. By contrast, older generations (especially baby boomers) desire traditional authentication experiences and physical identity credentials, citing security concerns with digital solutions as a main deterrent.</p>
<p>What follows is a deeper look at the survey findings as it relates to these generational differences. If you’re not up to speed on standard definitions of each generation, check out <a href="https://www.beresfordresearch.com/age-range-by-generation/">this</a> resource from Beresford Research before reading on.</p>
 1. Gen Z gravitates toward frictionless, passwordless login experiences 
<p>This familiarity with alternative authentication methods may explain why Gen Zers and millennials are the most likely to trust passwordless login methods. When we asked respondents which authentication methods they thought were more secure than passwords, younger generations were more likely to select multiple methods of authentication. For example, Gen Z respondents are twice as likely to believe “signing in through another account” (i.e., Google or Facebook) is more secure (19%) than baby boomers are (9%).</p>
<p>Despite differences among lower-ranked responses, all generations agree biometric-enabled authentication solutions are now the most secure login option. Gen Z was the only generation to perceive facial recognition as most secure, while baby boomers, Gen Xers, and millennials ranked fingerprint scans higher.</p>




Percentage of respondents who believe the following authentication methods are more secure than passwords





4- or 6-digit PIN codes
Facial recognition
Fingerprint scan
Signing in through another account
Device recognition
SMS one-time passcode
Passwords are the most secure


Gen Z
46%
51%
47%
19%
20%
30%
3%


Millennials   
43%
48%
55%
20%
20%
36%
4%


Gen X
41%
43%

12%
14%
36%
6%


Baby boomers
32%
40%
52%
9%
13%
33%
9%



<p>Younger generations not only view biometric-enabled authentication more favorably, they’re also more likely to take advantage of this authentication method compared to older generations. When given the option of biometrics or a password, 73% of Gen Z,&nbsp; 67% of millennials, and 54% of Gen X will use biometrics always or often, compared to just a third (32%) of baby boomers. Thirty-eight percent of baby boomers and 19% of Gen Xers will never use biometrics, compared to only 6% of Gen Zers and 9% of millennials.</p>
<p>We’re not surprised younger generations are more likely to trust alternative authentication methods and embrace biometrics compared to older generations. In addition to differences in upbringing, younger generations use a greater volume of <a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/how-to/digital-generations">digital apps and services</a> at a higher frequency than their older counterparts. With such a high rate of consumption, they’re after seamless login experiences and are more open to the emerging avenues that deliver on those expectations.</p>
 2. Younger generations are all-in on eIDs, while some older consumers hold out  
<p>Digital versions of physically issued identity credentials are <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/digital-identity-solutions-market-247527694.html">rapidly gaining traction</a>. They offer conveniences that resonate with younger generations’ preference for paperless, digital-first solutions.</p>
<p>Younger generations are much more likely to say they have an electronic ID (eID) — whether it be a driver’s license hosted on a mobile wallet or an ePassport booklet. Over half of Gen Z (56%) and millennials (55%) say they have an eID, compared to only 37% of Gen Xers and 12% of baby boomers. However, this difference may simply be due to a lack of awareness among older generations, considering a third (32%) of baby boomers say they’re unsure if they have an eID compared to only 19% of Gen Zers.</p>
<p>In addition to having a higher likelihood of possessing an eID, younger generations are also more likely to favor using eIDs and phasing out physical IDs completely compared to baby boomers.</p>




Percentage of respondents favorable toward the following stances:





Likelihood of using an eID
Support of phasing out physical IDs


Gen Z
82%
83%


Millennials
80%
77%


Gen X
67%
69%


Baby boomers
40%
44%



<p>When we asked respondents why they would be likely to use a digital ID, the most important reason for Gen Z and millennials was “it’s convenient,” while Gen X and baby boomers selected “it’s secure” as their No. 1 motivating factor. However, that’s not to say younger generations don’t value security as well. When we asked opponents of eIDs why they would not be likely to use them, Gen Z respondents’ top concern was that they worry the option is not secure or it would be easier to have their identity stolen.</p>
<p>Younger consumers employ apps and digital services for everything —&nbsp;from shopping for clothes to finding dog walkers to alerting them to water their plants — so why not their identities? Older generations, on the other hand, are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5649151/">more skeptical of and less comfortable</a> using digital technologies overall, so it makes sense they’re wary of allowing technology vendors to hold their most sensitive information.</p>
 3. Decentralized identities bridge opposing consumer preferences 
<p>In line with earlier findings, older generations tend to want more control over their personal data, while younger generations are more likely to accept sharing data as a necessary trade-off for convenient digital experiences.</p>
<p>While all respondents largely agreed with the statement “sharing personal information in exchange for access to goods, services, and applications is unavoidable. I have no choice but to allow access,” younger generations were more likely to strongly agree with the sentiment. Gen Z respondents were over twice as likely to strongly agree (30%) compared to baby boomers (12%).</p>
<p>Gen Zers are also more likely to believe they don’t own their identity information and credentials. When asked whether the issuer, data controller, or individual should own consumer identity information, Gen Z and millennials were nearly equally divided among the three groups. This stands in stark contrast to Gen X and baby boomer respondents, where half or more believed identity data should belong to the individual.</p>





Percentage of respondents who believe the following group should own identity information and citizen credentials:





The issuer
The data controller
The individual whose identity it is


Gen Z
35%
37%
28%


Millennials
32%
32%
35%


Gen X
25%
25%
50%


Baby boomers
11%
12%
76%



<p>This belief in a lack of ownership over personal data may be why younger generations are much more likely to feel comfortable with an organization they trust owning and storing an online digital identity for them if it simplifies their digital experiences. Two-thirds of Gen Zers, 61% of millennials, and half (51%) of Gen Xers said they would be in favor of this option, compared to just over a third (35%) of baby boomers.</p>
<p>Older generations largely covet ownership over their data, while younger generations are willing to relinquish control — if they get something in return.</p>
<p>At this junction of opposing views, decentralized identities offer a promising solution. While the technology, and global interoperability, is not yet fully realized, decentralized identities would allow individuals to store and manage access to their identities, using encryption and digital keys to confirm certain aspects of their &nbsp;identity without exposing unnecessary personally identifiable information to the receiver. Decentralized identities have the potential to address concerns over data ownership and control, while still enabling convenient, modern user experiences.</p>

<p>Data privacy is a contentious debate. Some users are fiercely protective over their data, while others welcome data sharing for convenient access to digital goods and services. Although older generations trend toward the former opinion and younger trend toward the latter, there will always be technology skeptics and proponents — especially when it comes to holding data that’s as sensitive as our personal identity information.</p>
<p>The bottom line? Our identities do live online. Now it’s a matter of figuring out exactly what that relationship looks like.</p>

<p>Hackers attack computer systems to steal information. Some of the most important types of information they can steal are access credentials like usernames/passwords or PINs.</p>
<p>Why is credential access dangerous? If a hacker steals credentials, they have full and legitimate access to a system that is much harder to notice and observe.</p>
 What Is Credential Access? 
<p>Credential access is the use of legitimate credentials to access system resources. Hackers use many techniques to steal user passwords, PINs, or even MFA factors to gain access to systems legitimately.</p>
<p>The danger of these attacks cannot be overstated. If a hacker has legitimate credentials, it becomes much harder to determine that an attack is underway. These credentials will give that hacker the keys to the car (at least so far as the privileges of the stolen credentials will permit) to do as they wish.</p>
 Types of Credential Theft 
<p>Credentials are, at their core, pieces of data. This means they can be stolen at several different points of use and transmission.</p>
<p>Some of the ways that hackers steal credentials include:</p>
 
 Password Guessing/Cracking: One way to get user passwords is to simply break into an account by calculating luck. Guessing involves using randomized credentials or those built into a dictionary to force your way into an account. Cracking is similar but involves breaking password security (typically hacking or encryption) and getting into local user accounts. 
 Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: If a hacker can inject themselves into network connections between two parties, and user credentials are transmitted on that connection, then it’s relatively easy for them to steal either encrypted or clear-text credentials (depending on how those credentials are sent). MiTM attacks can also contribute to social engineering attacks by rerouting users to fake websites to collect credentials. 
 Social Engineering: Phishing is one of the most common forms of attack because it is, unfortunately, still very effective. Attackers can use fake emails or text messages to trick users into giving up credentials. In tandem with man-in-the-middle attacks, hackers can also drive users to websites that look like a login page for a legitimate service but serve as a collection mechanism for credentials. 
 Credential Dumping: Dumping is breaking into a database or operating system and forcing the system to expose user credentials via exploits. Using exploits can be risky for hackers (alerting security experts to their presence), but the payoff can be enormous. 
 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Interception: While <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> is very secure, no security technique is 100% infallible. Clever hackers with the ability to steal or model 2FA factors like SAML tokens or physical media can feasibly use them to steal credentials. 
 Forging: An even rarer occurrence, some hackers can forge authentication factors. It’s been shown that hackers can forge artifacts like card keys and even fingerprints with the right context and technology. 
 Malware and Harvesting: If the hacker can get malware inside a less-secure system, they can use malware to install tools like network sniffers and keyloggers to harvest user information. Eventually, that user will type in their credentials. Then, the hackers only have to sift through the data and collect their rewards. 
 
 What Role Does Credential Access Play in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)? 
<p>Advanced Persistent Threat is a name used to refer to two entities:</p>
 
 Long-term and highly sophisticated cyber attacks are used to steal data or collect ransom from prominent organizations and government agencies. 
 Hacker groups that develop, launch, and monitor these threats, typically as part of state-sponsored cyber attacks. 
 
<p>So, for example, you may see a group like Cozy Bear (generally thought responsible for the SolarWinds Orion breach) and its associated tools collectively referred to as an APT.</p>
<p>An APT is “advanced” because they will use system access to propagate, hide, and monitor activity to spread their influence. One of the key stages of an APT lifecycle is the practice of “lateral movement,” or using credentials or exploits to move from one system to the next over network connections.</p>
<p>As might be expected, credential access is critical to the success of the lateral movement. In order to remain hidden, these threats must have legitimate credentials. Accordingly, such threats will implement several types of credential theft (network sniffing, credential dumping, harvesting, etc.) to collect as many user credentials as possible.</p>
 How Can I Prevent Unauthorized Credential Access? 
<p>The challenge with credential access is that it can happen through several (often concurrent) attacks. Addressing these attacks isn’t as straightforward as putting in two-factor authentication and calling it a day–it takes a culture of security and innovation to adopt the top techniques and technologies to find significant success.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-best-practices/">best practices</a> include:</p>
 
 Rotate Passwords Regularly: The longer a threat has access to legitimate credentials, the longer they can wreak havoc. By requiring regular password changes (once every 20, 60, or 90 days), you can reduce the impact a credential access attack has on system resources. 
 Utilize Secure MFA: Using multi-factor authentication is an important step for any authentication security policy, but for sensitive data and mission-critical systems, it pays to implement more stringent security in the form of physical authentication media and identity assurance management (compliance with NIST IAL requirements). 
 Monitor User Behavior Baselines: Advanced authentication and logging tools utilize AI and behavioral analytics to assess how users operate in a system. By analyzing patterns, these tools can determine if uncommon or risky behaviors are occurring that could signal that user accounts have been compromised. 
 Adhere to the Principle of Least Privileges: No user account should have system privileges beyond the needs of their job description and their immediate tasks. Following the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/principle-least-privilege/">PoLP</a>, your security systems should limit users’ access to system resources. Proper implementation can severely reduce a hacker’s ability to move laterally through the system. 
 Utilize Advanced Authentication and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless Securit</a>y: By eliminating passwords, you can remove the need to pass credentials back and forth over networked connections. Furthermore, you can effectively remove the threat of many phishing attacks (the most common entry vector for APTs).

<p>We surveyed 1,450 consumers globally to understand how they feel about emerging identity topics — here’s what we found.</p>
<p>Innovations like digital and hybrid identity solutions are a double-edged sword for business and security leaders. On the one hand, these solutions are driving convenience and higher issuance for users, which leads to a more satisfying user experience. On the other, their rapid emergence in the market means business leaders may have more questions than answers when it comes to implementing them. For example, what’s the best way to validate identity? How interested is the public in digital identity? As identity becomes more digitized, how can individuals protect their personal information?</p>
<p>To find the answers to these and other questions, the Entrust Cybersecurity Institute surveyed 1,450 consumers across 12 countries to investigate their experiences with three topics that will define the future of identity: passwordless authentication, hybrid identities, and ownership over personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Our report uncovered three key takeaways that will shape the future of identity.</p>
 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biometrics are poised to dethrone passwords. 
<p>Passwords have served as the standard for protecting digital goods and services since their inception in the 1960s. But as Mark Ruchie, chief information security officer of Entrust, says, “Passwords are a necessary evil that is becoming less necessary by the day.”</p>
<p>User and behavioral biometrics are powering new authentication solutions that offer consumers a much more convenient user experience than passwords. Consumers also believe these options are more secure than passwords. In fact, our report found that 53% of consumers believe fingerprint scans are the most secure authentication method, followed by facial recognition technology (47%).</p>
<p>Check out the full report to understand how frequently consumers are using biometrics, and why some holdouts still prefer passwords.</p>
 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Education around digital identities has a long way to go. 
<p>Digital identities have exploded in popularity in recent years, with the market expected to reach <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/09/16/2517659/0/en/Digital-Identity-Solutions-Market-worth-70-7-billion-by-2027-Exclusive-Report-by-MarketsandMarkets.html">$70.7 billion</a> by 2027. However, many consumers are still confused about what a digital identity actually is.</p>
<p>For example, in the U.S. only 27% of survey respondents agree that they have an electronic ID. The catch? Since 2006, all U.S. passport holders are automatically issued ePassports, which fall under the eID umbrella. Although some of the remaining 73% of respondents may not have a passport, it’s clear that most consumers don’t realize they already have an eID in their possession.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that even though eID awareness needs to improve, respondents are still largely in favor of the concept. Read the full report to understand why consumers either support or oppose digital identity documents.</p>
 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decentralized identities could empower consumers to take ownership of their data. 
<p>The fight for data privacy is divisive. Some users are fiercely protective of their data, while others accept pervasive data sharing as a necessary trade-off for access to digital goods and services. The seemingly endless sharing of data with banks, employers, and online marketers may be one reason why 55% of respondents believe they don’t own their information at all.</p>
<p>Consumers are also split down the middle when it comes to how comfortable they are with organizations owning and storing a digital identity for them. Skeptics point to a lack of confidence in whether organizations can be trusted to keep their data safe. But these fears would likely dissolve if users had the option to manage their personal information themselves. This is exactly what decentralized identities hope to accomplish.</p>
<p>While still in the experimental stage, decentralized identities give individuals greater control over their data and equip organizations with the information they need to provide personalized experiences. To learn more about decentralized identity solutions and consumers’ appetite for the possible solution, read the full report.</p>
 Download the Future of Identity report 
<p>The future of identity is changing. As new solutions continue to emerge, enterprises, employers, and governments need to find ways to maintain high-quality security and convenience with their users. Both physical and digital credentials are necessary, but don’t be surprised to see that change as the universality and interoperability of identity solutions improves.</p>

 Learn more about the dirty money trade (for educational purposes, of course), and the part you can play to prevent it.&nbsp; 



 



<p>Between <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html">US$800 million and $2 trillion</a> is laundered every single year, according to the United Nations – Office on Drugs and Crime (UNOD). At 2-5% of the global GDP, money laundering continues to pose a significant threat to businesses and economies, as well as consumers, who either intentionally or unintentionally become part of the trade in “dirty money.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often when describing money laundering, many may mention complex shareholding structures and offshore accounts led by international criminal groups. However, in reality, money laundering practices are far more pervasive, and may be happening much closer to home than you think. Money laundering takes advantage of any vulnerability (e.g., lack of or inadequate <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC measures)</a> that companies and portals offer, especially in the gaming and financial services industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What is the definition of money laundering?&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">Money laundering</a> can be defined as the process of hiding the source of illegally obtained funds, by moving it through a system of banking transfers or transactions. The final objective is to transfer the funds into a legitimate financial system. The source of funds could derive from arms sales, drug or human trafficking, bribery, or even insider trading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although complex in nature, the process of money laundering can usually be broken up into three simple steps:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Placement 



<p>In the first phase, the “dirty money” collected through illegitimate activities needs to be reinjected into the financial system. Whether cash, crypto/virtual currencies, or money orders, there are many ways a launderer can break large amounts into less conspicuous sums to fly under the radar. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">Gambling</a> or currency exchanges are often used as tools to deposit money back into the financial system in a less suspicious way. By depositing money in this manner, money launderers avoid being above the thresholds set by <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/moneyval/implementation/fiu">Financial Intelligence Units</a> (FIUs) or being the subject of a <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/what-we-do/crime-threats/money-laundering-and-illicit-finance/suspicious-activity-reports">Suspicious Activity Report</a> (SAR).&nbsp;</p>



 Layering 



<p>In the layering phase, the launderer will try to place as much distance between the funds and their source. One common method of layering is to channel funds through the purchase and sales of financial instruments like real estate or wiring money to multiple accounts around the globe to evade being subject to a specific jurisdiction. Layering operations requires specific skill sets, from corporate law to bookkeeping. Money laundering professionals offer services to criminal organizations to facilitate their financial operations.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies, exchanges and peer-to-peer platforms are now commonly used for layering.&nbsp; Even though the crypto industry is becoming increasingly regulated (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto-Assets</a> in Europe, <a href="https://www.globallegalinsights.com/practice-areas/blockchain-laws-and-regulations/usa">Securities Law</a> and <a href="https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/brief/cryptocurrency-laws-and-regulations-by-state/">State laws</a> in the US), the regulations are still in their infancy, with many crypto exchanges still to implement KYC mechanisms that would help screen and monitor. To complexify monitoring, layering is sometimes carried out through shell companies, intermediaries or nominees in fiscal-friendly countries that protect the ultimate beneficiaries’ identity. It can also be done by moving funds between several banks and/or accounts. As fees are required to move money around or pay intermediaries, layering can be costly.&nbsp;</p>



 Integration 



<p>Integration aims to legitimize the money cleaned in the layering phase. If the layering process has been conducted properly, the source of funds will be untraceable. The money can then be used to acquire real estate, luxury goods like art, or business ventures. It can also be used to pursue other criminal activities, such as terrorism financing.</p>



 







 Real life use cases.&nbsp; 



<p>There are as many methods to launder money as there are money launderers. Ranging from simple to complex, modus operandi may vary, and investigative units must be on their A-game to track them down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most common techniques to launder money is through a legitimate business that handles cash, such as bars or restaurants. In these types of business, it is easy to inflate the number of daily receipts to inject illicit cash into turnover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the FIUs, such as <a href="https://www.economie.gouv.fr/tracfin">Tracfin</a> in France, publish annual reports on the latest money laundering trends. In its <a href="https://www.economie.gouv.fr/files/2022-07/Tracfin_2021_Web.pdf?v=1675078163">2021 report</a>, Tracfin described a form of money laundering called “fake president fraud.” After depositing fraudulent money into a fake company, the money launderer sends a sum to an account in Eastern Europe, allegedly owned by the fake president. The laundered money is then transferred into an account in Asia owned by a nominee. The very existence of this account is not legitimate as the fake company does not have any commercial activity in this country. Those accounts are used as intermediaries, to then transfer the scammed funds into another account controlled by the fraudster. &nbsp;</p>



 The hidden cost of money laundering.&nbsp; 



<p>While the financial cost associated with money laundering is ample cause for alarm, perhaps the most harmful consequence of money laundering is the reputational damage to a banking system. A banking system that is not perceived as legitimate or working within a high legal framework and complying with ethical standards is not trustworthy, and therefore unlikely to be used. On a macroeconomic scale, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf/">Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</a> explains how <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/pages/frequently-asked-questions.html#tabs-36503a8663-item-6ff811783c-tab">money laundering</a> tends to create “inexplicable changes in money demand, prudential risks to bank soundness, contamination effects on legal financial transactions, and increased volatility of international capital flows and exchange rates due to unanticipated cross-border asset transfers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entities that are either knowingly or unknowingly participating in money laundering schemes are complicit in an incredibly dangerous criminal network. If organizations are found to have such links, they are likely to draw unwanted attention from the authorities as well as administrative and financial sanctions. Worst case scenario? Failure to prevent money laundering can even involve jail time for the top management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money laundering has a direct impact on a country’s economic development. Left unchecked, it can be an invitation to criminal organizations to infiltrate financial institutions or take control of vast sectors of a national economy. It can also help finance other criminal activities or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">terrorist financing</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Preventing money laundering.&nbsp; 



<p>Multiple prevention mechanisms can be implemented to deter money laundering activities. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">anti-money laundering</a> (AML) ecosystem is composed of multiple actors that work intricately. Whether state-level regulations such as EU <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">AML directives</a>, FATF recommendations, FIU investigations or financial actors reporting, everyone has a role in AML.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To stay compliant and avoid being sanctioned by national authorities, organizations must implement rigorous AML frameworks, routinely review the effectiveness of their programs, and monitor their activities on a daily basis. Navigating such a complex environment involves multiple challenges, especially when it comes to KYC obligations and transaction monitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operationally speaking, there are certain red flags that can help identify money laundering, such as high-frequency transactions and high-speed turnover of deposits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stakes for governments, businesses and society are high. Tackling money laundering needs to be given the utmost attention and requires a high degree of coordination between different parties, and constant monitoring of the latest trends and techniques used in the placement, layering and integration stages of money laundering.</p>


 
 
 
 What are the penalties for money laundering? 
 

<p>In most countries, money laundering is considered a serious criminal offence. While penalties may vary, it mostly involves imprisonment, financial and/or administrative fines, and confiscation of assets acquired through illegal funds.</p>

 
 
 
 How do law enforcement agencies investigate money laundering cases? 
 

<p>FIUs have developed their own methods to track money laundering, depending on the specific techniques used. The analyzing of financial records is a key element when it comes to money laundering. International cooperation between FIUs, as well as collaboration with financial actors, is also a strong means to support investigations.</p>

 
 
 
 What is the difference between money laundering and tax evasion? 
 

<p>Tax evasion aims to hide funds from fiscal authorities, in order to avoid paying taxes. Contrary to money laundering, it does not mean the funds were illegally acquired, and most often does not go through multiple transactions. However, they can be interconnected as criminals may use money laundering techniques to hide their taxable income.</p>

 
 
 
 What industries are most susceptible to money laundering? 
 

<p>The financial services industry is most susceptible to money laundering, given their ability to move large sums of money across borders. Other popular sectors are gaming and gambling, cryptocurrencies or real estate.&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 What are the most common methods used to launder money? 
 

<p>There are different methods commonly used to launder money, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/smurfing/">smurfing</a>, structuring (splitting a large financial transaction into smaller ones) and moving funds through shell companies or cash-related businesses like restaurants, bars and night clubs.&nbsp;</p>

 Public Pressure Integrates KILT Identity Blockchain to Verify NFTs and Users on its Music Marketplace <p>AUSTIN, TEXAS, March 13, 2023 — Web3 media pioneer Public Pressure and KILT Protocol developer BOTLabs GmbH today announced at SXSW the use of KILT’s infrastructure for issuing public credentials to verify NFT collections, and logging into the Public Pressure Marketplace.</p><p>Public Pressure is a music platform powered by artists, labels and fans. They will issue “verified by Public Pressure” credentials to the music NFTs in their <a href="https://app.publicpressure.io/marketplace">Marketplace</a> collections. Artists or their record label can then add certificates of authenticity, and DJs can show publicly that a particular song is part of their playlist, building the identity of the asset. These new elements make counterfeit more difficult and potentially add value to the&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>Public Pressure will also enable users to log into their platform using email credentials verified by KILT’s <a href="https://www.kilt.io/services/socialkyc">SocialKYC</a> service. These credentials remain under the control of the user on their device, and reduce the need for centralized data&nbsp;storage.</p><p>KILT is a decentralized parachain built on Polkadot that provides secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers. Using KILT’s <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/asset-dids">AssetDID framework</a>, which identifies multiple types of digital assets on any blockchain, Public Pressure users can link public credentials to any NFT on any smart contract. Anyone — artists, buyers and sellers — can read these public credentials, which are stored publicly on the KILT blockchain.</p><p>AssetDIDs work as a unique digital fingerprint and permanent identifier of the NFT. This means the credentials always stay with the NFT, even if ownership of the NFT&nbsp;changes.</p><p>“We are excited to see the first use case of AssetDIDs and public credentials by Public Pressure. The SXSW technology and music festival is the perfect setting to announce the next phase of NFT credentials,” said Ingo Rübe, CEO of BOTLabs GmbH and founder of KILT Protocol. “It’s great to see the pioneering work of Public Pressure adding extra utility and value to their music NFTs with public credentials built on&nbsp;KILT.”</p><p>“By partnering with KILT, we’re bringing an extra layer of transparency and protection against counterfeiting to music NFTs”, said Sergio Mottola, President of Public Pressure. “In addition, by integrating technology from other projects in the ecosystem, we’re also proving Polkadot is by far the best ecosystem in terms of interoperability. The success of this collaboration brings extra value to the end&nbsp;user.”</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a blockchain protocol for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers. BOTLabs GmbH is the initial developer of KILT Protocol and services “Built on KILT” including SocialKYC for identity verification, DIDsign for decentralized file signing and web3name for personalized digital identities. Based in Berlin, BOTLabs is a founding member of the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) and a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).</p> About Public&nbsp;Pressure <p><a href="http://www.publicpressure.io/">Public Pressure</a> was originally launched in 2015 as an online community and magazine dedicated to giving a voice to emerging artists and&nbsp;labels.</p><p>Now a Web3 media company headquartered in London with offices around the world, Public Pressure focuses on the interactions between music, culture and technology. It powers a fair and equitable, direct-to-fan strategy for creators, minus the production and distribution costs incurred in existing Web2 environments.</p><p>Public Pressure is built on Polkadot, which has the lowest total electricity consumption and carbon emissions per year of the six proof-of-stake (POS) blockchains studied, and has been designed to support the transition of music to&nbsp;Web3.</p> Press Contacts <p>KILT Protocol<br>Christine Mohan<br>christine@kilt.io<br> +49 17672269753</p><p>Public Pressure<br>Andy Saunders<br>Velocity Communications<br>andy@velocitypr.co.uk<br> + 44 (0) 7939&nbsp;133050</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/public-pressure-integrates-kilt-identity-blockchain-to-verify-nfts-and-users-on-its-music-92d9c77515af">Public Pressure Integrates KILT Identity Blockchain to Verify NFTs and Users on its Music…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

She has spoken extensively on issues related to digital identity, including security, privacy, consent, and user experience. Here, she offers her perspectives on technology, transparency, and trust — a future in which people can simply and safely access the connected world while retaining control of their data.</p>

<p>Technology can make processes simpler, faster, smarter. And there are definitely efficiency gains to be had by joining things together digitally and making better use of data. Where we think Blair and Hague's intervention will stumble is by calling for the introduction of digital ID cards. This issue has led the headlines and drowned out what are probably good ideas in the rest of their package.</p>

<p>People in the UK already have a Government Gateway ID to submit tax returns and get their driving licenses and passports, and another digital account for benefits. But, as a nation, the UK just does not trust ID cards. That might stem from skepticism of political leaders to use this power responsibly, as well as a general distrust around how data will be used and whether people will be tracked. Let's not forget the number of times government officials have misplaced citizen data on public transport.</p>

<p>But it's important we don't let this reluctance about digital identities hold the UK back. Many countries around the world are already beginning to embrace digital wallets — the amalgamation of IDs, payment cards, and train tickets. The United States and Australia are examples where they are moving deliberately towards digital driver's licenses. But for this to be embraced here, we need incremental change backed by transparency and safeguards. The UK must incorporate a standards-based approach that ensures individuals remain in control of their data, by enabling them to only share specific bits of information to a service provider, such as verifying your age or your NHS number.</p>

<p>People want to access the digital world simply and safely without needing to log in constantly, just like we do with Apple Pay or Google Wallet. When you go to purchase a restricted item such as alcohol at a self-service checkout, there is friction in the form of a manual verification check. The future is to have your credentials, like your date of birth, stored alongside your payment method to act as a form of validation, which would improve the buying experience and keep it secure. This approach could be extended to opening a bank account, taking out a mobile phone contract, or booking a GP appointment. For consumers, it is important to know that your credentials in each of these cases wouldn't be controlled by the service or authority, and ultimately you would always need to provide consent — and you may be able to avoid sharing your actual birthday and just share a trusted statement that you are "old enough."</p>

<p>The more the public accepts digital IDs for services we trust, the more open they'll become to expansion. Eventually, there may not even be a need for an official digital ID card, as citizens' wallets will hold the full range of information available and make its use controllable. Imagine a world where you never need to log in again.</p>

  In stark contrast to China’s response toward cryptocurrencies, Hong Kong is positioning itself as Asia’s crypto hub through several initiatives and measures.  Hong Kong’s most recent crypto-focused measure is a consultation paper on the proposed regulatory requirements for licensed Virtual Asset Trading Platform Operators from the city-state’s financial regulator Securities and Futures Commission.  The consultation paper is currently open for comments until March&nbsp;31.  <p>Hong Kong’s enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies and virtual assets has been evident at a policymaking and retail investment level. In its 2023–2024 budget — published on February 22nd, 2023 — Hong Kong earmarked HK$50 million, equivalent to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/22/hong-kong-backs-web3-with-64m-in-annual-budget/">US$6.4 million</a>, to develop its Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>It aimed to spread awareness and conduct discussions around the Web3 ecosystem by organizing significant international seminars. At a more functional level, the funds were expected to encourage business cooperation and hold workshops for young enthusiasts in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>Hong Kong’s financial secretary Paul Chan started a task force to help develop virtual assets. The task force would include policy bureau members and representatives from different regulatory bodies and industries.</p><p>This policy is in line with the enthusiasm shown by Hong Kong citizens towards virtual assets. For example, according to a survey conducted between November 2021 and February 2022, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1337682/apac-share-of-crypto-curious-consumers-by-country/">42 </a>percent of the respondents in Singapore and Hong Kong did not own cryptocurrency but were interested in or planning to purchase it in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Another report by Chainanalysis shows that cryptocurrency values received by internet addresses in Hong Kong reached a whopping <a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/hong-kongs-crypto-push-sets-up-race-bottom-2022-11-22/">US$70 billion</a> in the year to June&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Overall, Hong Kong’s dynamism in the world of virtual assets and the web3 ecosystem as a whole is something that has caught everyone’s attention. Here, we delve deeper to examine its latest crypto measures and what they mean for the city’s investors and industry.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML and KYC Compliance in Crypto&nbsp;Industry</a></p> Hong Kong’s Latest Crypto&nbsp;Measures <p>On February 20th, 2023, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) launched a consultation paper on the proposed regulatory requirements for Virtual Asset Trading Platform Operators licensed by the SFC. It welcomed comments from market participants and interested parties on the subject of consultation.</p><p>The regulatory requirements on which the Hong Kong SFC asked for consultation involved three key&nbsp;areas:</p>  Guidelines for Virtual Asset Trading Platform Operators  Guidelines on AML/CFT for Licensed Corporations and SFC-Licensed Virtual Asset Service Providers  Disciplinary Fining.  <p>Before going through each of these aforementioned sets of guidelines, we must be aware of the premise of these guidelines. They have come in the context of a new licensing regime that will take effect on June 1st, 2023. All centralized virtual asset trading platforms carrying on business in Hong Kong or actively marketing to Hong Kong investors will need to have SFC licenses.</p><p>The licensing will happen under the AMLO VASP regime, combining the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance.</p><p>With the commencement of the AMLO VASP regime, it will be required that the SFC-licensed VA trading platforms comply with the Guidelines for Virtual Asset Trading Platform Operators, also known as the VATP guidelines.</p><p>The proposed VATP guidelines are based on the existing regulatory requirements for SFO-licensed platform operators. These requirements are as&nbsp;follows:</p> Safe Custody of&nbsp;Assets   A platform operator should keep custody of the client’s money and virtual assets on trust through a wholly-owned subsidiary, also called an “associated entity.”  The platform operator should ensure that not more than 2% of the client’s virtual assets are stored in hot&nbsp;wallets.  The platform operator should have a robust set of written internal policies and governance procedures for private key management.  The operator should not deposit, transfer, lend, pledge, repledge, or otherwise deal with or create encumbrance over the client’s virtual&nbsp;assets.  An insurance policy is also mandatory to cover risks that come with the custody of a client’s virtual&nbsp;assets.   Know-Your-Client (KYC)   The KYC obligations the platform operator needs to fulfill depend on its client’s financial situation, investment experience, and investment objectives.   AML/CFT   Apart from establishing an adequate and appropriate set of AML/CFT policies, procedures, and controls, the platform operator may also deploy VA tracking tools to trace the on-chain history of specific Virtual&nbsp;Assets.   Conflicts of&nbsp;Interest   A platform operator should ensure that it is not engaging in proprietary trading or market-making activities on a proprietary basis.   Admission of Virtual Assets for&nbsp;Trading   A platform operator should establish a strong structural framework for admitting a virtual&nbsp;asset.  Moreover, the operator should perform reasonable due diligence on all virtual assets before admitting them for trading, ensuring they satisfy all criteria.   Preventing Market Manipulation and&nbsp;Abuse   Controls to prevent market manipulation and abuse may include restricting or suspending trading upon discovering such incidents.  The operator should establish an effective market surveillance system offered by a reputable and independent provider.   Accounting and&nbsp;Auditing   A platform operator should submit an auditor’s report each financial year.  Additionally, operators should provide monthly reports to the SFC on its business activities within two weeks after the end of each calendar&nbsp;month.   Risk Management   The platform operator should be able to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the full range of risks arising from their businesses and operations.  <p>The Hong Kong SFC has prepared a list of risk indicators for institutional and customer risk assessment. The broad categories of such risks include country risk, customer risk, product/service/transaction risk, and delivery/distribution channel&nbsp;risk.</p><p>The second set of guidelines is on AML/CFT. They apply to licensed corporations and SFC-licensed VASPs. These guidelines ask for the following:</p> Virtual Asset Transfers   If a licensed platform operator acts as an ordering institution of virtual asset transfers, the operator must obtain, record and submit the required information of the originator and recipient, as stipulated in the guidance, to the beneficiary institution as soon and securely as possible.  On the receiving end, licensed platform operators acting as beneficiary institutions must obtain and record the required information submitted by the ordering institution or intermediary institution.  The operator should conduct robust due diligence on a virtual asset transfer counterparty. These counterparties include the ordering institution, intermediary institution, or beneficiary institution involved in a VA transfer.  When virtual asset transfers happen to or from unhosted wallets, a licensed platform operator must obtain and record the required information from its customers.  Moreover, the operator must ensure reasonable efforts to mitigate and manage the money laundering/terrorist financing risks associated with the transfers.  <p>With the Disciplinary Fining guidelines to be published in detail, the above is a gist of the proposed regulatory measures for Virtual Asset Trading Platform Operators that have obtained licenses from the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p><p>Moreover, the obligations that VASPs, both beneficiary, and originator, will have under Hong Kong’s proposed rules align with that of the FATF Travel Rule. So, as soon as this law is enforced in the city-state, VASPs will have to begin using Travel Rule Solutions, like the Shyft Veriscope.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">What is KYC in Crypto, and Why do Crypto Exchanges Require&nbsp;it?</a></p> Implications for&nbsp;VASPs <p>If we look at the global order, the regulatory scrutiny — often hovering on the verge of a crackdown — has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6b8747c2-9c4a-4406-969c-0b8fa73c614c">increased significantly</a> in the major economies of the United States and China. For instance, the SEC-led US regulators have initiated several enforcement actions against some of the biggest digital asset companies in recent weeks. The agencies are also scrutinizing banks that support these companies with payment and custody solutions.</p><p>In early February 2023, Huang Yiping, a former member of the Monetary Policy Committee at the People’s Bank of China, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bank-of-china-ex-advisor-calls-beijing-to-reconsider-crypto-ban">asked</a> the Chinese government to reconsider its crypto ban. However, what remains a fact is that cryptocurrencies are still banned in mainland&nbsp;China.</p><p>In such a scenario, Hong Kong’s willingness to set up a regulated and structural environment for VA trading platforms is a positive sign to many. Apart from initiating a licensing regime for crypto service providers, the SFC is also keen to discuss and know whether licensed providers should serve retail investors. The discussion will also help ascertain investor protection measures.</p><p>In Hong Kong, the retail traders — so far — were trading crypto assets on unlicensed exchanges. Offering retail trade permissions to licensed operators would mean a big boost for Hong Kong in attracting crypto businesses to the territory.</p><p>According to Hong Kong <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/83572de0-be12-4e3b-9798-6e3a24a35838">SFC Chief executive Julia Leung</a>, “there is a clear consensus among regulators globally for regulation in the virtual asset space to ensure investors are adequately protected, and key risks are effectively managed.”</p><p>The intention of the HK SFC is a welcome signal for industry participants in Hong Kong. According to Henri Arslanian, managing partner at crypto asset management firm Nine Blocks Capital Management, “this sends a powerful message that Hong Kong wants to reclaim its status as a global crypto hub.” He also expressed optimism that these regulations would add to the renewed momentum the city is seeing, especially after many crypto businesses faced operating difficulties due to the covid-induced travel restrictions.</p><p>The consultation paper on the proposed regulations will remain open to feedback and input till March 31st, 2023. Respondents may choose to stay anonymous with their feedback. Otherwise, their feedback may get published with their names on the SFC&nbsp;website.</p><p>So, if you would like to share your feedback on the proposed rules, you must definitely go for it, as it could help the regulators see the user’s side of things, which they may not otherwise.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/compliant-defi-the-way-out-of-commingling-clean-and-illicit-funds-in-a-decentralized-finance-economy">Compliant DeFi — the way out of Commingling Clean and Illicit Funds in a Decentralized Finance&nbsp;Economy</a></p> The Impact on the End&nbsp;Users <p>It’s crucial to see how the rules and regulations will impact the end users, as no industry can prosper without prioritizing user experience and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Although the rules are rather extensive, they also include several user-focused measures, such as directing VASPs not to store over 2% of user funds on the hot wallets. Hot wallets are more prone to hacks, as they are connected to the internet, unlike cold wallets. Moreover, crypto hacks cause billions of dollars in losses every year, with hackers stealing a whopping <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/04/crypto-investors-lost-nearly-4-billion-dollars-to-hackers-in-2022.html">$4 billion</a> in 2022&nbsp;alone.</p><p>Having learned its lessons from the much-publicized case of FTX collapse, the proposed rules also bar VASPs from using client funds for any purposes that could put it at risk. That said, some suggested measures could also get privacy advocates to raise their eyebrows, such as making on-chain tracking of some virtual assets mandatory.</p><p>While it’s crucial to decipher how regulators’ actions will impact the end users, it’s equally important to look at the VASPs’ role as well. If the VASPs fail to ensure minimal impact on user privacy and experience while transitioning into this new regulated future, it can severely dent the future prospects of the entire industry.</p><p>For instance, if the suggested measures become Hong Kong’s new crypto rules, VASPs will have to begin collecting originator and beneficiary details while facilitating crypto transfers. Imagine what if VASPs start collecting the originator and beneficiary detail manually? It would severely impact the user experience, and many users may turn away from the crypto ecosystem altogether.</p><p>Now, let’s say the VASPs chose a Travel Rule Solution that automatically facilitates user data transfer but stores it on third-party servers outside their control. In this case, the VASPs may not even know when the third-party servers get breached, putting the personal data of their users at risk. Hence, VASPS must comply with these rules while prioritizing user experience and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>By using Shyft Veriscope, VASPs can solve both the privacy and user experience-related issues they may face while complying with the “Virtual Asset Transfer” requirements under the suggested crypto rules under the consultation paper.</p><p>Overall, both regulators and industry stakeholders will have to work together to protect user privacy and experience while promoting innovation in the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust. It is a public protocol designed to drive data discoverability and compliance into blockchain while preserving privacy and sovereignty. SHFT is its native token and fuel of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Shyft Network facilitates the transfer of verifiable data between centralized and decentralized ecosystems.

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>For this interview in the series, Ontology speaks with&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/itsdonnyok">Donny</a>.</p><p>1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology?</p><p>I began to gain an active interest in cryptocurrency and it’s potential impacts on human civilization in January of 2020 after passively reading about discussing blockchain tech for several years prior. One of the first investments I made was 1000 ONT due to the high staking rewards and sturdy business concept. Realizing that staking through an exchange I was receiving a lower APY, I began to do research on staking directly in the ONTO app, and eventually made the investment to start my own node in early&nbsp;2022.</p><p>2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand?</p><p>My support for Ontology grew organically through researching the concept, execution, and applicability of decentralized identity solutions. I began to see that Ontology is not only solving problems we currently have as a society, but moreso looks to solve problems we are yet going to have on a much, much larger scale. The more I learn, and the more of the team I meet, the more my faith&nbsp;grows.</p><p>3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger?</p><p>The key role of a Harbinger is to (generally speaking) be a proponent of the mission statement of the company. Each Harbinger does this is a different series of ways, but if I were to try to describe what my role includes, it would be using all of the products, trying to break them, providing a social bridge for newcomers and to other ecosystems, and writing and speaking both in person and digitally about Ontology and its bustling surrounding environment.</p><p>4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you?</p><p>I firmly believe that Ontology is working to make the world a better place for each of its inhabitants. I also firmly believe that human life is only possible and sustainable if each of its members strike a healthy balance between taking care of ones-self and behaving altruistically. I make it a point to partake in vaccine trials and do volunteer work, and I see my role as a Harbinger to be a confirmation of Ontology’s appreciation for my constant push to make a positive impact. This is one of the many affirming qualities Ontology possess as a company: appreciating and promoting the work of its individual community members unprompted.</p><p>5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities? Is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out?</p><p>Ontology’s community feels like it’s fully built around problem-solving. There is no hype without backing, and the main point of the company is not just to create wealth or price-prop its tokens. The company exists to eloquently and thoroughly solve problems in the web3 space, and its community members are a direct reflection of this. Open, honest, &amp; direct communication is everywhere you look, and without bravado or undue pride, each member is pushing to further the mission statement of the&nbsp;company.</p><p>6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others?</p><p>I mainly use Discord, but I try to pop into Reddit and Telegram as much as I can. I like that Discord is organizable into channels, easily sortable and searchable, and I love the bot and wallet integrations. I use Discord solely for my other web3 ventures, so I might be biased in some regard, but it seems the most powerful tool for community building. No others I can think of that would perform this set of tasks as well or&nbsp;better.</p><p>7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger?</p><p>Hanging with Polaris and Humpty on the weekly Ontology Discord Community Calls, I’ve learned/reinforced that listening is an important part of contributing. In order to be as effective and helpful as one might want to be, it requires absorbing as much information as possible and interjecting when clarification is necessary for understanding or when one genuinely feels they can add to the conversation in a positive manner. I’m constantly humbled by the other Harbingers and team members and can only hope to contribute to a similar&nbsp;degree.</p><p>8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words?</p><p>Diverse, effective, &amp;&nbsp;humble.</p><p>9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more or less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow?</p><p>I think ontology could expand its reach by integrating ONTO wallet more heavily into the NFT trade and secondary sales marketplaces. Even if it’s simply to be one of the main wallets used in NFT trading and holding, I think the exposure would bring thousands if not millions of new users to Ontology and increase the odds of gaining exponential traction. Whether we value the NFT trade or not, it’s undeniable that its the method of engagement for the masses in the web3 space at the&nbsp;moment.</p><p>10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these?</p><p>Corporate clients using DID services. Integrating openly with Ledger across the board, secondary NFT marketplaces such as Opensea, MagicEden, and any other main marketplace on an ONTO mobile supported chain, and beginning to integrate more heavily the concept of the ONT score, incentivizing common users to undergo the process of adding their information and creating ONTO wallets. I think the community is already pushing for this by having conversations and participating at a very high&nbsp;level!</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p><p>Tune in next week for the second interview in the Ontology Harbinger Interview Series.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>How they can be reduced with appropriate technical and legal measures</p>



<p>In the last two years of intensive study of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) I faced many critics despite to the advantages the technology offers over today’s familiar identification and certificate issuance options. They argue unexpectedly strongly with concerns about privacy and surveillance over citizens, ironically the very issues SSI seeks to resolve. Undoubtedly, the criticisms are valid and require closer examination to determine what measures should be derived from them. Since the eID is to be built on the basis of this technology, it is enormously important that consensus is created. How this is achieved I will deep dive in this blog.</p>



 In short: what is SSI? 



<p>With <a href="https://tanglelabs.io/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/" title="">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>, each individual manages their own third-party issued documents and certificates, called credentials. These can be a state identity (eID), a driver’s license, a settlement permit, a university degree, a tennis club membership, a purchase receipt, etc., stored in digital form on an app (wallet) on the smartphone or similar electronic device in the sole possession of the individual. </p>



<p>The credentials are issued for a globally unique identifier, for example a decentralized identifier (DID), which the wallet manages and which are stored with a unique verifiable digital signature by the issuer. The issued documents can thus be checked electronically for legitimacy. It is not possible to copy, forge or modify the contents, as the signature would expire and the fraud would be uncovered.</p>



 What can SSI achieve? 



<p>Basically, SSI wants to achieve the following:</p>



 
 Personal data is stored only on the electronic device of the applicable person. The person decides for himself with whom he wants to share data. A central entity that manages the identities (e.g. Google, Facebook, Apple, Samsung) is no longer necessary. 



 Verifiers can verify credentials with one hundred percent certainty because of the digital signature. Document forgery is no longer possible. 



 Since the credentials are only stored locally on the phone of the citizen, interaction with the credential issuer is not necessary for verification. 



 A wallet app can create any number of globally unique identifiers. Each credential can be linked to a different identifier, so that a profile of a specific person cannot be created on the basis of different verified data. 



 Within a few seconds, a credential can be created and transferred to the owner. 



 If the wallet is lost, the credentials can be revoked immediately, so that any previously issued documents lose their validity. 
 



<p>SSI thus aims to place the owner of an identity at the center of all activities and to ensure the highest possible level of data protection.</p>



<p>Additionally: Due to the globally unique identifier, SSI allows accounts to be created on the Internet for which neither an e-mail address nor a password are required. The uniqueness and thus assignability to an identity are regulated by the identifier. Remembering passwords and logging in using an e-mail account will be a thing of the past (see also&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 technology</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">SIOPv2</a>).</p>



 Valid arguments of the critics 



<p>In addition to the enormous advantages offered by SSI, it is also important to bear in mind that there are dangers lurking for citizens with the digitization of identities. Critics present very valid arguments against the widespread introduction of this technology in society. At this point, I will address these points.</p>



 Overidentification 



<p>Digitalization makes it possible to store and analyze data with much less effort than before. This is also the case with SSI. Service providers such as online stores, fitness centers or other everyday services have a great incentive to force holders to present the eID, since the verification effort will suddenly be very low, unlike with the physical identity card.</p>



 State-issued identities are extremely valuable 



<p>eID data is extremely valuable because it is authentic and state-verified. With the threat of identity coercion, third parties receive valuable data and thus become targets of attacks or can resell the data.</p>



 Facial images as part of the digital identity 



<p>How can you ensure that the holder of an eID is actually the person it claims to be? The facial image is an important component for unambiguous identification and is therefore part of the eID. In order to be able to make a clear match in a KYC process, the holder must release the contents of the eID together with the image. Verifiers will therefore possess the facial images in digital form in the future.</p>



 Account login mechanism with the eID 



<p>Many websites provide the option of logging in with Google, Facebook or similar (so-called identity providers) and appearing as a “federated identity”. While undoubtedly practical, they pose a major privacy problem, as activities on the web can be attributed to individuals. Such a practical and efficient login mechanism using the eID could become the standard. As mentioned above, digital service providers benefit from valuable government-verified information.</p>



 Law does not protect citizens enough 



<p>The introduction of the eID comes at the same time as a new law, in Switzerland the BGeID. While currently still in consultation, the first draft is still clearly not protective enough because the reference to the Data Protection Act is not sufficient. Specifically:</p>



 
 It refers to the need for private and public interests when requesting the eID, but does not specify when such an interest exists. 



 The citizen does not have the right to object (opt-out). 



 The linkage prohibition of further data (correlation) is not explained in detail. 
 



<p>Another problem arises for citizens when legislation is not coordinated across countries and data protection is not observed equally. Digitization is only weakly aware of geographical and legal boundaries, which is why citizens are exposed to risks in the digital space.</p>



 Discrimination and control efficiently implementable 



<p>With digital identity, discriminatory supply management of services or products can be implemented efficiently. Certain educational channels could be withheld from certain ethnic groups. There is currently a political debate in Switzerland about age verification for various content on the Internet.</p>



 Security gaps in the older generation of cell phones and negligent handling 



<p>With the eID, the identity is stored on the electronic devices. As with eBanking, security standards are prescribed for this to ensure the best possible protection for the user. Not all cell phones can comply with these standards.</p>



 Correlation issues by unique identifiers 



<p>Several global unique identifiers can be used to correlate activities of citizen. This may be an identifier of the software wallet, the decentralized identifier mentioned above, a specific index in the revocation registry or the signature of a specific credential, when used several times.</p>







 Status quo is not a solution 



<p>Despite the risks that an eID entails, the status quo is not a solution. The loss, inadequate protection of personal data occurs every day today and the verification in the KYC process is time-consuming and cost expensive for companies. Examples:</p>



 
 My bank lost the copy of my ID when I opened a new account. It can no longer be found. Who has this copy now? Where is it used? 



 The KYC processes to open a bank account or similar take several days. A lot of forms have to be submitted and signed. 



 Job references or training certificates can be easily falsified. 
 



<p>Today’s verification process is very error-prone, inefficient and not fraud-proof. Obtaining documents from third parties takes several days and costs money. It is very easy to obtain services using someone else’s identity. Personal information data of citizens are stored in many centralized systems, making it vulnerable for hacking and data breaches.</p>



<p>Even in the case of legal entities, a clear and verifiable identity such as the tax number is necessary, for example, to check the authenticity of invoices and account details before a payment is made. Very often, entrepreneurs fall victim to fraud schemes because the identities of business partners are not securely verified.</p>



<p>Additionally, in the international trading business a lot of certificates and import declarations must be shared and verified. This process takes a lot of time, which results in delayed shipments and increasing costs for companies.</p>







 Mitigate dangers 



<p>The dangers that have been pointed out are justified and must be taken seriously, and all precautions must be taken to minimize them in order to protect the citizen. At this point, I will show measures that help to ensure that SSI and the eID bring benefits for all. They consist of a mixture of legal and technical aspects. It is worth referring to the EU-wide eIDAS Regulation, which has already regulated a great deal on this topic.</p>



 Strict eID, data protection and anti-discrimination law 



<p>In Switzerland, the Federal eID Act (BGeID) is currently being drafted, which in principle allows a good balance between mandatory legal requirements and openness for the development of decentralized ecosystems. However, tightening is needed at the following points:</p>



 
 There is a lack of clear regulation under which circumstances an eID may be required. The “Schweizerische Anwaltsverband” demands that verifiers may only demand the eID “… if and insofar as this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation”. This would prevent an unnecessary demand for the eID in everyday life. eIDAS addresses this issue by requiring verifiers to register and report all data they want to collect. I very much support this approach but in the interest of reducing bureaucracy it needs to be limited for all credential issued by government agencies. 



 It must also be added to the law that non-discriminatory access for people without an eID is guaranteed at all times. 



 For low Level of Assurance (LoA) cases (e.g., when only age needs to be confirmed), an ID using Zero Knowledge Proof (see below) must be sufficient. 



 Right of withdrawal at any time, as provided for by the GDPR law in the EU, must be prescribed by law. 



 BGeID refers to the Data Protection Act, which, however, requires adjustments for handling in the digital space. 
 



<p>Currently, there is no explicit anti-discrimination law in Switzerland, which is repeatedly demanded by various bodies after the publication of studies on the legal effectiveness of the existing provision. With the spread of SSI technology and the possibility of more efficient monitoring of individuals, a tightening of non-discriminatory treatment in the digital space should be discussed.</p>



 Non-repudiation approach and independent reporting office for violations 



<p>To strengthen the enforcement power of the law, the so-called non-repudiation approach is mandatory. It enables the retrieval of data from the verifiers themselves to be given a digital signature. This means that in the event of a dispute, a citizen can prove that a possible breach of data protection regulations has occurred. An independent ombudsman’s office that records provable violations enables legal prosecution. An open rating system can proactively alert citizens to privacy concerns with specific verifiers.</p>



 Extended use of technologies such as ZKP 



<p>Third, it must be determined which data may be verified and stored and how. Here, the so-called ZKP technology plays an essential role, with which evidence is shared without sharing the content, for example, that a person is over 18 years old without disclosing the date of birth. In this respect, only parts of documents can be shared selectively using ZKP without disclosing the entire document (Selective Disclosure). Even the unique identifier will be anonymized, so that in no case profiling will be possible using the shared data. By law, criteria must be determined with which ZKP represents sufficient proof.</p>



 Safety standards 



<p>It must be ensured that globally valid security standards are defined for the wallets. The European Commission released, based on the eIDAS regulation, an Architecture and Reference Framework for an European Identity Wallet on February 10 2023. I want to point out the most important measures and add others:</p>



 
 Each credential can be associated with multiple identifiers that are not yet in use. Each time the document is presented, one random linked identifier is used, making profiling almost impossible. 



 The identifier itself of the holder is never stored publicly (for example on a blockchain). 



 Regular exchange of security keys (public-private key pair) helps prevent identity theft. Additional advanced backup capabilities allow to restore access in case of loss or compromise. 



 The security keys are stored in so-called Secure Enclaves (SE) or similar according to the latest standards and are thus encrypted and not readable by third-party applications and the OS such as Apple and Android. 



 Biometric data such as Face ID or fingerprint, also stored in the Secure Enclave, must be queried repeatedly, for example, when the wallet is opened AND when data is transferred to verifiers. This prevents unauthorized persons from misusing data if the electronic device is lost. 
 



 Optional Custodial Wallets 



<p>Technically, managing wallets and complying with security rules is not a simple undertaking for any citizen. Therefore, third-party entities such as banks or insurance companies will provide so-called custodial wallets (either as a cloud service or as an app) and take over the wallet backup administration for the holders. This enables faster acceptance and adoption and helps prevent data loss.</p>



<p>Custodial wallets, to the extent that it goes beyond just a backup function, are fundamentally at odds with the goals SSI is trying to achieve, as the wallet provider theoretically has visibility into all of the citizen’s activities. Therefore, such types of wallets must be provided with the strictest privacy rules.</p>



<p>I am not yet aware of any solution to the danger of digital facial image transmission. I welcome suggestions on how to address this issue. </p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p><a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/05/OIDF-Whitepaper_OpenID-for-Verifiable-Credentials_FINAL_2022-05-12.pdf">OpenID4VC (OpenID for Verifiable Credentials)</a> is a protocol for exchanging verifiable credentials in a decentralized identity environment. Its work is being conducted in the OpenID Foundation, in liaison with the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and with working groups in International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
<p>The goal of OpenID4VC is to provide a simple and interoperable way to exchange credentials between different decentralized identity systems.</p>
<p>OpenID4VC supports three main use cases:</p>
 
 Credential Issuance – OpenID4VC provides a way to issue verifiable credentials in a decentralized way 
 Credential Presentation – OpenID4VC enables users to present their credentials in a verifiable way, without revealing unnecessary personal information. 
 Pseudonymous User Authentication – OpenID4VC allows users to authenticate themselves without revealing their real identity. 
 
<p>The focus on these three use cases means that OpenID4VC purposefully isn’t focused on supporting a broader set of trust tasks that other protocols such as DIDComm aim to support.</p>
<p>Some core themes throughout this conversation were interoperability and avoiding locking into a specific implementation. The implementation of new formats for credentials can create obstacles for adoption, so providing a simple and secure credential agnostic protocol can help with interoperability, and therefore adoption. </p>
<p>In designing OpenID4VC, it was made a priority to support different credentials formats, identifiers, cryptography suites and trust management mechanisms. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z4cYfjbbE-rABcfC-xab8miocKLomivYMUFibOh9BVo/edit#gid=1084392809">This spreadsheet</a>&nbsp;should give a good idea of the complexity of the landscape of credential profiles and more.</p>
<p>As we’re reaching mid-March 2023, OpenID4VC seems to be gaining significant traction in the decentralized identity community. It has been incorporated into various industry standards, including the ISO/IEC 29184-8 standard for decentralized identity, and its issuance and verification protocols (OpenID4CI and OpenID4VP using SIOPv2) have been made “MUSTS” in the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">European Union’s Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework</a>.</p>
<p>I was fortunate in this latest podcast to sit down and chat with Torsten Lodderstedt, one of the co-authors of the OpenID4VC specification. I hope you enjoy the discussion and find it as informative as I did.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode with Torsten, him and I discuss,<br><br></p>
 
 OpenID4VC’s background, and its relationship to oAuth2 and OpenID Connect. 
 How verifiable credential issuances and verifications are done using OpenID4CI and OIDC4VP (+ why Presentation Exchange was chosen as the verification protocol). 
 Decisions behind supporting different credentials formats, identifiers, cryptography suites and trust management mechanisms. 
 How OpenID4VC fits within the ToIP Hourglass Model (from the <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/TechArch/blob/main/spec.md">ToIP Technical Architecture Specification</a>). 
 How OpenID4VC can be used in conjunction with other protocols such as DIDComm to bootstrap workflows. 
 Does OpenID4VC combined with trust frameworks help to solve the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR problem</a> we face today on the internet? 
 SIOP: the protocol to exchange cryptographically verifiable identifiers and authenticate using the key material controlled by the End-User. 
 Using OpenID4CI for ISO 18013-5 (mDL) to move away from wallet-specific credential issuance and towards an interoperable way of exchanging verifiable credentials between different decentralized identity systems.

Abstract <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. The first phase of Ocean was about building the core infrastructure for the open data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Ocean has entered its next phase: to drive data value-creation loops by focusing on the users in the last mile: data dapp developers, data scientists, and data-oriented crypto enthusiasts.</p><p>To meet these aims, we’ve re-organized ourselves into three specific streams, one for each user type. This post shared the plans for each of the streams and their respective users.</p> 2. Introduction  2.1. Ocean Foundations <p>Ocean Protocol was <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/909793166416662528">launched in 2017</a> with a whitepaper and a promise: to create the building blocks and tools to unleash an open, permissionless and secure data economy. It&nbsp;asked:</p><blockquote>How can we equalize access to data, and therefore opportunity to make the most of modern AI and&nbsp;compute?</blockquote><p>We shipped Ocean V1 to enable data sovereignty (“your keys, your data”). Ocean V2 enabled privacy via <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">Compute-to-Data</a>. We shipped Ocean V3 in 2020 with ERC20 <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/data-nfts-and-data-tokens">datatokens</a> to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-posts-413b2dd33e8f">leverage</a> other crypto services: where every wallet could be a data custodian, every DEX a data exchange, every DAO a data DAO. V3 met the whitepaper’s goals.</p><p>In 2022 we shipped <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-overview-1ccd4a7ce150">Ocean V4</a>, which refined V3: data NFTs to clarify intellectual property rights and help publishers and marketplaces monetize. We also shipped Data Farming (DF) and veOCEAN staking. We met all our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2022-e4263fa55549">2022 product goals</a>. Since then, we’ve further refined the Ocean stack towards reliability and usability.</p> 2.2. A New Phase: Drive Value Creation Via User&nbsp;Focus <p>The five years of Ocean (2017–2022) was the first phase: building the core infrastructure for the open data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>During this phase, hundreds of teams tried out new ideas, 20+ strong teams built data dapps, dozens of data scientists used Ocean in data competitions and more, and hundreds of crypto enthusiasts engaged with Ocean Data Farming — amongst the <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x967da4048cd07ab37855c090aaf366e4ce1b9f48">45,000</a> holders of&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>How do these people sustain and thrive in this burgeoning Data&nbsp;Economy?</p><p>Our hypothesis is — to ensure that they can make money! Specifically, create value from data, make money from that value, and loop back and reinvest this value creation into further growth. All the while, Ocean aims to be the orchestration and tooling for deeper and more complex value loops. The focus of the Ocean core team for 2023 and beyond is to realize this hypothesis. Put another&nbsp;way:</p><blockquote>Ocean has entered its next phase: to drive data value-creation loops, by focusing on the users in the last&nbsp;mile.</blockquote><p>The figure below illustrates.</p>Figure: The Data Value-Creation Loop. At the top, the user gets data by either buying it, or spending $ to create it. Then, they build an AI model from the data, then make predictions (e.g. “ETH will rise in next 10 minutes”) and choose actions (e.g. “buy ETH”). In executing these actions, they will make $ on average. The $ earned can be looped back into further activities.<p>In this loop, dapp builders can help their users make money; data scientists can earn directly; and crypto enthusiasts can catalyze the first two if incentivized properly (e.g. to curate valuable&nbsp;data).</p><p>DeFi &amp; LLMs. We analyzed dozens of possible verticals with respect to how quickly someone goes through the data value creation loop, and how much impact Ocean can have. The most promising and mature vertical is decentralized finance (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/defi/">DeFi</a>). Already in Q4/2022, the Ocean core team started to bias activities towards DeFi in our data challenges, internal research and funding programs, without constraining the Ocean community or applications elsewhere. With the release of ChatGPT and influx of attention to AI, the vertical of large language models (LLMs) and related AI tech is highly promising. Ocean’s core proposition was to be at the intersection of AI, data and blockchain. The Ocean core team is exploring ways to support the growth of AI and stay ahead of the&nbsp;pack.</p><p>Loops, then Scale. Once one or two data-value creation loops have been established on Ocean, where people are sustainably making money, we will help to scale those loops up by extending our technology and integrations so that developers and data engineers can do more and more over time. Our aim is to grow over the long-term, until Ocean is ubiquitous as a tool for orchestration and monetization.</p> 2.3. 2023+ Ocean Core Team Goals &amp;&nbsp;Setup <p>Ocean core team has set its aims accordingly: help data dapp developers, data scientists, and crypto enthusiasts to drive data value-creation loops.</p><p>To meet these aims, we’ve re-organized ourselves into three specific streams: Stream 1 (Eagle Rays) for developers, Stream 2 (Thresher) for data scientists, and Stream 3 (Sailfish) for crypto enthusiasts. The figure below illustrates.</p>Ocean core team’s aims: help (1) data dapp developers, (2) data scientists, and (3) crypto enthusiasts to drive data value-creation loops. The team is organized around these three&nbsp;aims. 2.4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <p>Ocean core team has transitioned from building out a product specified by a whitepaper and annual roadmaps, to doing “whatever it takes” to drive data value creation. Accordingly, the measure of success changes from “was X built” to “how well are metrics for the data economy growing?”</p><p>Specifically, we track progress via these&nbsp;metrics:</p>  The main metric is data consume volume (DCV) in USD on Ocean, i.e. how much money is spent buying &amp; consuming data and AI assets in a given time&nbsp;period.  <p>Other key performance indicators (KPIs)&nbsp;are:</p>  # Ocean transactions,  # dapps deployed using&nbsp;Ocean,  # data scientists using&nbsp;Ocean,  # assets published on Ocean,&nbsp;and  # OCEAN&nbsp;locked.  <p>We have set up internal measures for these metrics and will make them public when&nbsp;ready.</p>KPIs for Ocean core team. The main metric is $ data consume volume (DCV). It’s flanked by five supporting metrics. 2.5. Outline <p>This introduction has outlined Ocean’s first phase — creating the building blocks &amp; tools as a foundation for an open, permissionless, secure data economy. And it introduced Ocean’s next phase: driving data value-creation loops, by focusing on the users in the last-mile.</p><p>We are now in a position to share the plans for each of the teams, and their respective users. The rest of this post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2 — DApp Developers served by Team Eagle-Rays (Stream&nbsp;1)  Section 3 — Data Scientists served by team Thresher (Stream&nbsp;2)  Section 4 — Crypto-Enthusiasts served by team Sailfish (Stream&nbsp;3)   3. Dapp Developers served by Team Eagle-Rays (Stream&nbsp;1) [Spotted Eagle Ray. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spotted_Eagle_Ray_%28Aetobatus_narinari%292.jpg">Image by John Norton. License:&nbsp;CC-BY</a>] 3.1. Overview <p>Ocean core team has created building blocks and tools towards enabling an open, permissionless, secure data economy [1]. Dapp developers in the ecosystem can then build last-mile data dapps that use these building blocks and tools. Ocean makes it possible to quickly build &amp; ship decentralized data marketplaces, token-gated dapps, dapps with secure non-custodial user data, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>While the Ocean stack has made great progress, there are still challenges. The developer experience is suboptimal and sometimes leads to projects being “lost” in the fray. The core team has only partial visibility on dapps being built, and often fails to provide appropriate support to the development teams. Finally, it can be difficult for developers to see the full potential of possible use cases when given just the building blocks &amp;&nbsp;tools.</p><p>We can improve this. The priority for team Eagle-Rays is to help developers build sustainable dapps on top of Ocean Protocol with minimal friction.</p><p>The target outcomes for team Eagle Rays&nbsp;are:</p>  A developer can build a sustainable dapp on Ocean stack, within 1 month of interaction with Ocean Protocol development team. Where “sustainable” means that the dapp creates income towards the team supporting itself with a viable business model, and ultimately thriving.  Ocean becomes the meeting point for data dapp builders — a place for sharing development tools &amp; templates, for support, and for funding of new&nbsp;ideas.  <p>Team Eagle-Rays will run these activities towards achieving the&nbsp;goals:</p>  Gather community feedback  Improve dapp developer support  Run a dapp dashboard to highlight projects building on&nbsp;Ocean  Create demos to expose the capabilities of Ocean to developers  Host workshops &amp; hackathons to onboard developers into&nbsp;Ocean  Provide referrals &amp; funding for promising teams  <p>The following subsections have&nbsp;details.</p> 3.2. Gather Community Feedback <p>Our first goal is to gain a better understanding of the current state of&nbsp;affairs.</p><p>In the coming weeks we will have one-on-one conversations with the 20+ teams building data dapps on Ocean. We will understand the challenges they face and how we can serve them better in terms of tools and the technical support.</p><p>From this, we’ll compile a list of learnings, hypotheses and follow-up actions.</p> 3.3. Improve Developer Support <p>Rather than being merely reactive — responding to requests when something is not working — we aim to be proactive in supporting the developers building dapps on top of Ocean Protocol. To assist the teams from the moment they begin their journey, advising on the design, through to final implementation, and feedback after the dapp goes&nbsp;live.</p><p>To better allocate internal resources towards high-potential projects, we will define tiers of guidance &amp; technical support. Allocation is based on the level of engagement the dapp team has with Ocean Protocol. It may be as much as a dedicated core team member being allocated to that dapp&nbsp;team.</p><p>We will consolidate existing technical support channels and revamp the support procedures. We will refresh the product documentation, to speed up onboarding of developers.</p> 3.4. Run a Dapp Dashboard <p>To further raise the prominence of dapps on Ocean, we will launch &amp; run a new Dapp Dashboard, linked from oceanprotocol.com.</p><p>Every month, the dashboard will highlight one or two teams building on Ocean, to spread the word and help raise awareness for the&nbsp;teams.</p> 3.5. Create Demos &amp; Scaffolding <p>Having built the building blocks and tools of the Ocean stack, Ocean core developers intimately know the potential of Ocean to unlock data sharing and monetization.</p><p>To accelerate broader understanding and education, core developers will build a portfolio of demos and scaffolding (templates), to showcase the capabilities of Ocean, show what is possible and inspire more developers to build their ideas on Ocean. We aim to release one demo per month, showcasing various business scenarios or use cases where Ocean can be&nbsp;used.</p> 3.6. Host Workshops &amp; Hackathons <p>To engage more with our developer community, by organizing bi-weekly and monthly technical workshops where we’ll take deep dives into selected technical aspects of our platform.</p><p>We will run quarterly hackathons, with the target&nbsp;goals:</p>  Rapid prototyping: To quickly test new ideas for sustainable data&nbsp;dapps.  Community building: To bring people together in the Ocean community and together explore what a new data economy can look&nbsp;like.  Innovation &amp; idea generation: To generate new use cases for within the new data economy using&nbsp;Ocean  Skill development: To help dapp developers learn new skills, via a project that pushes them outside their comfort&nbsp;zone.   3.7. Provide Referrals and&nbsp;Funding <p>Once a dapp team is building on Ocean, the Ocean core team offers a range of non-technical support to help ease launching a viable dapp. This includes referrals to vetted legal, financial and organizational partners.</p><p>It also includes potential funding support, as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Ocean Shipyard — funding high quality teams to test out their&nbsp;ideas  Ocean Ventures — investing between $25,000-$100,000 into Pre-Seed and Seed rounds for dapp&nbsp;teams  Ocean Ecosystem Fund — a $10 million pool of capital pledged by Cypher Capital and Faculty Fund to invest in dapp&nbsp;teams   4. Data Scientists served by team Thresher (Stream&nbsp;2) [Thresher Shark. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/raven_malta/7123834169">Image by Raven Malta. License: CC-BY-SA</a>] 4.1. Overview <p>Team Thresher’s aim is to help data scientists make $ from their data and algorithms on&nbsp;Ocean.</p><p>Let’s unpack. Thresher’s target users are data scientists. They use Python extensively. They’re quite familiar with key AI/ML tools like numpy, and scikit-learn. They love algorithms. They are Web3-curious, though not necessarily Web3 experts. They loathe&nbsp;devops.</p><p>The Ocean value proposition for them is: with Ocean, data scientists can sell compelling data feeds powered by an algorithm of their design, while the algorithm stays private, with zero&nbsp;devops.</p><p>Accordingly, Team Thresher has these top-level goals:</p>  Make it easy for data scientists to create compelling data feeds and to sell them via&nbsp;Ocean  Grow the community of data scientists creating &amp; selling compelling data&nbsp;feeds.  <p>Team Thresher will run these activities towards achieving the&nbsp;goals:</p>  Run predict-ETH &amp; other objective data challenges, which guide data scientists to sell compelling data&nbsp;feeds  Run subjective data challenges, which drive insight, community, and partnerships  Ship open, compelling data feeds, which data scientists can fork and ship as their&nbsp;own  Reduce friction in data scientists’ (Python) flows. Especially, make ocean.py “just&nbsp;work”  Other tools to demonstrate capabilities and drive&nbsp;traction  <p>Each subsection below elaborates on these&nbsp;points.</p> 4.2. Run Predict-ETH &amp; Other Objective Data Challenges <p>Team Thresher uses Data Challenges to help walk data scientists down the garden path to monetize. They start by entering competitions, yet end up shipping compelling data feeds that make $$. Here’s&nbsp;how.</p>We use Data Challenges to help walk guide data scientists towards making money with their algorithms. They start by entering competitions, and end up shipping compelling data feeds that make&nbsp;$$.<p>Data challenges are competitions that invite participants to solve data-related problems, with prize money attached. They provide a platform to practice solving data problems, to collaborate, and to make $. They have become popular in recent years, being hosted by many companies and research institutions.</p><p>In a typical data challenge, a data scientist learns about the challenge, works on it to devise an algorithm, and submits an entry to the competition.</p><p>We take this further: the data scientist also submits a data feed powered by the data scientist’s algorithm, where the data feed is live and for sale on Ocean Market. If this algorithm is compelling enough, then people will buy it, and the data scientist will make&nbsp;$.</p><p>Predict-ETH. The prime example is the monthly <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth">Predict-ETH challenge</a>. This challenge has competitors submit predictions for the price of ETH 1, 2,&nbsp;…, 12 hours into the future. If the data scientist can create accurate predictions, there’s $ to be made from trading. This is compelling data. In upcoming rounds of Predict-ETH, competitors will also be guided to submit token-gated data feeds that generate ETH predictions upon request. These feeds are directly monetizable. If the predictions are good, others will buy&nbsp;them.</p><p>Now, the data scientist is making $ by winning the competition, AND making even more $$ by selling the feeds of their algorithms.</p><p>When they’re making $, they’re sticking around to make more $, all using the Ocean&nbsp;stack.</p><p>This scales. As data scientists make $ and stick around, they share with their friends, leading to organic growth. So an initial handful of data scientists can grow to tens, then hundreds, then thousands. All creating compelling data feeds; all kickstarting an open, permissionless, secure data&nbsp;economy.</p> 4.3. Run Subjective Data Challenges <p>The strategy of the previous section is best suited to data challenges with an objective quantitative metric like normalized mean-squared error (nmse) like in Predict-ETH.</p><p>There are also subjective data challenges — where judges assess qualitative metrics. We are running these too. Here’s&nbsp;why.</p><p>Benefits to data scientists:</p>  Tools to demonstrate capabilities and drive adoption: helps data scientists to promote their work. This can include dashboards, visualizations, and other features that help users give insights into&nbsp;data.  A means for organizations to partner with Ocean core team and share their data. The partner gets the benefits of people analyzing their data, and learning more about the Ocean stack. E.g. Government of Catalonia  Providing more broadly accessible competitions. Subjective challenges appeal to a different demographic of data scientists — ones that prefer the “insight” side of data science over stark objective values  <p>Benefits to Ocean core&nbsp;team:</p>  Qualitative feedback on Ocean&nbsp;stack  Learn more about data scientist tools and workflows  Learn more about a new vertical, problem space, or subproblem. Without having to go directly to an objective data challenge.   4.4. Ship Compelling Data&nbsp;Feeds <p>The best way for competitors to create compelling data feeds is… to fork other compelling data feeds! So, Team Thresher is working to create compelling data feeds that are also open (and therefore forkable). To start, we’re doing this for predictions of ETH. We’ll do this for other objective competitions in the future as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Q: if Ocean can make such valuable algorithms, why would it make them&nbsp;open?</p><p>A: Ocean aims to kickstart a whole data economy, which means we want many participants shipping compelling data feeds. To catalyze this, we give them a starting point, where they can make $ with little extra&nbsp;effort!</p> 4.5. Reduce Friction in Data Scientist Flows <p>As described, Thresher’s target users are data scientists, who use Python extensively.</p><p>We want to make it as low-friction for them to use Ocean in their Python-based flows. Especially in the flows around monetizing their algorithms, as discussed above.</p><p>To reduce friction in their flows, this includes: make ocean.py “just work”. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py">ocean.py</a> is a Python library on pypi. It’s the main interface for Python users to get Ocean capabilities, such as publishing a file or algorithm, creating datatokens (access tokens), and sharing or selling those. We’ve discovered that when people use it, they often run into “gotchas” in OSes or dependencies on Ocean Aquarius / Provider.</p><p>Furthermore, this includes: making ocean.py more accessible in a broader set of Python workflows. E.g. have it as part of the default Anaconda distribution.</p> 4.6. Other Tools to Demo Capabilities and Drive&nbsp;Traction <p>We see many opportunities of tools to help potential users better understand Ocean capabilities, try out Ocean, and ultimately drive adoption. Especially in DeFi and LLMs. We keep this open-ended here for&nbsp;now.</p> 5. Crypto-Enthusiasts served by team Sailfish (Stream&nbsp;3) [Sailfish. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/usoceangov/34185942223">Image by Rodrigo Friscione. License: Public&nbsp;Domain</a>] 5.1. Overview <p>Last year, the Ocean core team launched Data Farming and veOCEAN. veOCEAN aligns near-term with long-term perspectives in the burgeoning data economy. By Q4, Data Farming was driving up to 1.5M $USD in Data Consume Volume (DCV) per week with up-to 75K $OCEAN in rewards being distributed to data&nbsp;farmers.</p><p>Every participant who contributes value to this data economy should benefit from it. This includes work by staking &amp; curating, building dapps that integrate veOCEAN &amp; Data Farming, or otherwise.</p><p>Team Sailfish builds on this promising start. Our mission is to help crypto enthusiasts — especially web3-native Ocean participants — to earn in the Ocean ecosystem. These participants do work to reap economic rewards, and the system harnesses this work to further drive Ocean DCV via dapps and data scientists. For example, staking on data assets helps data curation in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>Besides driving DCV, another KPI we focus on is to increase the # participants in Data Farming and their APYs, by specifically targeting (a) OCEAN holders that have not yet engaged with veOCEAN (b) veOCEAN holders whose APYs can be improved, and (c ) Publishers who can benefit from boosting.</p><p>Towards these goals, Team Sailfish will run these activities:</p>  Launch &amp; Complete DF&nbsp;Main  Refine DF&nbsp;Rewards  Serve DeFi dapp Builders&nbsp;Better  Other KPI-Driving Activities  <p>The following subsections have&nbsp;details.</p> 5.2. Launch &amp; Complete DF&nbsp;Main <p>DF has several phases: DF Alpha, DF/VE Alpha, DF Beta, and DF Main. DF Main is soon: it starts in DF Round 29 (Mar 16,&nbsp;2023).</p> Trent McConaghy on Twitter: "Data Farming @oceanprotocol schedule: - DF alpha - rounds 1-4 (4 wks)- DF/VE alpha - rounds 5-8 (4 wks)- DF beta - rounds 9-28 (20 wks)- DF main - rounds 29+ (decades)DF main is coming soon!Good overview:https://t.co/kbBHiQEzW7 / Twitter" <p>Data Farming @oceanprotocol schedule: - DF alpha - rounds 1-4 (4 wks)- DF/VE alpha - rounds 5-8 (4 wks)- DF beta - rounds 9-28 (20 wks)- DF main - rounds 29+ (decades)DF main is coming soon!Good overview:https://t.co/kbBHiQEzW7</p><p>DF Main is the final “production” phase where the largest amounts of OCEAN are dispensed. It vests OCEAN with a 4-year half-life (like Bitcoin) into rewards for Data&nbsp;Farming.</p><p>Given the large amounts of OCEAN, we follow the time-tested approach of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">ratcheting up value-at-risk over time</a>. Specifically, we’ll first deploy a “canary” vesting contract that will hold just a small amount of OCEAN, and manually top up weekly DF rewards. Once the system has stabilized and contracts are verified (via bug bounty &amp; security audit) then we will deploy the remaining amount.</p><p>In completing DF Main, OCEAN vesting &amp; related will be fully automated and on-chain. This will serve the Ocean ecosystem well in the decades that follow, with more transparency, stability, and composability.</p> 5.3. Refine DF&nbsp;Rewards <p>Improvements to the Reward Function (RF) create new pull-mechanisms that help drive DCV and other metrics. An example is the introduction of Data Farming and how much Data Consume Volume it&nbsp;drove.</p><p>Every week DF emits OCEAN rewards, according to a pre-set schedule. We want to maximize the bang-for-the buck of these emissions in driving traction.</p><p>Accordingly, we spend effort to refine DF rewards. Recent changes&nbsp;include:</p>  We recently introduced <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508">publisher rewards</a> — giving publishers 2x effective stake — to catalyze more data being published into&nbsp;Ocean.  For DF29, wash consume will become unprofitable. Until then, it’s profitable because users receive more rewards than the 0.1% fee they&nbsp;pay.  <p>To drive DCV further, we envision more refinements of DF Rewards. Besides tuning the existing function, we can split the weekly active DF rewards budget into sub-streams. New sub-streams could&nbsp;include:</p>  Dapp Data Farming. If a dapp running Ocean uses x$ of gas, pay the dapp developer 25–100% * x (denominated in OCEAN). This could be an excellent way for dapp developers to monetize&nbsp;[2]  Competition Data Farming. At some point, some of the Stream 2 data competitions can get streamlined &amp; automated enough to put into weekly DF&nbsp;ops.  Other publisher schemes. Eg high-touch schemes to onboard publishers and ensure they get paid. Maybe less automated, but could be vertical helpful in the next 6–18&nbsp;months.   5.4. Serve DeFi Dapp Builders&nbsp;Better <p>We will know that we have succeeded when we can observe many products, features, and case studies showing organic demand and validate end-to-end value flows on top of the protocol.</p><p>In 2022, it was important for us to build the systems that get us from 0 → 1 with veOCEAN and DF. So, our focus was largely on core software.</p><p>For 2023, our focus is core software and customer success — success of (a) OCEAN holders and of (b) DeFi-oriented dapp builders. Previous sections focused on (a) OCEAN&nbsp;holders.</p><p>We want to serve (b) DeFi-oriented dapp builders better. Specifically, builders that are building out the DeFi side of OCEAN, veOCEAN, and Data&nbsp;Farming.</p><p>A prime example is <a href="https://www.h2odata.xyz/">H2O</a>’s introduction of psdnOCEAN, for liquid staking of OCEAN. psdnOCEAN provides improved UX, higher APY and more liquidity than default veOCEAN. We view this as a success&nbsp;story.</p><p>We ask: what other DeFi-oriented dapp builders can we engage with, and serve better? Can OCEAN or veOCEAN integrate with DeFi loan protocols like Aave? Can we guide teams to build fractionalized Data NFTs, revenue-backed loans, or&nbsp;other?</p> 5.5. Other KPI-Driving Activities <p>We aim to improve these&nbsp;KPIs:</p>  # OCEAN holders participating in&nbsp;veOCEAN  APY for veOCEAN and Data Farming participants  # Publishers with multiple quality data&nbsp;sets  Publisher volume and&nbsp;APY  <p>We have several hypotheses of how to drive these KPIs. We don’t know which will work. We will test ideas, learn, and iterate. Therefore, this section is open-ended. Let’s see where it takes&nbsp;us!</p> 6. Conclusion <p>Ocean was founded to create the building blocks and tools to unleash an open, permissionless and secure data economy. The first phase of Ocean was about building the core infrastructure for the open data economy. Ocean has entered its next phase: to drive data value-creation loops, by focusing on the users in the last mile: data dapp developers, data scientists, and data-oriented crypto enthusiasts.</p><p>To meet these aims, we’ve re-organized ourselves into three specific streams: Stream 1 (Eagle Rays) for developers, Stream 2 (Thresher) for data scientists, and Stream 3 (Sailfish) for crypto enthusiasts.</p><p>This post shared the plans for each of the streams, and their respective users.</p> 7. Notes <p>[1] Besides building block primitives and tools, the Ocean core team may also build with “baseline apps” like Ocean Market (decentralized data&nbsp;market)</p><p>[2] It’s a bit like how NEAR and Canto L1s pay a % of tx fees to dapp developers.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter</a> or <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a> to keep up to date.

				  Indicio Proven™ Finance is a complete verifiable credential solution for banks, financial service companies, and payment providers, providing seamless customer account authentication, consent-based data sharing, data privacy compliance,&nbsp; and reusable KYC, AML, and KYB.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Banking, financial services, and payments are entering a period of intense digital transformation around new platforms, seamless processes, data democratization,&nbsp; automation, and personalization.</p>
<p>Combined, all these trends will deliver dramatically better financial products and services to customers, drive financial inclusion, eliminate inefficiencies, and provide more convenience and better customer experiences. This isn’t just top-down innovation, digital natives who have grown up interacting with the world through their mobile devices expect digital interactions to be seamless.</p>
<p>But to achieve this kind of digital transformation, banks, financial institutions, and third-party providers will need to overcome three powerful, trend-killing, obstacles: Data privacy, data security, and data trust.</p>
<p>This is why we launched <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven-finance/">Indicio Proven Finance</a>. It’s an application of our award-winning open-source verifiable credential technology, designed to deliver privacy, to provide consent to data sharing, and to verify identity and data in a seamless, secure way through the use of open-source digital identity technologies.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven Finance launches with:</p>
 
 A verifiable bank account credential — for bank account holders to prove that they are the owners of their bank account. 
 A verifiable KYC credential — for reusing costly, time-consuming identity assurance.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Verifier software—so that bank partners, and third parties — including retailers — can seamlessly verify financial data with the consent of the customer, including payments. 
 
<p>Why verifiable credentials are a powerful way to transform finance</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials remove the need for usernames and passwords, or sharing other personal data in order to securely access a bank account. With a verifiable credential, a customer can create a direct, encrypted communication to their bank and the bank can know that this communication can only come from this customer.</p>
<p>How does this happen? In simplified terms, verification uses the metadata in the credential to find and check the public cryptographic keys related to the account credential which are stored on a distributed ledger network. And this happens over an encrypted communication channel that can only come from the account holder.</p>
<p>This means that a bank can immediately and authoritatively know that their customer is their customer; the account holder can also immediately and authoritatively know they are talking to their bank. Seamless login to an account is also faster and easier for the account holder — passwords do not have to be remembered and changed and there are no multiple authentication steps.</p>
<p>But this kind of verification can be easily extended to bank partners, third-party fintech providers,&nbsp; and the marketplace at large. If someone trusts your bank, they can use the same verification process to trust that you are the owner of your account, which means onboarding can be simplified and online payments can be verified. Only you can verify a payment.</p>
<p>And then, because verifiable credential technology allows people to hold and prove the authenticity of their own data, there is no need for a third-party to involve itself in this process. This radically simplifies data privacy compliance. Customers can consent to share their data and they can share their data in special privacy-preserving ways, such as selective disclosure or predicate proofs (where data can be validated by “yes” or “no” answers).</p>
<p>The value proposition goes even further when it comes to replacing or enhancing APIs (see our article, <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-didcomm-economy/">The DIDComm Economy</a>), but the bottom line is this: a verifiable account credential is the gateway to digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can you get started?</p>
<p>The goal of Indicio’s Proven product range is to give you everything you need to quickly start issuing and verifying credentials. This isn’t a technology that requires you to start over or take months to deploy: it can be integrated into your current identity and access systems and workflows in weeks and scale at a pace that meets your needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio provides all the components—along with the support, training, and continuous upgrades needed to deliver success. Critically,&nbsp; Indicio Proven Finance is a fully open source product that you fully own. There is no vendor lock-in. We’re happy to customize it to your needs but you are free to do this on your own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wow, what a week! </p><p>Holochain participated in this year’s build week (BUIDLWeek) at ETHDenver, and we can only call it a rousing success. We hosted four separate events with over 500 total registrations between them and some 100 people we met and worked with over the week, showing great interest in what we are building. With Beta live and Holochain growing, this was a fantastic opportunity to grow the community, help people build, and collectively imagine a new future.</p> ETHDenver? <p>You’ve seen us talking about ETHDenver and our participation there for the last month but without any broader explanation of what that means, so let's take a second to add a little background.</p><p>ETHDenver, hosted by SporkDAO in Denver Colorado, is a week long unconference with a preceding “BUIDL” &nbsp;week focused on software building. Over the past several years it has become a major annual gathering point for Ethereum and Web3 enthusiasts. It includes two weeks of events hosted by numerous Web3 organizations across the city of Denver, with opportunities for networking, learning, business development, and building the next web. </p><p>We know that Holochain sits on the edge of this world. We aren’t an Ethereum project or even a blockchain, but we are building a decentralized (and distributed!) framework for applications alongside the rest of the people working on what many refer to as Web3.</p><p>This was an opportunity to show the Ethereum community a different way of doing Web3, and seek ways of integrating the unique capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain and Holochain.</p> Intentions <p>A few of our team had been to ETHDenver in the past as individuals, but we’ve never hosted our own events there before. Why now?</p><p>Well, a big part of it is Beta. We have a usable product and are finally turning our energy outward and working to grow our community. We need experienced developers with an understanding of distributed frameworks and an entrepreneurial spirit. The Ethereum community has people who meet that criteria. </p><p>EthDenver also gave us the opportunity to sample the Web3 movement so we could hear first hand both what is alive and what needs people have. We want to build critical infrastructure for developers and to help them create innovative businesses that meet real needs. Learning about people's pain points and what other projects are doing is an important part of doing that well. </p><p>We’ve never done events of this sort and size before, so running these events also felt like a testing ground for our new dev tools and the organization as a whole. More on that later but, let’s just say we learned a lot!</p><p>Finally, we wanted to connect with our local Colorado community, devs and non-devs alike.</p> The events <p>We hosted two different types of events, our build days and an open space.</p> BUIDL Days <p>We hosted three build days where we gave developers a first-hand experience of Holochain. &nbsp;These day-long events were the perfect opportunity to test out our new <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/scaffolding-my-first-happ-in-10-minutes/">scaffolding tools</a> and help people build cool things.</p><p>Check out this video of a participant describing his first impressions of Holochain.</p> Imagining Web 2030: Open Space <p>Our open space event was centered on the web of the future, attracting over 70 participants who came together to think deeply about the web we want to build. </p><p>An open space format doesn’t feature a single presenter, but is rather based on a set of breakout sessions where any participant can host a topic of conversation. This fosters a lot of focused discussion while enabling those who are natural pollinators to share ideas between groups. </p><p>We were inspired by the community and their questions. There were sessions on topics such as: </p><blockquote>“How has centralized technology unconsciously shaped what we believe is possible?” </blockquote><p>and </p><blockquote>“How do existing laws, policies, and governance models need to change to support a human-centric web?” </blockquote><p>We really think this is just the start of many more conversations to come. </p>Open Space events allow for collective organization, much like Holochain What we learned <p>With developers hammering away at our new tools for three days, we quickly learned a lot about setting up dev environments for new users' needs, running the scaffolding tool, and the best ways to guide people through building on Holochain. Often, these devs came from different backgrounds in software development, engineering and distributed tech.</p><p>As an organization we are all about iterative processes. This meant that the three build days were the perfect testing ground for our teaching processes, Holochain Beta, the install configs, and our new rapid application development (RAD) tools. &nbsp;</p><p>While we are still integrating many of these learnings, some potential outcomes include:</p>  Open office hours on <a href="https://discord.gg/k55DS5dmPH?ref=blog.holochain.org">Discord</a> to help new devs get set up  Online build events of various skill levels  Systems that support local files for install downloads when hosting hackathons  Integration of the ‘how-to’ in build days and ‘why bother’ in exploration events  <p>Similarly, we learned a lot about how to improve the way we run events in our new beta landscape. From calculating how much space and food we need to plan for based on sign-ups, to the information we need to include on event onesheets, but most of all we took another step in learning about our community. Both those of you who have been with us from the beginning, and those just learning about our work. </p><p>We plan to take all these lessons and ensure that future events are better, smoother, and more exciting. That is the nature of iterative growth.</p><p>We are excited to be growing alongside you. </p><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/#subscribe">Sign up to our newsletter</a> for more events and happenings at Holochain</p>

<p>For those of you who don't know HD Moore (which would be surprising if you are in security), he is a pioneer of the cybersecurity industry. He has dedicated his career to vulnerability research, network discovery, and software development since the 1990s. He is most recognized for creating Metasploit and is a passionate advocate for open-source software and vulnerability disclosure. </p>

<p>HD currently serves as the CTO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.runzero.com/">runZero</a>, a provider of cutting-edge cyber asset management software and cloud services. Prior to founding runZero, he held leadership positions at Atredis Partners, Rapid7, and BreakingPoint. HD has also been a frequent speaker at industry events such as Black Hat and DEF CON.</p>

<p>We can also add to his resume: Google Super Administrator. </p>

<p>What is your role/company?</p>
<p>I started Rumble (now <a href="https://www.runzero.com/">runZero</a>) back in 2018. It is a network discovery and asset inventory platform. I was the only employee for a couple of years until  I brought in a chief architect and convinced Chris Kirsch (now CEO) to join at the end of 2020. We are now at about 100 people.</p>

<p>Why/How did you get designated as the Google Administrator? How long did you hold this role?</p>
<p>I was the first employee. I had a choice: Google or Microsoft. G Suite at the time had all kinds of quirks and bugs and issues, but I felt they were the lesser of the two evils, especially for email deliverability. Everything was just more straightforward and familiar with Google.  </p>

<p>Now our IT team owns the day-to-day administration work like onboarding, and offboarding. I still jump in and help out with things like DNS management or spot check on the security side</p>

<p>What is the strangest thing you encountered using Google Workspace?</p>
<p>Oh, man. There's so much weird stuff. The two biggest gotchas I've run into are both related to domains.</p>

<p>First, Google domains are tied to individual user accounts, not tied to the organization. Let’s say you create your main admin user called admin@ and then you register a bunch of domains using <a href="https://domains.google/">,Google Domains</a> and DNS. Now, later on, I need to remove that user, admin@ and re-add it as HD@. You can no longer see (or manage) your domains! They're gone once you removed admin@! There's pretty much no way to get them back without restoring the user account or using an email-based domain transfer process (assuming transfer lock was disabled when you deleted the user). You want to make sure there's more than one person added as an admin to each domain you manage.</p>

<p>Second is moving everyone to the new company domain name - for instance we were Rumble and then we became <a href="https://www.runzero.com/">runZero</a>. You start with creating aliases for all of your users in the secondary domain on the primary domain. After you set that up, you say I'm ready to change my primary domain. </p>

<p>To be clear: We did dry runs. We set up a temporary organization. We created a giant 40-page plan. We did all these things to make sure we wouldn't cause any issues. We cleared our schedules at the end of the day Friday and we were ready to change the domains. We went to hit the button and Google says, “oh, you can't do that.” If you want to move your primary domain to a secondary domain, it won’t allow you to unless you remove every single alias of the secondary domain first.</p>

<p>So now we have to delete sales@runzero, admin, help, etc., but in the process, you would be bouncing emails for those aliases. So to reduce the time of non-functioning email, the IT team and I had 15 screens open and we're like, “Okay, GO!” And we furiously start removing all the aliases and creating new entries one at a time.</p>

<p>Then we hit the transfer button and of course, something else broke. </p>

<p>So what should have been like a five-second “Hit the button, do the migration” turned into two to three hours of frantic clicking and hunting around the Google interface trying to find dangling references to old domains.  </p>

<p>And of course, during that period, no one could contact us by email on the new domain.</p>

<p>Any funny mishaps you want to share?</p>
<p>More annoying than funny.</p>

<p>The integration between our payroll provider and Google Workspace can create some policy wrinkles. When our HR staff adds a new employee we have an automated process that calls out to Google and creates the new email account. It will automatically send the temp password link on their start date. </p>

<p>Between when the account is created and the user actually starts, we show as being out of compliance on our SOC2 dashboard because they haven’t set MFA yet because they haven't logged in yet. We sorted that out with a policy override.</p>

<p>But the most frustrating thing is when you terminate a user in our payroll platform; it immediately deletes the user from Google, which is not the way you want to offboard. You want to be able to move over calendars and Google Drive, etc.. So we have to go back into Google, undelete the user, do the transfer, and then delete the account again. It adds another step to our offboarding process.</p>

<p>What is one thing you wish you had set up / knew earlier in your (short) IT career?</p>
<p>Google Workspace has changed quite a bit in the last four years. But the UI is still terrible and you have to click 15 times to get things done.</p>

<p>Google has APIs to do many things that the UI does not, which is highly annoying because it's hard to discover these very useful functionalities, especially if there is an emergency or you just want to automate repetitive stuff. There are two areas you have to watch for updates: Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). They overlap in functionality, and it's unclear where to look for what and when.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM">,GAM</a> is awesome. [GAM is a command line tool for Google Workspace admins to manage domain and user settings quickly and easily.] You can get on the command line and do actions. GAM also has functionality that they don’t have in the Google Workspace UI. Like it is the only way to do a silent delegation of someone’s inbox (let’s say - if they are a salesperson leaving).</p>

<p>To set up GAM to manage your Google Workspace, GAM needs to be set up as a service account in Google Cloud Provider (GCP), and then GAM needs permissions for various services, including GWS, which is controlled by GCP. So, it's all spaghetti. So, my advice is: Set up GAM in advance and automate repetitive stuff for emergencies.</p>

<p>Which parts of Google Workspace did your org outgrow first?</p>
<p>The things that were non-starters were Google Meet and Chat. None of that worked for us. There are participant limits that are smaller than what you need and threading was atrocious.</p>

<p>Did you ever find active accounts for users that did not exist or had left the company?</p>
<p>Earlier in <a href="https://www.runzero.com/">runZero</a>’s history, instead of deleting folks' accounts and doing transfers, we were just suspending them. And then we ended up with a bunch of suspended users that we'd forgotten about. Their email aliases couldn't be used by anybody else and they were still, costing us money. </p>

<p>But now we are pretty neurotic about user offboarding. We start running down our offboarding checklist the second the HR phone call ends with an employee. The user gets removed from Google’s IDP, we lock them out of their laptops and then we go through the long list of accounts you need to clean out. Finally, you recover licenses and stuff - which is less important from a security standpoint. </p>

<p>What security advice do you have?</p>
<p>Make sure you get a Google Workspace plan that has Vault enabled [Business Plus, Enterprise]. Vault allows you to retain, hold, and search your users’ Google Workspace data. </p>

<p>You should set up your [vault] retention policies on day one. It has been a lifesaver to figure out what’s going on from a people or security standpoint. If someone leaves a company or somebody reports harassment, you can go look at the email. So even if an employee deletes the email from their inbox, you can still review what happened.</p>

<p>Google’s authentication has been pretty good. We feel like out-of-the-box works well. We send employees a Yubikey. We enforce MFA.  I think that we have a three day or 48 hour grace period for folks to get MFA set up and then we nag them until they set it up.</p>

<p>Not long ago, Entrust created a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OlK1GuRf4">racecar commercial</a>&nbsp;showcasing how we help our customers manage identities, payments, and data so they can remain focused on their road ahead.</p>
<p>As I rewatched this commercial, I was struck by the footage of the talented engineers and mechanics working as one team to ensure the car was always running in&nbsp;top&nbsp;form.</p>
<p>As an F1 racing fan and a former rally navigator, I see a lot of parallels between the talented pit crew and how every one of us at Entrust has a role when it comes to contributing to our customers’ experiences and success – from our manufacturing colleagues, to engineering, to sales, to customer support, and more.</p>
<p>We want you, our valued customers, to have a great experience with us and to know you are in good hands.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marina Iantorno</a></p> 
<p>Cyber insurance offers protection against financial damage resulting from catastrophes involving computer networks, such as data breaches, network failures, and cyber-attacks. Cyber insurance is used to cover a wide variety of costs associated with cyber incidents, including remediation costs, legal expenses, and losses as a result of reputational damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Cyber insurance coverage is often tailored to meet the requirements of the company insured. Insurance firms are carrying out increasingly thorough evaluations of the cybersecurity at organizations and providing advice on the kinds and levels of coverage that may be required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 Why is cyber insurance important?&nbsp; 
 
 
<p>In today's environment, the ability to get adequate and appropriate cyber insurance is becoming increasingly important as the frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks continue to rise. The importance and relevance of cyber insurance will be highlighted at this year’s KuppingerCole Analysts’ European Identity and Cloud conference (EIC), including a presentation entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5345/2">Cyber Insurance: Results from a Recent Survey</a>, which examines the challenges in obtaining and using cyber insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>On the other hand, it is becoming increasingly complex to obtain cyber insurance, because insurance companies are constantly raising the level of cybersecurity they require. Companies must know how to prepare for cyber insurance assessments to ensure they get the coverage and rates that accurately reflect their risk profile. Failure to get the right coverage means that organizations could be left struggling to recover financially from major cyber incidents. Being able to respond quickly, effectively, and comprehensively to major cyber incidents in terms of fixing the damage, restoring data, and mitigating the impact of reputational damage could depend on having adequate and appropriate cyber insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Nevertheless, organizations must consider that the pay-out from the insurance company will depend on factors such as the type of plan, the policy’s terms and conditions, and the overall cyber defence capabilities of the organization. In the face of the harsh reality of cyber-attacks, damage mitigation is essential, and we will further examine the role of cyber insurance in this context at the EIC in this presentation on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5345/1">Cyber Insurance as a Damage Mitigation Strategy</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 Can everybody get cyber insurance?&nbsp; 
 
 
<p>Working with an expert in insurance is recommended for corporations looking to get cyber insurance, as well as seeking expert advice to strengthen the cybersecurity posture and to pass the cyber insurance assessments. An analyst company like KuppingerCole Analysts can guide organizations in improving their cybersecurity posture and implementing the security controls that cyber insurance companies require. The cybersecurity posture of a business may be evaluated by advisors, who can then provide recommendations about the proper levels of cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Businesses must take measures to strengthen their cybersecurity posture in order to increase the likelihood of being approved for an affordable and adequate cyber insurance policy. The implementation of security measures, the creation of an incident response plan, and the performance of regular risk assessments are all examples of how this can be achieved. Organizations can boost their chances of acquiring cost-effective and appropriate cyber insurance cover by demonstrating a good level of cybersecurity and risk mitigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>To summarize, it is important to have the ability to get appropriate cyber insurance for managing the financial and reputational risks related to cyber incidents. With the right cyber insurance, organizations can better protect their financial position from the ever-increasing risks posed by cyber-attacks. Having a cyber insurance does not mitigate the risk of being a target for cyber-attacks, but it helps to mitigate the damage and restore business operations. Any organization looking for cyber insurance should collaborate with a seasoned insurance broker as well as cybersecurity advisors and take measures to strengthen its cybersecurity posture, which will not only reduce cyber risk but at the same time increase the odds of being able to secure a policy that is both suitable and reasonable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, all of us at Web3auth moved a step closer to realising our mission of passing the identity ownership back to the individuals and users. We partnered with FOX -owned Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL) to provide a seamless Web3 user onboarding experience for The Masked Singer Experience.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1626028978220990464">https://twitter.com/i/status/1626028978220990464</a></p><p>A typical web3 wallet’s user onboarding experience involves setting up a seed phrase for authentication, which is a complex and tedious task. It takes the user anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes. This timeframe has churn written all over it, and it is quite significant in web3 user adoption standards.</p><p>But this has been the standard practice over the years. After we launched Web3Auth and had numerous customers using our wallet infrastructure, several consumer-focused applications have seen a 3x increase in conversion rates, from 24% to about 63%, as opposed to conventional seed phrase wallet solutions.</p><p>In a significant paradigm shift that we have been able to enable today, we joined forces with FOX Entertainment-owned Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL) to offer the most seamless onboarding experience possible for the fans of The Masked Singer Experience. This digital fan community is an evolution of the singing competition The Masked Singer — television #1 unscripted series.</p><p>With this partnership, Web3Auth will allow the fan community to connect to The Masked Singer Experience seamlessly, by logging in to the experience and setting up a web3 wallet directly via email, social and Google accounts instead of having to use the conventional seed phrase-enabled wallets. After this collaboration with us, users will need only less than a minute to set up their wallet accounts.</p><p>We decided to give this renewed onboarding journey a special&nbsp;name.</p><p>Two-Factor Wallets&nbsp;(2FW)</p><p>Users can set up a 2FW via 2FA flows — including social logins, phone, laptops, or even biometrics which would take less than a minute. The 2FW also significantly enhances wallet security — if one factor is damaged, users can still recover the wallet using the other&nbsp;factors.</p><p>Our Co-founder and CEO Zhen Yu Yong recommends three key factors for web2 businesses to consider for a successful web3 project&nbsp;launch:</p>  intuitive user experience  familiar user&nbsp;journey  security  <p>He believes that intuitive user experience and accessibility are paramount to allow the show’s fans and crypto enthusiasts to enjoy the reimagined Masker Singer NFT experience.</p><p>But the partnership only makes more sense for Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL). It empowers creators to build their communities through web3-centered fandom experiences that allow people to interact with content in new ways, ultimately reshaping the entertainment industry as we know it by infusing it with a new sense of freedom, access and control. BCL believes the future of the entertainment industry lies within Web3, which will help democratize access to Hollywood, strengthen the bond between creators and their communities and pave new avenues for creativity, innovation and&nbsp;success.</p><p>Today, we have been able to scale Web3Auth to a place where we have already onboarded over 500 web2 and web3 applications and wallets. Today, we are able to clock over 12 million user keys a month, which is an exponential growth from that of last year. But this is only scratching the surface. Having said that, our larger goal is to provide users with Two-Factor Wallets that are secure and seamless.</p><p>“We are all set to partner with larger enterprises within entertainment, gaming and blockchain industries. We want to close the gap between Web2 and&nbsp;Web3.”</p><p>~ Zhen Yu Yong, Co-founder and CEO, Web3Auth.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/how-web3auths-two-factor-wallet-infra-empowered-the-masked-singer-experience-onboarding-experience-83c3498675">How Web3Auth’s Two-Factor Wallet infra empowered The Masked Singer Experience onboarding experience</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Web3Auth Self-host SDK is now Core&nbsp;Kit <p>Simplification in access — a core principle our entire team at Web3Auth consistently strives for. It has been a significant part of our engineering culture. Today, we move a step closer towards our mission to simplify Web3 wallet infrastructure for everyone.</p> Our Self-host SDK is now Core&nbsp;Kit <p>We decided to do a little rebranding to our Self-host SDK, and call it Core Kit. Because it is the core infrastructure that resides underneath all of our products. Simple and&nbsp;easy.</p><p>Of course, there are reasons why we chose to change the&nbsp;name.</p>  The very term self-host could possibly imply that our customers had to do a lot of heavy-lifting.  It could have been very easily interpreted with our Plug &amp; Play&nbsp;SDK.  <p>Here is a little context pertaining to the underlying technological architecture in our two flagship SDKs — Core Kit (previously Self-host) and Plug &amp;&nbsp;Play.</p><p>These SDKs are built on top of an underlying SDK called tKey, which stands for Threshold Key. The <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/tkey/">tKey SDK</a> manages private keys by generating shares using Shamir Secret Sharing, a threshold cryptographic algorithm technique. The image below shows how the tKey SDK architecture plays out in a virtual environment.</p>Web3Auth’s tKey SDK architecture<p>Now when it came to Self-host as a term, ‘hosting by the self’ was a possible misinterpretation we did not want our customers to take away from&nbsp;it.</p>  Self-host offered a bundled package of core components or UI-less SDKs to help a customer customize their desired user interface (UI) to further generate and manage their shares. This implies only one thing — it empowers you to retain your own brand’s user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)&nbsp;flow.  On the other hand, the core purpose of our Plug &amp; Play SDK was to offer a standardized and default user interface (UI) and a user experience (UX) flow from Web3Auth — so that our customers could seamlessly generate and manage their desired number of&nbsp;shares.  <p>By definition, this particular SDK is supposed to be a set of tools that would help you build an authentication engine for your platform — essentially, a non-custodial wallet. But the problem is that our Plug &amp; Play SDK also has a similar purpose, but the only differentiation is that — it allows no room to customize any&nbsp;shares.</p><p>The change of name to Core Kit also refers to exactly what our SDKs offer — a bundled package of UI-less SDKs (or core components) to help you gain better access and control over the user experience (UX) flows, while retaining your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Here is what the Core Kit&nbsp;entails:</p>  tKey JS SDK, which works on web and react&nbsp;native.  A web-based Single Factor Auth&nbsp;SDK.  A NodeJS Server SDK hosted on the backend nodejs&nbsp;server.  <blockquote>“Owing to this potential misinterpretation, we wanted to take this space and opportunity to explain why we decided to do this rebranding.”</blockquote><p>As we move forward, we are soon going to launch the tKey Android iOS SDKs over the coming few months. Besides, we are also going to launch an aggregator SDK for all of the Core Kit in Web, to allow for better ease of integration.</p><p>If you are an enterprise looking to add a powerful web3 component to your existing systems, look no further — Core Kit is&nbsp;here!</p><p>Furthermore, below is a summary of all the other product updates we&nbsp;have:</p> A revamped Plug &amp; Play&nbsp;SDK <p>Our Plug &amp; Play suite now has all UI SDKs, giving you quick and easy access to our platform.</p><p>Here is what the suit includes:</p>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/modal/">Web Modal&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/no-modal/">Web No Modal&nbsp;SDK</a>  an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/android/">Android SDK</a>, an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/ios/">iOS&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/react-native/">React Native&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/flutter/">Flutter&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/unity/">Unity&nbsp;SDK</a>  a Unreal SDK is out, documentation will be launched&nbsp;soon   Updated documentation <p>All of our documentation has been revamped with a new <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/quick-start">quick start</a>, and general flows to highlight our products and integration better.</p><p>Check them out&nbsp;<a href="https://web3auth.io/docs">here</a>.</p> We’re on Discourse, our newest community portal! <p>We have now fully migrated from GitHub Discussions to a brand new community forum on Discourse to enable a superior community support experience, better search capabilities, more accurate suggestions, and quicker responses.</p><p>Join our community forum&nbsp;<a href="https://community.web3auth.io/">here</a>.</p><p>Over the last 4 years, our team at Web3Auth has been able to onboard over 500 applications and wallets across Web2 and Web3. Today, we manage more than 12 million user keys a month, a growth that is significant and exponential from that of our previous&nbsp;years.</p><p>Traditional wallet authentication methods such as seed-phrases, are difficult to remember and are vulnerable to phishing attacks. We have been working hard the last 4 years on various key management technologies and we believe we have been instrumental in pioneering this paradigm shift in the industry, especially after having launched our <a href="https://web3auth.io/mpc.html">Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</a> technology.</p><p>But this is only the beginning. As we continue this journey to achieve our audacious mission, which is to make digital ownership human-centric and accessible to everyone, we want to thank you for being a part of our thriving community and for your support in helping us build this wallet infrastructure for&nbsp;all.</p><p>We’d love for you to try out Core Kit, the Plug &amp; Play SDKs, and join us in the product conversations on <a href="https://community.web3auth.io/">Discourse</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/important-product-updates-web3auth-self-host-and-plug-and-play-590bdf414ef6">Important Product Updates — Web3Auth Self Host and Plug and Play</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is to clarify our response to a detailed internal investigation into a claimed vulnerability attack on Web3 Magic&nbsp;Links.</p><p>Today, we want to take this opportunity to address a claimed vulnerability on Magic Links in Web3 highlighted by DFNS.co. Read more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/24/crypto-wallet-firm-dfns-says-magic-links-have-critical-vulnerability/">here</a>.</p><p>The disclosure describes a phishing attack on passwordless Magic Links, that affects Web2 applications but was aimed specifically toward Web3 applications.</p><p>A short summary of the incident with the timelines:</p>  This phishing method was disclosed to us privately on Thursday, 23rd February 2023, over a voice&nbsp;call.  Between 23rd and 25th February, upon discovery of the phishing attack, the Web3Auth team launched a detailed investigation into potentially affected users and their accounts.  In conclusion, the investigation found no cases of existing users being affected by this&nbsp;attack.  A verification challenge and stricter IP policies were implemented to prevent future phishing attempts on Monday, 27th February, 2023.  <p>A brief overview of the phishing&nbsp;attack:</p><p>When a user wants to sign up and log in to any user account on the internet, the conventional flow is that he or she would get a verification email with a link to confirm and verify the email address. Upon verification, the user would now be able to access the dashboard or the user&nbsp;account.</p><p>But in this case, which happens to be a phishing attack, a malicious third party comes into play. It triggers a login request, because of which it sends out a passwordless web3 Magic Link to the user’s email. The link could possibly have a call-to-action button that prompts the user to log in. When the user clicks on it, the malicious third party would now be able to log in on behalf of the user, but the user is kept in the dark about the consequences until the account is accessed or&nbsp;altered.</p><p>This was how the claimed vulnerability attack unfolded, which turned out to be a well-known phishing&nbsp;attack.</p><p>Upon intimation of the issue on 23rd Feb 2023, Web3Auth conducted a detailed investigation into potential scenarios under which the issue might have occurred.</p><p>The investigation found that there were no such cases of this vulnerability found with respect to our existing user accounts. Our current policies that are already in place, display the origination of login requests as well as open channels for support, for identified malicious requests. These shall effectively prepare us for similar malicious incidents where the user did not activate the request in the first place. Rest assured, we continue to conduct our business and everyday operations while our users have absolutely nothing to worry&nbsp;about.</p><p>Our future commitment</p><p>However, this gave us an opportunity to further tighten our existing security measures. As part of some immediate remedial actions, we have proactively added additional security policies to identify potential and existing phishing attacks. This included matching and verification of a numeric login code to identify false requests, along with more stringent IP blocking, if the attack originated from different locations.</p><p>To ensure that we handle similar issues in a timely and effective manner, we have developed a Security SOP. Further, if you happen to discover any issues with our product, please email us at security@web3auth.io. Our team shall quickly review your submission and respond within 72 hours. While submitting these issues, kindly provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, the potential impact, and any additional information that may be&nbsp;helpful.</p><p>Feel free to refer to our <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/contribute/bug-bounty">bug bounty program</a> as&nbsp;well.</p><p>As part of our commitment to platform security, we will acknowledge your submission and keep you informed of our progress in addressing the vulnerabilities. We would also publicly recognize your contribution, with your permission, in our security hall of&nbsp;fame.</p><p>We take the security of our platform very seriously. We acknowledge your support and extend our gratitude for joining us in our mission to improve the security of Web3Auth and Web3 as an entirety.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auths-statement-on-the-recent-magic-link-phishing-attack-afd7f46566cf">Web3Auth’s statement on the recent Magic Link phishing attack</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Account Abstraction has been all the rage in recent months. But with all the different specifications, implementations, jargon and use cases it entails, it is very easy to be buried in the weeds. For those looking for an easily pluggable AA SDK, look no&nbsp;further.</p><p>Today, Safe Global (previously Gnosis.safe) <a href="https://safe.global/core">announced</a> the Safe{Core} SDK, in partnership with Web3Auth in making Account Abstraction an end-to-end and production-ready experience.</p><p>Here is a snapshot of what the core SDK entails for developers:</p><p>The company (Safe) reports that its custody infrastructure has been closely audited and tested over the last 5 years, and that it is now able to secure $39 billion in assets&nbsp;today.</p><p>With Web3Auth, this SDK enables mainstream users to enjoy the benefits of an experience they’re already familiar with. Social logins to Two-Factor wallets that leverage the security of their devices as well. Here is where we echo a similar philosophy and align with Safe on the&nbsp;same.</p><p>”Today, there is a binary choice for users. They can either completely give up ownership of their assets to a custodian and play in a walled garden, or bear the full responsibility of protecting their assets and scrutinizing every transaction. Small everyday burdens of gas fees, seed phrases, jumping wallets, and switching networks to do simple transactions have made web3 unusable by the&nbsp;masses.</p><p>We need to do&nbsp;better.”</p><p>As for developers, if you want to understand more and build on top of the Account Abstraction experience, join us in a month-long global AA Hackathon. The march for this hackathon starts today, with bounties worth $50,000.

 Web3Auth vs Magic — How to choose your Key Management Solution  Authentication is one of the most important components of any application and as the Web3 movement grows, wallet &amp; private key management becomes its most critical aspect. The right to own your own key and the right to own your own identity.  For any dApps, the fundamental question is — how are you managing your users’ wallet? Keeping in mind this critical question, we are comparing two of the leaders in the wallet management space, Web3Auth and&nbsp;Magic. <p>Before we deep dive into the technical details and comparison, let’s understand what these solutions are trying to achieve. Both Web3Auth and Magic replace seed phrases with intuitive one-click logins making onboarding into web3 seamless while giving control to the application to manage their&nbsp;flows.</p><p>Further to that, the infrastructure and usage of both the platforms is very different and needs a deeper understanding. For this, we will be comparing the two platforms on the following aspects:</p>  Wallet Management: How the users’ private keys are managed and held&nbsp;safe?  Authentications Options: How many types of authentication and 2FA methods are supported?  Multichain Support: How many blockchains are supported and utilised?  White Labelling and Customisation: How much control the developer has on the UX&nbsp;flows?  Scalability: How the platforms perform for applications at&nbsp;scale.  Ease of integration: How easy it is to implement a basic instance of the platform.  Open Source &amp; Native platforms support: How much code is publicly available and audited? How many platforms are supported?  Web3Auth vs&nbsp;Magic Differences in Wallet Management Infrastructure <p>According to the Magic’s <a href="https://magic-whitepaper-key-based-authentication-system.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Magic+Whitepaper.pdf">Whitepaper</a>,</p><blockquote>“Magic’s Delegated Key Management leverages Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) provided by Amazon Web Services’ Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Dedicated user master keys generated using AES-256 with 384-bits of entropy are stored on the HSMs. The master keys never leave the hardware as they are meant to be locked inside and unable to be exported. All encryption and decryption operations happen inside the hardware modules themselves. HSMs are a lot like popular 7 FIDO devices like YubiKeys or hardware-based wallets for cryptocurrency storage such as Trezor or Ledger, but instead of traditional harddrive storage, they sit in the cloud, secured by AWS’s data&nbsp;centers.</blockquote><blockquote>Users’ private keys are encrypted by these hardware-based user master keys, which means that attackers need to gain access to the hardware to be able to retrieve the keys, and are forced to stay within Magic’s adversarial infrastructure — which is capable to detect, impede, and monitor attacker’s progress to prevent and mitigate any damages.”</blockquote><p>Hence, we can see that Magic depends on Amazon Web Service’s (AWS) Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for their key encryption. The users’ private keys are encrypted by these hardware-based user master keys and stored separately in a multi-region MySQL database.. This approach is good in terms of speed and availability, however has a major flaw, wherein the entire private key sits encrypted on the cloud secured by AWS KMS which can be a single point of failure. Hence, we can regard their solution as a semi-custodial system.</p><p>Web3Auth is a<a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-is-here-9387d570990b"> fully non custodial MPC (Multi Party Computation) solution</a> where the user keys are distributed across a network of nodes owned by the top firms in the crypto industry and the user’s own devices. This is enabled by an on chain node network distributed key generation followed by an off chain multi-sig. The key is never fully owned by anyone and only the user has the access to it via their own authentication methods. While making a blockchain transaction, the key is never reconstructed or stored anywhere, rather a series of partial signatures are done across the network and user devices and the final signature is generated for the transaction.</p><p>This infrastructure can be used across the world with node availability throughout the world with industry leading speeds and a surety that user keys are never owned by a single entity&nbsp;anytime.</p><p>You can read more about Web3Auth’s <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/overview/key-management/">Wallet Management Infrastructure</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-is-here-9387d570990b">New MPC Solution</a>.</p> Authentications Options <p>One of key features of Web3Auth and Magic is the support of any social, federated identity ( Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito, etc.) and custom JWT auth providers. This allows developers to integrate any kind of login method, provided they are using JWT ID Token for user registration.</p><p>In addition to this, Two Factor Authentication is a key aspect of keeping your accounts secure. Magic supports 2FA with mobile operators like Authy and Google Authenticator and/or SMS authentication giving you the traditional experience of&nbsp;2FA.</p><p>Web3Auth introduces a new layer of security here with the introduction of Two Factor Wallets. Web3Auth actually uses its off chain multi sig to distribute keys into multiple devices and or SMS/ other authentication methods. This enables you to get a true decentralised 2FA setup where your keys are secured even if one of the authentication methods is compromised.</p> Multichain Support <p>Web3Auth’s SDKs are chain agnostic, ie. they can be used on any blockchain. Today there are thousands of dApps built on numerous blockchains that have integrated Web3Auth. On the other hand, Magic supports 20+ popular blockchains.</p> White Labelling and Customisation <p>Web3Auth allows applications and wallets to fully customise and whitelabel the solution. Using the various options of integration available, you can even make Web3Auth totally invisible in the user flow focusing totally on your application end to end. Magic does provide a range of customisation options, but it is limited as compared to Web3Auth.</p> Scalability <p>Both the solutions do very well in terms of scalability of users and availability across multiple regions. Being hosted on AWS HSMs, Magic is available worldwide within their servers. These servers are owned by&nbsp;Amazon.</p><p>Web3Auth’s network of nodes are hosted worldwide and by trusted industry leaders like Polygon, Binance, Tendermint, ENS, Etherscan etc. Additionally, with the new Sapphire network of Web3Auth, applications can choose to run their own nodes in addition to the nodes available publicly giving them flexibility and control over their user scalability.</p> Ease of Integration <p>A basic integration of both the platforms is quite easy and straightforward. With Web3Auth a basic of the Plug and Play SDKs requires just <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/quick-start">4 basic steps</a> and with excellent documentation and examples guiding you throughout the journey of building your own customised solution. A basic integration takes less than 15 mins of work and no extra customisation is required for being production ready. You also have the flexibility to migrate to a more advanced integration with our range of SDKs available for different use cases and platforms. We also have an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/integration-builder">integration builder</a> which, according to your requirements, shapes up a ready to use code that can be directly implemented in your application.</p><p>A basic Magic integration takes a similar approach with one additional step. You need to use custom authentication for using any social login provider apart from email passwordless. Their documentation and guides are great to follow along and one can figure out how to implement them&nbsp;easily.</p> Open Source &amp; Native Platform&nbsp;Support <p>Open source is at the heart of decentralisation. Both Web3Auth and Magic have strong multi platform support and an active open source community around their products. Web3Auth supports Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, Unity and Unreal Engine. Magic supports all of them except Unreal Engine. They additionally support PHP and WordPress logins.</p><p>At Web3Auth, all these SDKs are open sourced alongside our core infrastructural SDKs and smart contracts controlling the nodes as well. These are fully audited by some of the top smart contract auditing firms in the world. For Magic, the SDKs are open source, while the encryption and DKMS remain closed&nbsp;source.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Although Magic is a great product in terms of getting your users onboarded into the Web3 world, it is evident that Web3Auth has a clear advantage on the core infrastructure level over them. Being a more advanced product with a greater emphasis on security, non-custodiality, and customisation, Web3Auth becomes a clear choice in almost every situation where user wallet management and recoverability is an involved&nbsp;factor.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-vs-magic-how-to-choose-your-key-management-solution-10bbbe78e58e">Web3Auth vs Magic — How to choose your Key Management Solution</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Dear Metadium community,</p><p>Metadium’s ecosystem continues to grow. This time we are happy to announce our most recent partnership with ES Energía, a global company developing renewable energy products and solutions with over twenty years of experience across different markets.</p><p>Partnering with ES Energía gives us access to its existing SE Asia and Latin America network, opening new opportunities to provide Metadium blockchain technology to new users. The two companies are looking to develop a new project in the Indonesian market and expect to continue expanding their cooperation into other countries. Their goal is to implement Metadium’s DID technology to provide millions of Indonesians with easy and safe identification and authentication.</p>ES Energia’s Business&nbsp;Network The Indonesian Identity Market&nbsp;Prospect <p>Indonesia has the right environment and international support to develop blockchain-based identification services. The country recently received US$250 million in funding from the World Bank Group’s International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) to strengthen the country’s civil registration and increase the implementation of, but not limited to, biometric digital identification to access public and private services, as stated in the “ID for Inclusive Service Delivery and Digital Transformation in Indonesia” report.</p><p>Indonesia has 97% coverage of the national ID (NIK) and e-KTP, and 88.4% of those aged 17 and under have birth certificates. The country is also the fifth most internet-engaged country in the world after the Philippines, Brazil, Thailand, and Colombia. The percentage of households online doubled from 42% to 82% between 2015 and 2021.

   Increased government regulation makes the combination of Identity Governance and Administration and Identity Access Management essential to success 

<p>The Biden-Harris Administration recently released its <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-national-cybersecurity-strategy/">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a> outlining how it will address rapidly evolving cyberthreats and secure the promise of our digital future. As the world becomes increasingly digital with the nation's most relied upon resources all connected, this strategy marks an important step in our nation's efforts to become more secure.</p>

<p>Until now, the U.S. government has viewed cybersecurity as voluntary. The White House's strategy demonstrates that it has shifted to viewing these cybersecurity policies as mandatory because attackers continue to have the upper hand when it comes to cybercrime and fraud.</p>

<p>The main focus of the National Cybersecurity Strategy is to defend our Nation's critical infrastructure, which is vital for the health and wellbeing of the American people, as well as essential services that keep our economy moving. Most notably, the strategy identifies the need for industry and government to work together, saying we "must drive effective and equitable collaboration to correct market failures, minimize the harms from cyber incidents to society's most vulnerable, and defend our shared digital ecosystem." These collaborative efforts will allow crucial updates to occur, and in turn, greatly improve the resilience of our essential services, protecting us from catastrophic cyber interference.</p>

<p>But what else will this cybersecurity strategy mean for government entities, IT leaders, and citizens?</p>

  Increased security is a necessary step of government regulation. This has been needed for quite some time to protect the interests of the American people. 
	 States will need to pass legislation that mandates a centralized citizen framework to reduce fraud. As the framework is created, legacy authentication methodologies need to be replaced. 
	 We need to work cooperatively with governments around the world to create a secure and free digital ecosystem. While the strategy accurately identifies the need to protect the interests of the American people, the digital ecosystem is global - meaning worldwide collaboration is necessary. 
 <p>The challenges identified by the White House have highlighted that government entities and organizations alike need more mature, scalable identity solutions that can be deployed quickly and flexibly to any necessary environment. The ability to have standard processing for proofing, authenticating, and authorizing Identities and non-person entities (NPE) is key to the Zero Trust architecture, which will quickly advance the availability of new standards to support and enable the most disadvantaged populations.</p>

<p>To best support this new strategy, organizations and leaders can take the actionable steps below to ensure compliance:</p>

  Stop using old authentication methodologies. This includes knowledge-based authentication (KBA) like passwords and Social Security Numbers that open organizations up to increased cyber risk. Removing these authentication methodologies strengthens security and reduces the risk of costly breaches. 
	 Legacy systems take time to modernize. Beginning the process of implementing new security infrastructure and applications is often intimidating, and knowing where to begin is half the battle. Selecting a governance solution with strong journey orchestration capabilities helps organizations design and implement new solutions at their own pace - without it being an "all or nothing" experience. 
	 Consider enterprise grade governance solutions. Governance solutions that converge Access Management with Identity Governance help enterprises gain efficiencies, meet compliance regulations and increase cost savings with the ability to manage, secure, and govern identities throughout their entire lifecycle. 
	 Put AI (and Zero Trust) to work. Advancements in AI have made it possible for better threat detection, particularly in areas around Zero Trust. Seeking out tech partners who offer this can support the White House's initiative to modernize networks and update the Federal incident response policy. 
	 Prioritize explicit consent &amp; proper data management practices. Many leaders have already made steps in the right direction with the adoption of phishing-resistant authentication technologies like passkeys, but the White House's emphasis on promoting privacy and security of personal data means securing explicit consent from users and minimizing the amount of personal data stored on individuals will be critical to complying. 
 <p>While the National CyberSecurity Strategy is a great place to start, it will take some time for it to come to life. U.S. federal departments and agencies, state and local governments, and private industry verticals must develop action plans, which White House funding has committed to support to help accelerate. Additionally, governance and compliance challenges associated with the growth of the hybrid workforce, employee job changes and increasing adoption of cloud-based applications and services is proving to be difficult for organizations, often resulting in increased costs and security risk. Identity Governance and Administration will be key to organizations supporting the new National Cybersecurity Strategy, and managing all identities, both for workforce and consumer, from a single comprehensive identity platform.</p>

<p>ForgeRock is ready to support and enable our government and private sector customers as they implement the directions outlined in this new strategy. We look forward to the innovation that will occur as a result of these efforts. Together, we can create a more secure digital future.</p>

  <p>As feedback has been shared on the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/forgerock-and-new-dod-zero-trust-strategy">first blog about the Department of Defense Zero Trust Strategy</a>, the primary responses were:</p>

<p>"OK, how does ForgeRock do what you've claimed?"</p>

<p>"Is that all ForgeRock does to meet the user pillar of the Zero Trust architecture?"</p>

<p>Constructive feedback is always appreciated. The feedback provided structure for a response. In this blog, we are focusing on the user pillar in the Zero Trust Architecture. It contains the requirements for proofing, authentication, authorization and governance of identities and Non-Person Entities (NPE).</p>

<p>In the Department of Defense Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), there are five major tenets that influence all aspects of Zero Trust. They are:</p>

  Assume a hostile environment 
	 Presume breach 
	 Never trust, always verify 
	 Scrutinize explicitly 
	 Apply unified analytics 
 <p>These guidelines offer a straightforward approach to assess whether a proposed solution is suitable for a given pillar under the ZTA framework.</p>

<p>For the user pillar, the processes executed for the continuous authentication, continuous authorization, and User Event Behavior Analytics (UEBA) are key to meeting the tenets of the ZTA. ForgeRock meets these <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">Zero Trust</a> requirements by providing features in three main categories. They are:</p>

  Identity orchestration for user journeys 
	 Partner integrations 
	 Flexible deployment model 
  Identity Orchestration for User Journeys 

<p>Journeys enable dynamic run-time <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">identity orchestration</a> for processes ranging from the highlights referenced in the image below:</p>

    
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The journey builder allows for changes to be made and tested in a real-time environment. With over 100 pre-built nodes to use in your journeys, processes that used to require scripting are now accomplished through simple drag-and-drop actions.</p>

<p>The robust flexibility created by the ForgeRock identity orchestration engine lets you design processes that enforce the tenets of ZTA, as listed above. Since the circumstances, mission requirements, and attack plane are different for every group in DoD, it is vital for there to be choices that still meet the tenets but also provide flexibility for different scenarios.</p>

 Partner Integrations 

<p>ForgeRock has built a large network of technology partners that have proven integrations with ForgeRock technology.</p>

    
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">ForgeRock Trust Network</a> is a robust, growing network that enables ForgeRock customers to leverage solutions that improve the strength of their ZTA user experience and security. ForgeRock is always seeking new technology partners. This network will grow organically as new solutions come to market leveraging new technology innovations.</p>

 Flexible Deployment Model 

<p>ForgeRock's deployments in the Department of Defense, from small to large mission groups, is a natural result of our flexible deployment model. ForgeRock is compliant with Defense Information Systems Agency Security Technical Implementation Guides (DISA STIG) and has deployments at every Impact Level. It is common for ForgeRock to be deployed in Denied, Disrupted, Interrupted, and Limited (DDIL) and low-bandwidth environments. The different deployments can synchronize with a main instance of ForgeRock located in a centralized deployment in the cloud or in a mission-specific data center. ForgeRock supports a central user repository and a base set of configurations, enforced at the mission or branch level, while still providing the ability for varied deployments to be configured differently based on mission requirements.</p>

 Reducing Risk 

<p>ForgeRock's robust identity orchestration engine, mature technology partner network, and flexible deployment model facilitate your ability to meet mission requirements in the user pillar of the ZTA framework. Risks change frequently, requiring a change in approach, one of the main requirements of a working Zero Trust Architecture.</p>

<p>When considering an identity vendor to partner with you in your ZTA journey, these three criteria are essential. Without any one of the three, you will find areas where you cannot meet the ZTA requirements and tenets.</p>

<p>In part 3 of this blog series, we will discuss the details of each tenet and how ForgeRock meets that tenet in the user pillar of the Zero Trust Architecture.</p>

<p>In authentication security, passwords are often the weak link, susceptible to several attacks.</p>
<p>What is password cracking? Password cracking is the use of different attacks to guess or expose a password and gain access into a user’s account.</p>
 What Does it Mean to Crack a Password? 
<p>Passwords are one of the oldest and most well-established forms of authentication security in computing. Brought about with the emergence of multi-user systems in the 1960s and 1870s, username/password combinations serve as the backbone of authentication because of their ease of use, simple implementation, and common acceptance across consumer and enterprise contexts.</p>
<p>However, passwords are incredibly vulnerable and often serve as a weak point in cybersecurity overall. The major issue with password authentication is that they rely on user commitment to using strong, secure passwords while remaining vigilant against social engineering attempts.</p>
<p>The first part of that responsibility (strong passwords) plays a significant role in protecting against password cracking or using brute-force attacks to guess passwords to gain access to a system. These attacks range from brute-force in nature to more sophisticated threats.</p>
<p>Some forms of password threats include:</p>
 
 Guessing: The most simple of brute-force methods, a guessing attack is, as the name suggests, one where the attacker simply throws different passwords against user accounts in hopes of getting lucky. For the most part, many security technologies resist this attack, but a lack of employee security education or password requirements can still make this threat real. 
 Dictionary Attacks: Dictionary attacks involve using common phrases and names from a dictionary as password guesses. This threat relies on the unfortunately-common fact that users will often use simple words or phrases as passwords because they are easy to remember. 
 Common Passphrase Attacks: Much like a dictionary attack, a common phrase attack will use a dictionary populated explicitly with common passwords. This can include simple sequences of numbers (123456) or words (like a password) and permutations of those phrases (like “passw0rd” or “password1”). Again, these attacks remain effective in cases where users rely on simple or common passwords. 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/credential-stuffing/">Credential Stuffing</a>: This attack is much more insidious than those already discussed. Credential stuffing relies on compromised databases containing passwords to crack accounts on other platforms. 
 
<p>So, for example, if a user’s username and password are compromised in a hack, then attackers may purchase that information on the black market and start pushing those credentials to other common platforms, like social media or banking. This attack works extremely well because it utilizes known information and leverages the tendency for users to reuse credentials across multiple systems.</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-spraying/">Password Spraying</a>: An inverse of dictionary attacks, password spraying involves using common phrases across a swath of accounts rather than just focusing on a single charge. What this form of attack loses in depth, it gains in breadth. 
 
<p>By spreading attacks over hundreds or thousands of accounts, it plays the odds against someone in a user population keeping simple or shared passwords. And, as is often the case, an attacker only needs to compromise a single account.</p>
 
 Rainbow Table Attack: Passwords are rarely stored in plain text, existing instead as a one-way hash that hides the information while allowing authentication. These can be difficult or impossible to crack. 
 
<p>However, suppose the attacker steals a table of hashes from a platform. In that case, they can use a rainbow table of common password hashes to compare against and, with enough work, break those hashes and expose every password in the database.</p>
<p>Most of these attacks can be defined as either cracking or password guessing. The latter typically involves using repeated authentication attempts to gain unauthorized access to (usually online) accounts. The former most often uses more sophisticated methods to break security on stolen passwords or password databases that have been taken offline. The difference between these two is a thin line, however, as guessing techniques (dictionaries) can serve as part of a larger cracking attempt (such as rainbow tables).</p>
<p>Note that cracking isn’t necessarily the most popular or effective authentication attack. Phishing attacks remain at the top of this list because they target most security systems’ weakest link: users. However, phishing attacks can help with other cracking attacks.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a phishing attack can expose credentials for someone with access to specific databases. In that case, hackers can use that information to breach systems and crack other passwords in that same system.</p>
 How Can Organizations Resist Password Cracking? 
<p>Organizations can follow several best practices for their authentication services to mitigate password cracking. These practices include securing passwords against common attacks, reinforcing password database security, and (in some cases) going around the need for passwords.</p>
<p>These best practices include:</p>
 
 Require Complex Passwords: Shorter passwords are much easier to crack than longer ones. Hackers can refine their password dictionary attempts, but they cannot optimize effectively if the users can include special characters or differentiate between lower- and uppercase letters. 
 
<p>By using several character types, requiring a long minimum length, and disallowing common words, your organization can resist many types of cracking attempts.</p>
 
 Require Regular Password Changes: If an attacker attempts to crack passwords using a dictionary, their odds of breaking through increase the longer they work on the problem. 
 
<p>However, if users constantly change passwords, these attackers can’t make significant headway. Additionally, if a hacker does gain access to a system by cracking an account, requiring changes at regular intervals can limit the impact they have over time.</p>
 
 Use Salted Hashes to Store Passwords: Hackers using rainbow attacks can break through plain hashes relatively quickly. By “salting” password hashes or adding random data, you can make it much harder for attackers to break through these encryption methods. 
 Disallow Password Reuse: Users like to reuse passwords over and over to make remembering their credentials easiest, but essentially eliminates the security that passwords may provide. By forcing users to change passwords into newer, unique versions, you reduce the security risks associated with long-term password storage while minimizing the possibility of the user reusing passwords from other platforms. 
 Use Passwordless Security: A solid approach, and one that’s gained a lot of traction in recent years, is passwordless authentication. This method, as the name suggests, foregoes passwords for other processes (usually tokens or biometrics). While these may be a little more complex to implement, they are only insignificantly so. And, with the proliferation of mobile devices and biometrics technology, passwordless is relatively simple to deploy.

<p>We like to start the year with a look at what’s looming on the privacy landscape. For 2023 and beyond, global thought leaders have made big predictions that will affect enterprises everywhere.</p>



 1. Smartphone apps will replace more paper documents. Decentralized identity is here to stay. 



<p><a href="https://securelist.com/privacy-predictions-2023/108068/">Kaspersky</a>&nbsp;confirms an&nbsp;undeniable trend to decentralized identity technology like&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">digital wallets</a>.&nbsp;This one doesn’t surprise us at all, which is why our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;APIs make it easy for enterprise to rapidly develop and deploy DI and privacy solutions to customers, and we’ve recently released our Sudo Platform&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">identity wallet</a>&nbsp;product.</p>



<p>Experts agree&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity&amp;et_pb_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess&amp;et_pb_include_posts=yes">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;is the future of identity management on the internet. It will be essential to the evolving metaverse and the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/what-is-web-3-0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-privacy/">Web3</a>&nbsp;world. We’ll all be using personal keys, blockchains and decentralized applications to limit the amount of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;we expose to data brokers, data breaches and dodgy business practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;global decentralized identity market was valued at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/decentralized-identity-market-report#:~:text=The%20global%20decentralized%20identity%20market,identity%20fraud%20across%20the%20globe.">USD 379.66 million in 2021</a>&nbsp;and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/decentralized-identity-market-report#:~:text=The%20global%20decentralized%20identity%20market,identity%20fraud%20across%20the%20globe.">88.2 percent from 2022 to 2030</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increasing incidences of identity fraud across the globe are causing more companies to turn to DI solutions. Federal Trade Commission figures from February 2022 show identity fraud incidents increased by about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/decentralized-identity-market-report#:~:text=The%20global%20decentralized%20identity%20market,identity%20fraud%20across%20the%20globe.">45 percent globally</a>&nbsp;in 2020, and DI is considered one of the most secured identity solutions to combat identity fraud risk,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/decentralized-identity-market-report#:~:text=The%20global%20decentralized%20identity%20market,identity%20fraud%20across%20the%20globe.">research</a>&nbsp;has found.</p>



<p>Industry consensus is that brands that go quickly to market with DI technology will see huge&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-4-benefits-to-enterprises-from-proactively-adopting-decentralized-identity/">competitive advantages</a>. We agree.&nbsp;Discover how you can rapidly put decentralized identity solutions into your customers’ hands with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;APIs.&nbsp;</p>



 2. The “legislative juggernaut” in the digital and data space will speed up in 2023.&nbsp; 



<p>Global law firm&nbsp;<a href="https://www.taylorwessing.com/en/interface/2022/predictions-2023/data-privacy-in-2023-new-technologies-more-data-and-more-regulation">Taylor Wessing</a>&nbsp;is one of many experts predicting expansion of data privacy regulations in 2023.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-05-31-gartner-identifies-top-five-trends-in-privacy-through-2024">Gartner</a>&nbsp;predicts, by 2024, 75 per cent of the global population will have its personal data covered under privacy regulations. Experts are also predicting the US will get more serious about data protection, but there still won’t be a federal privacy law in 2023, which is disappointing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Analysts at international law firm&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mofo.com/">Morrison Foerster</a>&nbsp;say, “Despite an end of the year push in 2022, the U.S. Congress continues to fail to make even credible progress towards enacting omnibus privacy legislation. In fact, a divided Congress with each party controlling a separate House is the last straw on the federal front for the next two years, thereby ensuring that the U.S. states will continue to lead the way in this area.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.taylorwessing.com/en/interface/2022/predictions-2023/data-privacy-in-2023-new-technologies-more-data-and-more-regulation">Taylor Wessing</a>&nbsp;says it is likely we will, however, see more enforcement action of existing and new US state privacy laws, such as the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomchavez/2022/10/27/on-privacy-regulators-are-awakening-the-consumerand-its-an-innovation-imperative/?sh=c35e92f56b31">$1.2 million penalty to Sephora</a>&nbsp;for violating the California Consumer Privacy Act’s ‘do not sell’ provision. Without a federal privacy law, there “may well be pressure on regulators and officials to show these new laws have real teeth. While discussion on the US’s new federal data protection law continues, it does, however, seem unlikely that we’ll see a final version passed through Congress in the next 12 months.”</p>



<p>We will keep watching this space.</p>



 3. Big Tech will continue to face sanctions and restrictions, but it won’t make them stop abusing user data. 



<p>Big Tech will continue to be hit with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/25691/highest-fines-for-gdpr-breaches/">big fines</a>&nbsp;for data privacy regulation violations but it won’t change their data surveillance behavior. The EU’s antitrust chief,&nbsp;Margrethe Vestager,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-vestager-says-tech-giants-may-prefer-fines-compliance-cites-apple-2022-02-23/">said</a>&nbsp;in February this year: “Some U.S. tech giants may prefer to pay a fine rather than comply with antitrust rules.” Clearly, it’s cheaper for Big Tech to pay fines than change their&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">business model</a>.</p>



<p>Which means …</p>



 4. Consumers will ramp up efforts to proactively defend their data privacy.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://securelist.com/privacy-predictions-2023/108068/">Kaspersky</a>&nbsp;says living a convenient modern life comes with a cost to privacy, whether consumers like it or not, but consumers are fighting back where they can. We’ve said for a couple years that privacy awareness is&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">growing</a>, and people are taking&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">preventive measures</a>&nbsp;to protect their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. Kaspersky says one way consumers might do that is to take out insurance against identity theft resulting from data breaches, and in 2023 they expect to see more personal cyber insurance products.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">Data breaches</a>&nbsp;are already enormously costly for business in financial and reputational terms. And we know consumers are&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/3-signs-the-us-public-is-taking-data-privacy-in-its-own-hands/">taking privacy into their own hands</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;and abandoning brands that aren’t good stewards of their personal data.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.informationweek.com/big-data/privacy-debate-for-2023-can-data-collection-persist-as-is-">Information Week</a>&nbsp;predicts, “An awakened awareness of personal data, how it can be manipulated, and the control individuals have over their own information continues to frame regulatory and commercial interests for the coming year.”</p>



 5. Data privacy regulatory compliance will continue to be a top business priority. (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/11/21/top-business-priorities-in-2023-compliance-data-security-data-pipelines-and-zero-trust/?sh=3df44def7d6f">Forbes</a>) 



<p>It’s no surprise then that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/11/21/top-business-priorities-in-2023-compliance-data-security-data-pipelines-and-zero-trust/?sh=279f7d767d6f">Forbes</a>&nbsp;is predicting that given businesses have to use customer data but also protect it, they will make “data protection and security their highest priority in 2023.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-05-31-gartner-identifies-top-five-trends-in-privacy-through-2024">Gartner</a>&nbsp;predicts&nbsp;large organizations’ average annual budget for privacy will exceed $2.5 million by 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Data security and privacy preservation are no longer niche IT concerns—they are critical business priorities. As data’s value rises and more data privacy laws are enacted, organizations that do not stay ahead of the curve may find themselves playing catch-up in the years to come. Aggressively addressing data protection and security gaps should be at the top of any company’s to-do list in 2023 if it isn’t already,” according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/11/21/top-business-priorities-in-2023-compliance-data-security-data-pipelines-and-zero-trust/?sh=3df44def7d6f">Forbes</a>.</p>



<p>As one industry player&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onetrust.com/blog/5-privacy-milestones-to-prepare-for-in-2023/">notes</a>: “Investors, customers, employees, and other critical stakeholders are paying close attention to business practices, ethics, and governance. As a result, transparency and consent carry significant weight when it comes to the bottom line. The opportunity to capture consumer trust will be a strategic differentiator in the years to come.</p>



<p>“Privacy is receiving a more significant share of visibility in the boardroom and among external stakeholders. This opens the door for privacy teams to tell a compelling story: one of integrating privacy efforts more profoundly across the organization to accomplish mutually beneficial objectives.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we enter 2023, we predict enterprises everywhere will be looking to initiate or expand their privacy-first product offerings to meet the increasing regulatory compliance burden and build greater trust and loyalty among their customer base which,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">as we know</a>, is growing in its privacy awareness and dissatisfaction.&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;is the perfect starting place for brands looking to rush next-generation customer apps with privacy, cyber safety and decentralized identity capabilities into their customers’ hands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">10-year vision for privacy</a>&nbsp;which we released in 2020.</p>

				  Digital Wallets Are The Future Of Identification  
			  
				
				
				
				
				  <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/dgwbirch/p/time-for-a-wallet-strategy?r=97yn&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email">In a recent article</a>, and podcast appearance, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgwbirch/">David Birch</a>, an internationally-recognized thought leader in digital identity and currencies, pointed out that digital wallets are the future of identification – their rise goes beyond just making payments online.

				 <p>Birch argues that those who see <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/digital-identity-wallet-service/">digital wallets</a> as merely a convenient way to select payment cards are missing the big picture, as digital wallets will become a central hub for storing and managing our digital identity. From our passports and driver’s license to our loyalty cards and even our health records, the potential uses of digital wallets are vast and go well beyond just financial transactions.&nbsp;</p>
 The Popularity of Digital Wallets 
<p>Digital wallets are becoming increasingly popular worldwide, with around 56% of users in 13 countries utilizing digital wallets more than five times a month, <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/payments-gets-personal-strategies-stay-relevant">according to an Accenture survey</a>. As physical wallets become less relevant, banks are developing digital wallets in response to the demand from customers. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and others are creating digital wallets to help consumers pay online merchants.&nbsp;</p>
 The Decline of Cash and Rise of Direct-to-Account Payments 
<p>The shift towards digital wallets and the future of identification is also reflected in the continuing decline of cash. A decade ago, 60% of payments were made in cash, and <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/policy-and-guidance/reports-and-publications/uk-payment-markets-2022">UK Finance estimates</a> that this will fall to 6% by 2031. As a result, banks are moving towards direct-to-account payments as an alternative to cards, which makes sense for both consumers and merchants.</p>
 The Role of Mobile Phones 
<p>Mobile phones are becoming the wallets of the future, with around half of Brits believing that physical wallets will become less relevant, <a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/95334/physical-wallets-in-decline-as-smartphone-payments-accelerate">according to Mastercard</a>. Direct-to-account payments are growing in popularity, and it’s becoming increasingly crucial for banks to recognize the role digital identity will play in the future of digital financial services. The Mobey Forum has suggested that banks leverage their position as custodians of personal data to offer value-added digital identity services, allowing them to become brokers of trust in the digital economy.</p>
 It’s Time for a Wallet Strategy 
<p>We’ve been advising banks, governments, telcos, and other large organizations on their wallet strategy for years. David is correct – without a wallet strategy, you’re likely missing the target – or aiming at the wrong one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s pretty simple. The popularity of digital wallets is rising, and banks and other players are responding to this demand by developing their own digital wallets. As physical wallets become less relevant, mobile phones are becoming the wallets of the future, and account-to-account payments are growing in popularity. Banks must recognize the importance of digital identity and their role in shaping the future of digital financial services, offering value-added digital identity services to become brokers of trust in the digital economy.</p>
<p>In his podcast appearance, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/digital-currencies-david-birch/">Let’s talk about digital identity</a>, hosted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscarsantolalla/">Oscar Santolalla</a> of <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/">Ubisecure</a>, David emphasizes that digital currencies need some form of digital identity, and the need for identity might actually drive digital identity forward and help it develop into the mass market.&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
 Digital currency needs some form of digital identity, that might actually drive digital identity forward and help digital identity to develop into the mass market.&nbsp; 
</blockquote> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>In addition to the insights from David Birch, <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/state-of-digital-wallets-series/">The Current and Future State of Digital Wallets</a> report provides valuable guidance to organizations navigating the digital wallet industry and ecosystem. Continuum Loop is proud to have published the most comprehensive information that defines a digital wallet, clarifies the ecosystem, and provides recommendations on how organizations can move forward as the ecosystem develops.</p>
 The Future of Digital Wallets 
<p>Digital wallets are poised to transform the way we live and work. Birch’s insights remind us of the transformative potential of this technology and the many ways it will impact our lives beyond just making payments. As digital wallets continue to grow in popularity, organizations must stay aware of how they will shape our future and how they can leverage tools like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/trustcontinuum/">Trust Continuum</a>™ Methodology to build trusted ecosystems that facilitate the safe and effective use of digital wallets.</p>

 Despite a gender gap in the tech industry, women at IDnow and elsewhere continue to pave the way for a brighter, more diverse tomorrow. 



<p>When it comes to the gender gap in the work force, we are still seeing a range of inequalities between men and women, especially within the tech industry. With the majority of workers in tech being mostly male, women can have a harder time reaching management level positions, earning a higher salary or simply feeling like they belong. So, despite the many achievements in gender equality over the decades, we still have a long way to go to make it a true reality. Therefore, to create an even brighter future for the many generations of women to come, we must first look at where we are now and then at where we want to go in the future.</p>



 Gender disparity in IT. 



<p>Women make up half of society and minimizing their presence in any industry is a huge mistake. Studies have shown that <a href="https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/diversity-inclusion/gender-equality">everyone benefits with women in the workforce</a> – as it leads to greater prosperity, resilience, and faster social progress.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there is still a big gap when it comes to gender diversity in the IT sector. Nearly <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/empowering-women-to-work-in-cybersecurity-is-a-win-win">75% of workers in cybersecurity are male</a>. But not only that, the global cybersecurity workforce was short some 3.4 million workers in 2022, according to a <a href="https://www.isc2.org//-/media/ISC2/Research/2022-WorkForce-Study/ISC2-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study.ashx">study by (ISC)2</a>. So along with men dominating the sector, the world is also experiencing a deficit of qualified individuals for a rising industry that is crucial for everyone’s future. And with women only comprising 25% of the workforce in the IT sector, the industry is not taking advantage of the solution that is staring them in the face.</p>



<p>By enticing more women to study and eventually work in IT, the lack of sufficient talent in the industry could be decreased all while providing additional insight that is absent due to the gender gap, further improving the industry as a whole.</p>



<p>This issue of a lack of female representation within the tech industry has sadly been there from the beginning. As a precursor to tech, only <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Women-in-tech-statistics-The-latest-research-and-trends">8% of women were working within STEM jobs in 1970</a>. Fortunately, there have been improvements over the years, despite at a somewhat snail pace. In 2011, <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/jobs/">women accounted for only 10% of the workforce in IT</a>, and in 2021 we have managed to raise that percentage to 25%. Given the inherent inertia of any industry to such radical change, it’s not a bad figure, but there is still room for improvement.</p>



 Overcoming the hurdles. 



<p>Even though the gender gap in the tech industry is slowly getting smaller and companies such as IDnow are actively welcoming and working on closing that gap, women still face certain challenges in the sector.</p>



<p>The lack of female leaders can be off-putting to many women considering working within the industry. This of course can be counteracted by putting those accomplished women IT professionals in the spotlight and showing other women what they can aspire to be.</p>



<p>Thus, career advancement for women in tech can be a struggle due to the shortage of mentorship and just an overall lack of access to career-advancing relationships. By creating more opportunities for women to connect with women leaders, this can be resolved.</p>



<p>The gender bias is another obstacle women face. Over the years, companies would evaluate female candidates not by their competencies but rather on their sociability. This has improved, but because companies feel pressured to reach a quota of females for their business, they may not fully recognize the capabilities of their female employees.</p>



<p>This goes to show, <a href="https://digitalisationworld.com/videos/4368/spotlight-on-women-in-it-episode-17-idnow">we shouldn’t necessarily focus on gender</a> but instead on an individual’s talents and skills. Maybe by looking at what an individual can do rather than their gender, we would be faster with closing the gap than expected because no one wants to be known for being the minority but instead by what they can do.</p>



<p>Additionally, investing in oneself is always worth the time and effort. Women are already aware of this with an <a href="https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Research/ISC2-Women-in-Cybersecurity-Report.ashx">(ISC)2 study</a> revealing that women have higher education levels and certifications than men in the tech industry. By developing their skills in order to grow in their areas, women can overcome the hurdles and continue to climb the ladder.</p>



 Counteracting the deficit. 



<p>But how exactly can we entice more women to study and eventually work within the tech industry? The key is to get them <a href="https://technative.io/overcoming-the-gender-disparity-in-tech/">interested at an early age</a>, specifically, before high school, according to <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/empowering-women-to-work-in-cybersecurity-is-a-win-win">a former diversity, inclusion, and equity manager at Cisco Systems</a> and a member of the board of Women in Cybersecurity. But achieving this comes down to breaking stereotypes as well as highlighting women role models in the industry.</p>



<p>Women who have low awareness of IT and cybersecurity view those working within the field as “nerds” or “hackers” while those women who have greater awareness of the industry have a more positive perception. It’s easy to believe in stereotypes when there is a lack of role models for individuals to look up to. That’s precisely why society needs to highlight women who are innovative, forward-thinking creators.</p>



<p>Furthermore, since contributing to society is among the top three priorities for women in choosing a job, perhaps if we highlighted women innovators and their contributions more often, more women would follow in their paths leading them to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/career/">a rewarding career</a>.</p>



 



  



 



 Inspiring tomorrow’s innovators. 



<p>Here are a few women in the IT sector who have made major contributions to society. Going all the way back to the year 1843 when she published the first algorithm, <a href="https://www.mpg.de/female-pioneers-of-science/Ada-Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> is said to be the world’s first computer programmer. Years later, in the 1940s, Hollywood actress <a href="https://www.dpma.de/english/our_office/publications/ingeniouswomen/hedylamarr-erfinderischefemmefatale/index.html">Hedy Lamarr</a> is credited with co-inventing a frequency-hopping method to control torpedoes remotely without the risk of signal tracking or jamming. This led to the prevention of the Cuban Missile Crisis and also later became part of the technology underlying Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</p>



<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.pioneeringminds.com/nicole-eagan/">Nicole Eagan, Chief Strategy Officer and AI Officer of the company Darktrace,</a> has managed to establish Darktrace as the global leader of AI cyber defense by developing state-of-the-art AI algorithms that detect never-before-seen cyberattacks. She also won the AI Leader of the Year Award at the Tech Leaders Awards in 2020. Additional women tech role models include <a href="https://ranaelkaliouby.com/">Rana el Kaliouby, former CEO and co-founder of Affectiva and current CEO of Smart Eye</a>. She continues to establish and lead the emotion AI industry and advocates for women mentors for the next generation. Lastly, <a href="https://www.womenleadersincybersecurity.org/nasrin-rezai">Nasrin Rezai, Chief Information Security Officer at Verizon</a>, advocates for a more accessible, humanized approach to cybersecurity for all and says that it’s our job to enable women to enter the tech field and create opportunities so they stay.</p>



<p>With such accomplished women blazing the trail for a female-friendly future, the outlook appears bright. However, it’s one thing to get women interested in the industry but it’s another to get them to join and stay. As such, along with wanting to have a career that contributes to society, women also prioritize earning a high salary and having a good work-life balance.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many women feel that the tech industry does not allow them to create such a balance. Therefore, tech businesses should make it a point to allow flexibility within the company for <a href="https://wearetechwomen.com/the-challenges-of-hybrid-work-in-tech-companies-reintegrating-women-into-the-workforce-post-parental-leave/">women with families to create a better balance</a> that they feel they can live with. By providing that support, tech companies can offer more women the opportunities they are looking for and, in the end, create a more diverse and secure environment that benefits everyone.</p>



 Women at IDnow. 



<p>At IDnow, we are aware of the gender disparity in the industry and are working to create a more gender diverse community in the tech sector. The gender split in our company is at 63% male and 36% female and thus above the industry’s average. We know that women in tech are talented and a crucial part to any industry.</p>



<p>As such, IDnow is pleased to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/celebrating-women-idnow/">highlight those women</a> and their accomplishments to provide inspiration for other females who consider working within the tech industry. We welcome their endeavors and hope that the advice they provide will encourage more women to follow in their footsteps.</p>



 Blazing ahead—the only place to go is up. 



<p>As we encourage more women to take part in the IT industry, it’s important to keep in mind the advice future generations of women should follow. The women already in the industry have much to share and many are advocates for the young women starting their careers.</p>



<p>International Women’s Day, which dates back to 1911 when women were fighting for their right to vote and hold public office, is a day to remind not only women, but everyone that a brighter future means less bias.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.internationalwomensday.com/Theme">This year’s theme of #EmbraceEquity</a> reminds everyone that just because we give people equal opportunities doesn’t mean they are able to achieve the same goal. We need to make sure that we are providing the correct resources to every individual because each person has a different starting position.</p>



<p>Thus, the resources and advice women need for a female-friendly culture in tech include skills/training, networks and perseverance, along with taking risks and making their voice heard.</p>



<p>In the end, women are innovators; they are strong, courageous, and they have ideas for a better tomorrow because they belong.</p>

<p>This is one of an occasional series examining misconceptions that people have about personal data empowerment and personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>When Mydex talks about empowering people with their own data, putting them in control, enabling them to manage their data and so on, we often get pushback. Surprisingly often, in&nbsp;fact.</p><p>The thing is, we are told condescendingly, “People just don’t want to manage their data”. Here, for example, is how one paid adviser to the Scottish Government recently responded to a debate about digital identity and the personal data needed to underpin it put&nbsp;it:</p><blockquote>“The problem with the ID world is the misconception that a user really wants an ID let alone own their&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p>From our perspective and experience working with real people this is nonsense and here’s&nbsp;why.</p> Well, duh!! <p>That’s our first response when we’re told that people don’t want to manage their data: well,&nbsp;duh!</p><p>Generally speaking, people don’t want to have to work for a living or do household chores. But they still have to, whether they want to or not. Ditto, with personal data. If we want to get stuff done nowadays — any sort of online dealings with almost any sort of organisation — we have to provide some information about ourselves. Quite often, it can be a lot of information, and we not only have to provide this information but prove it’s true too. So, whether we like it or not, we have to manage our data. The same goes for interacting by the phone, in person or in writing via forms. Everyone needs to use their personal data and know things about themselves and their&nbsp;lives.</p><p>The implication of someone declaring that ‘people won’t want to manage their data is: ”therefore, there’s no point in trying to help them do so”. The logic of the argument goes like this: “People don’t want to do household chores, so therefore there’s no point providing them with washing machines or vacuum cleaners. What’s wrong with a bit of elbow&nbsp;grease?”</p><p>Often, behind this almost-sneering condescension lies something more sinister. It goes like this: “People don’t want to manage their data but we do. So why don’t you leave us free to manage people’s data (so that we can use their data in our interests rather than theirs without even involving them)?”</p> But it’s so complicated! <p>A second reason for arguing that people don’t want to manage their data is because it’s so complicated. It’s true. Currently, it is incredibly complicated. To really manage our data, we would have to jump through all the necessary hoops to get inside hundreds of different organisations systems, read and understand their privacy policies, find out how to adjust the settings, and make these adjustments.</p><p>An awful burden in other words. A huge amount of what we call FERC — Friction, Effort, Risk and Cost. If this is what ‘managing your data’ means, then of course nobody wants to do it. The same goes for the manual way in which all have to keep our own records, largely in paper files of some&nbsp;kind.</p><p>But does it really have to be that complicated? Of course it doesn’t. The complexity we see around us to today is invented and imposed by corporate lawyers trying to make things as complicated and difficult as possible, so that their paymasters can get away with as much as possible.</p><p>In reality, managing your data can and should be simple. People should be able to see every organisation they have shared their data with on one single consents dashboard, and the content of these consents can and should be incredibly simple, boiling down to just a few obvious questions such as ‘what service is this data being used for?’, and ‘what data is needed to provide this service?’</p><p>That’s what ‘managing your data’ should look like: easy and simple, even to the degree that there are tools working automatically for you, under your instruction ‘as you sleep’ so that you don’t even have to think about it — like using a direct debit or standing order to make regular payments. These are the sorts of data management services we at Mydex are developing — services designed to strip out all that artificial, imposed complexity to make managing and using your data as simple as using a smart phone banking app, if not&nbsp;simpler.</p><p>Those who insist that citizens don’t want to manage their data ignore all this. Sometimes, people get so fixated with how things currently are that they can’t imagine it being any different, and this is a case in point. But in our experience the ‘it’s all too complicated!’ argument is also often used by those with a hidden agenda. They have a vested interest in keeping things as complicated as possible — because it’s this that gives them the opportunity to take advantage of people not managing their data. They know that complexity drives resignation, and that is what they are&nbsp;after.</p> For what&nbsp;purpose? <p>When we talk about citizens managing their data, some people seem to assume we think that ‘control’ and ‘managing your data’ is supposed to be a desirable end in itself. As if people want to manage their data for the sheer hell of&nbsp;it!</p><p>Most people want to exercise control over their money, but they don’t want to exercise this control for the sake of it, because they like exercising control. They want to exercise control because they want to avoid the risks and harms of not exercising this control and because they want to access the benefits that come from being in control. Like going to work because you want to enjoy the benefits of the money you&nbsp;earn.</p><p>Those who say ‘people don’t want to manage their data’ simply ignore this question of purpose. But it is critical. Mydex doesn’t want to help citizens manage their data simply for the sake of managing their data. We want to help them manage their data so that they can access the benefits it brings — of getting stuff done in their lives, making it easier to access and use services, saving time, avoiding duplication and repetition of effort, eradicating the need to fill in forms, and so&nbsp;on.</p> Conclusion <p>Yes, there is a tiny element of truth to the claim that people don’t want to manage their data. Yes, today the way things stand, it’s a chore that most people would like to avoid. But are those who insist that people don’t want to manage their data actually suggesting any ways to improve the situation?</p><p>No. Almost invariably, they are not. They are using it as an excuse to do nothing. Or worse, to defend a hidden agenda. They don’t want citizens to control their own data, because they want to control this data for their own purposes.</p><p>Mydex wants to empower people with their data so that they can use their own data to improve their lives. Doing so involves ‘managing your data’, and we are committed to making this as simple and easy as possible.</p><p>Seen from this perspective, does anyone really not want to ‘manage their&nbsp;data’?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/do-people-really-want-to-manage-their-data-bac784b98be1">Do people really want to manage their data?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

A message from Elina Cadouri, Dock's Co-founder and COO<p>Happy International Women’s Day!</p><p>I’m Elina Cadouri, Dock’s Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer. At Dock we want to take a moment to recognize the incredible contributions that women have made in the growth and development of Web3, the decentralized and blockchain-based version of the internet that is still in its early stages of development. </p><p>There has been an <a href="https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/women-in-the-blockchain-industry-who-are-making-a-huge-impact/?ref=blog.dock.io">increase in women</a> becoming business leaders, investors, traders, analysts, and heads of companies in the blockchain and Web3 industry. While the role of women in Web3 is growing, there is still a lot of work to be done to ensure that the ecosystem is truly inclusive and representative of all voices. </p><p>Even though more efforts are needed to support and encourage the participation of women in the development, governance, and adoption of Web3 technologies, there are fortunately many areas where women are contributing greatly in the industry. </p><p>Let's meet a few of many incredible women in Web3 and blockchain.</p> 1) Deborah Ojengdede, CEO of <a href="https://afengroup.com/?ref=blog.dock.io">AFEN</a> <p>Deborah’s curiosity about cryptocurrency was the initial motivation for her to explore blockchain and Web3. As she delved deeper into the technology, she began to understand its potential for creating decentralized and transparent systems that could solve some of the challenges facing Africa. &nbsp;</p><p>In addition to being the CEO of AFEN Blockchain Group, Deborah Ojengbede has over 5 years of banking experience under her belt, with a diverse background that includes Strategy &amp; Innovation, Business Development, and Women Banking.</p><p>Deborah’s culminating experience is now being utilized to drive blockchain adoption in Africa through innovative Web3 protocols.</p><p>The inspiration to start AFEN</p><p>Deborah: “The inspiration to start AFEN came from the need to create a platform that connects African talents with the Web3 world, and we do this through our two products: <a href="https://nftytribe.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">NftyTribe</a> and <a href="https://afengroup.com/bloomone?ref=blog.dock.io">BloomOne Academy</a>.</p><p>NftyTribe is a multi-chain NFT marketplace that provides traditional and digital African creators with unique tools and resources to reach global audiences. BloomOne Academy is a platform dedicated to educating African talents in the Web3 space, making it the go-to platform for those looking to kickstart or advance their career in the industry.</p><p>I am excited about the future of blockchain and Web3 in Africa, and I believe that AFEN has an important role to play in driving adoption and innovation on the continent. Our mission is to create a more inclusive and equitable Web3 ecosystem that empowers African talents and contributes to the development of the continent.”</p>NFT: Eze Nwaanyi / Creator: Jesse Tomi (AfroX Collection)<p>Accomplishments</p><p>AFEN and Deborah’s achievements include:</p>  Establishing AFEN as a leading Web3 startup in Africa  Building a platform that is creating opportunities for African creatives  Growing BloomOne Academy to become a trusted source of Web3 education for African talents  Developing partnerships with other leading blockchain and non-blockchain companies to expand their reach and impact  Creating a community of Web3 enthusiasts who are passionate about driving blockchain adoption in Africa  <p>Deborah’s advice for women who are interested in entering the Web3 industry</p><p>“My advice to women is to start by learning as much as possible about the technology and its potential use cases. It's also important to get involved in the community by attending events, participating in forums, and networking with others in the industry.</p><p>It is very important to be open to collaborating and partnering with other people in the space. Like it is in every industry, resilience is key! Representation matters and it would be lovely to see more women participating in the space.”</p>NFT: Space Turtle / Creator: ConservatioNFT - for The Turtle Foundation, Cape Verde<p>Recommended skills to develop to succeed in the Web3 industry</p><p>“The key skills that women need to have to succeed in the Web3 industry include a strong work ethic, a willingness to learn, and the ability to adapt to new developments. Women can cultivate these qualities by seeking out mentors and role models in the industry, participating in hackathons and other collaborative projects, and pursuing education and training in blockchain technology.”</p><p>Check out:</p>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/afenblockchain?ref=blog.dock.io">@Afenblockchain</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/deborahofafen?s=21&amp;ref=blog.dock.io">@Deborahofafen</a>  <a href="https://afengroup.com/blog?ref=blog.dock.io">AFEN's updates</a>  <p>2) Krista Kim, <a href="https://www.kristakimstudio.com/?ref=blog.dock.io">contemporary artist</a> and founder of the Techism movement (2014) </p>Photo credit: Frederic Auerbach<p>Krista first became interested in blockchain and Web3 because she saw the potential for it to revolutionize the art world. As an artist, she was always interested in exploring new technologies and how they could be used to create innovative and immersive experiences for viewers. </p><p>When she learned about blockchain, she realized that it could solve many of the problems facing the art world, such as issues of authenticity, ownership, and provenance. She also saw the potential for blockchain to create new business models that could empower artists and enable them to monetize their work in new ways.</p><p>The inspiration to begin the Techism Movement and Mars House</p><p>“The Technism Movement was inspired by my fascination with technology and its potential to create new forms of art. I wanted to explore the intersection between art and technology and create works that were both visually stunning and intellectually engaging. </p><p>Mars House was an extension of this idea, and it was also influenced by my interest in creating immersive experiences that transport viewers to another world. I wanted to create a space that was both beautiful and surreal, and that offered a glimpse into what the future of art and architecture could look like.”</p>Krista Kim made the world's first digital home that sold for 288 ETH on SuperRare in March 2020<p>Accomplishments</p><p>Krista’s many achievements include: </p>  Writing the Techism manifesto in 2014 and being recognized as a pioneer in the field of blockchain art  Designing <a href="https://www.kristakimstudio.com/marshouse?ref=blog.dock.io">Mars House, the first NFT digital house</a> that sold for over $500,000 USD on SuperRare  Being named a <a href="https://www.kristakimstudio.com/louis200?ref=blog.dock.io">Louis Vuitton #Louis200</a> visionary in 2021 and participating in an art collaboration with 200 other visionaries that exhibited globally  Mars House was featured on the cover of Vogue Hong Kong 2022 as a first metaverse cover in history of publishing  Her artwork, “Bending Light” was featured on the cover of Harper's Bazaar UK’s 10th Anniversary art edition in 2022  Using her platform to advocate for diversity and inclusivity in the art and tech industries  Being named the metaverse editor for Vogue Singapore in 2022  Pioneering the metaverse as a solution for the mental health crisis with Dr. Srini Pillay, MD (Harvard)  Photo credit: Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.<p>Krista’s advice for women who are interested in entering the Web3 industry or building a career in blockchain technology</p><p>“Be persistent and believe in yourself. This is still a male-dominated field, but there are many women who are making significant contributions and breaking down barriers. It's important to network with other women in the industry, to stay informed about new developments, and to be willing to take risks and pursue your passions.”</p><p>Recommended skills that women need to have to succeed in the Web3 industry</p><p>“The key skills that women need to have to succeed in the Web3 industry include a strong understanding of blockchain technology, creativity, adaptability, and perseverance. Women who want to cultivate these qualities can start by learning as much as they can about blockchain and Web3, experimenting with new technologies, and collaborating with others in the industry. It's also important to stay up-to-date on industry trends and to be willing to take risks and try new things.</p><p>I'm excited about the future of blockchain and Web3 and the potential it has to transform not just the art world, but many other industries as well. I believe that this technology has the power to create a more decentralized, equitable, and transparent world, and I'm committed to using my platform to advocate for these values.”</p><p>Check out:</p>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Krista_Kim?ref=blog.dock.io">@Krista_Kim</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/0_metaverse?ref=blog.dock.io">@0_metaverse</a>  <a href="https://www.kristakimstudio.com/lambourghini?ref=blog.dock.io">Ultimate 1:1 NFT Lamborghini created by Krista Kim in collaboration with Steve Aoki</a>  <p>3) Leah Sams, award-winning illustrator behind the NFT Movement <a href="https://powerofwomen.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Power of Women</a> </p><p>Leah fell into Web3 almost completely by chance when COVID-19 struck and virtually all of her work as a set and costume designer in theatre disappeared overnight. As she shifted her focus to illustration, graphic design, and teaching art, her partner also left a career in the music industry and became a firefighter. At the time, his colleagues were really interested in crypto and when they saw some of her digital illustrations, they encouraged her to take a look at blockchain technology and NFTs. And the rest is history!</p><p>The inspiration to start Power of Women</p><p>“When I first entered the space 18 months ago, there were very few female-led NFT projects or collections. Women made up less than 5% of collectors and there were even fewer NFT artworks that accurately and authentically represented women as the gorgeous humans we are. As a complete novice and newcomer to Web3, not only was this super daunting, but I felt a duty to proactively inspire other women to embrace this incredible new technology and drive a change.</p><p>I’ve always believed in empowerment through representation. Given that art is what defines most NFT collections and many Web3 brands, I felt it was vital to create artworks that are representative of the women and girls we are seeking to onboard into the space — not solely in terms of appearance, but in the representation of our journeys, our experiences, our sexuality, and so much more. It was at this moment that Power Of Women was born. </p><p>One of my first ever NFT artworks was titled “BE BOLD.” Looking back on this now, I think these two words perfectly capture what Web3 means to me.”<br></p>Power of Women: Blazing Collection<p>Accomplishments</p><p>Leah’s achievements include:</p>  Her artworks exhibited at the ADIDAS International Women’s Month exhibition at their flagship store in London last year  Winning the NFT.NYC Diversity Award as the artist for the sell-out collection, <a href="https://linktr.ee/theroyalsnft?ref=blog.dock.io">The Royals</a>  <a href="https://www.mancity.com/news/club/international-womens-day-digital-art-collection-announced-manchester-city-63813436?ref=blog.dock.io#:~:text=City%20announce%20latest%20digital%20art%20collection%20as%20part%20of%20International%20Women's%20Day%20celebrations,-Fri%2003%20Mar&amp;text=Manchester%20City%20has%20today%20announced,created%20by%20Power%20Of%20Women">Collaborating with Manchester City Football Club</a> for its sixth collaborative art drop created by Power of Women for International Women’s Day 2023  <p>“It may seem simple, but earning a living through my art has always been an ambition and I feel so grateful that I’m fortunate enough to be able to do this. But perhaps most rewarding, are the messages I receive from other women in the space who feel that my artwork represents them, has told their story, or has inspired them to pursue their dreams too.”</p><p>Leah’s advice for women who are interested in entering the Web3 industry </p><p>“Explore with bundles of curiosity and don’t be afraid to ask questions. We’re all still new here and there is so much we can learn from each other. Identify Web3 brands that resonate with you and be open to opportunities for collaboration. The NFT space moves at lightning speed and success often comes with your ability to be flexible and pivot, but without compromising on the integrity of your values or the authenticity of your work. </p><p>Web3 also offers us a far more flexible way of working than ever before, but it’s important to set boundaries and allow yourself time and space to reset when you need it. And finally, treat others with kindness, love and respect, and you will be surprised at how quickly this is returned.”</p>Power of Women: “Autumn”<p>Recommended skills that women need to have to succeed in the Web3 industry<br>“As women, we often tend to be quiet about our skills and our achievements, but Web3 is a place to be loud and proud about your work. Don’t be afraid to shout about your wins and celebrate the achievements of others too.</p><p>Perseverance is key. Success does not come overnight and showing up for yourself and others is vital. One of the most important things I’ve learned is the power that comes with community, and the importance of valuing your own community and the communities you’re a part of. Communication, transparency, and a desire to connect with like minded souls are key as well as a willingness to learn and challenge yourself like never before.”</p><p>Check out:</p>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/PowerOfWomenNFT?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&amp;ref=blog.dock.io">@PowerofWomenNFT</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/leahsams?ref=blog.dock.io">@leahsams</a>  <a href="https://powerofwomen.io/shop?ref=blog.dock.io">The Power Shop</a>   Other Amazing Women in Web3 <p>It’s wonderful to see the variety of projects that women in Web3 are developing, accelerating, and creating.

  <p>Step-up authentication in an application is a pattern of allowing access to non-critical resources using basic level of authentication, and requiring additional authentications for critical resources.</p>

<p>In this article, we will explore the&nbsp;whys&nbsp;and&nbsp;hows of step-up authentication in modern applications that include Single Page Applications (SPA) and native mobile applications.</p>

<p>Federation protocols such as&nbsp;OpenID Connect (OIDC)&nbsp;are getting increasingly popular for modern applications to enhance security by trusting an appropriate identity provider. Here we will focus primarily on the OIDC&nbsp;standard and how it can be leveraged to provide the step-up functions in an idiomatic way.</p>

 Why an application needs step-up authentication 

<blockquote>
  <p>“Freedom, security, convenience – choose two.” - Dan Geer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Step-up authentication is useful in balancing between frictionless user experience and security.</p>

<p>In general, not all aspects of an application are equally critical. Prioritizing convenience over security for authentication to relatively non-critical resources can ensure a smoother user experience. When the user tries to access sensitive resources, additional scrutiny will ensure integrity and confidentiality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, while doing a fund transfer, user probably won’t mind multi-factor authentication challenge; while they can otherwise browse the application for just checking balances and viewing offers without much friction.</p>

<p>Listed below are some real world scenarios where an application will typically challenge user with additional verification:</p>

 
   
    <p>Update profile information</p>
   
   
    <p>Forgot password</p>
   
   
    <p>Purchase merchandise</p>
   
   
    <p>Deposit checks</p>
   
   
    <p>Transfer funds</p>
   
   
    <p>Withdraw money from account</p>
   
   
    <p>Making payments (Accounts Payable)</p>
   
   
    <p>Update accounting information</p>
   
   
    <p>Adjust payroll</p>
   
   
    <p>Access salary data</p>
   
   
    <p>Approve purchase orders</p>
   
   
    <p>Access customer data</p>
   
   
    <p>Update contracts</p>
   
   
    <p>Add new person to the insurance</p>
   
   
    <p>Access premium news articles</p>
   
 

<p>In general, actions that change data or reveal secret information will require a higher level of verification than the default for other operations.</p>

 How did legacy applications handle this? 

<p>Traditionally applications have handled step-up authentication by building the functionality inside the application. The implementations waste engineering effort by missing an opportunity to reuse well-tested code, incur ongoing maintenance burden, and are prone to security loopholes.</p>

<p>Legacy access management solutions (Siteminder,&nbsp;Oracle Access Manager) mostly leverage agent-based reverse proxy architecture, and provide the step-up function by allowing to specify access policies based on&nbsp;HTTP URL paths. This architecture does not work well with modern SPA and mobile applications, since their application resources are not inherently URL based.</p>

 Federation and step-up 

<p>Additionally, step-up authentication becomes tricky when <a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/what-is-federated-identity/">federation protocols</a> such as&nbsp;OIDC&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2020/09/what-is-saml/">SAML</a> are used, since the standard federation protocols, unlike&nbsp;legacy reverse proxy&nbsp;solutions, do not track every user interaction with an application.</p>

<p>The applications then need to initiate the step-up scenarios by themselves. Fortunately,&nbsp;OIDC&nbsp;has specifications to help applications build such scenarios and co-ordinate with&nbsp;identity provider&nbsp;for seamless step-up service in a declarative policy driven fashion.</p>

 Wait! Do you just want to re-authenticate? 

<p>Sometimes, a user is authenticated to a sufficient level when they first logged in, but the compromise for convenience is to allow long-lived sessions. In this case, re-authentication may be a more appropriate solution than step-up authentication. OIDC&nbsp;supports such scenario&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">implicitly</a>.</p>

<p>In this case, the application will initiate a new&nbsp;authorization request&nbsp;with the identity provider. The request will have the value for the&nbsp;prompt&nbsp;parameter&nbsp;login. Then the authentication server will force re-authentication, even if there is an existing active session.</p>

   <code>GET /authorize? 
	response_type=code 
	&amp;scope=openid%20profile%20email 
	&amp;client_id=****** &amp;state=af0ifjsldkj 
	&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb 
	&amp;prompt=login HTTP/1.1 
Host: server.example.com
</code>   

 Elevate the session authentication level 

<p>Every time the user tries to access a sensitive area of an application, prompting for re-authentication introduces friction in user experience. To properly strike a balance between smooth user experience and security considerations, the technique of session elevation&nbsp;can be adopted.</p>

<p>The idea is to maintain a basic assurance level for a user session after user initially authenticates to the application.&nbsp;</p>

 
   
    <p>When the user accesses a sensitive resource, she is prompted for step-up authentication using additional authentication factors.&nbsp;</p>
   
   
    <p>Once step-up is successful, the user session is moved to a higher assurance level for a specified duration of time.&nbsp;</p>
   
   
    <p>Next time she accesses the sensitive area within the stipulated period, since her session is already at the elevated level, no more authentication challenge is presented, ensuring a relatively frictionless user experience.</p>
   
 

<p>With&nbsp;OIDC, this behavior is achievable using the&nbsp;<code>acr_values</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>max_age</code>&nbsp;parameters of the authentication request.</p>

<p>The following diagram steps through the sequence of access-</p>

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>The&nbsp;acr_values&nbsp;parameter will have the assurance level requested for a session.&nbsp;</p>

     
       
        <p>If there is an existing session with a lower level of assurance, the authentication server will prompt the user for additional factors needed to satisfy the requested level of assurance.&nbsp;</p>
       
       
        <p>If the session is already at the requested level or higher, the authentication server will proceed without any additional user challenge.</p>
       
     
   
   
    <p>The&nbsp;max_age&nbsp;parameter will keep the session elevated only for the stipulated duration. This is useful in scenario such as allowing access to sensitive resources, for say next 30 minutes, before it goes back to the previous assurance level.</p>
   
 

   <code>GET /authorize? 
	response_type=code 
	&amp;prompt=login 
	&amp;scope=openid%20profile%20email 
	&amp;client_id=****** 
	&amp;state=af0ifjsldkj 
	&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb 
	&amp;acr_values=phr 
	&amp;max_age=30 HTTP/1.1 
Host: server.example.com\
</code>   

 How Okta can help 

 Okta Customer Identity Cloud (CIC) 

 
   
    <p>Okta CIC comes with a flexible and extensible authentication engine, which can easily inspect&nbsp;<code>acr_values</code>&nbsp;in the authentication request and initiate step-up authentication.&nbsp;</p>
   
   
    <p>CIC recommends using the&nbsp;<code>acr_values</code>&nbsp;as defined in&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-provider-authentication-policy-extension-1_0.html">this</a>&nbsp;OIDC spec. For example, <code>http://schemas.openid.net/pape/policies/2007/06/multi-factor</code>.</p>
   
   
    <p>CIC can be configured to provide&nbsp;<a href="https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/step-up-authentication">step-up authentication</a>&nbsp;for both&nbsp;<a href="https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/step-up-authentication/configure-step-up-authentication-for-web-apps">web applications</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/step-up-authentication/configure-step-up-authentication-for-apis">API</a></p>
   
 

 Okta Workforce Identity Cloud (WIC) 

 
   
    <p>WIC Authorization server has inbuilt support for step-up authentication.&nbsp;</p>
   
   
    <p>Currently, WIC supports a pre-defined&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/step-up-authentication/main/#predefined-parameter-values">list</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;acr_values.&nbsp;</p>
   
   
    <p>The non-okta-specific defined values such as&nbsp;phr&nbsp;and&nbsp;phrh&nbsp;are taken from&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-eap-acr-values-1_0.html#OpenID.PAPE">this</a>&nbsp;OIDC spec.&nbsp;</p>
   
   
    <p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/step-up-authentication/main/">This guide</a> explains the capability in more detail.</p>
   
 

 How about transactional MFA? 

<p>Transactional MFA is a close cousin of step-up authentication. In some step-up cases, transactional MFA can be used instead.</p>

<p>Consider the scenario-&nbsp;</p>

 
   
    <p>User authenticates to the application</p>
   
   
    <p>At some point the user tries to access a sensitive resource</p>
   
   
    <p>User receives a push notification or email link in her mobile to approve the transaction</p>
   
   
    <p>Once approved, the access is granted to the resource</p>
   
 

<p>Recent standards like&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html">OIDC CIBA</a>&nbsp;allow this kind of out-of-band transactional MFA and might in some cases meet the need to step-up authentication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One important difference is, while&nbsp;CIBA&nbsp;can be used to provide MFA during sensitive transaction, it typically does not affect any provider specific session. Also,&nbsp;CIBA&nbsp;is inherently out-of-band, and has its own niche uses.&nbsp;</p>

  The IMF has released a paper addressing concerns raised by member countries on the risks and benefits of crypto and how to structure appropriate policy responses.  The paper sets out a framework of nine elements to help member countries develop a comprehensive, consistent, &amp; coordinated policy response.  It aims to be mindful not to stifle innovation and allow leveraging the underlying technologies of crypto&nbsp;assets.  <p>Last week, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published an <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/02/23/pr2351-imf-executive-board-discusses-elements-of-effective-policies-for-crypto-assets">article</a> on its site discussing different elements of effective policies for crypto assets that will guide member countries.</p><p>The IMF argued that in the light of the failure of various exchanges and other actors within the crypto ecosystem, as well as the collapse of certain crypto assets, setting effective policies for digital currencies has become a key priority for authorities.</p><p>It says doing nothing is not an option, as crypto assets may continue to evolve despite the current downturn.</p> The IMF’s&nbsp;Proposal <p>With that in mind, the paper provides a framework of nine elements to develop a policy response that is comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated.</p><p>The IMF insists that by adopting the framework, policymakers can better mitigate the crypto risks while harnessing the potential benefits of its technological innovation.</p><p>The suggested policy actions involve safeguarding monetary sovereignty and stability by strengthening monetary policy frameworks and not granting crypto official currency or legal tender&nbsp;status.</p><p>Guarding against excessive volatility, maintaining the effectiveness of volatility management measures, analyzing and disclosing fiscal risks, and adopting a clear tax treatment are also part of IMF’s policy&nbsp;actions.</p><p>Other proposed elements include establishing legal certainty of crypto and developing and enforcing prudent oversight requirements for all crypto market&nbsp;actors.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/compliant-defi-the-way-out-of-commingling-clean-and-illicit-funds-in-a-decentralized-finance-economy">Compliant DeFi — the way out of Commingling Clean and Illicit Funds in a Decentralized Finance&nbsp;Economy</a></p><p>It also talks of establishing a joint monitoring framework across different domestic agencies and achieving global collaboration to enhance the enforcement of crypto asset regulations and avoid regulatory arbitrage.</p><p>At last, the IMF proposes monitoring the impact of crypto assets on the stability of the international monetary system and strengthening global cooperation to develop digital infrastructures and alternative solutions for cross-border payments and&nbsp;finance.</p><p>“The growing adoption of crypto assets in some countries, the extra-territorial nature of crypto assets and its providers, and the increasing interlinkages with the financial system, motivate the need for a comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated response,” stated the&nbsp;paper.</p><p>The IMF also notes in its paper that while the potential benefits of crypto have yet to be seen, significant risks have arisen, including risks to the effectiveness of the monetary policy, capital flow volatility, and fiscal risks. Additionally, the global financial agency also red-flagged several concerns around cryptocurrencies, such as consumer protection, legal risks, financial stability, and market integrity.</p> Not Keen on Outright Ban &amp; Stifle Innovation <p>While the IMF has stressed that strict bans aren’t something they are keen on, they haven’t completely ruled it out either. Instead, they are batting for targeted restrictions.</p><p>At the same time, they want regulation to be mindful not to stifle innovation, as the agency believes the public sector could leverage some of the underlying technologies of crypto assets for their public policy objectives.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/between-freedom-and-security-preserving-privacy-in-the-crypto-economy">Between Freedom and Security — Preserving Privacy in the Crypto&nbsp;Economy</a></p> Final Note <p>Although the IMF’s proposed crypto policy may not immediately impact end users, it could potentially lead to changes in the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies that may affect their ability to access and use these assets in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>It may even end the most significant benefit of using cryptocurrencies, which is its privacy-friendly capabilities, thereby impacting the users that prefer to transact using crypto assets to keep their identity&nbsp;hidden.</p><p>Whatever approach or suggestions the IMF makes, it should do it from the end user’s perspective, and its aim should be to protect them by all means. However, banning an entire industry outright, especially one as innovative and game-changing as cryptocurrencies, should definitely be off the table. Curtailing innovation within the crypto space should not be an option&nbsp;either.</p><p>And just like traditional financial space, there are several malicious actors within the crypto space, too, but it is crucial to note the technology itself has no malicious intent. It is a mere&nbsp;tool.</p><p>Overall, regulators and industry stakeholders must work together to address all the issues currently present in the crypto world for the benefit of its end users globally, which by recent estimates, have surpassed a remarkable figure of 420 million. And only then will the industry prosper, achieve mass adoption, and complete the objectives that the cryptocurrencies were truly meant&nbsp;for.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 Artificial Intelligence and Humanity 
 Humans versus technology 
<p>The advancement in technology for the past several decades has stirred a growing debate of humans versus artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, if AI begins to take over tasks which were traditionally associated with people, what are people left with? Their sense of humanity and individual identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digitalization has impacted every aspect of our lives, making it easier for us to perform our daily tasks. Because of this, we have more or less become dependent on technology in order to operate in the online world.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Overall, the topic of AI is quite controversial. Throughout history, humans have been cautious about accepting new technologies since the dawn of the industrial age. While technology has undoubtedly brought significant improvements to our lives, an important question remains:</p>
 
<p>Will AI ultimately be beneficial or detrimental to our well-being in the long run?</p>
 
<p>We will examine the potential advantages and disadvantages of AI in the following sections.</p>
 The benefits of Artificial Intelligence 
<p>Despite the potential risks and challenges posed by AI, there is no denying that it brings many benefits and advantages for humanity.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Technology has filled our lives with entertainment, efficiency, and enhanced accessibility by eliminating frustrating and time-consuming tasks. Not only that, but it has made performing our daily tasks considerably easier and it has opened doors to an incredible library of information.</p>
 
<p>Let’s briefly explore some of AI’s key benefits:</p>
 
 
 
 Automation. Advanced technology can program AI to do tedious, repetitive mundane jobs, so that humans can focus on more complex and creative tasks. 
 
 
 
 
 Efficiency. AI has the capability to analyze a large amount of data and find patterns and trends that might be hard for humans to see. This can help individuals make better decisions. 
 
 
 Accesibility. Thanks to modern technology, individuals can benefit from applications that make working, studying, and communicating remotely much easier.&nbsp; 
 Accuracy. Under careful supervision, AI can perform tasks with high accuracy, reducing the risk of errors and improving performance tremendously. 
 
 
 The dark side of Artificial Intelligence 
<p>With AI progressing at incredible speeds, technology has raised concerns about privacy and security. One of the biggest concerns nowadays is the threat of AI stealing human identities. There has been an increase in data breaches and cyberattacks, which leads to a growing need for stronger security measures to protect our personal data.</p>
 
<p>Like any other innovation, AI undoubtedly has its drawbacks, which are often overshadowed by its benefits. Basically, AI systems are designed to learn and make decisions based on data. Therefore, if the data used to train these systems is biased or incomplete, it can lead to flawed decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>We can understand the dark side of AI once we examine some of its potential risks and negative impacts:</p>
 
 In the wrong hands, AI systems can be used for malicious purposes, such as cyberattacks. 
 Because of this, privacy and security are major concerns when it comes to AI. 
 Data breaches could result in divulging sensitive data, leading to significant consequences, like loss of privacy. 
 Hackers can make use of the leaked data to steal or forge individuals’ digital identities. 
 AI can generate fake identities, which can be used to influence the decision-making or output of a system. 
 
 
<p>As AI systems continue to evolve, it becomes more and more difficult to predict their actions. Consequently, we cannot hold them accountable for their faulty behavior.&nbsp;</p>
 What can we do, then? 
<p>Artificial intelligence is currently not a sentient being, it cannot make its own decisions.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>It can either be used for good purposes or for malicious purposes, depending on the intentions of the individuals behind it. And, while humans are not equipped with the accuracy and efficiency of state-of-the-art technology, we can use AI to fight against malicious AI.</p>
 
<p>Thankfully, there is a method which can verify an individual’s identity in a secure, efficient and highly accurate manner.&nbsp;</p>
 AI-Powered Proof of Individuality 
 What is Proof of Individuality? 
<p>Proof of individuality (POI) is a protocol that supports the statement that every person is a distinct and unique individual. As a matter of fact, individuality is a core aspect of human existence. It refers to the one-of-a-kind set of characteristics, thoughts, emotions and perspectives that make each person different from one another.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>While digital identities can be stolen and sold, individuality is not something which, at the moment, can be duplicated. At this time, it represents our liveliness as real, tangible, mindful beings.</p>
 Identification in modern times 
<p>Identification is an important aspect of our lives. Above all, it is unique to each and every one of us, and it represents our liveliness. Therefore, as technology makes new, magnificent progress every day, AI-Powered proof of individuality has become an essential part of our daily existence. From accessing bank accounts to opening doors, AI-Powered proof of individuality has revolutionized the way we identify ourselves.</p>
 
<p>Some of the most common AI-Powered proof of individuality methods are:</p>
 
 Fingerprints 
 Facial recognition 
 Iris scans 
 
 
<p>These biometric identification methods are highly accurate and reliable, making them the go-to method for identification in many industries.</p>
 How can AI-Powered Proof of Individuality benefit us? 
<p>Overall, AI-Powered proof of individuality has many advantages. Particularly:</p>
 
 Speed 
 Accuracy 
 Remote identification 
 
 Speed 
 
 The traditional methods of identification, such as presenting a physical paper for verification can cause delays. 
 Ai-Powered proof of individuality methods are much quicker. For example, using a fingerprint scanner can take only a few seconds. 
 As a result, Ai-Powered proof of individuality methods are efficient in situations where time is of the essence. 
 
 Accuracy 
 
 Biometric methods such as facial recognition and iris scans are highly accurate. 
 In such a case, the chance of false positives or false negatives is minimal. 
 This level of accuracy is ideal for high-security situations, such as airport security or government buildings. 
 
 Remote identification 
 
 AI-Powered proof of individuality made it possible to identify individuals remotely. 
 With the use of online identification tools, individuals can verify the authenticity of each other’s identities. 
 There is no need to meet in person anymore. Therefore, physical distance is no longer an obstacle. 
 
 How does AI-Powered Proof of Individuality work? 
 A brief description 
<p>AI-Powered proof of individuality uses artificial intelligence to verify an individual’s identity based on their biometric features and behavior.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>As mentioned previously, biometric features are fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Some of the behavior patterns this technology analyzes are:</p>
 
 Typing speed and style. How a person types on a keyboard, how long they pause between keystrokes, and how hard they press the keys. 
 Mouse movements. How a person moves the cursor on a screen, the direction and speed of their movements. 
 Voice patterns. The way a person talks, their pitch, tone and accent. 
 Smartphone usage. The way a person holds or uses their smartphone, the angle of how they hold their device, or how they swipe and tap on the screen. 
 
 All in the benefit of the individual 
<p>The idea that our devices check our behavior patterns might be anxiety-inducing. Without a doubt, it can be scary thinking how technology knows us better than we know ourselves. However, in this case, AI is programmed to keep our individuality safe from malicious, bad players.</p>
 
<p>This way, organizations can improve security and prevent identity fraud. Furthermore, AI-Powered proof of individuality is more convenient to access digital services without the need for passwords or tangible identification cards. Passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised.</p>
 
<p>Consequently, AI-Powered proof of individuality has the potential to positively transform how we verify our identities in the digital age.</p>
 AI-Powered Proof of Individuality and Selfkey 
<p>Our goal at SelfKey is to offer individuals a secure means of verifying their identity through AI-Powered proof of individuality methods.&nbsp;</p>
 Guidelines for users: 
 
 The user will first have to perform a KYC check.&nbsp; 
 
 
 KYC stands for Know Your Customer, and it is a mandatory process of identifying and verifying an individual’s identity. It is done to ensure that the user is genuinely who they claim to be. 
 
 
 
 The user will then obtain the SelfKey iD SBT.&nbsp; 
 
 
 <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">SBT</a> stands for Soulbound Tokens. They are non-transferrable, verifiable, digital tokens that can show an individual’s accreditations, work experience, work history, and past records. 
 
 
 
 After this, the user onboards to SelfKey DAO. 
 
 
 DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It is governed by a community of individuals on a decentralized blockchain network.&nbsp; 
 The rules of a DAO are transparent to all members in order to create equality between users. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>After the user completes all of the steps above, SelfKey will require an AI-Powered selfie check. This modern method of verifying an individual’s identity uses facial recognition technology.</p>
 
<p>For instance, here’s what happens during an AI-Powered selfie check:</p>
 
 The user will take a selfie and submit it to an AI-Powered system. 
 The AI-Powered system will check the photo against a vast collection of pre-verified images. 
 The system will use algorithms to identify unique facial features, like:&nbsp; 
 
 
 distance between the eyes 
 &nbsp;the shape of the jawline 
 &nbsp;the position of the nose 
 
 
 If the user passes the check, they will receive a POI (proof of identity) credential, which they can stake KEY on. 
 If the user does not pass the check, they will not be allowed to continue. 
 In the case of a false negative, the user will have the possibility to contact support. 
 
 
<p>These AI-Powered selfie checks will be made periodically, each time a user performs important actions within SelfKey DAO.</p>
 How does this benefit us? 
<p>This method is widely used by online platforms and organizations that require a high level of trust and security in their user authentication process. Firstly, it is a quick, convenient, and reliable method. Secondly, and most importantly, AI-powered checks will prevent identity fraud in the online world.</p>
 
<p>For instance, AI-Powered proof of individuality will efficiently and accurately check that:</p>
 
 The user’s selfie is not forged by another individual. 
 The user’s selfie is not AI-generated or fake. 
 The user is a real person. 
 The user’s selfie matches the original selfie they submitted during the KYC check. 
 
 Anti-Sybil technology 
<p>Did you know that there is a term for “identity fraud” in the digital world? In the context of online security and identity verification, “Sybil” refers to the act of creating multiple fake identities or accounts.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>A single, malicious individual or a group can do that, with the intention of manipulating or deceiving the system. Alarmingly, it can carry out spam attacks, manipulate voting in online polls for elections, even inflate the popularity of a website or social media.</p>
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks is a crucial challenge in the design of many online systems. Thankfully, SelfKey’s AI-Powered proof of individuality methods can fight against that.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>Even though technology has posed challenges throughout the decades, it has an immense potential to make society better. AI-Powered Proof of Individuality has become a part of our daily lives, helping us identify ourselves in a quick and efficient manner. The advantages modern identification methods bring are undeniable.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>In spite of that, having concerns about privacy and security is normal, especially when it comes to our individuality. However, SelfKey is continuously working on developing methods to combat those who use cutting-edge technology for malicious purposes.</p>
 
<p>Finally, as technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more complex methods of identification in the future. But, it is vital to remember that we are supposed to use technology to enhance our lives, our work, rather than replace them. The solution is to find a balance between technology and humanity.</p>
<p>Together with SelfKey we can achieve that balance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week in the crypto regulatory update, the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/financial-action-task-force-fatf/"> Financial Action Task Force (FATF) </a>held its second Plenary in Paris. India is ahead of other jurisdictions in adopting a CBDC, while France and Dubai have taken steps to regulate crypto businesses more strictly.</p>



 FATF Plenary – February 2023 



 
 
 



 
<p>On 22-24 February 2023, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) held its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfgeneral/outcomes-fatf-plenary-february-2023.html">second Plenary</a>&nbsp;in Paris under the two-year Singapore Presidency of T. Raja Kumar. Present for the discussions were delegates from over 200 jurisdictions of the Global Network.</p>
 
 



<p>The following topics were covered:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The suspension of the Russian Federation’s membership
  A member is suspended for the first time since the FATF was founded. 



 The FATF issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfgeneral/fatf-statement-russian-federation.html">statement</a>&nbsp;mentioning it acknowledges the United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/1 requesting Russia to retract its armed forces from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. Due to failing to comply with this demand and violating FATF’s core principles, which, as a member, it had agreed to implement and support, Russia will no longer be allowed to participate in FATF meetings or access the Global Network’s files. In turn, the Russian Federation keeps its place and rights as a member of the Global Network of the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering (EAG), meaning it must still implement the FATF Standards and meet its financial obligations. 
  



 Mutual Evaluation Reports will be released by May 2023 for Indonesia and Qatar. 



 Morocco and Cambodia are removed from the Grey List 



 A series of Strategic Initiatives were discussed:
  Beneficial Ownership of legal persons and legal arrangements 



 A report on ransomware attacks’ impact on disrupting the financial flows will be issued in March 2023. It will include a list of risk flags indicating suspicious activities related to ransomware and advice for entities on how to better spot them.&nbsp; 
  
 <blockquote>
<p>„Given the transnational nature of ransomware attacks, it is essential that authorities in each country build on and leverage existing international cooperation mechanisms to successfully tackle the laundering of ransomware payments. Authorities also need to develop the necessary skills and tools to quickly collect key information, trace the nearly instantaneous virtual transactions and recover virtual assets before they dissipate. This means that authorities must extend their collaboration beyond their traditional counterparts to include cyber-security and data protection agencies.”</p>
</blockquote>



  The need to improve the implementation of FATF requirements for VAs and VASPs.&nbsp; 
 <p>Despite FATF’s issuance of crypto-related recommendations in October 2018 and revised in June 2022, the authority observed that many countries have failed to implement them, including Travel Rule one.</p>



<p>A roadmap to strengthen their implementation was agreed upon and in 2024 a report will be issued “on steps FATF members and FSRB countries with materially important virtual asset activity have taken to regulate and supervise virtual asset service providers.”</p>



  A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/Money-Laundering-Terrorist-Financing-Art-Antiquities-Market.html">report</a>&nbsp;showcasing the link between money laundering and art and antiquities was issued.&nbsp; 



 Changes in the Vice Presidency were announced. 
 <p>Between 2023 and 2025, Mr. Jeremy Weil, currently Head of the Canadian delegation to the FATF, will succeed Ms. Elisa de Anda Madrazo, who will step down on June 30, 2023.</p>



 🇮🇷 Iran 



<p>Central Bank of Iran (CBI)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mbri.ac.ir/Home/News_Page?News_ID=396004">stated</a>&nbsp;at the ninth annual conference on electronic banking and payment systems that the preliminary stage of the digital rial and is moving forward with its implementation, however, it will be a slow process. Its aim is for the CBDC to be distributed among individuals and banks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The digital rial is pegged to the Iranian rial at a 1:1 ratio. Mohammad Reza Mani Yekta, Head of the CBI office for supervising payment systems, stated that governing law of the CBDC will align with the rial banknotes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was reported that around ten banks have applied to join the project, and all banks in the jurisdiction are expected to offer crypto-wallets to its nationals for the use of the digital rial.&nbsp;</p>



 🇮🇳 India 



<p>India seems to be ahead of other jurisdictions which are in the preliminary stages of adopting a CBDC. Ajay Kumar Choudhary, Executive Director (ED) at Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stated in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/finance/rbi-to-commence-the-first-digital-rupee-pilot-in-the-wholesale-segment-on-november-1-15056211.htm">CNBC interview</a>&nbsp;that so far, the CBDC pilot program has generated around 800K transactions and, given the interest of the jurisdiction’s nationals in this type of payment environment, is looking to scale up the number of customers to 1M.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The jurisdiction’s interest in the issuance of the CBDC is based on a vision of financial inclusion via a digital economy.</p>



<p>The bank’s representative stated that the CBDC will act as an alternative to cryptos, as „[i]t is aimed to complement, rather than replac[e] physical currency”, and a foreseeable feature of this project is anonymity due to the expectation that it “needs all features of physical currency”. To this end the bank is looking for an offline solution.</p>



<p>To further the project, RBI is „looking at cross border transactions, linkage with legacy systems of other countries” and is “looking forward to the private sector and fintechs’ participation in CBDC”.</p>



 🇫🇷 France 



<p>France has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/16/textes/l16b0826_texte-adopte-commission#D_Article_5_bis">passed </a><a href="https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/16/textes/l16b0826_texte-adopte-commission#D_Article_5_bis">a</a><a href="https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/16/textes/l16b0826_texte-adopte-commission#D_Article_5_bis"> bill</a>&nbsp;that targets more stringent licensing laws for crypto firms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>French National Assembly voted in favor of the bill, which brings local legislation closer to proposed European Union standards:</p>



  stricter anti-money laundering rules,&nbsp; 



 customer funds must be segregated, and proof thereof must be kept,&nbsp; 



 updated guidelines on reporting to regulators, 



 customer protection to be enhanced by disclosing detailed risks and conflicts of interest.&nbsp; 
 <p>By March 16, President Emmanuel Macron needs to either approve it or send it back to the legislature. If passed, the new guidelines will be applied to new entities registered from July 2023 and offering crypto services. Existing ones will need to comply with AMF’s (Financial Markets Authority) regulations until MiCA is passed.&nbsp;</p>



 🇦🇪 UAE 



<p>Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) issued its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vara.ae/en/#0">first crypto legislation</a>&nbsp;in February 2023, known as the Full Market Product Regulations (FMP).&nbsp;</p>



<p>They apply to the Emirate of Dubai and all its free zones, apart from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), with immediate effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All VASPs offering virtual asset services in Dubai prior to and after the publication of the Regulations are now required to register with VARA to become fully compliant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two parts of the Full Market Product Regulations: the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vara.ae/media/Virtual%20Assets%20and%20Related%20Activities%20Regulations%202023.pdf">Virtual Assets and Related Activities Regulations 2023</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;and a number of separate rulebooks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>General overview of the VARA Regulations:</p>



<p>– represent the foundation of the FMP Regulations&nbsp;</p>



<p>– present VARA’s regulatory powers, its licensing and registration requirements,</p>



<p>– describe regulated&nbsp;VA activities&nbsp;</p>



<p>– set out AML requirements and market offenses&nbsp;</p>

 Strongest growth reported in financial services, telecommunications, and mobility and travel 



<p>Munich, March 7, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, has increased the revenue generated from its AI-powered, automated portfolio by 52% in 2022, compared to 2021. Built with in-house technology, the automated solutions, which include biometric selfies and video liveness checks, can verify users across a range of industries and use cases in minutes. </p>



<p>FinServ, telecommunications, and mobility and travel lead vertical growth</p>



<p>The revenue growth of the company in its automated solutions was driven by three key verticals: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/finance/">Financial services, traditionally the most highly regulated market</a>, nearly doubled its revenue in 2022 with 97% growth year-over-year (YOY). <a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">The telecommunications sector</a> contributed with 40% growth YOY, while the mobility and travel sector grew by 16%. Similar developments can be observed in the gaming industry, where regulatory changes are expected to further fuel adoption of automated identity verification.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">The travel industry</a>, in particular, has faced tremendous challenges due to the global pandemic in the last few years but is looking to transform itself to offer a fully digital travel experience. Identity verification is becoming an essential part of booking, check-in and onboarding processes. By providing a more seamless and secure travel experience, businesses can now gain a highly competitive advantage in this market, as the customer experience benefits significantly from digital identity verification solutions,” explains Bertrand Bouteloup, CCO at IDnow.</p>



<p>Revenue growth in automated solutions across geos</p>



<p>IDnow more than doubled its sales in automated solutions outside of France and the DACH region (117% growth YOY), where the company has its roots, following the acquisition of the French market leader for identity technology, ARIADNEXT, in 2021. The DACH region also showed significant revenue growth in 2022 with a 40% YOY increase. In France, the company’s revenue from sales of its automated, AI-powered solutions rose by 54%. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A significant percentage of the revenue stemmed from one of the hybrid solutions in IDnow’s portfolio: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> plus QES, an all-in-one solution with qualified electronic signature (QES) paired with remote identity verification, that complies with Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) requirements of most EU regulators.</p>



<p>European certifications for automated and hybrid solutions</p>



<p>Automated identity verification has been a trend in Europe for some time, as an increasing number of regulators continue to approve AI-powered solutions for AML use cases.</p>



<p>France and Romania have been paving the way for certifying identity proofing providers to increase the level of trust that their customers can have in them. More and more countries have also started regulating the level of assurance associated with identity proofing services.</p>



<p>“Last year, our services had already been certified by the Romanian Digital Authority according to their framework. For France, a key market for us, we are engaged in the PVID (prestataire de vérification d’identité à distance) certification from the French National Safety and Security Agency <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/">(Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d’Information, ANSSI</a>) for our automated IDCheck.io solution,” adds Bertrand Bouteloup. “These certifications corroborate that we are able to provide reliable automated identity verification that is equivalent to a face-to-face experience and will serve to reinforce the leadership of IDnow across Europe.”</p>

  <p>The Okta Angular SDK supports a new and improved configuration method to pass in the required properties for incorporating Okta in your Angular applications. Now, you can add Okta to your Angular application using the <code>forRoot</code> pattern!</p>

 The <code>forRoot</code> pattern in Angular 

<p>The <code>forRoot</code> pattern helps ensure services defined in <code>NgModules</code> aren’t duplicated across the application. This is especially noteworthy if you have a module that both provides services and also has component and directive declarations. The intention for the <code>forRoot</code> static method is for importing and configuration to happen at the root module. This is good practice and recommended patterns for an authentication module! It can make configuring the <code>NgModule</code> more straightforward too!</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example case, such as a cupcake e-commerce application with a module containing a service and view for supporting denoting your favorite treats with a heart. 😋🧁💜</p>

<p>Your service code might look like this with the <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator:</p>

   <code>@Injectable()
export class FavoriteCupcakeService {
    addCupcakeToFavorites(cupcake: Cupcake): Observable&lt;Cupcake&gt; {
        // make HTTP call to add a cupcake to favorite for this user
    }

    getFavoriteCupcakes(): Observable&lt;Cupcake[]&gt; {
        // make HTTP call to get all the favorite cupcakes for this user
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Additionally, you have a component that supports the favorite cupcakes feature in the favorite cupcake module:</p>

   <code>@NgModule {
    declarations: [FavoriteCupcakeComponent],
    exports: [FavoriteCupcakeComponent],
    providers: [FavoriteCupcakeService]
}
export class FavoriteCupcakeModule {}
</code>   

<p>In your application module, you might import the <code>FavoriteCupcakeModule</code>, making the declared <code>FavoriteCupcakeComponent</code> and provided <code>FavoriteCupcakeService</code> available throughout your application.</p>

<p>But what if you don’t import the <code>FavoriteCupcakeModule</code> in the <code>AppModule</code> or if you want to use the <code>FavoriteCupcakeComponent</code> in a lazy-loaded feature module in your app? You’ll have to reimport the <code>FavoriteCupcakeModule</code> in that lazy-loaded module. Each lazy-loaded module has an injector instance, so you may have multiple instances of the <code>FavoriteCupcakeService</code> in your application, which we don’t want.</p>

<p>One option is to amend the <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator to add the metadata that determines where in the application the service is provided using the <code>providedIn</code> property:</p>

   <code>@Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root'
})
</code>   

<p>This declaration within the decorator is preferable over providing the service within a module’s <code>providers</code> array because it supports tree-shaking.</p>

<p>Another option is adding the <code>forRoot()</code> static method to the <code>FavoriteCupcakeModule</code> and providing the <code>FavoriteCupcakeService</code>instead of through the <code>providers</code> array. The <code>FavoriteCupcakeService</code> can and should be a singleton instance for the application, and the <code>forRoot()</code> static method sets the module up to do so.</p>

<p>Following in the steps of this best practice, the Okta Angular SDK now has more streamlined configuration options and helps promote good practices of importing the <code>OktaAuthModule</code> at the application root. Authentication applies to the entire application and should not depend on where you imported the <code>OktaAuthModule</code> in the application.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this configuration change.</p>

 Configuring the Okta Angular SDK using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>Previously, to incorporate Okta in your Angular applications, you had to import the <code>OktaAuthModule</code> and pass in your configuration in the <code>providers</code> array as a replacement for the <code>OKTA_CONFIG</code> injection token like this:</p>

   <code>const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
    clientId: '{yourOktaClientId}',
    issuer: '/oauth2/default'
});

@NgModule({
    imports: [ 
        OktaAuthModule 
    ],
    providers: [
        { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: {oktaAuth} }
    ]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>This method will continue to work, and you can continue using the module as you have it now without any changes.</p>

<p>However, you can now change your configuration to pass in your Okta config directly into the <code>forRoot()</code> method of the <code>OktaAuthModule</code>. Not only is this more straightforward, it sets your application up to practice better architecture:</p>

   <code>const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
    clientId: '{yourOktaClientId}',
    issuer: '/oauth2/default'
});

@NgModule({
    imports: [ 
        OktaAuthModule.forRoot({oktaAuth})
    ]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>The <code>OktaAuthModule</code> handles setting the <code>OKTA_CONFIG</code> injection token for you, so you won’t have to make that extra hop when adding Okta to your application! 🎉</p>

 Configuring Okta Angular application going forward 

<p>Since authentication-related services should be application-wide, we recommend using the <code>OktaAuthModule.forRoot()</code> static method when configuring Okta in new Angular applications. You’re still covered with backward-compatibility support if you have more complex needs, such as requiring a factory method to provide the <code>OKTA_CONFIG</code> injection token.</p>

<p>The Okta Angular SDK team plans to improve this in the future. They recognize the current <code>OktaAuthModule</code> can improve, and to truly support <code>forRoot()</code>, they will have to remove auth services from the <code>providers</code> array of the module, which breaks backward compatibility. The Okta Angular SDK team also is preparing to support the latest Angular features, which will become the Angular recommended patterns going forward, such as stand-alone components, module-less architecture, and functional route guards. If you have thoughts or input, or want to share how you use the Okta Angular SDK so the team can make sure they consider it, feel free to drop a note in the comment below.</p>

A later post will describe how to do setup for remote networks.</p><p>We’ll closely follow the ocean.py <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/setup-local.md">setup-local.md</a> README.</p><p>Note 1: Ocean local setup uses Docker, which is fine for Linux/Ubuntu but plays badly with MacOS and Windows. If you are on these, you’ll want <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/setup-remote.md">remote&nbsp;setup</a>.</p><p>Note 2: if you have issues with any steps in this README, please share it in o Ocean’s <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/720631837122363412">#dev-support Discord</a>, and we will work with you to resolve&nbsp;them.</p><p>Note 3: this blog post is up-to-date as of Mar 2023, but if 2+ months have passed, we recommend using the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py#readme">READMEs</a> directly for up-to-date instructions.</p><p>Let’s get&nbsp;going!</p> 1. Download barge and run&nbsp;services <p>Ocean barge runs ganache (local blockchain), Provider (data service), and Aquarius (metadata cache).</p><p>Barge helps you quickly become familiar with Ocean, because the local blockchain has low latency and no transaction fees. Accordingly, many READMEs use it. However, if you plan to only use Ocean with remote services, you don’t need&nbsp;barge.</p><p>In a new&nbsp;console:</p> # Grab repo<br>git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge<br>cd barge<br><br># Clean up old containers (to be sure)<br>docker system prune -a --volumes<br><br># Run barge: start Ganache, Provider, Aquarius; deploy contracts; update ~/.ocean<br>./start_ocean.sh <p>Now that we have barge running, we can mostly ignore its console while it&nbsp;runs.</p> 2. Brownie local network configuration <p>(You don’t need to do anything in this step, it’s just useful to understand.)</p><p>Brownie’s network configuration file is at ~/.brownie/network-config.yaml.</p><p>When running locally, Brownie will use the chain listed under development, having id development. This refers to Ganache, which is running in&nbsp;Barge.</p> 3. Set&nbsp;envvars <p>From here on, go to a console different than Barge. (E.g. the console where you installed Ocean, or a new&nbsp;one.)</p><p>First, ensure that you’re in the working directory, with venv activated:</p> cd my_project<br>source venv/bin/activate <p>Then, set keys in&nbsp;READMEs:</p> # keys for alice and bob in readmes<br>export TEST_PRIVATE_KEY1=0x8467415bb2ba7c91084d932276214b11a3dd9bdb2930fefa194b666dd8020b99<br>export TEST_PRIVATE_KEY2=0x1d751ded5a32226054cd2e71261039b65afb9ee1c746d055dd699b1150a5befc<br><br># key for minting fake OCEAN<br>export FACTORY_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xc594c6e5def4bab63ac29eed19a134c130388f74f019bc74b8f4389df2837a58  4.

<p>It’s been a little while since we’ve given you an update on what’s happening with ARTiFACTS Verify – and that’s because it’s been all hands on deck building on our successful pilot and scaling up our platform. We’ve got a lot to tell you so keep an eye on the blog over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
 Where we are&nbsp; 
<p>We’ve talked about the problem of substandard and falsified (SF) drugs in <a href="https://artifacts.ai/how-the-artifacts-and-notre-dame-collaboration-addresses-substandard-or-falsified-drugs-in-pharmaceutical-supply-chains-a-global-public-health-challenge/">previous posts</a>. The <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products">human cost and the economic cost are both substantial,</a> and solutions must be found to reduce them: which is why we developed Verify. Our powerful platform can be used to track and verify pharmaceutical products, from the manufacturing stage all the way to patients who need their medicine.</p>
<p>From our pilot program, we have developed the following core capabilities of Verify (CAT):&nbsp;</p>
 
 Capture data from multiple locations using low-cost tools such as PAD (Paper Analytical Device) readers 
 Analyze initial results using Artificial Intelligence to identify suspect drugs quickly for in-depth analysis of their Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) 
 Track SF drug data using blockchain technology to create an immutable chain of custody 
 
 <a href="https://artifacts.ai/proof-of-concept-provides-pathway-to-address-problem-of-substandard-and-falsified-drugs/">Building on our successful Pilot&nbsp;</a> 
<p>We have just released an update to the Verify system for current customers, introducing valuable enhancements that broaden the appeal of Verify:</p>
 
 Verify can monitor the time taken for all the steps between sample collection and analysis, allowing users to speed up detection of SF medicines. 
 We have expanded x-fold the number of APIs and testing protocols supported on Verify which massively increases the SF screening capacity for client organizations. 
 A richer feature set allows faster deployment across collaborating teams, and for all work to be completed using Verify, thereby eliminating dependencies on multiple, disconnected systems and third-party tools. 
 
<p>These APIs are confirmed to be supported by Verify:</p>
 
 Albendazole 
 Amoxicillin 
 Ampicillin 
 Azithromycin 
 Benzyl Penicillin 
 Ceftriaxone 
 Chloroquine 
 Ciprofloxacin 
 Doxycycline 
 Epinephrine 
 Ethambutol 
 Hydroxychloroquine 
 Isoniazid 
 Promethazine Hydrochloride 
 Pyrazinamide 
 Rifampicin 
 RIPE 
 Sulfamethoxazole

 Putting Verify into practice 
<p>Verify is now incorporated in the ongoing screening for SF medicines by the DPAL community and the training of university chemistry students engaged in this meaningful research. </p>
<p>“Educating the next generation of analytical chemists requires they understand the importance of capturing data accurately and securing findings, which Verify provides,” said teaching professor Jill Robinson of Indiana University. </p>
<p>“Using Verify in our lab gives students access to a state-of-art information solution that supports SF screening they perform on amoxicillin samples we receive from our partners working in sub-Saharan Africa,” added associate professor Kyle Knust of Millikin University.&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next 
<p>Importing historical results into Verify for deeper analysis:&nbsp; While the DPAL program at the University of Notre Dame continues expanding its use of Verify for evaluating SF medicines, labs across the DPAL community have many data archives with the results for thousands of drug samples they wish to organize and analyze. We are busy structuring efficient methods for importing these data into Verify where they can be mined to identify trends and expose insights useful for ongoing scientific research and for in-country mitigation actions.</p>
<p>Enhanced data management services:&nbsp; Scientific research is largely conducted with the financial support of governments, private charities, industry and various NGOs. In an effort to speed innovation, these organizations ask or explicitly require grant recipients to share data they produce. Collaborating with our user community, we are designing a suite of services useful for meeting the Data Management Plans and compliance requirements of these funders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Addressing chemotherapy medicines with Verify:&nbsp; It should come as no surprise that healthcare practitioners are warning that chemotherapy medicines are under attack by SF products finding their way into the supply chain. These drugs are expensive (higher value) so they are attractive targets for falsification, and in turn, patients face more severe risks from fake or substandard chemotherapy drugs. The Lieberman Lab is on the case, funded by a five year grant from the NIH, to research and report on the extent and nature of the impact on patients and healthcare systems in Africa. </p>
<p>“Chemotherapy treatments are administered by hospitals and clinics that are eager to ensure their patients get good quality medicines,” said professor Lieberman. “We appreciate the support that Verify provides for tracking the physical location and place in the workflow of these samples, which may be temperature sensitive or dangerous to handle.&nbsp; As we begin this project, which initially spans Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya and Malawi, my collaborators and I are working closely with the ARTiFACTS team to deploy Verify in support of this important research,” added Lieberman.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report">identity verification market was valued at $11B in 2022</a>. It’s anticipated that in the years to come an increased awareness of the security and customer service advantages of digital identity technologies will further scale the market to a value of nearly <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/identity-verification-market-178660742.html">$40B by 2032</a>. So, what is driving this rapid growth and investment?</p>
<p>Travel and tourism, crossing borders, financial transactions, and online account onboarding activities are different experiences than they used to be. Globally, there is a greater need for businesses and governments to adopt identity verification technologies as online and mobile transactions become part of our daily lives.</p>
<p>The global pandemic intensified the debate on the digitalization of identity management and led to innovation in identity verification. Identity verification provides more precise outcomes with high levels of assurance (LOA) and trusted risk assessments to create a seamless solution.</p>
<p>Let’s understand the main factors affecting the market:</p>
<p>1. Global growth of digitization</p>
<p>The race to digitize interactions has led to great innovation and economic growth. On the flip side, it has also provided ample opportunity for fraudulent activities on intellectual property rights. Companies are looking to implement various security measures to minimize risks. Look at what my colleague Rajan Barara has to say to better <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/01/decentralized-identity-know-your-customer-kyc/">understand citizen IDs and access management</a>.</p>
<p>With businesses and governments around the world moving toward digitization, identity verification is a critical piece of the pie. When we say digitally verified identification, it is not just your passport but all your ID cards, health cards, credit cards, and much more. This will give more power to citizens to control their identity data and only share specific aspects of their identity when needed. In the near future, using verified readable identity will become the standard.</p>
<p>2. Increased government funding for digital identity</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, government services such as border controls and seamless travel are adopting electronic IDs (eIDs)/digital IDs. Nearly 160 out of 200 countries are already issuing ePassports (i.e., merely a readable chip in your passport that can extract essential pieces of information digitally to prove your identity).</p>
<p>Digital identity will become the new way travelers prove their identity. With thousands of people moving through customs each day, it takes numerous resources to ensure strong border security. As a result, digitally enabled smart borders and airports have emerged rapidly. With <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2020/08/01/how-the-pandemic-is-accelerating-the-death-of-paper-passports/?sh=11df81c7e2f6">1.2B ePassports now in circulation</a> and a strong push behind biometrics (particularly facial recognition​), authorities are offering travelers a taste of cross-border movement that is as secure as it is swift and seamless.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/explore-data">the U.S. Federal Trade Commission</a>, 2.9M fraud reports were filed as of 2022 and identity theft was the No. 1 category for consumer complaints.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we step into the future of identity verification − a truly digital-first approach − here are some <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/datasheets/idv-identity-verification-as-a-service-ds.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=C8CA55C3798BFCDC755AA0C68E27B0E2">best practices</a>:</p>
 
 Secure authentication of Identity documents with high LOA 
 Compliance with international security and privacy standards 
 Advanced biometric technology – such as facial matching – to link the person to their document 
 Built-in monitoring and reporting tools for performance and usage 
 Easy integration 
 
<p>Entrust offers a robust identity verification (IDV) solution that validates the user you are interacting with is a real person linked to the genuine ID document that proves their digital identity. Entrust IDV offers remote, scalable verification services at the highest level of identity assurance for crucial government-to-citizen programs. With the choice of best-of-breed technologies, IDV has the flexibility and secure processes to meet each government’s policy, technical, and budget requirements. Our innovative process utilizes smartphone reading and validation of electronic machine-readable travel documents (eMRTDs) – ePassports or eIDs – combined with ICAO-compliant and ISO-quality biometrics matched to the individual that remotely verify they are a real person and are who they say they are.</p>

Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SSX <p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything), is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in web3 to get started with decentralized identity.</p>  We recently demonstrated how a user can Sign-In with Ethereum, obtain various credentials that are saved and encrypted in an off-chain data vault, and authorize access to that data vault to present those credentials. We are currently working on how developers can access these various workflows through SSX. To check out that demo, go to https://quest.ssx.id, or check out the following post:  <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/plant-a-tree-and-control-your-data-with-ssx-at-ethdenver/">  Plant a Tree and Control Your Data with SSX At ETHDenver  We’re happy to announce that we are demoing an app called SSX Quest that shows how Sign-In with Ethereum can extend user control into interactions with user-controlled data, beyond just identity.  SpruceSpruce    </a>  We've recently heard from developers that they wish to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, but still would like to retain email-based login flows for their users – so we built out a tutorial to show developers how to do that using NextAuth.

<p>Verifiable Credentials for Enhanced Supply Chain Traceability, Security, &amp; Resilience</p><p>Transmute uses verifiable credentials (VCs) + decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to create cost effective supply chain data security at scale. Using VCs + DIDs together harnesses the benefits of centralization while eliminating the downsides.</p> The Drawbacks of Blockchain <p>Blockchains are an incredible innovation, but they’re not a one-size-fits-all solution.</p><p>In their current state, blockchains are a heavy and over-engineered tool for the job at hand when it comes to bridging data silos in global&nbsp;trade.</p> Blockchains have a high cost for creation and maintenance.   Blockchains are expensive in public and private form, often gobbling up the margins of commodities they are being used to&nbsp;secure.   Blockchains are difficult to&nbsp;scale.   Blockchains don’t scale well enough for reliable enterprise use, including large supply chain companies or large regulatory and customs agencies. Blockchains may require layer 2 solutions to meet these&nbsp;needs.   Blockchains lack interoperability.   Blockchains aren’t interoperable with existing infrastructure or each other. To achieve interoperability, blockchains require additional adapters or layer 2 investments. Additionally, the cryptography many of them rely on is still considered very emergent and may not meet certain regulatory requirements. For instance, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-186.pdf">updated NIST requirements</a> only recently allowed for an element used in Bitcoin and Ethereum to be used in blockchain applications.   The Benefits of VCs +&nbsp;DIDs <p>Applied correctly, VCs + DIDs are affordable, interoperable, and already standardized. The interoperability perks of VCs + DIDs give you the ability to work across existing systems, including distributed ledgers (DLTs) and blockchains. Using VCs + DIDs is a futureproof method to fortify supply chain data, using the right tool for the&nbsp;job.</p>  Using VCs + the appropriate DIDs provide the security benefits of decentralization and the efficiency benefits of centralization. Decentralization benefits include immutable claims and tamper evidence, while centralization benefits include scalability.  Implemented by experts like Transmute, VCs + DIDs awaken superpowers — such as data portability, data minimization, and selective disclosure — without locking you into a single vendor or blockchain.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/@karylfowler">Karyl Fowler</a>, Transmute co-Founder and CEO, is an expert in emerging tech and economic development in fields with high regulatory burdens such as FDA, HIPAA and ITAR.

 Represents significant progress towards achieving Ubisecure’s vision for the future of Digital Identity 
<p>As we enter March 2023, Ubisecure is proud to announce the issuance of over 200,000 Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI) via our RapidLEI service. LEIs are standardised, globally recognised organisation identities used in financial regulation, counterparty transactions, and B2B identity management.</p>
<p>RapidLEI has been the world’s largest issuer of new LEIs for some time, issuing around 1 in 4 new LEIs, and now maintains the largest number of issued LEIs (including both new and renewed) within the Global LEI System.</p>
<p>In fortuitous timing, Ubisecure is presenting at the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/gartner-iam-summit-2023/" title="Gartner Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) Summit in London">Gartner Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) Summit in London</a> this week. The session focuses on how global business can reduce fraud and increase efficiency with a standard ability to express verified business relationships. Ubisecure’s approach to combine strongly authenticated individuals with highly assured organisation identities lies at the centre of such a framework. With over 200k organisation identities now under management by Ubisecure, we take a giant step closer to rolling out this proposition on a global basis.</p>
<p>Aside from realising our vision, and with such a milestone reached, we wanted to take the opportunity to reflect on some of the reasons behind why RapidLEI has become one of the fastest growing LEI Issuers since being accredited by the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) in 2018.</p>
 RapidLEI Timeline 
  
<p></p>
 Issuance vs Imported 
<p></p>
<p>A total of 100k LEIs were issued by RapidLEI between August 2021 and February 2023. 85% were newly issued by RapidLEI, and the remaining 15% were existing LEIs originally managed by other LOUs, but imported under RapidLEI management during that period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Ubisecure achieved #1 status 
 Partner-first approach 
<p>RapidLEI’s partners are a critical part of our growth. We operate the most developed <a href="https://rapidlei.com/partners/">partner program</a> in the LEI ecosystem, with the largest Registration Agent (RA) and Validation Agent (VA) networks globally. Our partners provide global, and accessible, market coverage with local support and languages, making it easier than ever before for organisations in any corner of the globe to register and maintain LEIs. We work alongside our partners to launch new and innovative LEI use cases within their own core services.</p>
 Improving partner workflows with the LEI issuance API 
<p>RapidLEI provides API services to allow LEI issuance to be built directly into partner applications and workflows. The API provides Validation Agents with a quick and easy way to search, register, issue and renew LEIs.</p>
<p></p>
 Automated LEI issuance 
<p>The RapidLEI team is the same team who helped drive the mass issuance of SSL/TLS certificates globally. The team believes that LEI should be as ubiquitous as SSL/TLS, with a goal that every legal entity on the planet should have an LEI. To achieve this, we needed to introduce automation into the LEI ecosystem.</p>
<p>RapidLEI launched using automation to deliver better speed and accuracy. The RapidLEI platform is integrated with many Business Registries around the world to speed up issuance and ensure data accuracy, and ultimately to lower the cost of issuance and enhance price points for greater LEI adoption.</p>
<p>We understand the need for same session issuance, eliminating the traditional wait between applying for and obtaining an LEI. With same session issuance organisations can utilise the benefits of LEI in minutes. LEIs are often required to comply with regulations, like MiFID II, and same session issuance allows for the LEI to be issued quickly, without delays holding up the transaction.</p>
<p>We also work with some Business Registries to issue and manage LEIs directly, while also gathering accurate Legal Entity Reference Data (LE-RD) in real time for automated LEI issuance workflows.</p>
 LEI Everywhere for Banks &amp; Fintech 
<p>In 2021 RapidLEI introduced <a href="https://rapidlei.com/gleif-validation-agents/">LEI Everywhere</a>. The LEI Everywhere initiative is designed for KYC Service Providers, Bank, FinTechs and Trust Service Providers to benefit from the GLEIF Validation Agent programme. By leveraging existing KYC/KYB and AML workflows, obtaining or renewing LEIs can be automated to work in parallel with existing systems. This stops costly duplicate processing and creates more efficient workflows.</p>
 Passionate about customer service 
<p>RapidLEI experts are always on hand to support customers and partners, and this is proven by our impressive Trustpilot <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/rapidlei.com">customer satisfaction</a> score. We are continually investing and improving the platform to provide positive user experience.</p>
 At the cutting edge of LEI developments 
<p>RapidLEI drives new use cases that deliver the benefits of LEIs, cross-border and all industries. New use cases are growing fast; the LEI is no longer just about meeting compliance and regulation. Using LEIs to enhance KYC/KYB is now an important driver along with digital signing and e-seal embedding.</p>
<p>A number of global initiates also recognising the need for highly assured organisation ID and the value of contextual delegation:</p>
 
 eIDaS II –the LEI will be the basis of the organisation identity 
 GAIN – incorporating the LEI into the network of networks. 
 vLEI – building the LEI into verifiable credentials 
 
<p>We have been proud to play a part in the GLEIF’s vLEI pilot as the first vLEI issuer to provide verifiable credentials to the GLEIF. &nbsp;Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO, said “We are exceptionally excited by the potential of the vLEI ecosystem and to be acting as Qualified vLEI Issuer showcasing the vLEI in GLEIF’s Annual Report 2021”. RapidLEI will maintain its position as a leader in LEI-based innovation.</p>
 Ubisecure’s Vision for the Future of LEIs 
<p>As we look towards the future and enabling the full potential of Digital Identities, LEIs represent the once-missing component – the standardised Organisation Identity. The many global initiatives referenced, nicely support the realisation of our vision.</p>

  Today we got our first custom domain name handle registered on Bluesky. Domain name handles are a way for us to improve the state of trust and control users have over their social identities online.

<p>Today we got our first custom domain name handle registered on Bluesky. Daniel was previously @dan.bluesky.social. Now his handle is @dholms.xyz, because he owns the domain dholms.xyz.</p>
<p></p>
Daniel's handle is now @dholms.xyz
<p>Here’s why we’ve designed the AT protocol to let you join a social network with a custom domain and prioritized it as a feature in Bluesky:</p>
 
 You can tell which accounts are authentic based on the websites they’re associated with. Custom domain handles are a decentralized way for us to achieve a level of account verification. Curious if “@potus.bsky.social” is actually the president of the US? Once this feature fully lands, you should assume the actual president of the US would have an official domain handle like “@potus.whitehouse.gov”. 
 You can use the same handle to identify you across social media services. I own jaygraber.com, so if I set my handle to @jaygraber.com on Bluesky, I can tell my friends to find me at this stable handle across any AT Protocol social site that supports custom domains. 
 You can keep a custom domain handle when you switch services. If you’re currently using the bsky.social service we’re running, but you decide you don’t like our policies and want to switch to another, you’ll be able to keep the same domain handle. 
 
<p>Custom domain handles are a way for us to improve the state of trust and control users have over their social identities online. It builds off the existing infrastructure of DNS, the naming system for websites.</p>
<p>We’re excited for this feature to ship as the first step in our roadmap for protocol features that will create a more user-controlled social network.</p>

<p>Entrust has been working with mailbox providers since June 2017 to create Brand Indicators for Message Identification (<a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-bimi">BIMI</a>) with <a href="http://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a>, digital certificates that enable organizations to display their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside outgoing emails in many mailboxes today. BIMI standards aim to make the email ecosystem more secure and engaging with DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) and VMCs.</p>
<p>VMCs help an organization’s emails stand out and get noticed in a crowded inbox while protecting them against fraud through DMARC’s anti-spoofing technology.</p>
<p>But there was one problem: Government organizations could not get a VMC unless they had registered their mark with a recognized trademark office.</p>
<p>Now that problem has been solved. Governments can now get a Government Mark Certificate showing their marks or logos authorized under applicable law – even if the marks or logos are not registered with the local trademark office. The good news is, a Government Mark Certificate works just the same as a trademark VMC and will show the government’s mark or logo in the avatar slot alongside their outgoing emails for mailbox providers who support VMCs.</p>
<p>At present, Government Mark Certificates are supported by Gmail, Apple, and other select applications in the following countries and regions:</p>
 
 In Europe
 
 Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. 
 
 
 Rest of the world:
 
 Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Japan, Republic of Korea (South Korea), New Zealand, and the United States. 
 
 
 
<p>Entrust is proud to announce that we issued the world’s first Government Mark Certificate to the Danish government’s national IT agency, <a href="https://statens-it.dk/">Statens IT</a>. What’s the result? Outgoing emails from Statens IT’s “@statens-it.dk“ address now display the agency’s government logo (a stylized Danish crown with the agency name “Statens IT” below) to email recipients.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Using BIMI with a Government Mark Certificate (GMC) to display our official government logo in email communications is a strategic investment towards securing our communications and building trust with our citizens, vendors, and governmental users. We believe by implementing BIMI with GMC we can assure these users that we are adopting the best practices in email security.”</p>

<p>We have just delivered Holochain Beta 0.1.0.<br><br>I find myself feeling more deeply satisfied than I expected, and I’m realizing why. </p><p>I had been thinking that Beta was just about getting to stability, but what we have really just delivered is viability. In some ways Holochain has felt viable to me from the start, because I can see its power and value, which is enough (for me). But I didn’t really understand what it would take to land viability for a project of our scope and scale in the world.</p> A little history <p>But before we go there, indulge me as I take you through some history. <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto/commit/ea8d456afa3d33968e01cd5fc5ba7cb53f112d3a?ref=blog.holochain.org">Arthur’s first commit</a> to the Holochain repo was made on December 23, 2017. It contained a one-line README file describing Holochain as <code>Holographic storage for distributed applications -- a monotonic DHT "backed" by authoritative hashchains</code>, a GNU LICENSE, and a .gitignore file.</p><p>My memory is that I started actively coding a few days later on Dec 31st of that year. If you look at the commit history you then see a flurry of commits in January and February of 2017 which led to a Hackathon in March where we already had a functional prototype of the code.</p><p>So why the heck did it take so long to get to Beta? We built what felt like a working prototype in just 3 months! At that time it seemed like we could have a fully functional beta in under a year. But I was wrong–and kept being wrong. I remember thinking it would be just one more year, and that continued to be my thought for the next four years until at last I just gave up and decided it would happen when it happens. And now in early 2023 it has finally happened.</p> Retrospective <p>I want to know why it took so long. It’s tempting to look for single, or “root” causes. I can think of some clear internal problems of our own making where we took both some technical and organizational mis-steps. I can also point to some specific external events, like the crypto crash of 2019, which required us to do a big restructuring that took quite a while to integrate and recover from. And of course there’s the well known experience of software projects taking way longer than developers imagine they will, in part because it’s just so hard to know how hard something is, and also because there’s scope creep. We have this tendency to make it harder as we go along because we see things that we missed. But identifying a single factor to act as scape-goat would hide the real story here.</p> Non-Linear growth <p>My current reflection about this turns to the complex interactions between interior capacities and the external environment: the constant, yet non-linear, re-configuration that growth entails — and what we so glibly refer to as “timing.” When we look at the growth patterns of living organisms, they are always non-linear. A fertilized egg grows exponentially for a time and then slows down dramatically before alternating phases of fast and slow growth. Seeds planted in hospitable soil can spend quite some time in germination, then suddenly grow rapidly to sprout above ground, but then seemingly stop growing above ground while underground root systems are spreading like crazy, only to then have the above ground portion explode into exponential growth again before slowing.</p><p>What I have learned is that a startup, especially one building such a core-level infrastructure, can be much the same as those seeds. There were points of hidden growth in our project, where it didn’t look like we were getting anywhere in the code, but what was really happening was internal reconfiguration and maturing of the organization itself. And then there were moments where tons of code was being committed, and it really looked like things were on fire, but that might have been from just one team and not integrated with other teams' work. Seeds take time to germinate, and projects like this twist and bend as they reach for light and water. </p>We can't always see the life growing inside. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/6G0HWfLvP4Y?ref=blog.holochain.org">Source</a><p>For example, it’s been possible to use a fully functional Holochain app (hApp) well before Beta 0.1.0. Core community members had created a wonderfully usable <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/acorn/releases/tag/v0.5.0-alpha?ref=blog.holochain.org">early release</a> of <a href="https://acorn.software/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Acorn</a> back in May of 2021! But we still hadn’t matured into a framework that full stack developers could use ‘out of the box’ to build apps. This demonstrates that functionality isn’t always the same as viability. So what is viability anyways?</p> Viability <p>One of the strategies that software teams are urged to use to combat the problem of ever extending delivery timelines is to just build and deliver a “minimum viable product” and then iterate. But what constitutes viability!? You could say that viability is when the tool you are delivering creates enough value that a person (or some number of people related to your business model) will use it despite whatever things they don’t like about it. That’s well and good for a simple product, but what about an infrastructure platform, where you are delivering to developers who themselves have to deliver to end-users? There is a double viability requirement in that. The developers have to experience the value in the platform to use it despite any flaws, and then the end-users have to do the same again. And I’m guessing this is not merely additive, but at least multiplies the challenge or even causes exponential difficulty! </p><p>So, I want to offer three aspects of viability that I think we’ve at least made good headway on: meeting people where they are, providing confidence in the integrity and security of the system, and achieving “minimum viable beauty”.</p> Meeting people where they are <p>As I mentioned, in projects like Holochain we need to make sure that we are meeting both end-users and developers where they are. In both cases, that’s about not asking for too much change, however revolutionary our platform may be!</p><p>A simple way to do this is by supporting whatever hardware platform they are already using. Our run-time for end-users has supported Linux, Mac and Windows for over a year, but adding this same support for developers turned out to have been really difficult to deliver. After years of really only supporting development on Linux, with Beta 0.1.0 developers can now develop Holochain apps on their platform of choice: Linux, Mac (Intel &amp; M1), and Windows (under WSL2). We spent hundreds of hours developing and redeveloping our CI tooling such that when a Holochain-core team dev merges a branch, our test suite runs across all the platforms; and when we deploy a new version, binaries are automatically compiled and added to our package management system so that developers can easily pull them to in their dev environment of choice. </p>We've developed robust scaffolding tools to make building hApps easy. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/SXxMh_95ipI?ref=blog.holochain.org">Source</a><p>A much more difficult place to meet developers where they are has to do with the nature of Holochain itself as a distributed application development platform. The core value that Holochain delivers, distributed applications that don’t rely on any centralized architecture, actually requires developers to think and do things a little differently than they might be used to. This means that there’s a learning curve, and so getting started can take some effort. To address this, for Beta 0.1.0 we have delivered what I can only describe as a stellar scaffolding framework. Our scaffolding tool allows developers to generate the bones of a fully functional hApp in minutes. But, again, in our commitment to meeting developers where they are, the scaffolding tool allows you to pick which UI framework you want to use (currently Svelte, Lit, or Vue). Additionally because the scaffolding tool is modular and extensible, advanced developers can create more scaffolding templates that support more UI frameworks or even different types of projects.</p> Confidence <p>Viability in terms of adoption of any complex system requires delivering confidence in the integrity and security of the system. Supporting Beta 0.1.0 we’ve also delivered on our commitment to providing that confidence via external validation of the security and integrity of our code. Least Authority (one of the most trusted third-party evaluators in the industry) has so far audited both <a href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-holochain-lair-keystore/?ref=blog.holochain.org">lair-keystore</a>, our cryptographic key-manager, as well our <a href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-holochain-deterministic-integrity-crate/?ref=blog.holochain.org">deterministic integrity model</a>. We’re very pleased with their initial findings and we will be delivering much more code that supports integrity, security, and thus confidence &nbsp;in Beta 0.2.0.</p> Minimum viable beauty <p>There’s one more aspect to viability that I feel intrigued about, and this is what I like to call “minimum viable beauty.” There’s something deeply subjective about what makes something feel viable, and it deserves facing head on. I believe that the tools we use on a daily basis aren’t just functional. Our use of them touches into all kinds of aspects of our being, our identity and our sense of aesthetics. From my own experience, at least some part of my willingness to try something new is just that it feels right. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it has to match my preferred style, it’s almost more that I can recognize that enough care was put into the tool that it actually has its own style. It’s as if in this realm, what matters happens at the level of recognizing attention to detail.</p><p>We spent lots of time and effort upgrading <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">the Dev Portal</a>, testing out the layout, the instructions,, and more, in a way that I hope transmits our care. Similarly we’ve done lot’s of “pixel pushing” on both the Launcher and our sample hApps (TalkingStickies and KanDo!), so that they look good as well as being really usable and thus deliver a strong end-user experience. The DevHub for uploading hApps is working pretty darn well. The scaffolding’s command-line UX was tested over and over. Even internally in the Holochain’s HDK we spent months working on improving dev ergonomics, i.e. ensuring that it is easy and clear to make Holochain calls from within your DNAs.</p>We see a beautiful journey ahead. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/GQ5aE4wdkLU?ref=blog.holochain.org">Source</a><p>I’m not really trying to make a strong claim about what minimum viable beauty is. I’m just saying that I like to think through that lens. The lens of how things feel to use, and what thresholds actually matter when developing a project like this. Clearly we will use things that are really clunky if the value of use is great enough. So minimum-viability is relative. But my sense is that we’ve crossed over a threshold.</p><p>With Holochain at Beta 0.1.0 it’s more than a seed or a sprout; Holochain is a sapling chasing after the sun.</p>

			 Building Institutional DeFi: A Guide to Stakeholder Responsibilities 
<p>We previously explored&nbsp;the necessary requirements for compliantly&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenization-is-the-first-step-for-real-world-assets-in-defi/">bringing tokenized real-world assets (RWA) and securities to DeFi</a>. To achieve this,&nbsp;DeFi protocols must be designed to restrict participation rights to prevent illegal funding resources. Moreover, the availability of trusted data oracles is crucial to provide pricing data for private assets, and trading venues must be accessible to ensure minimum liquidity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the emergence of innovative solutions such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onchainid.com/complydefi">ComplyDeFi</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/dino/">DINO</a>&nbsp;distribution network has made it possible for the current tokenization market to fulfill all of these necessary requirements. However, for the development of institutional DeFi to succeed,&nbsp;it is crucial for stakeholders to understand their roles and responsibilities.&nbsp;Below, we have listed some key roles that are usually required:</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 
 Issuers&nbsp;– They are responsible for&nbsp;bringing real-world assets and securities on public blockchains&nbsp;through tokenization, making real-value-backed assets available to the DeFi ecosystem, and allowing their token holders to participate in DeFi services. 
 Deployers&nbsp;– This role involves deploying the smart contracts of the DeFi protocol on the blockchain and setting up the eligibility rules. It can be done easily by implementing the ComplyDeFi SDK, a developer tool for leveraging the identity system&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onchainid.com/">ONCHAINID</a>. To do so, they may&nbsp;set up access credential requirements and verifiers. 
 Verifiers&nbsp;– These are any authorities and entities who can bring trust, such as banks, regulated exchanges, custodians, auditors, notaries, etc. Their role is to&nbsp;verify user information off-chain and issue onchain credentials or proofs of verification&nbsp;to the users’ ONCHAINID. This approach ensures that no confidential information is disclosed on the blockchain, only the credentials to provide a “yes, verified” response to the DeFi protocols. 
 DeFi Users&nbsp;– DeFi applications offer a wide range of financial services such as lending, trading, asset management, and insurance. Typically, DeFi users act as liquidity providers by leveraging their tokens to access services and earn interest through token deposits for liquidity. Additionally, users may choose to deposit their tokens for staking, automated investment, or into a vault managed by an asset manager, among other possibilities. To engage with compliant DeFi applications, users are&nbsp;required to obtain credentials from verifiers&nbsp;appointed by the DeFi protocols. 
 
<p>By understanding these key roles and responsibilities, institutions can find their niche in institutional DeFi, which can open up new business opportunities and facilitate the development of institutional DeFi.</p>

<p>Financial services organizations struggle to make sense of Zero Trust security on the journey to cloud services. To start, they are often stuck between a rock and a hard place: caught between the ever-changing digital demands of customers and compliance with state and federal regulations. And when you add in organizational digital transformation initiatives, like moving to the cloud, accountability to prevent security incidents while conducting traditional identity management responsibilities can easily overwhelm security teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CIOs and other leaders of financial services organizations find themselves with a jumbled mess of initiatives at their doorstep: needing to save money, increase security, and make end users happier. Many are feeling pressured to take on cloud initiatives, looking to reduce infrastructure costs and mitigate operational risk with enterprise-grade uptime and reliability. This reasoning is sound—SaaS solutions are often going to deliver value while allowing for flexibility in terms of offering the most services to employees, partners, and customers while lowering your organization’s overall risk posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staying grounded in Zero Trust principles, however, and specifically leading your organization’s Zero Trust journey with identity, will not only increase your organization's security posture, it will also make digital transformation easier.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>SOCs müssen heute viel stärker automatisiert werden als in der Vergangenheit. Nur so kann auf die stetig wachsende Bedrohung auch in Zeiten einer Ressourcenknappheit bei Cybersicherheitsexperten reagiert werden. Zudem müssen sich technische Lösungen eng mit den Prozessen von der Analyse von Schwachstellen bis hin zum Umgang mit kritischen Sicherheitsereignissen integrieren. Das setzt moderne Technologie, aber auch das richtige Zusammenspiel zwischen Technologien, Prozessen sowie internen und externen Experten voraus.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst bei KuppingerCole Analysts, wird auf die Anforderungen an moderne SOCs (Security Operations Centers) eingehen und dabei insbesondere die Bedeutung von Automatisierung und Integration betrachten. Dabei steht SOAR als Technologie im Fokus. Die organisatorischen und technischen Voraussetzungen und die wichtigsten Anwendungsfälle, aber auch die Überlappung und Schnittstellen von SOAR zu anderen Sicherheitstechnologien für ein modernes SOC werden im Vortrag beleuchtet.</p>
<p>Thomas Maxeiner,&nbsp;Sr. Manager Presales&nbsp; bei Palo Alto Networks, wird Einblicke in den Lösungsansatz XSOAR (eXtended SOAR) von Palo Alto Networks geben. Er wird beschreiben, wie man solche Lösungen effizient als Erweiterung bestehender SOCs oder als Basis von neuen SOCs umsetzt. Er wird darüber hinaus die wichtigsten Fähigkeiten von XSOAR und ihre Relevanz für moderne, hoch automatisierte SOCs betrachten und auf das Zusammenspiel mit weiteren Lösungsbereichen der Cybersecurity wie ASM&nbsp;(Attack Surface Management), XDR (eXtended Detection and Response) und den Palo Alto XSIAM-Ansatz (eXtended Security Intelligence and Automation Management) eingehen.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/das-automatisierte-soc"></a>

<p>A new report on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/data-security-concerns-are-driving-changes-in-us-consumer-behavior-and-demands">Dark Reading</a>&nbsp;says consumers are more aware than ever of data privacy and security risks and it’s changing their behavior.</p>



<p>Report author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/author/todd-moore">Todd Moore</a>, Thales VP of Encryption Products, says US consumers are demanding to make more informed decisions about how organizations are using, storing and processing their personal data, and data protection will heat up as a political topic.</p>



 These two outcomes have been coming for some time. Back in 2020 we&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">reported</a>: 



 
 High profile, significant, and regular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/information-technology/worst-data-breaches-infographic/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;have spooked consumers.&nbsp; 



 Consumers generally get that they have to trade certain&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;for services, but are now warier of sharing their personal data.&nbsp; 



 Consumers want to control their own data and will act to do so if they can. 



 Levels of consumer trust for brands is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">generally low</a>.&nbsp; 



 Consumers will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/14/half-of-americans-have-decided-not-to-use-a-product-or-service-because-of-privacy-concerns/">abandon</a>&nbsp;brands or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">delay&nbsp;purchases</a>&nbsp;where they perceive a risk to their personal data. 



 The regulatory screws are tightening to protect consumers. 
 



<p>Todd Moore says, according to the&nbsp;latest Thales&nbsp;<a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/data-trust-index">Consumer Digital Trust Index</a>, the public is taking data privacy into their own hands “as they realize inaction is not an option.” He cites three signs the public has had enough and wants greater data control and protection:</p>



 
 Consumers are abandoning organizations that suffer data breaches. 



 Consumers are demanding organizations delete their personal information altogether. 



 Consumers are more alert to suspicious activity on their accounts. 
 



<p>“These actions show that data security is a priority for consumers, and it’s good practice for organizations to enable them to share this responsibility, in part,” Moore says. To us it also says that the cohort Cisco calls&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">privacy actives</a>&nbsp;is flourishing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what is a company to do? Building customer trust around data protection and privacy is essential.&nbsp;Back in 2020, half of the respondents in McKinsey’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">annual survey</a>&nbsp;of US consumers said they are&nbsp;more&nbsp;likely to trust companies that ask for&nbsp;minimal personal information&nbsp;and&nbsp;only information related&nbsp;to the product they’re purchasing. They also are more likely to trust brands that don’t collect passive data (e.g. browsing history), and those that promote privacy within their products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 This is a wake-up call for enterprise. 



<p>The 2022 Thales survey&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/data-security-concerns-are-driving-changes-in-us-consumer-behavior-and-demands">reveals</a>&nbsp;consumers want companies that suffer a data breach to be “forced into mandatory data protection controls … [including] encryption and 2FA, which have long been favored options …” and to be subject to more stringent regulation.</p>



<p>Moore predicts consumers will push for stricter data protection laws in the US in future, potentially the proposed American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA). The ADPPA is “a landmark US federal privacy proposal that could potentially meet sweeping demands for security and privacy” and is similar to the&nbsp;European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>



<p>“While we wait to hear about the progression of this legislation, it is increasingly clear that if it does not become law in the near future, something will have to provide that modicum of oversight. To fully realize what kind of change will be effective, it is important to understand consumer perceptions around data security in the US, and for organizations to provide more visible safeguards in their digital services, in the meantime,” Moore says.</p>

 What Is a Password Guessing Attack? 
 
<p>Hackers never rest, and this truth is nowhere more apparent than in the world of password security.</p>
<p>What is a password guessing attack? A password guessing attack is the use of brute-force techniques to attempt to guess a password and break into a user’s account.</p>
 Primary Forms of Password Attacks 
<p>Authentication systems that use passwords are vulnerable precisely because of their ease of use. That is because it’s so easy to implement password systems (especially when considering how much power such systems place in the hands of the user) it also seems equally easy to crack these systems.</p>
<p>And the truth is modern technology has yet to make it easy to maintain strong password security. Always-on SaaS accounts provide unfortunate honey pots for hackers, and users with dozens, if not hundreds, of passwords will often cut corners by using common password phrases and reusing these passwords all over the place.</p>
<p>Because users and technology are often so predictable, there have been an equally predictable and effective set of hacks in place that malicious users have deployed to compromise user accounts since the advent of networked computing.</p>
<p>Some of these <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/8-worst-password-attack-types-how-to-stop-them/">password attacks</a> include:</p>
 
 Brute-Force Guessing: The simplest of simple, brute-force guessing is the use of a list of passwords thrown at an authentication interface with the hopes that, over time, the password will be stumbled upon. 
 Dictionary Attacks: A more refined form of guessing attack, dictionaries use curated lists of common phrases, password permutations, and other potential keys to breaking into accounts. 
 
<p>These dictionaries can be more or less sophisticated. Some may include highly-specific password combinations gleaned from other sources, such as social engineering attacks or database breaches (a form of attack known as credential stuffing).</p>
 
 Password Spraying: While dictionary attacks go in-depth by attacking a single account with a lengthy list, password spraying takes the opposite approach by attempting to attack multiple accounts over time using common phrases. 
 
<p>These breadth-focused attacks can play the numbers game by locating users with poor password hygiene from a large pool.</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/">Phishing</a>: Phishing attacks are a form of social engineering in which attackers send emails, SMS texts, or other forms of communication to fool users into giving up their passwords. Phishing attacks are often the most popular form of attack and can complement guessing approaches by feeding common passwords. 
 
 Password Guessing vs. Password Cracking 
<p>Password guessing and password cracking are two terms often used interchangeably. And, to be fair, there are several similarities between the two. However, they are also different in very general ways.</p>
 
Password Guessing 
<p>A password guessing attack is one where the attacker uses some tool to guess the password. Dictionary attacks, credential stuffing, brute-force attacks and password spraying are all forms of guessing attacks.</p>
 
Password Cracking 
<p>Password cracking, on the other hand, more often refers to offline attempts to break passwords, typically from stolen databases. These attempts can sometimes include brute-force encryption breaking or rainbow table cracking. Other approaches, like dictionary attacks, can be used to crack passwords on local machines or software access.</p>
<p>A few types of attacks will sometimes get lumped into the cracking/guessing conversation. Man-in-the-Middle attacks and malware keyloggers are threats to passwords. Still, they don’t fall under either guessing or cracking because neither involves actually breaking a password (they involve stealing it).</p>
 Best Practices for Preventing Password Guessing 
<p>There are some basic best practices that an organization can put into place to mitigate guessing attacks. In the year 2023, these best practices are generally expected to be in place at almost any enterprise organization. Most consumer products will include one or more of these.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-best-practices/https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-best-practices/">best practices</a> include:</p>
 
 Require Strong Passwords: Long, irregular, and complex passwords are much harder, if not impossible, for guessing attacks to succeed. 
 
<p>The philosophy behind what constitutes a strong password may differ from one expert to the next, but generally speaking, passwords over 8-10 characters, using a variety of characters (upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters), and not matching or resembling any common words or phrases.</p>
 
 Force Changes of Default Passwords: Many software packages and platforms will come with a default password so users can access their accounts for the first time. One of the biggest mistakes many hardware and software users make is not changing the default password–which is easy to do when not prompted. 
 
<p>Hackers who know common passwords for hardware types can easily guess their way into access. That’s why you must force users to change their defaults before they can access system features.</p>
 
 Implement Login Attempt Limits: Guessing attacks will rely on one common capability before any other; the ability to repeatedly submit credentials to the same account until they gain access. 
 
<p>The straightforward solution is to make sure that no user can repeatedly attempt to login to the same performance and fail without any system response. By limiting login attempts, you can effectively stop a password guessing attack.</p>
 
 Implement <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">Multi-Factor Authentication</a>: Single-factor password authentication limits the security available for user accounts. If a password is cracked by some hacker halfway across the world, the system cannot address the issue. 
 
<p>Implementing MFA measures can eliminate cracking issues because the cracker cannot spoof biometrics or gain access to email accounts or mobile devices.</p>
 
 Use Passwordless Authentication: if there isn’t a password to enter, the hacker can’t guess the password. While passwords won’t 100% mitigate all attacks, they will go a long way in eliminating basic authentication attacks like cracking, guessing, and even password theft. 
 
 Use 1Kosmos Passwordless Authentication to Eliminate Password Guessing Attacks 
<p>When it comes to real and long-lasting investments in authentication security, it’s necessary to get solutions that can provide password protection from front to back. That means having real security on the backend to avoid hacks and streamlined protection on the front end to mitigate guessing and phishing attacks.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID provides such security backed by the decentralized private blockchain and robust <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/biometric-authentication/biometric-password">biometrics</a> and MFA, BlockID also makes onboarding simple and authentication a breeze.</p>

 How the Mattereum Asset Passport Solves the Problems Inherent in Digital Product Passports <p>The <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bizzabo.file.upload/ANuCLtboRBOxs6p5cnTo_Dec2AHoeppeSKimMRamsey.pdf">Gartner report</a> on the top trends impacting manufacturing for 2023 predicts that 50 percent of the top ten consumer goods manufacturers will have introduced digital product passports (DPP) for at least one of their product categories by 2027, and the EU is intending to <a href="https://www.wbcsd.org/Pathways/Products-and-Materials/Resources/The-EU-Digital-Product-Passport">require DPP</a>s for a wide range of products by&nbsp;2024.</p><blockquote>It is one thing to aspire to something, another to make it&nbsp;work</blockquote><p>It is one thing to aspire to something, another to make it work, and there is little evidence that the work has been done by the EU or other bodies to truly understand what the implications of creating or operating DPPs are. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Y6eLRZQPwP-clFQLwxxQ75WBogt0aclL9NH36Tw-PmE/edit">Mattereum</a>, however, in developing the <a href="https://mattereum.com/mattereum-asset-passports/">Matterum Asset Passport (MAP)</a>, has done that work and as a result has a form of fully functional DPP that is already available, with all the liability problems implicit in DPPs addressed and&nbsp;solved.</p><p>The Mattereum Asset Passport provides an infrastructure for an open, standard, interoperable, legally binding, multi-party format for the digital product passport data that is already in existence and working. It is also machine-readable, structured, and searchable because it is on the blockchain</p><p>Why is the liability issue important? Well, for a start, a DPP is guaranteeing something, and if it is doing that, at some point someone is going to buy a product that doesn’t live up to the DPP guaranteed standard, then&nbsp;what?</p><blockquote>If there isn’t a warranty mechanism, it’s not going to be worth the pixels it’s made&nbsp;of</blockquote><p>Imagine I bought a product with a DPP that says that it was vegan, but it is not vegan; I complain to the manufacturer or supplier and if there is a warranty they can give me a refund as fulfilment of a contract that they have with me through the warranty. If on the other hand, there is no explicit contract then at that point, they have a much harder time finding a reason legally to give me the money. They’re just sort of making a payment to some random person and then they have to make a decision that it’s being justified essentially as a PR matter. If that doesn’t work I then have to go for full scale litigation to get my money and for many things, it’s just not worth the cost. So, if there isn’t a warranty mechanism to support a DPP, it’s not going to be worth the pixels it’s made of because there’s nothing to provide guaranteed restitution if its claims are not&nbsp;true.</p><p>A cautionary example is what has happened with the verified credentials movement. This is a way of having a third party verify facts about someone online, say, if they are over 18 when they want to look at a website with violent content. Verified credentials allows a website to make a challenge to a user asking “is this person over 18?” and the user’s website then relays a confirmation from something like their bank to verify that they are over 18. This assumes everyone has a digital wallet that stores all their verified credentials. It is a process that has been working its way through the online ecosystem for something like 15 years, but they still haven’t addressed what happens if a verified credential is wrong, either one way or the other, and lets an under 18 into the site or locks someone over 18 out. Who’s carrying the legal responsibility? And what’s the procedure for making a correction to the credentials? The answer is nobody knows. They are still discussing the liability framework associated with bad information and verify credentials. As it turns out, it seems to me that the verified credential business essentially means palming off responsibility onto a third party, and any resolution of errors is currently only possible through lawsuit, and this is one of the reasons the system hasn’t been adopted as widely as anticipated. This is not a satisfactory state of affairs, and if the DPP does not solve the liability issue up front, it will go the same way, seriously undermining the effectiveness of the whole&nbsp;project.</p><blockquote>It solves the liability problem at the&nbsp;outset</blockquote><p>Mattereum Asset Passports come with a built-in legal layer, providing a warranty claim mechanism that addresses liability. This occupies the space where there is a contractual obligation which is stronger than a PR claim, but less massively expensive and costly than doing a full scale litigation. The result is an orderly and cost effective resolution of any conflict that arises from the claims in a DPP. It solves the liability problem at the outset, removing the need for 15-plus years of wrangling and wilful blindness, while enhancing customer trust in the&nbsp;DPP.</p><p>But this isn’t the entire liability problem, finished products are usually made of many different materials and components, all from different sources, each with their own particular liabilities. The result is that any DPP for a product comes with a hidden chain of product liability within&nbsp;it.</p><p>Imagine a DPP that attests that a product is made out of a legitimate recycled plastic, but I find it is 100% low quality new manufacture PVC, and has potentially carcinogenic contaminants in it as well. Even if the DPP has the immediate liability issue sorted so that I can make a claim from the retailer; they then have a claim against the supplier, and in turn, the supplier has a claim against the manufacturer of the item, who has one against the supplier of the plastic, and in turn they have one against the plastic manufacturer. That whole chain is implicit in the DPP provided with the product. Horrible, long drawn out, messy and exactly the sort of thing a DPP is meant to&nbsp;avoid.</p><blockquote>Mattereum’s Asset Passport has explicit mechanisms built in to deal with liability chains</blockquote><p>How does Mattereum’s Asset Passport solve that issue? They have explicit mechanisms built in to deal with liability chains. They carry with them legally enforceable warranties, valid in 170 jurisdictions (i.e. effectively everywhere) for each stage of the process. That means that the final purchaser will find a warranty from the plastic manufacturer that it is 100% recycled, safe material, with a financial penalty set against it in the event that their claim turns out not to be true. This means that the purchaser of the product doesn’t have to claim from the seller, setting off the whole tedious claim chain, they have a warranty right there from the original source that they can make a claim against. No liability chain, just swift and effective restitution.</p><blockquote>How do you update a Digital Product Passport?</blockquote><p>The final area where there is a fog of confusion about DPPs is how do you update one? If I have a product with a DPP, then I repair or refurbish it, what happens to the DPP? Have I voided it unless it’s done by very specific people? That is possible, it’s pretty much what happens with a lot of tech today; you can’t field strip and repair your iPad, it has to go back to Apple or your warranty is void, and in fact, with printers, they are notorious for noticing that you’ve interfered with them and spontaneously bricking.</p><p>That’s not going to be a great way forward for DPPs, particularly if you want them to contribute to sustainability, where products have a long life and support <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/making-the-spiral-economy-a-reality-8a5930cc80cd">the spiral economy</a>. It’s possible of course to have separate DPPs for each part — here’s a DPP for the wheel, here’s a DPP for the handlebars; you could do that, but it’s complicated and runs the risk of turning the whole thing into a massive bureaucratic burden for the manufacturer. With a MAP, when something is repaired or refurbished all that needs to happen is that there is a new warranty added to the passport that replaces the manufacturer’s warranty with the refurbisher’s warranty, or specifically warrants a particular repair. That’s quick and easy to do, and if the repaired part goes wrong, you know you need to make a claim against the warranty from the repairer, not anyone else. The whole thing doesn’t need a new DPP, liability is accurately assigned and anyone can provide a warranty, it doesn’t have to be the original manufacturer. It’s simple, avoids loads of bureaucracy, is fair, flexible and enables sustainable use of the product instead of a direct route to landfill as soon as something goes wrong. Indeed, the Mattereum system gives the people who supply warranties, including the manufacturer, a cut of every second, third, fourth sale so they are incentivised to make things robust and repairable so that they get income from them throughout their lives, not just when they sell a new&nbsp;one.</p><blockquote>the Mattereum Asset Passport provides the only existing viable solution for a workable Digital Product&nbsp;Passport</blockquote><p>We think the Mattereum Asset Passport provides the only existing viable solution for a workable Digital Product Passport, and the only one likely to be fully operational on the timescale that the major brands and the EU are talking about implementing them. They could reinvent the wheel, come up with something where crucial foundations are fudged in order to get the thing in use, or they could use the system that is already&nbsp;working.</p><p>Mattereum is ready to speak to anyone who needs a DPP system to make it work for their brand, we know we can do it, it is already working for Mattereum’s clients, right&nbsp;now.</p><p>If you are working on a Digital Product Passport project that you think could be enhanced by the Mattereum system get in touch with us via <a href="mailto:contact@mattereum.com">contact@mattereum.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/making-digital-product-passports-work-d8c4476ea3a3">MAKING DIGITAL PRODUCT PASSPORTS WORK</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Risk-Based Authentication (RBA), is the applied use of roles and attributes (sometimes thought of as policy control) to improve the security of your account and the system you are accessing. The basic guidelines are what role (or function) you have and which attributes or policies enable your role to login, access and control specific things. You can then add complexity of groups, organisations and factors like location, time or devices being used to determine the level of risk.</p>
 Practical examples of basic RBA 
<p>As a basic example, you receive an email informing you that you have logged into a service from a new device. If you did perform the login, then there is no issue. But if your account has been hacked into, you would be able to contact the service and potentially limit your personal exposure. It is now up to you to react and reduce the risk.</p>
<p>Another common example of RBA is when a user attempts to log into their online bank account from a new device or location. Modern online banking systems typically now recognise this as a higher risk login attempt and may require additional forms of authentication, such as a one-time code sent to the user’s phone or email, or it may prompt the user to answer additional security questions.</p>
<p>There are numerous RBA feedback loops like these common examples, but they all place the burden of security on the end user. If the account has been hacked or breached, the user must react quickly to prevent further impact (data theft, outright monetary loss, etc.). The service provider assumes that you will react – but only knows there’s an issue if you contact them. This is very passive from the service side and places most of the obligation on the end-user of the service.</p>
 Adaptive Risk-Based Authentication 
<p>In an adaptive RBA, there is an ability to layer different existing control systems into a cohesive system, which provides greater granularity and control points for both the users of the system and the service provider. An adaptive approach can be more impactful in terms of security to your end user. However, adaptive RBA can also provide better user experiences – by only requiring additional authentication steps when the factors such as user behaviour, location, etc. are deemed to be outside the norm. &nbsp;RBA, by definition, should be relatively transparent, so long as the risk factors remain low by reducing the number of times the user is prompted to authenticate themselves.</p>
 Additional use cases of Risk-Based Authentication 
<p>If we consider supplementary areas that Risk-Based Authentication might help both the end user and the security of your organisation, then there are a few areas we can expand into.</p>
<p>For example, a business partner creating a sample order on your web store application has been sufficiently identified with their username, password and MFA from their initial logon. But if that same user were making a high value order, or shipping the goods to a newly added address, then additional steps to authenticate the order would be reasonable. Similarly, the ability to enforce EULA (End User License Agreement) terms – like users not having more than 5 devices accessing a streaming service – would help the user to understand the practical limits of their service, while protecting the value of your streaming content.</p>
 RBA and IAM 
<p>An Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform is the central location for all of your users, both internal and external, as well as the applications or resources they access. In managing active access control, the IAM system is therefore the key location to drive Risk-Based Authentication.</p>
<p>Being able to offer a wide variety of attribute and role-based access controls, along with the ability to perform interruptive Multi-Factor Authentication re-requests, is at the heart of Ubisecure’s Identity Platform.</p>

<p>We recently announced our presence at ETHDenver, alongside our ETHDenver bounties, talks, and half-day event: <a href="https://spruceid.com/did-day?ref=blog.spruceid.com">did:day</a>. </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/ethdenver-2023/">  Spruce at ETHDenver 2023  It’s the greatest time of year again–when thousands of developers and Web3 aficionados descend upon the mountains of Colorado for a week of Ethereum fandom, activities, events, and hackathons. ETHDenver is here and Spruce will have events, activities, bounties, talks and more.  SpruceElissa Maercklein    </a><p>Alongside this, we're also happy to announce that we are demoing an app called SSX Quest at ETHDenver that shows how Sign-In with Ethereum doesn't just end at user-controlled identity but also enables interactions with user-controlled data. </p><p>This early alpha demo will show how you can Sign-In with Ethereum, obtain various credentials that are saved and encrypted in an off-chain data vault, and authorize access to that data vault to present those credentials. </p><p>These workflows will define the future of SSX and how developers using SSX can work with decentralized identity and data in the future. The SSX Quest interaction at our ETHDenver booth is a sneak peek for now. </p><p>After obtaining a specific POAP at our booth, you, as a user, can use that POAP to participate in an activity that will plant a tree in real life. </p> Plant a Tree at ETHDenver <p>SSX Quest is open for anyone to experience and run through any of the credential workflows available. However, to use the SSX Quest alpha in order to plant a tree, you'll need to stop by our booth at ETHDenver and obtain our special ETHDenver POAP first, or have an ENS domain. </p><p>After you’ve obtained the POAP or have an ENS name, visit <a href="https://quest.ssx.id/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">https://quest.ssx.id</a>, and follow the steps to sign in to the application with your Ethereum account. Note: in the future, we are architecting a way to combine all of these signings into a single step for users through the use of ReCaps and SSX. For now, as a first-time user, you’re conducting the following actions:</p>  Connecting your wallet and signing in with Ethereum to authorize the creation of your data vault.  Signing to authorize read and write access to your data vault from SSX Quest, and,  Signing to encrypt your data.  <p>In the future, this will be combined into a single signing step for a user.</p><p>After going through the sign-in and data vault creation flow, you'll be able to scroll down to the available credentials shown at the bottom. Here, you will select the “Spruce POAP Ownership” flow or the "ENS Ownership" flow.</p><p>After selecting the POAP flow or ENS flow, there are four steps to complete:</p>  Confirm you own the POAP or ENS name  Sign an attestation that you own that POAP or ENS name  Our open-source witness checks against an indexer to ensure ownership and then finally   A credential is issued  <p>If you’re curious about what powers this prototype workflow, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/45/files?ref=blog.spruceid.com">check it out in Rebase</a>. </p><p>Finally, on the main page, hit “Present Credential” to verify your POAP Verifiable Credential or ENS Verifiable Credential, and add your tree to all the other trees we’ll plant after we get a total tally from the ETHDenver event.</p> Our Libraries and Products That Make it Possible <p>SSX Quest is created with a combination of libraries and initiatives from Spruce to bring user-controlled identity and data to life.</p><p>It starts with our <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Rebase</a> library, which is responsible for the credential workflows you find in the interface. The interface currently supports Twitter, GitHub, Email, DNS, SoundCloud, Reddit, ENS Ownership, and the Spruce POAP ownership credential. </p><p>These flows are built using this library and typically require the user first to sign a statement attesting to ownership of their account or asset, “prove” ownership in a variety of publicly auditable ways (for example, a Gist for a GitHub account), and then be issued a credential which is stored in their data vault. &nbsp;</p><p>Our data vaults are handled with our <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Kepler</a> library. Kepler is self-sovereign storage. With Kepler, you can define exactly where your data are stored, and who has access to your personal data vault, known as an Orbit. An Orbit designates a list of trusted hosts for your data and can be represented as a smart contract that only your keys can control.</p><p>Our next immediate goal for Kepler is to demonstrate how a user can quickly run Kepler anywhere they choose, fully replicate from Spruce’s instance, and demonstrate full data sovereignty by choosing to remove us as a host of their orbit at any time. </p><a href="https://kepler.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">  Kepler | Self-Sovereign Storage  Kepler is Self-Sovereign Storage. Securely store digital credentials, private files, and more - all using your Web3 wallet and with rules that only you control.  Self-Sovereign Storage    </a><p>These off-chain interactions are all possible with ReCaps.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/extending-sign-in-with-ethereum-to-authorizations-recap/">  Extending Sign-In with Ethereum to Authorizations - ReCap  Sign-In with Ethereum describes how Ethereum accounts authenticate with off-chain applications. ReCap introduces a mechanism that allows an off-chain application to combine authentication and authorization of such, while preserving security and optimizing UX.  SpruceOliver Terbu    </a><p>ReCaps are an extension specification to Sign-In with Ethereum that allows users to authorize an application to access third-party resources for that session–all with a single wallet interaction. This allows authorizations to happen alongside authentication to read and write to a user’s data vault, all while having informed consent in the statement section of the Sign-In with Ethereum message.</p> The Future of SSX and SSX Quest <p>When we built SSX, our goal was not only to make Sign-In with Ethereum as easy as possible for developers to install but also to give developers a robust set of tools they could use to start working with decentralized identity. </p><p>SSX will evolve to:</p>  Enable developers to build applications where you no longer need to hold user data, and instead, users can be in control.  Expand the scope of ReCaps, enabling new forms of off-chain authorizations to happen.  Allow developers to use a set of core credentials that users bring with them, regardless of where they build their profile.  <p>At Spruce, we strive to build a world where user-owned credentials are abundant and easy to use in applications across the web. Whether that means we issue them, other organizations across the space issue them, or even you issue them: users should be able to receive them and use them in a friction-free way. </p><p>The version of SSX Quest that we’re demonstrating at ETHDenver is an alpha demo, and we look forward to expanding it in the future alongside those aforementioned interactions.</p><p>We’re happy to help facilitate this regenerative activity while demonstrating how a user can bring their own identity and data to a dapp with Sign-In with Ethereum at the core of it. If you’re curious about using credentials in your application or letting users control their data across the web, join us at our booth at ETHDenver to talk, or send us a message in our <a href="https://discord.gg/spruce?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I’ve shown how to use Google Cloud Identity to create a Super Admin account for free and reroute all the emails going to it to another account. Today I will share two more tips for improving account management in Google Workspace.</p>
 Contractor and temporary Google accounts <p>Imagine you bring someone to help you with hiring. Someone as awesome as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanremy/">,Nate</a>. Nate needed a Google account on your domain to act on behalf of YeshID and login into the tools we use, like <a href="https://www.gem.com/">,gem.com</a> “The modern recruiting CRM.” So I set up a Google Workspace account for Nate. It’s easy and not too expensive. </p>

<p>When Nate was done with his gig, we wanted (and needed, for compliance reasons) to close his account. As we said in <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/simple-and-powerful-identity-and-access-management-the-somehow-still-unsolved-problem">,this post</a>, we wanted to move fast and save money. But then I realized we could not access some of the things Nate set up. Not because he didn’t do a great job of transferring–Nate is great–but because some tools, like Gem–which is also great(!)–don’t support handing over access (yet).</p>

<p>Now I faced a dilemma: keep Nate’s account after ensuring he has no access (compliance) and pay for it monthly or delete it and maybe lose some of the work?</p>

<p>I found another option: convert it into a free Cloud Identity account, route all the emails to one of the employees–me in this case–and use it to sign into Gem just a like a regular Google account!</p>

<p>For a step-by-step explanation of how to do that, see the <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/the-adventures-of-super-er-google-admin-reduce-your-attack-surface-for-free">,More secure and free</a> section in my previous blog.</p>

<p>You now have a free account, sans Gmail but with email routing, that you can use to “Sign in with Google” to all the services until you no longer need it.</p>

<p>Note: this will not work on services that require explicit access to the account’s Gmail.</p>
 Account locked with enforced 2 Step Verification (2SV) <p>So, here’s a common scenario: you have enforced 2SV–sometimes called multi-factor authentication–company-wide. People have to use 2SV, but not right away. There’s a grace period so people can sign up without having their second means of authentication in the way. You create a new account and email a temporary password to an existing email account. The user registers. Most people, I found, skip setting the second factor because it’s annoying friction. They promise themselves they’ll do it later, and they are annoyed when you remind me to fix the squeaky door every six months…! Erm. I mean, setting 2SV.</p>

<p>But, unlike others who wait patiently for six months, the policy here is strict. If you don’t have your 2SV in time, you’ll be locked out. Now the admin has to waste time reenabling the account. Resetting the password won’t help - the password isn’t the problem. Generating backup codes doesn’t help either. Same deal:  the account never enabled 2SV, so Google will not ask for the backup codes during the user’s login. Luckily, there’s a hidden solution that I really think shouldn’t be so hard to find.</p>
<p></p><p>1. Go to admin.google.com</p>
<p>2. Open Directory</p>
<p>3. Open Users</p>
<p>4. Click on the name of the locked account</p>
<p>5. Click on the Security bar on the right</p><p></p><p>Ok, I know this is annoying, but I think it’s better than many alternatives which might temporarily move you out of compliance.</p>

<p>Save time onboarding employees, increase security, and save money. Try YeshID’s simple IAM, contact <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dana-wolf-0713">,Dana</a> or<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexvaystikh"> ,me</a>.</p>

What are your hobbies? If you had a superpower, what would it&nbsp;be? <p>I studied Geological Oceanography for my undergraduate and master’s. I then went on to do my PhD in Geography — with a specialism in climate science. Despite being old, and a little too fond of beer, I occasionally embrace the delusion that I can still play football. Spoiler… I can’t. I have been known to write and publish comics in my spare time, but I’m no longer sure spare time exists. I have two cats, one of which is a giant hairball — much like myself. If I could have a superpower? I’d really like the ability to fill in forms with my&nbsp;mind.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I have so many roles, but for Ontology, I mainly just talk a lot. I like talking, it makes me feel important. I joined as a Harbinger back in November 2022, I think — Christina had to help me fill out the form. Not long ago, I was a Climate Researcher and Lecturer. However, I gave all that up to go full-time in the crazy world of crypto. One day, my wife will talk to me&nbsp;again.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>For me, a blockchain is pretty much a blockchain. I honestly don’t have any strong opinions on them. What actually makes Ontology stand out is the continuous push to build solutions that remove or reduce barriers to entry in this space. Not enough projects do&nbsp;that.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>The unrealized possibilities of what we are building. When you can see how technology can improve things for users, and everyone else is still waiting to catch up with that idea… that’s pretty&nbsp;cool.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>When you’re as old as me, this is a difficult question. I’d have to say getting my doctorate. It taught me how to quickly understand new information. Without it, I’d never have had the patience to deep dive into the world of&nbsp;crypto.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>When I’m famous enough to have someone fill in forms for&nbsp;me.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>What a time to ask this question. The world of crypto is on fire with the fallout of several poorly managed projects. The real world has become more cautious about our exciting technology. But… we’re still in the game and not going anywhere. For Web3 in five years? I would hope we have our first killer dApp. That thing that people have to use because everyone else is using it. For Ontology? At that point, we will be 10 years old, and having seen the development over the last five years, it would be foolish not to be excited. I hope people aren’t talking about Ontology. Ideally, the solutions will just be embedded into dApps that you use and you’ll access them from an Ontology gateway. You won’t talk about it, because it will just&nbsp;work.</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-geoff-richards-594baab380f4">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Geoff Richards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>International Women’s Day 2023 is coming up soon on March 8 and we will be featuring some incredible female leaders working in Web3 and blockchain. Even though there’s huge potential for growth and innovation in the industry, women remain significantly underrepresented in leadership positions in this field. </p><p>But despite the persistent gender gap, progress is being made as more and more women are taking on prominent roles in this industry from pioneering blockchain-based companies to driving policy. Women are making significant strides towards building a more inclusive and diverse Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>To kick off the month where we celebrate the International Women’s Day, we interviewed our Co-founder and COO Elina Cadouri who talked about her experience as a leader in the blockchain industry.</p> How did you first get involved in the blockchain industry? <p>“When I was previously working on Remote.com, which was a platform for remote work focused on the future of work, one of our investors told us that we should look into blockchain, which seemed like the emerging trend at the time. So I started learning about blockchain and very quickly fell down the rabbit hole of learning about the technology and various projects. </p><p>I became really excited about many aspects that were driving the industry including how we can equalize things, create more transparency, and give power back to individuals. I was amazed at the progress being made with blockchain technology and got to a point where I felt like we had no choice but to do something to contribute to its development.” </p> Did you have any female role models in your career? <p>“I didn't really have a specific female role model or mentor, but I did have women leaders I was able to read about or follow which was really influential for me. I read Sheryl Sandberg's book, Lean In, kind of early in my career and even though she does get criticized a bit, it was pretty amazing to read about a woman speaking up about issues that she was facing and hear her stories. </p><p>I also liked reading books by Brené Brown and Melinda Gates, listening to podcasts, and following different female leaders on Twitter. That was really helpful just to see how other women were talking about the challenges that they were facing, learning from that, and also helping to qualify the experiences that I was going through.”</p> What were some of the challenges you faced in your career as a female leader? <p>“Pretty much with every company I've worked with, I've been the only female leader in the company and often the only woman on a call or in an investor meeting. And that's tough because I was also pretty young when I began in startups. And I think early on, I felt like I had to fit in and I had to do things the way men did.</p><p>The male voices can dominate sometimes, especially when there's a lot of men in the room together. I had to learn to speak up and feel confident in myself and appreciate that having a different perspective can be an asset versus something I needed to change or to mold into the group that I was working with. That took some time for me.</p><p>So it was really helpful having female leaders that I could look to and say, “Wow, they did it and they're saying these are real problems and I shouldn't just change what I'm saying or worry about how I look in order to fit in.” I just kept focusing on the work and my contributions. That was a really important shift that I've been able to make throughout my career.”</p> Are there any key takeaways that really stood out to you when you were reading and listening to these female leaders? <p>“I think one thing that really resonated for me is that a lot of times women aren't critiqued in the same way that men are critiqued. Men are often critiqued for their ideas or the work that they do while a lot of times women can get critiqued more about our personality, how we look or how we do something, rather than our actual work. For example, I was called “reserved”. I think being aware of that was really powerful because then I knew, “Okay, this isn't about me, it’s not personal” since those kinds of comments can feel personal quickly. Being able to see that difference and understanding the wider misconceptions made it easier for me to continuously be able to shift back and focus on the work.</p><p>Also, there's that famous study where participants were given the exact same case study where one leader had a female name and one leader had a male name. Students had to evaluate the leaders after hearing about the different things they did. The male leader was called ambitious, outspoken, and strong minded while the female leader was called bossy, headstrong or not compassionate enough.</p><p>These sorts of things provide really helpful context to understand so that when I come up against difficult situations, especially early in my career, it becomes not just about who is giving me that feedback, but the wider issues that are at play with the society we live in and how things have been done up until now. But now, thankfully for me at least, these kinds of comments happen less and less.”</p> How do you think the Web3 and blockchain industry can play a role in promoting gender diversity in the tech industry?  <p>“I'm hopeful that a lot of the ideals that blockchain and crypto were built on that have to do with equalizing opportunities come into practice where companies can create diversity within their organizations and how projects are built. I think a lot of blockchain companies tend to work remotely, which opens up a lot more opportunities for diversity in the space. </p><p>I think there’s an open mindset that I hope companies and people working in this space continue to embrace as they build out their teams and try to hire a lot of different types of people in the industry. If the people behind it look the same and talk the same as the people working in tech over the last few decades, then I think we're going to have a lot of the same type of issues that we've been struggling with so far.”</p> What does Dock do to promote diversity? <p>“We're a fully distributed global team across 11 countries, so almost everybody on our team is in a different country. And I think that's really awesome and I’m proud that we have people from a variety of backgrounds. This brings a deeper level of diversity since our team members live in very different types of societies, political systems, religions, and cultures. Everybody brings a different perspective based on their experiences that's very different from everybody else's. I also think it brings an openness to the team where we try to embrace our differences. </p><p>We like to learn about each other, ask questions about how people live, and what their local traditions are. All of that really helps promote a company culture where people feel welcome and they feel like the things that make them unique are really embraced.”</p> Can you share any advice you have for women who are interested in working in the blockchain industry or currently working in the field? <p>“One thing that's really great about blockchain and crypto in general is that there are many ways for women to get involved, grow their experience, and contribute that aren't just through the workplace. There's local meetups, online communities, events, and other channels where someone can share their skills or learn more about their interests. That's really powerful for somebody who wants to get into the industry to start. Because that way, as you're applying to roles, you can show your genuine interest and have some experience. When I speak to candidates who are interested in working with us, I personally love seeing that they’ve had some sort of involvement in blockchain.</p><p>As for women who are already in this space, there are some pretty great communities of women that tend to be very welcoming and are a great way to kind of meet other women in the industry. Many projects and companies are still fairly small so it's a nice way to network with other people. </p><p>Early on when I was just getting started in the space, somebody invited me into a women in blockchain Slack group which had some pretty impressive women leaders in it, which was awesome to see what other women were saying,ask questions or share resources.” &nbsp;</p> Can you share some of your proudest accomplishments as a female leader in the Web3 industry? <p>“I spend day in and day out of my work days on Dock and I’m proud of where we are and where we’re headed. We’re five years old and we’re flourishing. What really gets me excited is when we started, we had a vision, and we were motivated about this beautiful dream we had, but we had a long road ahead of us to make it a reality. And now we’ve made a lot of progress with the products we’ve built and getting more customers and organizations in diverse industries using our technology. </p><p>I'm also extremely proud of the team we have behind Dock. I think our company is a group of people who are passionate about what we're doing, who understand the mission we're working on, and who really care a lot about making sure that we do this right.</p> What do you think the future holds for women in the blockchain and Web3 industry? <p>On one hand, there have been some recent setbacks for women across industries in general and around the world with COVID. At least in the US, the majority of people who left the workforce due to COVID were women and many are still recovering from that, especially women coming from minority groups. </p><p>My hope is that the blockchain industry is able to help reduce this gap both by providing work and opportunities for women to advance in the workforce, as well as provide tools to enable women to have more independence, access to resources, and to protect their privacy.</p> Are you seeing more involvement of women at blockchain conferences, shaping standards, and other relevant discussions? <p>I think there are a lot of women who do speak up in the industry in general. When I've attended conferences in the past, there's still a majority of men, but I do think women are presenting, women are standing out. I know there's a lot of women-led crypto projects, which is awesome to see.</p><p>There's an Internet Identity Workshop that happens twice a year that is organized by a woman and there's a lot of emphasis on trying to help women who attend to network. Many of the leaders in the credentialing space are also women, so I think there are improvements there.</p> Conclusion <p>Dock’s founder Elina Cadouri is a leading woman in blockchain who has made her mark by leveraging blockchain technology to help empower organizations and individuals by giving them the ability to create and share verified data. We hope to see more women and people of diverse backgrounds around the world contributing and engaging in the blockchain and Web3 industry. </p> About Dock <p>Dock is a Verifiable Credentials company that provides Dock Certs, a user-friendly, no-code platform, and developer solutions that enable organizations to issue, manage and verify fraud-proof credentials efficiently and securely.

<p>When Bluesky started, we set out to build a protocol that would turn the fundamental functions of social media into basic infrastructure like the web itself. Last year we open sourced <a href="https://blueskyweb.org/blog/10-18-2022-the-at-protocol">the AT protocol</a>, a foundation for next generation social apps that can bring back the openness and creativity of the early web. It’s a few months* away from being ready to build on, but in the meantime, we’ve started inviting people from <a href="https://bsky.app/">our waitlist</a> to test out a beta app.</p>
<p>What’s this app all about? We expect the app to serve as a reference client for developers to learn how to build on atproto, as well as a landing place for users to see how a decentralized social app can be pleasant to use, customizable, performant, and safe. While we could’ve built the protocol in isolation, we knew we needed to work with real users to build pragmatic specs. We built an app to drive protocol development through product learnings, and chose a very simple microblogging format to show how Twitter could have been built on atproto (the AT protocol).</p>
<p>Our focus right now is on finishing atproto and surfacing its novel features in the app. Here’s what you can expect to see in the next few months:</p>
 
 Domain names as usernames &amp; account portability 
 Algorithmic choice &amp; custom feeds 
 Composable moderation &amp; reputation systems 
 
<p>We’ll write more about each of these features as they get introduced. The app is currently invite-only while we finish pieces that we believe to be critical — in particular the moderation system. We want to enable people to have a safe, enjoyable experience, so we’re regulating growth and building moderation tooling as a first-order feature and not as an afterthought.</p>
<p>We believe decentralization is a means to end. The end goal is to provide choice to users, freedom to developers, and control to creators. The AT Protocol is a fresh start for social because it creates a composable ecosystem where the convenience and scale of centralized services can be combined with the openness and resilience of decentralized protocols.</p>
 
 
<p>As a user, you can create an account and use our Bluesky app with few recognizable differences from using a centralized social app. However, if you decide you want to host your own server, or have a username that’s your personal website, you can also switch over to doing that. If you don’t like the way we show you posts or moderate your experience, you can switch services without losing your friends or data, or swap out your feed or moderators though a plugin ecosystem.</p>
 
 
<p>As a developer, you can freely build apps on atproto (AT Protocol) because open protocols are locked-open APIs. However, if you just want to introduce another way of showing people posts, or moderating content in the network, we are designing interfaces for you to plug in and do exactly that, accessible through our app. If you’re building a new social app, you’ll be able to tap into the social graph and interest graph of atproto users the way you are currently able to bootstrap off of a user’s phone contacts.</p>
 
 
<p>As a creator, you’ve probably invested a lot of time building an audience on social platforms, but you always want to keep an email list of subscribers because email is an open protocol that a platform can’t take away from you. The promise of building an audience on apps built on atproto is that long term, it should become a protocol like email that lets you keep direct connections with people regardless of how the services mediating that relationship change.</p>
 
 
<p>People have been saying for years that it would be great if users could own their data and their relationships; if we could have transparent algorithms and algorithmic choice; if there could be more accountability and user control over how social platforms are moderated. We’ve been wanting this for years too. We’ve now designed and built a system that we think achieves the goals stated above. We’re excited for the future of social we’re building towards, and hope you join us on this journey of bringing an open, self-governing ecosystem to life.</p>
 
 
 timelines fuzzy, but feel free to watch our <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto">progress on github</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#bluesky-dev:matrix.org">join our dev chat</a>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p>Identity and access management (IAM) systems represent the front door to every digital organization. They can provide a welcoming experience, or they can make it difficult to get in. They can provide security, ensuring that those entering can see what they’re authorized to see and nothing else. If they know you, they can wave you in. If they don’t, they can ask for proof of identity. In the digital world, all of these experiences, and many more, are made possible by identity orchestration. 
 
 Orchestration is a critical function for digital businesses because it makes it possible to create differentiated, personalized experiences for customers, provide the workforce with fast access to the right resources, and protect data and assets by blocking suspicious access attempts. This paper analyses the ForgeRock Identity Platform’s built-in orchestration capabilities, which include a visual designer and drag-and-drop nodes for mapping out journeys based on the context of the access request.

 Online Safety 
 Digital revolution: both a blessing and a curse 
<p>In the past several decades, mankind has shown magnificent progress in computer science. So much so that society quickly became accustomed to using Information and Communication Technologies on a daily basis. Whether it is for recreational purposes, communication, work or education, mundane tasks are made significantly easier with the help of cutting-edge technology and wireless systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is capable of performing convenient assignments, such as reading, generating, integrating, and theorizing information. However, it is also heading dangerously fast towards mimicking a trait which, up until now, has been uniquely human: identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When personal data is leaked, AI can potentially make use of that information to steal or forge human identities. Thankfully, the future will also bring ways to prevent that. A Self-Sovereign Identity solution is being developed to protect our data from being stolen and sold.</p>
 How safe is it really out there? 
<p>Using technology and having a digital presence has become so common nowadays that many people don’t think twice about the security of their personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although they are within the safety of their homes, their data is still potentially visible to millions of users online. Among those millions, there are many individuals with bad intentions, who look for ways to use other people’s private data for their own personal benefit.</p>
<p>More often than not, however, it is entities that individuals are supposed to trust who end up selling or divulging their personal information to other parties. And those parties, whether willingly or not, will put that personal information at risk of being unlawfully used by bad players.</p>
<p>At the moment, unfortunately, people have come to depend on centralized systems in order to benefit from online services to perform their daily tasks. Without those online services, it would be impossible for individuals to function in the present day society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is more of an obligation rather than a choice,and it has become so normal that we simply go with the flow. Otherwise, we will not be able to keep up with the fast-paced changes in the way we work, study, and communicate.</p>
 Our digital identities 
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) belonging to individuals, firms or organizations is being stored online in the form of digital data. This collection of digital data is then used to build our digital identity.</p>
<p>A digital identity is used to facilitate access to services that make it easy for computers to efficiently mediate transactions between two or more individuals. The web provides us with a quick way of performing these transactions. However, it is not the safest place to store our private information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data breaches happen on a daily basis without our knowledge. Through data breaches, important and valuable information can be stolen and sold, including our very own digital identities.</p>
<p>Ideally, individuals should be able to make use of the advanced, modern day technology without the risk of their private data ending up in the wrong hands. In order for that to happen, individuals need to have more control over how their information is stored and who has access to view or share it, at all times.</p>
 The illusion of choice 
<p>Nowadays, control seems less impactful on our lives, because the deception of freedom is given to us through choices. However, when access to necessary modern applications is being restricted unless personal data is consensually shared, choice becomes an illusion.</p>
<p>With the choice to opt in being enforced, people have grown used to accepting the privacy policies of applications without a second thought. These policies, that we barely even bother to read, do mention how data is shared with third parties. However, we cannot do anything but blindly trust that service providers will not abuse or mishandle our data.</p>
<p>At the moment there is only the illusion of consent, of trust, all in the detriment of the individual. Because of this deceitful way of forcing users to consent to their data being used, trust between individuals is becoming more and more difficult to establish.</p>
<p>SSID aims to dispel these illusions and bring authentic consent and trust to the mainstream.</p>
 Seeking safety in a digital world 
<p>Sadly, Big Tech often profits off of individuals at the expense of the latter’s safety, which may lead up to identity theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many users are unaware of the unlawful incidents happening underneath the brightly colored backgrounds of websites and applications as they perform their daily online tasks. Living under the impression that, as long as there is no malware alert on their devices, they have nothing to be concerned about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alarming truth, however, is that security violations occur on a daily basis. These cumulative cyber attacks can potentially cause millions of dollars in damages to the individuals whose data was involved.</p>
 How will Self Sovereign Identity improve our online activities? 
<p>Fortunately, a solution to the above-mentioned risks is currently being developed by SelfKey. It will be the sword and shield for individuals to function and perform transactions in the safest way possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self sovereign identity not only gives back the freedom of choice, but it also prevents this kind of disaster from happening. SSID users give access only to individuals that they wish to engage with. During this interaction, only a very limited amount of information is shared.</p>
<p>Therefore, sensitive, protected and important data is less likely to be sold to or shared with harmful individuals and organizations. Self sovereign identity was conceived to prevent data leakage in this sense. It gives users the power not only to manage and control, but also to protect what they deem valuable.&nbsp;</p>
 Self Sovereign Identity 
 A brief introduction 
<p>Self sovereign identity (SSID) is a new way of managing digital identities, which aims to put individuals in control of how their accounts and private information are managed. With SSID, individuals have full ownership over their personal data. They no longer need to rely on centralized systems that might share their data with unknown parties for personal gain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can store their private information into their devices and present it for validation when it is specifically needed. This way, the risk of having their data compromised is considerably reduced. Individuals are in complete control over how their information is used and stored, at all times.</p>
 How self sovereign identity is currently being implemented 
<p>Once Self Sovereign Identity users store their private data on their devices, they can quickly take the opportunity to interact with trusted partners. In order to benefit from the services offered by these trusted partners, users need to accept the processing of their information by the partners. This is declared by the relying party once the user attempts to onboard into their services.</p>
 Issues with the current implementation of Self Sovereign Identity 
 Adoption and Convenience 
<p>At the moment, SSID users must store their data on their private device instead of the traditional central database. This method allows the users to have full control of their personal data. On the down side, the flow by which users interact with the system is less convenient than centralized alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storing data on one private device makes it difficult for it to be accessed by the user’s other devices. Individuals have to manually introduce their information into devices they want to use, which can become time consuming and frustrating.</p>
 Scalability 
<p>Currently, users can only exercise their self sovereign rights with partners within the SSID environment. More so, individuals need to trust that the parties they choose to interact&nbsp; with will handle their personal data with respect to their privacy and store it securely.</p>
 How can the current Self Sovereign Identity implementation be improved and scaled? 
 
 Should we use Centralized Systems for convenience? 
<p>Centrally controlled systems are databases in which an individual’s digital identity is stored in one or more servers belonging to a centralized entity. Once personal data is stored in this type of server, an individual has no way of knowing who has access to it, who it is shared with, or where it ends up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When personal data is being shared with unknown, third parties, there is a high risk of unintentional information disclosure. This can lead to dire consequences like identity theft or secret information being disclosed to the public, stolen or sold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While centralized systems are not necessarily malicious, their security is weak, which leads to data leakage. With AI progressing alarmingly fast, this is a particularly serious concern. As a conclusion, centralized systems can not be used to improve the adoption and scalability of SSID solutions.</p>
 Are Decentralized Systems a better option? 
<p>On the polar opposite of centralized systems are decentralized systems. This type of system stores and verifies information in multiple computers that work together as nodes in a network, popularly known as a blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By transferring the control from a centralized entity to a dispersed group, decentralized systems aim to reach a level of fairness among its users, without one individual having authority over the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way data is stored in a decentralized system makes it very difficult for malicious parties to manipulate it, because it is secured by the blockchain. A decentralized system is perfect for storing public and openly-accessible data, such as a record of transactions.</p>
<p>However, storing personally identifiable information (PII) in a decentralized system is highly unadvised, even if it is encrypted. PII can be anything from full name, phone number, full date of birth, full address, or credit card information.</p>
<p>Once data is made public, it can not be erased or changed, and it is openly accessible to anyone. Therefore, decentralized systems alone are not ideal for storing private information, due to inevitable and permanent loss of privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are part of the solution, though, and we will discuss in the following sections.</p>
 Is there a solution to this dilemma, then? 
<p>At the moment, SelfKey is actively working on and is committed to delivering an ideal solution to increase the adoption of SSID, using cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next segments we will thoroughly discuss SelfKey’s proposed solution, which pertains to:</p>
 
 The Trust Triangle 
 The Three Pillars of self sovereign identity 
 Zero Knowledge Proofs 
 
 The Trust Triangle 
<p>Presently, we are accustomed to the traditional “peer-to-peer” interactions between identity owners and verifiers. To better facilitate the goals of SSI, a three-party system is proposed. In this triangle, two individuals that want to interact securely can rely on a third party to issue and to confirm the authenticity of their credentials.&nbsp;</p>
 For example: 
 
 We have individual A and individual B, two entities who are about to make an exchange. B has obtained their verifiable credentials (personal data that can be checked for validity) from C, a third, neutral party. C is legally permitted to vouch for B’s authenticity.&nbsp; 
 B wants to make a purchase with A, but the services provided by A are age-restricted. Therefore, A must check with C if B legally qualifies to access that kind of service.&nbsp; 
 In this case, there is only one specific inquiry that must be clarified: whether B is a legal adult. That is the only information that C will validate with A. 
 A does not have access to extra information that would otherwise be physically printed on an ID or a passport. This information can be name, full address, full date of birth, social security number, photos, etc. Basically, any identifier that B does not want to share with A or to divulge to the public. 
 This also eliminates the risk of A, if potentially ill-intended, retaining private information from B. There is no visible data for A to read and memorize. There is only C’s confirmation that B qualifies (or not) to purchase a service from A, without giving out specific details. 
 
<p>This applies to any kind of identifier which is needed to validate interactions between persons or companies. The risk of personal data being visible to individuals outside of the trust triangle is eliminated this way. And even within the trust triangle, only the minimum, relevant information will be shown or confirmed.</p>
 Agents of The Trust Triangle 
<p>The issuer is the entity that releases verifiable credentials after verifying the claims given by the holder.&nbsp;</p>
 
 It is typically an institution, an organization or an individual who possesses the legal authority to verify and to vouch for the holder’s authenticity.&nbsp; 
 Examples of issuers are governmental institutions; universities, departments, companies, agencies, authorities, training institutions, etc.&nbsp; 
 The issuer is a neutral party whose role is only to validate a claim in a holder-verifier transaction. 
 
<p>The holder (data owner) is the individual, a person, a company or an organization who owns unique, personal data.</p>
 
 The holder earns verifiable credentials after providing proof of authenticity to the issuer.&nbsp; 
 The data owner will use those verifiable credentials to prove authenticity before benefiting from various services, making purchases or transactions. 
 
<p>The verifier (relying party) is the entity which verifies a holder’s verifiable credentials.</p>
 
 The relying party will need to verify only a specific piece of information. Only the bare minimum which is relevant to provide a service to the holder. 
 The verifier checks if the holder’s data is issued by a competent and legally authorized issuer. 
 The verifier makes sure that the holder’s data has not been tampered with, forged, expired or revoked.&nbsp; 
 
 Trust in the digital world 
<p>What makes this triangle work is that the three parties are willing to trust one another. The element of trust is important, especially in a time where information forgery and theft happen quite frequently. But within a trust triangle, the user (or holder), has complete control over the management and visibility of their data.</p>
<p>As stated above, digital identities are the counterparts of physical identities that are verified through paper documents. The way trust works digitally is similar to the real, tangible world. However, the consequences of having personal information exposed to the public digitally are much greater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having to trust a centralized database is more or less forced upon individuals. Otherwise they couldn’t benefit from services required to perform daily transactions, either for personal or professional gain. Within a trust triangle, SSID can facilitate these daily transactions without holders having to concede to “blind trust” and risking the safety of their personal data.&nbsp;</p>
 The Three Pillars of Self Sovereign Identity 
<p>Within the trust-triangle framework, there are three main components, or “pillars”, that enable the realization of the ideal solution SSID is aiming to achieve:</p>
 
 Blockchains 
 Decentralized Identifiers 
 Verifiable Credentials 
 
 Blockchains&nbsp; 
<p>A blockchain is a ledger which is shared across thousands of computers around the world. These computers act like nodes within a network, storing and verifying information in a way that makes it nearly impossible to modify or cheat the system.</p>
<p>Within a blockchain, data is saved like a compilation of records, linked to one another. Each user has a copy of this collection, which makes it particularly difficult for hackers to unlawfully modify the information stored within.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance security, data is protected using complex cryptography which, at the moment, cannot be deciphered by malignant parties. The blockchain will provide the security layer necessary for users and relying parties to interact within the SSID framework.&nbsp;</p>
 Decentralized Identifiers&nbsp; 
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, for short, are the digital counterparts of physical documents, IDs, passports or licenses used to verify one’s identity.</p>
<p>What qualifies as an identifier is any kind of information that proves an individual’s identity and individuality. Traditionally, identifiers are issued and stored by centralized systems, such as governmental institutions and organizations.</p>
<p>Decentralized identifiers no longer depend on a central system to manage, issue, and store valuable, private information. They ensure that individuals are able to generate their own identifiers with the help of systems that they trust. Individuals can then use cryptographic proof, such as digital signatures, to authenticate their new identifiers as their own.</p>
<p>Decentralized identifiers are unique. They cannot be forged or stolen, because identity itself is unique and pertaining to only one individual. For example, a digital wallet address can be used as a decentralized identifier.</p>
 Verifiable Credentials&nbsp; 
<p>Verifiable credentials are digital versions of physical, paper documents used by persons, businesses, and organizations to identify themselves. Individuals can also use them to prove that they are qualified to access a service or perform a transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are, but not limited to: digital birth certificates, digital education certificates, digital licenses, digital employee identification cards.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are issued in a tamper-evident manner that is respectful of the individual’s privacy. Bad players cannot make any unauthorized attempt to modify or forge digital documents without leaving evidence behind. This is something that a relying party will verify at each check.</p>
<p>In the physical world, a tamper-proof document would be sealed within multiple layers that are locked in a specific manner. If anyone attempts to open them, they cannot rearrange the layers in the original way. There is visible evidence that someone has unsealed and tampered with the document.</p>
<p>Using such a tamper-proof document, holders can present them to issuers and be verified immediately. This makes onboarding even more convenient than what centralized services offer nowadays.</p>
<p>But how do individuals make use of these credentials? We believe that the answer to that question lies within Zero Knowledge flows detailed below.</p>
 Zero Knowledge 
<p>In the current context, the concept of zero knowledge simply means that a relying party (verifier) does not need any additional information, other than the necessary minimum, to confirm whether a data owner (holder) qualifies for the service they provide or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the zero-knowledge proof method within a trust triangle, participants will benefit from secure interactions. This is because their full personal information does not need to be revealed in the majority of interactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s revisit our previous example but with ZK in mind:</p>
 
 Holder A wishes to access Verifier B’s services, which are age-restricted. 
 B needs to verify with Issuer C whether A qualifies for said services.&nbsp; 
 C will confirm whether A is of age or not, without revealing the full date of birth, or specific age. Confirmation is expressed in the form of a ZK proof. 
 B will not have access to any kind of additional information, like location, actual date of birth, full name, full address, gender, etc. Likewise, B will not be retaining any data, because there will be no information for B to memorize or share outside of the interaction with A. 
 
 Conclusions 
<p>The quick progress of technology is both thrilling and anxiety-inducing. It can be challenging to adapt to these fast-paced changes. However, there will always be ways to combat the threat of being controlled by an ill-intended higher power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self Sovereign Identity is keeping pace with this constant technological uprising, making sure to protect its users. It aims to maintain the ideal that there’s a choice that doesn’t trap individuals in exhausting, exploitative loops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its goal is to continuously certify its users to reach their full professional and personal potential. To restore each individual’s ability to be the sole controller of their PII in their digital lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey is restlessly working towards achieving ways for users to be able to safely engage with partners in an environment that is secure and neutral. At the moment, SSID is an ideal, a work in progress. SelfKey has the potential to become the bridge that will take its users towards a much safer and empowering future.&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The Financial Services Modernization Act, also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), was put into law in 1999 to partially deregulate the U.S. financial industry. The Safeguards Rule, established in 2003, as part of the GLBA, requires financial institutions to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive information security program.</p>
<p>In December 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a revised version of the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/part-314">Safeguards Rule</a>.&nbsp;While some aspects of the Rule became effective in January 2022, new elements for financial institutions to include in their information security program will take effect on June 9, 2023.</p>
<p>The new rule expands the definition of “financial institution” to include activities incidental to financial activities. The FTC lists several examples of “financial institutions” and mortgage lenders are among those included.</p>
<p>Financial institution&nbsp;means any institution the business of which is engaging in an activity that is financial in nature or incidental to such financial activities as described in section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2020-title12/pdf/USCODE-2020-title12-chap17-sec1843.pdf">12 U.S.C § 1843(k)</a>. An institution that is significantly engaged in financial activities, or significantly engaged in activities incidental to such financial activities, is a financial institution.</p>
<p>What’s New</p>
<p>Section 314.4(c) of the updated FTC Safeguards Rule includes the following security requirements:</p>
 
 Access controls 
 Data and systems inventory 
 Encryption 
 Secure development practices 
 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) 
 Secure disposal of customer information 
 Adopt procedures for change management 
 Monitor and log activity of authorized users, detect unauthorized access 
 
<p>Why It Matters for Mortgage Lenders&nbsp;</p>
<p>While protecting customer data is a common goal for all enterprises, this objective can be significantly more challenging when the volume and complexity of customer data are greater. Customer data belonging to a consumer purchasing groceries, for example, will look quite different than that of a borrower applying for a loan.</p>
<p>Consider a typical U.S. mortgage loan application. As part of the loan origination process, a borrower requesting mortgage pre-qualification will provide multiple documents to a lender. Bank statements, proof of identity, and tax returns are just a few examples. The lender’s underwriters will then review the collected information, corresponding credit reports, and other supporting documentation, to either approve or deny a borrower’s loan application.</p>
<p>Once a purchase contract for a property has been negotiated with the seller, the process for closing the loan begins. Loan processors will order necessary documents, such as a credit report, flood determination, survey, property appraisal, and title policy. A residential mortgage loan package will typically contain hundreds of pages, with multiple instances of protected data elements throughout a digital file. On the first page of a standard loan application form, for example, there are multiple fields containing nonpublic personal information (NPI), such as income and social security numbers. Digital mortgages may represent the most&nbsp; significant volume of sensitive customer data traversing a lender’s internal and external networks throughout the lifecycle of a loan.</p>
<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) requires U.S. lending institutions to report public loan data. For <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_data-point-mortgage-market-activity-trends_report_2022-09.pdf">2021</a>, over 4,300 lenders, including banks, credit unions, and mortgage companies, reported 21.5M loan applications. While mortgage companies account for just 22% of the institutions, they were responsible for 65% of those applications.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A conventional mortgage will typically contain hundreds of pages with multiple instances of NPI.</p>
<p>Under the updated Safeguards Rule, mortgage companies will be required to implement controls such as <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-314#p-314.4(c)(5)">multi-factor authentication (MFA) for anyone accessing any system</a>. All customer information held or transmitted both in transit over external networks and at rest will also require encryption. Lenders must monitor and log the activity of authorized users and detect unauthorized access or use of, or tampering with, customer information by such users.</p>
<p>Lenders are continuing the path toward a fully digital mortgage experience with capabilities such as secure digital signatures, remote online notarization, and eRecording. While these enhancements are helping to align the experience closer to customer expectations in other industries, the complexities of a mortgage still require manual processes for hybrid closings. Additionally, lenders typically require third-party service providers to assist at various stages throughout the origination and servicing phases. For example, a mortgage lender may order a flood certification from a third-party vendor to determine whether a borrower’s property is located in a flood zone.&nbsp; 314.4(f)(2) of the Safeguards Rule reads “Requiring your service providers by contract to implement and maintain such safeguards…”</p>
<p>Given the scope of sensitive customer data stored throughout the mortgage application process, bad actors may view a lender’s mortgage portfolio&nbsp;as a prime target. Because non-bank lenders may now be defined as “financial institutions” under the Rule, mortgage companies should continue working with their internal risk and compliance teams to develop a proactive and comprehensive approach to protecting customer data.</p>
<p>What Solutions can Entrust offer mortgage lenders to help with the updated FTC requirements?</p>
<p>Multi-cloud environments, remote workforces, and digital onboarding processes are just a few examples of the new normal for today’s lenders. As mortgage companies progress further along their digital transformation journey, the new FTC controls will play a key role to help mitigate risk. Entrust provides mortgage lenders with a full scope of solutions designed to help protect customer data throughout the mortgage lifecycle.</p>

			<p>1 March 2023, Luxembourg – <a href="http://www.tokeny.com">Tokeny</a>, the leading tokenization platform, has joined forces with <a href="https://www.avax.network/">Avalanche</a> to bring institutions a seamless and secure solution for issuing, managing, and transferring tokenized securities on the Avalanche blockchain.</p>
<p>This integration allows for quick, compliant tokenization of any asset type and real-time asset management – improving efficiency, reducing costs, and meeting investors’ demands for digital and real-time experiences. With built-in compliance, tokenized assets can connect to global trading venues, increasing liquidity and revolutionizing the financial landscape.</p>
<p>Tokenization is the next generation of securities, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/12/04/the-next-generation-blackrock-ceo-reveals-8-trillion-funds-huge-crypto-prediction-after-bitcoin-and-ethereum-price-crash/">as confirmed by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink</a>. In light of this evolution, institutions have been exploring efficient and secure ways to join the movement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, developing a tokenization platform internally can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, drawing focus away from the key business challenges of adapting new operational models and developing new products in the evolving tokenized landscape.</p>
<p>This is where the partnership between Avalanche and Tokeny comes in, which provides a powerful and streamlined tokenization solution. Tokeny’s enterprise-grade, easy-to-use platform, integrated with Avalanche’s fast, cost-efficient, reliable, and eco-friendly blockchain, allows institutions to focus on their core business while leveraging the industry standard ERC3643 for ensuring compliance and control of tokenized assets.</p>
<p>Avalanche launched in September 2020, ushering in a new era for blockchains with near-instant transaction finality. Today, Avalanche supports 1000+ dApps and secures billions of dollars in value, all while having minimal climate impact.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
    We're excited to provide fast, scalable, and secure tokenization solutions for institutions to bring their assets on Avalanche’s blockchain network. In addition, our solutions provide financial institutions with multi-chain capabilities. They can easily move tokenized assets from less efficient blockchains, such as Ethereum, to a cost-efficient network, like Avalanche, while maintaining full ownership transaction records on our platform and ensuring future-proof solutions.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny       Tokeny's launch represents another key advancement of Ava Labs’ mission to digitize and tokenize the world’s assets. The Tokeny integration with Avalanche will provide another avenue for institutions to pursue their asset tokenization strategies while providing a faster, more efficient, and controlled environment for issuers and investors.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: In the lead up to Gardner Identity and Access Management Summit 2023 in London. The Let’s talk about digital identity team have released this special episode to discuss Hybrid IAM. A trending topic in the identity management industry, IAM stakeholders are increasingly interested in understanding what Hybrid IAM really means, how we can solve modern ID challenges, and how to evaluate whether Hybrid IAM is a suitable business choice for their current identity projects.</p>
<p>For today’s episode and to help answer those questions, I am joined by John Jellema, Vice President of Product Management at Ubisecure. Hello, John.</p>
<p>John Jellema: Hi Oscar. Thanks for having me on the podcast.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very welcome. So, John, let’s talk about digital identity and as usual we want to hear a bit more about our guest. So please tell us about yourself and your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>John: Sure, absolutely. I started in a very old Internet company back in the United States in 1997. Moved over to Amsterdam, where I became a product owner on several security services for Verizon, the global telco. The last of which was operating an anti DDOS platform, so to ensure availability of circuits all over the globe through some of the largest DDOS attacks. Ran that platform for about 15 years and then I came over here to Ubisecure about five years ago.</p>
<p>I’m intensely interested in the personal access, the capabilities and the dynamic future of identity management. As we move from employee identity management into true global functioning personal identity management. That’s why I’m here at Ubisecure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So, John, to get started with talking about Hybrid IAM. What do we mean when we talk about Hybrid IAM?</p>
<p>John: It’s a good question. It’s confusing a lot of times. There’s a lot of material out there if you search for the term hybrid IAM, what different folks are referring to or meaning. In practical terms, it’s using two dissimilar services or two dissimilar location areas to have a service deployed at the same time.</p>
<p>So, a lot of organisations – I mean we’re 20 – 25 years into this thing called ‘the internet’ with user accounts, and there are lots of legacy systems. That’s a term that is widely used for employee identity and access management, or your log on service that you do, or your access when you sign into your laptop or an internal machine.</p>
<p>It’s functionally – a legacy IAM is functionally, a server or a private cloud, at this point in time that a corporation or an organisation runs for themselves and hybrid IAM is linking that legacy service with a cloud-based service. So, something that is on a public cloud like Azure from Microsoft or AWS, Amazon Web Services, where you can get compute functionality from one of the larger providers in a dynamically scalable environment.</p>
<p>So, it’s kind of old school and new school coupled together and that gives you hybrid. That’s the functional area of what hybrid IAM is. Of course, the detail is, why would anyone want to have a hybrid IAM? Why add complexity? Those kinds of pieces. And the answer is, you really have different use cases.</p>
<p>So, your legacy service like I suggested was a B2E, so business to enterprise or business to employee. Where your public cloud-based service, that is the new component in hybrid IAM, is really you’re reaching out to consumers or citizens or business partners. So, you’re doing something that’s kind of different to what your existing business was doing, and you don’t want to have the complication of trying to onboard lots of non-employees into your employee IAM system.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. Often, I talk with customers and they have those requirements. They might need hybrid. One might think but why don’t you stick to on prem or why don’t you do only cloud, but often both requirements are needed and hybrid IAM is what is needed.</p>
<p>When could you consider choosing hybrid?</p>
<p>John: For myself as a legacy networking individual, I would consider hybrid at any moment in time where I could make a logical DMARC. So, I’m trying to make a division in between which systems are running. It’s true, like you suggested, Oscar. You could have two implementations of your legacy stack running on your own prem, and you could say one of those is for internal and one of those is for external.</p>
<p>The driver or the key would kind of be, well does your legacy stack IAM actually do all of – does it serve all of the use cases? Does it do all of the functions that your new users are looking for? So, how do I integrate with a business partner or how do I offer services in a consumer way or a citizen manner?&nbsp;If you’re a government organisation.</p>
<p>You don’t necessarily want to expose all of the details or run the risk of co-mingling use access for everyone. So, putting an easy demarcation point, a DMARC point, in between the two services is key, and it will be a use case that kind of drives you to look out towards a public cloud. And it is that merging of the public cloud, that new service somewhere out there in the cloud infrastructure, along with your existing on prem legacy service or private cloud service, that really makes you hybrid.</p>
<p>There’s another aspect that people will, or organisations will oftentimes look at when they’re considering choosing hybrid, and that’s cost control. Your hardware or your legacy stack is expensive to run, operate. It takes your IT team an amount of time to manage and keep it going, to keep it secure, even for your employees. And you say, well, is there a way or a method to actually get all of this service function without having the core obligation. The core liability, the security risk of actually running things on prem.</p>
<p>Starting with B2D or a B2C out in the cloud. So, making an initial hybrid implementation that does a new feature for you, is a good starting point or a stepping off point. Where an organisation that has an existing platform, a legacy platform, can start looking in solving the question of going out to a hybrid and then eventually a full public cloud environment. Without going through the organisational trauma of completely upsetting everything. Or trying to make a dramatic shift of every use case all at once.</p>
<p>So, considering hybrid cloud can be for a couple of different reasons. Cost control, it can be new features, new functionality, and it can be along the general migration path, a growth path that an organisation is doing.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely and if we go to see the benefits. Because also, mostly when we have an organisation that has to make a decision, do we go for hybrid, do we stay as we are? It’s important to know clearly, what are the benefits of choosing hybrid. So, for you, what are the main benefits of choosing hybrid IAM?</p>
<p>John: For me and as the head of product here at Ubisecure, it’s the same kind of decision we make in our own roadmap. We look at the use cases that customers are bringing forward in RFP’s. That’s reflective of the benefits or the benefit decision making process that we see a lot of companies doing, and that is, really a generational change.</p>
<p>They can be looking to utilise their IT staff, in more effective manner than managing this internal identity access management. There can be challenges with a merger acquisition, so if the company is actually considering expanding or being taken over. How do I actually make sure that my existing business partners, if I’m calling them internal at this moment, utilising my legacy stack of B2E for my partners, how can I do more for those external users?</p>
<p>And the more is, security as a primary driver. One of the big benefits of choosing a hybrid IAM is, like I’ve said, this big DMARC between your existing service and the new things that you’re trying to do. Or the better improved, more improved security that you’re trying for. It’s easier to implement multifactor for external users, if you’re on completely a new platform, you can multifactor that user in, and get good control points very easily. And then only with OIDC compliant tokens come back and process the specific pieces of information or specific access to your internal applications, that you might want to be giving to your partners.</p>
<p>So really using the public cloud, and that is the hybrid IAM, as an extra security layer or an extra layer of an onion, if you know that classic security model. That’s from my view, one of the largest benefits of choosing a hybrid IAM, you get more functions, different functions, altered functions that you don’t have to attempt to build into your legacy service. So, there’s no existing corporate disruption, while you’re growing your business, and that can be organically as your business grows or in-organically through merger and acquisition.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. And do you see any drawbacks or downsides, that can be considered in [Hybrid IAM]?</p>
<p>John: Any time you add a complication right, and a hybrid IAM is a step function, you’re adding a complication, you’re talking about adding a second system. That can be considered to be a drawback. But if you consider the direction of IT in general, there are fewer and fewer prem based installations. More and more services that your corporation is using, whether that’s ticketing, whether that’s mail services, whether that’s applications for data processing or anything, more applications that we use are going towards the cloud. And there’s good reasons for going towards the cloud, that is public cloud, for all of these kinds of applications.</p>
<p>It’s much easier to ensure security. So, there can be security patches and feature additions that happen on a cloud environment in a much, much faster timeframe compared to what it takes to for all of us to, for example, install the latest image, latest security patch on our laptop or make a generational shift of our laptop. When all of the applications we’re using are out in the cloud, again the public cloud, then the world is just about access, and you can access those applications from anywhere you’re qualified to access them from.</p>
<p>So, bring your own device and as long as I can securely identify yourself or myself, then I should be able to use that item or that application. Again, be it email or be it our internal ticketing system, as an example. That’s a clear directional move that the entire world, not just identity and access management, but the entire world is moving. Saying, we no longer desire to have machine rooms in an office cabinet, or in a closet, in every office building, for every company individually.</p>
<p>Those are costly, they have a lot of Capex cost and it’s much easier to grow, scale, and use what you need in a public cloud offering. Starting with hybrid IAM, you get the benefit of having your existing platform being not disrupted. But you have the complication saying, now there’s this external or this additional application that your IT staff or your operations team, at least, have to pay attention. That you have internal users, Oscar and John log on to Ubisecure and you have external users, customer A, B or C logs on to our IDaaS platform. And there is extra work while corporation or organisation is going through this transition from legacy to public cloud. This transition is really hybrid IAM.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, we can see there are many, many benefits a few, of course, drawbacks, especially complexity. If someone who is now considering, maybe already, this person made the decision that yeah, we’re going to do hybrid IAM. So, to try to visualise that – how to start the project, what happens at that moment? How to start the project? So, what are the goals or outcomes that will need to be achieved by the organisation?</p>
<p>John: It’s always hard to know, when starting a hybrid project is a good idea. Or replacing your existing service is a good idea. It’s best for every organisation to consider it, before they have a traumatic event like a security breach. Security breaches would be an obvious consideration or a security audit, which is one step back from a breach. Where your auditor says – hey, you’re not doing a very good job keeping your legacy system up to date. Or when you did this merger and acquisition, or integrated a business partner as B2B, or reached out to consumers or citizens as B2C, you’re starting to take on lots of liability, because you’re building a user database that’s incredibly huge. And GDPR says I should have a right to forget.</p>
<p>So, you have a lot of liability coming in there that you have to manage. Instead of waiting for a traumatic event, again, like a security breach or an audit event where suddenly your company is thrown into, again, a light state of trauma. Where they’re saying, I’m not going to pass my security audit next year, if I don’t resolve this kind of thing now.</p>
<p>We should all be kind of looking and saying, is my existing stack of software doing everything that I want? Does it serve all of the use cases that I want? Would it scale dynamically, if the marketing department said let’s go get a million more customer leads? So, could my platform scale, if we change business focus. Does it actually serve where the corporation is going, and does running internal services – is that a key function to my business?</p>
<p>If it’s not really a key function to your business, it’s a historical thing – you started in a B2E, so an employee or an internal enterprise-wide identity and access management platform. If you have one of those, and you’ve always had one of those because you think you need one of those, now is a good moment to actually look and say, do you really need one of those?</p>
<p>Can you look at Microsoft or Amazon services, here in Europe. Which are incredibly secure and incredibly compliant with all of the legislations and start to utilise hybrid to meet one of the use cases that your current platform isn’t able to do very quickly. And this for me, would be the motivation to start a hybrid project.</p>
<p>Is there a use case, is there a group of users that you’re not servicing very well? Is it for diversity, equity and inclusion, right? Your current UI isn’t compliant, or doesn’t look as nice as it should, or isn’t as accessible as it should be? That could be a good moment for considering, how to start a hybrid project.</p>
<p>Can I get a different UI as something that’s available? And again, a merger and acquisition, it’s a good kind of consideration. If you’re merging with a peer company, that same size, you don’t want to get rid of your application, they don’t want to get rid of their B2E application. Well, that sounds like the definition of a hybrid.</p>
<p>You need a centralised point where everybody can agree. So, there will really be obvious use cases. I think for all of our listeners, anybody who’s following this podcast, will understand that there’s a use case, that’s sitting on their desk, that isn’t being met by their current organisation and maybe can’t even be met by their current organisation.</p>
<p>It’s really hard for the current IT, or developer team to actually resolve and that’s going to be the genesis of the start moment of where to consider a hybrid project. Again, you don’t have to do a complete lift and shift, that’s the pure definition of a hybrid project. You can keep your existing platform, that runs, is very stable, services every use case that you currently have. And only use the hybrid public cloud service, for fulfilling those new use cases, or those difficult use cases, the ones that you aren’t currently able to do. That to me would be the starting moment for nearly all of our listeners.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, and yeah, it makes sense. And it’s a concept that actually, in this conversation with you, I’m hearing repeatedly so absolutely agree with that. How to use hybrid in order to implement, to deliver, these use cases, which are underserved by either the private cloud or the on prem. And that could be much easily and even more securely, probably more securely, delivered by using a public cloud based CIAM.</p>
<p>Would you also see some possible complications? Just thinking of, again, starting a project like this. Starting a project, project is having some progress – so what could be some possible complications here?</p>
<p>John: Absolutely. I mean there are complications when you’re putting on a second system. You do need to find a public cloud-based identity access management platform, an IDaaS service, that is secure, that is qualified to meet the use cases that you’ve identified. The reason to start the hybrid project in the first place.</p>
<p>So that in and of itself is work, you have to go out and look for vendors. And an RFP for an element like this can be cost to an organisation where you don’t have manpower, or time to actually cover that cost. So, you know, all of the organisations, all of the listeners should look for an IDaaS service that can make quick, easy trials.</p>
<p>They ought to be able to very quickly demonstrate the security additives that they bring to you. They ought to be able to demonstrate the use cases, fulfil the use cases, and it should be easily consumable for you. It shouldn’t be overly complex to try and consider how to add this layer.</p>
<p>There are still disadvantages – you do have extra cost. We are talking a second system that’s actually running, and any time there’s more, more systems, more anything, there’s going to be more cost. Now, if it is in your organisation’s corporate transition to go from your own servers to a public cloud, and most corporations at this point have the gradual transition to cloud somewhere on the roadmap, a hybrid IAM is a good way to start learning how to move the organisation forward. But there needs to be budget for that, there is cost inside those elements.</p>
<p>You will have the integration complexities, so your prem based service or your existing service has to be able to be integrated with a public cloud. Your existing applications need to be compliant to some degree, or you have to have an engine that will actually take your non-standard applications and make them standard.</p>
<p>Whether that’s SAML or whether that’s OIDC, you have to be able to integrate and that’s oftentimes a challenge. Knowing what your applications are, being able to do a site survey of what your applications are versus your new use cases and being able to carry out that integration is complex. That’s the reason ourselves, as a vendor, and others in the space exist. Because it is complex and there are vendors out that can help you with this, with this kind of review or integration capability.</p>
<p>And one of the final pieces it’s got to be latency. So, it’s not a huge factor if you’re operating inside, for example, all inside Europe here. But you need to consider – is your transaction whatever is going on or takes place with that, new user coming on to the hybrid cloud platform, way out there someplace. And then coming through, authenticating themselves with whatever public service they’ve authenticated themselves, and then coming back into your infrastructure – is your application tolerant of that amount of latency?</p>
<p>So, there can be gaps or difficulties, complications, even if everything looks right on paper. Even if the IDaaS service functions well, there can still be difficulties with the application or the latency in between the two clouds, as it were. The public of the IDaaS and the private of your current service, and whether that’s prem or whether that’s your server is running out on an EC2 instance in AWS for example.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. It’s definitely good that you mentioned all this, possible scenarios like latency, different potential complications. Some might happen, for instance if the company has, let’s say, office in every continent. But if that’s not the case then it’s not a complication. But there are many scenarios, as you say that has to be taken into account.</p>
<p>When you mentioned earlier about mergers and acquisitions, one thing that came to my mind immediately was, okay, of course. I think if there’s a merger or acquisition, I think almost for sure that a hybrid IAM project is born. It’s almost for sure that. What if one of the, let’s say there are two companies only, what if one company uses one type of cloud, like you say Azure, and the other uses Amazon Web services? They are based in, both are Cloud, they both have their identity and access management. What about this type of orchestration? Coexistence between different clouds.</p>
<p>John: I mean functionally, in the very early days of a merger and acquisition, you’ve got to decide who gets an account on both platforms. Right. Your IT staff are suddenly going to have two accounts, and they’re going to have to manage two accounts, one in Azure and one in AWS. That’s for simple access, administrators are always over – your IT staff are always overburdened with too many systems to run.</p>
<p>As a company you’re going to have to decide, and maybe many companies already have, having gone through the COVID pandemic and everybody’s starting to work remotely. But you’re going to have to decide how to authenticate a human being onto a platform that isn’t on your premises. So, the laptop isn’t plugging on to a LAN, whether that’s wireless or whether that’s cable. They aren’t plugging onto a LAN in your office building, so they’re not behind your firewall, you can’t identify them as easily. And in any good zero trust policy, you shouldn’t necessarily trust anything from out there, in the open Internet.</p>
<p>That’s the kind of merger and acquisition problem you’re running into where you say, I’ve got a thousand-person company on AWS, I’ve got a thousand-person company on Azure. How do I actually pull these two together? A hybrid solution can be, you know, very easy to say – well, I don’t want 100% of the applications from company Azure versus company AWS,</p>
<p>I don’t want to give access to everything yet. We’re only in the early days of merger and acquisition, oftentimes in an M&amp;A, there’s staff reduction. So, you don’t necessarily need two HR departments, you don’t necessarily need all of the sales staff. That’s not always true, you could be growing, but you’re going to go through an alteration of your corporate structure. And you can use a third platform.</p>
<p>So that could be either on azure, or on an AWS, or somewhere else. You could use a third identity and access management platform to say – Oscar, let’s all, you and I can all, you know, identify ourselves on this third platform. And that third platform has equal access back into specific applications found within company on AWS and specific, similar, applications found on company inside Azure.</p>
<p>Again, it’s more complex. It’s not a straightforward kind of way, but that’s one of the easiest ways. Again, introducing a hybrid is one of the easiest ways of saying, I’m not going to immediately merge or try and slam the two corporations together. I’m simply going to set up another platform, that handles the who gets access to what, who is identified as what.</p>
<p>It’s actually not as strange as it sounds. Oftentimes when companies merge, you’ll see company John, company Oscar, and now we have the new company called Oscar John, right. You’ll merge the names of the company; your domains will merge and it’s a very easy transition. Saying we’re going to set up another platform. Again, could be a second one on AWS, could be a second one on Azure.</p>
<p>Doesn’t have to be overly complex. One of the IT departments is going to have more work, both of the IT departments are going to have access control work to do. But it shouldn’t be difficult, it shouldn’t be difficult for any company going through an M&amp;A.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, indeed, John, we are going towards the end of this conversation with you about Hybrid IAM and for a closing question. A question that is always targeted to business leader, decision makers. What would you tell us, why should hybrid IAM be on their agendas?</p>
<p>John: It’s a good or a key question. It’s one that we’ve been thinking about here, inside Ubisecure for a couple of years now. Trying to resolve, how to best serve what we think the use cases are. The gradual migration from. I’ve said it a few times in the podcast – but the key point would be, a gradual migration from prem services to more secure cloud services. That ‘cloudisation’ or that migration towards cloud is going to be one of the drivers, and hybrid IAM can be an easy uptake. So, it can be a way you’re – the executive management team as well as the top end of your IT team, can start to get experience with things that aren’t their own, right. How to get onwards, how to move your company forward into a public cloud scenario.</p>
<p>You might already be doing this with using Office 365, and for example, not even realise that what you’re doing is, you’re taking your local Active Directory and you’re using it in a ‘clouded’ environment. Accessing all of the Microsoft applications or the Google applications, if you’re on on G suite. All the Google applications, out there in cloud, you’re not installing them on prem.</p>
<p>A second key driver would be for me security. Where I think identity access management is going, growing, and continuing is around the areas of security. We’ve all seen that passwords aren’t secure. You should have a fairly simple, good, memorable password that’s extremely long. For lots of, so for the big three ecosystems, those are all moving towards passwordless for the end user, which is fantastic. It makes it easy for me to log on to my phone or my laptop. Passwordless or Fido2 whichever ecosystem you happen to be most interested in.</p>
<p>But when you’re talking about business to business, or business to consumer, there’s the extra need of MFA. So, you need to have multi-factor authentication, you need to consider other areas of security, risk-based authentication on top of it. What your what your security stance is, how to see who is accessing what and block unneeded transactions or unwanted transactions very quickly. And moving towards a hybrid cloud again offers a good DMARC, offers a security point. Where you can lay or layover or add on multi-factor authentication for a user who is not in your system, is not identified in your system.</p>
<p>And probably one of the last pieces but it’s really important, especially for all of our European listeners. Is the European Union’s eIDAS project. The idea that myself as a European resident, will be able to have a digital wallet on my phone where I can conduct a majority of business with just about any organisation, public and private, anywhere on the continent. That means I can identify myself in a very strong manner, very easily, and I can chain or remain in control of all of my personal details. And that in and of itself, that kind of legislation is the clear driver that the digital world is moving.</p>
<p>So, you don’t want to necessarily have all of your consumers, or maybe even all of your employees, identifying themselves off their username and password and the MFA that you have on your local legacy implementation installation. You want to start considering how to move to a hybrid cloud or a full public cloud, hybrid being a good step.</p>
<p>So, it’s on your digital path, it’s going to be more secure, and there’s new technologies or legal requirements that are coming to your organisation. So those are going to be the three key drivers for, I think, any of our listeners.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. Thanks a lot, John, for enlightening us about hybrid IAM. Tell us, if someone would like to follow this conversation with you, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>John: I think if anybody is interested in discussing hybrid IAM, they can reach out to anyone here at Ubisecure. We’re all very conversant on it, we – it is an opinionated field, and we’re happy to have the conversation to work through your use cases.

 Nobody is delivering true B2B IAM. How do we change that? 
<p>London, UK. March 1st, 2023 – Ubisecure today announced its participation in the Gartner Identity &amp; Access Management Summit, being held on March 6-7 in London, UK. Ubisecure CEO Simon Wood will present a session on the state of B2B IAM, making the statement that “nobody is delivering, and therefore benefiting from, true B2B IAM”, and asking the question “how do we change that?” </p>
<p>Gartner Identity &amp; Access Management Summit 2023 helps IAM and security leaders make the right decisions about which identity-first security initiatives to prioritize, how to modernize existing staffing models and whether to invest in new tools to take their organization’s security posture into the identity-first era. </p>
<p>Session participants can expect to gain valuable insights on the nuances of successful B2B IAM deployments and learn how combining strongly authenticated individual digital identities with highly assured organisation digital identities present game-changing improvements in efficiency, operational effectiveness, and customer service.</p>
<p>The abstract for Ubisecure’s session includes: “IAM has evolved to secure and protect transactions, from the smallest interaction to the largest global contract. Individuals have a plethora of technology available to identify themselves. However, organisations are underserved and under-identified with no standard ability for individuals to express their verified relationship to various organisations. Learn how to achieve true B2B IAM – only made possible by combining strongly authenticated individuals with highly assured organisation identities to allow them to express who they are, who they represent and the rights they have when doing so.”</p>
<p>Ubisecure session will take place on Tuesday March 7, 2023 at 2:45pm.</p>
 
 Speaker: Simon Wood 
 Time: 2:45pm – 3:15pm 
 Location: Cutty Sark, Level Two, Intercontinental O2 
 Title: Nobody is delivering true B2B IAM. How do we change that?

<p>Twitter is giving SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) the bird for all but its paid subscribers. But there’s a simpler way to secure Twitter accounts without ruffling anyone’s feathers.</p>
<p>In a recent tweet, the company announced that effective March 20, only “Twitter Blue” subscribers will be permitted to use text messages as a 2FA method to secure their accounts. Its rationale: Phone-based<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-charge-users-secure-accounts-via-text-message-2023-02-18/"> 2FA is being abused</a> by what the company calls “bad actors.” In addition to hackers, these malevolent forces can include telcos using “bot accounts to pump [fees charged for] 2FA SMS.” Twitter says the price tag tops $60 million in annual losses.</p>
<p>Two-factor authentication requires an account holder to use a second authentication method in addition to a login to secure against account takeover (ATO). These methods can include a one-time passcode sent via SMS, or the use of a third-party authenticator or a security key.</p>
<p>Twitter says it’s restricting SMS-based 2FA to paid subscribers to cut down on losses. But even then, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2023/an-update-on-two-factor-authentication-using-sms-on-twitter">availability may vary</a> by country and carrier. All users, however, will still be allowed to use an authenticator app or a security key as 2FA methods.</p>
<p>Which is all … a bit confusing. It also begs a larger question: With better, simpler options for securing accounts so readily available, why use 2FA at all?</p>
 Twitter’s Farewell to “Free” 2FA 
<p>Twitter is right: SMS-based two-factor authentication isn’t bulletproof against bad actors. Cybercriminals have several ways of <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3620223/how-to-hack-2fa.html">beating 2FA</a> when harvesting login credentials for use in infiltrating accounts.</p>
<p>But if 2FA is being disabled due to abuse by bad actors, why continue to allow only paid subscribers to use a more insecure authentication method? A paywall won’t help protect their accounts—it makes them better targets. And while there are incremental savings from reduced SMS costs, they will likely be minimal. As Wired points out, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-sms-2fa-twitter-blue/">only 2.6%</a> of Twitter users had 2FA of any kind enabled as recently as last July.</p>
<p>At a time when <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/03/09/99-of-compromised-microsoft-enterprise-accounts-lack-mfa/">as many as 99.9%</a> of all compromised accounts across industries aren’t 2FA-enabled, the question should be how do we protect all accounts against bad actors? For Twitter, it’s an especially pertinent question.</p>
<p>Today, 51% of all <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/report-24-million-u-s-households-have-fallen-victim-to-account-takeover-fraud/">account takeover</a> attacks target social media accounts. And losses from imposters perpetrating fraud via social media platforms, often via hacked accounts, topped as much as <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/02/ftc-crunches-2022-numbers-see-where-scammers-continue-crunch-consumers">$1.2 billion</a> in 2022, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Removing methods for securing accounts can only contribute to an erosion in trust among users and advertisers at a time when Twitter is scrambling to grow its user base and become a profitable enterprise.</p>
<p>To be clear, more 2FA isn’t the answer. So let’s look at what is.</p>
 ATO-Proof Security Made Effortless 
<p>As mentioned, all Twitter users can continue to use an authentication app or security key for 2FA. But just like SMS, these and other traditional forms of multi-factor authentication create user friction and come with plenty of security loopholes.</p>
<p>As a result, users (paid and otherwise) get phished via email, SMS messages, phone calls, and, yes, on the social media platforms they use. But today, a new generation of customer authentication solutions can change all that.</p>
<p>If Twitter implemented our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/customer/">1Kosmos platform</a>, for example, there’d be no need for 2FA at all—SMS, key, app, or otherwise. No telco fees, either. Paid subscribers and free users alike could log in to Twitter and be verified instantly using a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/live-id/">biometric</a> captured when they set up or update a profile—without taking additional steps. Because BlockID is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">FIDO</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">iBeta PAD-2</a> certified, the user’s biometric can’t be stolen or spoofed.</p>
<p>Twitter could use the same technology to expand its highest, Gold-Checkmark subscription to celebrities, influencers, luminaries, and all business users associated with a specific brand by verifying identity at account setup or login. In the case of multi-user brand accounts, a method could be established for the brand’s master account owner to add or delete verified users while making it impossible for anyone to hack an account.</p>
 Tweeting Safely–Without 2FA 
<p>Think about this for a second. In addition to giving high-profile creators, influencers, businesses, and news organizations a reason to sign up for Twitter’s top subscription tier, BlockID can enable a frictionless, ATO-free user experience for everyone.</p>
<p>In turn, this can help Twitter increase subscriber revenues while creating a level of trust with users (paid and otherwise) that can boost advertiser <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/more-than-half-of-twitters-top-advertisers-stopped-spending-on-platform/">confidence and spend</a>. I’m biased, of course. But if you ask me, that’s something worth tweeting about.</p>

 RapidLEI and Ceviant announce partnership with webinar today on, “Legal Entity Identifiers: Key Applications in AML &amp; other areas” 
<p>LONDON, UK – 28 February 2023 – Today, <a href="https://rapidlei.com/">RapidLEI</a> announce a partnership with UK-based FinTech, <a href="https://www.ceviant.co.uk/">Ceviant</a>. The partnership enables Ceviant to build Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) issuance into its treasury platform, using RapidLEI’s automated LEI issuance APIs.</p>
<p>RapidLEI is a service from identity leader, Ubisecure. It is the world’s number one issuer of new LEIs – 20-digit alphanumeric codes which uniquely identify a business on a global scale. RapidLEI offers automated LEI issuance, which is also available as an API to be built into partner offerings, creating a host of new and innovative LEI use cases.</p>
<p>Ceviant is a FinTech company that delivers a broad range of treasury and trade solutions to a large and diversified client base, including corporates &amp; multinationals, SMEs, importers and exporters. With the RapidLEI partnership, it now mandates the use of an LEI in its platform, so that a code is assigned to companies, funds, and other financial entities to allow for accurate and efficient tracking of transactions.</p>
<p>Benjamin Würzburger, Group COO at Ceviant, said, “the LEI is incredibly important to increasing transparency in international business and trade, whilst also streamlining such processes and eliminating data duplication. No wonder adoption of LEIs has been – and is still – growing fast. We’re delighted to partner with RapidLEI to offer these benefits to our customers, all in one place on our platform.”</p>
<p>Nathan Tourret, Strategic Partner Manager at RapidLEI, said, “LEIs are of course a regulatory requirement in many cases, like MiFID II, and Ceviant are offering issuance in the most efficient way for its customers – all within its platform. Ceviant are also visionaries in realising the true potential of the LEI, such as addressing the importance of LEIs in emerging markets, where trusted identity is an enabler to economic growth.”</p>
<p>The pair join together in a webinar today, discussing insights on LEIs and their role in AML and other key financial areas. Attendees consist of treasurers and financial professionals seeking to stay current on advancements in compliance, risk&nbsp;management, and financial transactions.</p>
<p>Join the webinar today at 11am GMT: <a href="https://app.livestorm.co/ceviant/legal-entity-identifiers">https://app.livestorm.co/ceviant/legal-entity-identifiers</a></p>

   As the world's largest economy, the US is undoubtedly a global center of financial activity - and it has an advanced compliance regime to go with it. US financial regulations can be complex and are enforced by a number of government agencies, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

  <p>As we reflect on Black History Month coming to a close, these are a few of my thoughts...</p>

<p>In a recent internal ForgeRock blog, one of our embRACE Employee Resource Group Leads, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/niah-johnson-8bb714124/">Niah Johnson</a>, wrote about her experience as a young Black woman. She focused on the importance of creating a culture and working environment that feels safe and intentionally advocates for its people, especially those who identify as part of an underrepresented group.</p>

<p>When I read Niah's blog I was reminded of times in my life where I have paused to understand the gravity of things that happened to people on my team. I can recall conversations I've had with African American team members who were experiencing significant harm to their community and with loved ones. Just by being curious, making room, and creating safety for individuals to share, I came to understand more deeply the challenges, the fear they sometimes had in navigating company environments. I realized that by seeking to understand our differences actually brought us closer. It was those conversations that led me to do more introspection into my own life experiences, to be more proximate to how they felt every day and take my good intentions and use them to hold myself accountable to act.</p>

<p>Black History Month is an important time to reflect on the rich history and contributions of Black Americans to our society. It is a time to celebrate the achievements and successes of Black leaders and activists who fought for justice and equality, as well as to acknowledge the racism and struggles that they faced and continue to face. This time provides an opportunity to learn from the past, work towards a better tomorrow and ensure our future is one where everyone is treated with dignity and respect regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.</p>

<p>Since our inception, ForgeRock has always championed respect for individuality. When people feel like they can speak up and share their opinions without fear of repercussions, they are more likely to engage in open and honest communication. Trust and psychological safety are foundational to empowering our people to turn up as their authentic selves.</p>

<p>To ensure we continue to foster a diverse workplace we have turned to experts like @<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rtulshyan/">Ruchika Tulshyan</a>, @<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-brackett-10a563/">Marc Bracket</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-brackett-10a563/">t</a>, and initiatives like recruiting techniques to remove bias from the hiring process, and training on how to identify and dispel one's biases. One of our cultural pillars is Global Teams Built on Trust. This means we prioritize trust and safety as the currency of high-performing teams and companies.</p>

<p>We will continue to champion equality, we will strive to always listen and be better today than we were yesterday, and we always seek to embrace our differences, because it's our differences that bring us together.</p>

<p>Most importantly, we will continue to advocate for and protect the rights of those who can be made to feel unseen. We proudly stand with our Black friends, family, and fellow ForgeRockers. Not because we know the challenges they face, but because it's the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Because at ForgeRock we call our culture Our Identity, but at ForgeRock it's your identity that matters.</p>

<p>It’s the greatest time of year again–when thousands of developers and Web3 aficionados descend upon the mountains of Colorado for a week of Ethereum fandom, activities, events, and hackathons. </p><p>Yes, it’s ETHDenver time. </p><p>Many are predicting 2023 as the year of decentralized identity (see Vitalik’s blog, <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/12/05/excited.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">“What in the Ethereum application ecosystem excites me,”</a> where he names Sign-In with Ethereum as a leading topic of interest). We might be biased–but we agree. Momentum is building in the decentralized identity space, with more progress on fundamental infrastructure layers, adoption of global standards, and developers interested in implementing solutions within real-world applications. </p><p>So, we’re bringing that energy to ETHDenver.</p> 👾did:day👾 <p>As we previously announced, we are hosting a half-day summit, did:day, on March 1 as a part of the official ETHDenver BUIDLWeek. At did:day, we’ll be joined by speakers representing other leaders in the space–including <a href="https://disco.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Disco</a>, <a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ceramic</a>, <a href="https://ens.domains/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ENS</a>, <a href="https://passport.gitcoin.co/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Gitcoin Passport</a>, <a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-id/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">PolygonID</a>, <a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Unlock</a>, <a href="https://litprotocol.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Lit Protocol</a>, <a href="https://cyberconnect.me/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">CyberConnect</a>, and <a href="https://www.lens.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Lens</a>–to bring together visionaries who are building the foundations to turn decentralized identity into a reality.</p>Agenda for did:day on March 1, 2023 at ETHDenver.<p>You can learn more about did:day in our blog post <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-did-day-an-exploration-of-decentralized-identity-at-ethdenver-buidlweek/">announcing the event here</a> or on <a href="http://spruceid.com/did-day?ref=blog.spruceid.com">the did:day webpage</a> on the Spruce website. The event is currently sold out, so if you missed your chance to register for a free ticket, stay tuned for our recaps.</p> 🌲Plant a Tree at our booth🌲 <p>At our booth during the main conference, we’re doing something a little bit different. Rather than giving away swag, we’re introducing an interactive experience where booth visitors can test out our newest product (hint: bring your own identity and data with Sign-In with Ethereum, fun with POAPs, and more) and then plant a tree. Yes, a real tree–without disclosing too much, we are planting one tree for each person that “completes an interaction” with our newest product. </p><p>Sticking with the tree theme (Spruce, trees, get it…) we’ll also have a fun tree-themed giveaway and some other bonus goodies for folks who come say hello at our booth. </p><p>If you’re at ETHDenver and want to chat about decentralized identity, Sign-In with Ethereum, or just want to see what all this tree stuff is about, stop by our booth in Devtopia at the main conference to chat with us.</p> 👩‍💻Bounties for Buidlers🧑‍💻 <p>Our main bounties focus on improvements and enhancements for SSX, or “Self-Sovereign Anything,” our open-source product that acts as a gateway for developers to incorporate decentralized identity into their applications. Learn more about SSX in our <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-ssx/">announcement blog here.</a></p><p>1. The Best Use of SSX + ENS: Developers are tasked with incorporating Sign-In with Ethereum workflows into their project using SSX’s feature to resolve ENS names and avatars for users. For this bounty, we are looking for existing projects to incorporate SSX into their application workflows and we’ll judge based on the open-source submitted for the hackathon.</p><p>Prize: For this in-person bounty, there will be four (4) winning projects that will each win $1,000. </p><p>2. Extending SSX’s Availability: For this bounty, we are looking for open-source contributions to SSX that extend SSX to additional frameworks and languages that are not currently supported. For example, this could be Python support for SSX, a new frontend or backend that SSX doesn’t yet support, and so on. Our goal with this bounty is to make developer experiences even easier, as they explore ways to incorporate decentralized identity solutions into their existing applications and frameworks. </p><p>Prize: For this in-person bounty, there will be two (2) winning projects that will each win $2,000. </p><p>3. The Best Upgrade to SSX: As the name suggests, we are looking for an open-source contribution that offers the best upgrade to SSX. This might be an enhancement to SSX or a new feature flag alongside the existing ones. SSX currently supports features like DAO logins with multi-sig wallets or ENS and Lens profile resolutions, but developers can contribute new feature flags for SSX, like SSX chat functionality for users when developers bring it into their project.</p><p>Prize: For this in-person bounty, there will be two (2) winning projects that will win $1,000.</p><p>And last, but not least:</p><p>4. The Easiest (Micro and Unofficial) Bounty of Them All: We’re looking for developers to give us feedback on our open-source products and libraries. No previous familiarity with Spruce, SSX, or Sign-In with Ethereum is required to participate in this. Stop by our booth in Devtopia at the main conference for a brief feedback session and we’ll give you a $20 gift card to a nearby local Denver coffee shop for a caffeine dose and a snack on us.

<p>In recent years, healthcare has seen a shift towards digitalisation. In order to meet these needs, hybrid cloud data storage has emerged as a popular solution, by offering the control and security of on-premises storage with the flexibility and scalability of cloud storage. This blog will explore the shift towards digitalisation in healthcare and why hybrid cloud storage is an effective and compliant option within e-healthcare.</p>
 Drive to digitalisation in EU healthcare 
<p>Healthcare systems are becoming increasingly dependent on information and communication technologies to deliver quality care to EU residents. As a result, digital health was set up as one of the priorities of the EU’s <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/eeurope/i2010/index_en.htm">i2010</a> programme over a decade ago. Even now, healthcare has remained as one of the six high-level priorities of the European Commission for 2019-2024. All of the six priorities link strongly to the ongoing digitalisation, to the point that the strategy is simply titled <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age_en">A Europe fit for the digital age</a>.</p>
<p>Across verticals, the aims are to make sure that digital transformation works for the people and the economy, while also closely linking it to the “green transition” towards the dream of a climate-neutral Europe by 2050.</p>
 Why data residency matters 
<p>Healthcare data is obviously something one wishes to keep private and closely controlled, and that includes where it is stored and processed, and by whom. Strictly speaking, data residency only describes where your data is stored at rest – not where it might be copied to for processing. A related term is data sovereignty, which refers to the legal ownership of data.</p>
<p>Data residency is a critical issue for any organisation with customers, partners or even employees in more than one country. Often several external stakeholders are involved as well, such as governments and other businesses. Each of these stakeholders has different interests and needs, that can sometimes even conflict with each other. This makes data residency requirements a moving target, and often there is no one-size-fits-all solution.</p>
<p>An example of this conflict is how the European Union has passed laws requiring organisations to store certain special categories of personal data, including healthcare-related data, within the European Economic Area (EEA)or another pre-approved country to protect the privacy of all EU residents. However, other countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws requiring companies to store data within their borders. Obviously, fulfilling both requirements simultaneously is like tight-rope walking at best, prone to costly errors and practically impossible for any larger number of users.</p>
 Data Protection around the World<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnil.fr%2Fen%2Fdata-protection-around-the-world&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cchloe.hartup%40ubisecure.com%7C713bf6bec582490bbe8a08db1022fc46%7Cfeaa11396ffc44229c7b980ad003c1a7%7C0%7C0%7C638121514677248042%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=9uWlzaMMMAqoR9%2FCFLGGwBahEpjrjjHrxEA4ExbqZB8%3D&amp;reserved=0"></a> 
<p>Countries with an adequate level of personal data protection laws – Data protection around the world | CNILIn the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forbids storing or processing any Personally Identifiable Information outside the EEA, unless the destination country is deemed by the European Commission to provide a level of personal data protection comparable to that provided in European legislation. As of February 2023, only a very small number of countries fulfil the requirements.</p>
<p>Careful management of data residency doesn’t just fulfil regulatory and legal demands but can also protect data from unauthorised access by other countries. This is vital for security and confidentiality, as such unauthorised access could be undetectable by normal intrusion monitoring systems, or it may even involve legal gag orders.</p>
 Why storing all data on-premises is often not the best solution 
<p>Organisations may store data in multiple locations, including on-premises, in the cloud, or in both – in a hybrid environment. Each option has different implications for data privacy and security.</p>
<p>On-premises data storage naturally gives an organisation physical control over the servers that store its data. However, the organisation is now responsible for ensuring that the data is stored securely and is accessible only to authorised personnel – and that its availability and scalability satisfy the business requirements. Getting five nines uptime, ensuring that the system is fully operational 99.999% of the time, is no trivial task, and dedicating 24/7 IT resources to manage and maintain the services is a major burden.</p>
<p>Cloud-based data storage offers more flexibility and scalability than on-premises storage. Organisations can choose from various cloud-based storage solutions, such as public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud, which I examined in closer detail in a recent <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/understanding-hybrid-cloud/" title="Understanding hybrid cloud">Understanding hybrid cloud</a> blog. Cloud storage can be much more cost-effective than on-premises storage, but it may raise questions on how data residency issues are handled due to the organisation not having complete control over which jurisdiction the data is stored under.</p>
<p>In all cases however, if the data is encrypted and the keys are not accessible by the cloud service provider, then from a privacy perspective, the legality of whether the cloud provider could be compelled to hand over the data becomes irrelevant.</p>
 Why hybrid cloud for e-healthcare 
<p>Sometimes, it is indeed possible to have your cake and eat it, and the key to that was already known thousands of years before “cloud” meant anything else than a mass of water droplets suspended in the sky. The key is to divide and…perhaps not conquer, but to embrace both on-prem processing with cloud processing. The end result – lowering your expenses while improving resilience and compliance – is worth the initial cost.</p>
<p>Before working from home reached critical density, it was common in any organisation to divide stored digital identities and their related data as internal/trusted, and external/less trusted. Organisations are therefore familiar with dividing data into two classes. Embracing hybrid cloud merely expands that to include customer data.</p>
<p>With the rapid and accelerating growth of the e-health sector, hybrid cloud solutions are not just a convenience, but a business driver. Few home-grown solutions can keep up with 15-25% annual growth and working in multiple jurisdictions can easily become a legal minefield that paralyses the organisation – just when it would be the best opportunity to expand operations across borders.</p>
<p>Working with customer data is a natural start, and expanding that to include the varied B2B opportunities, such as co-operation with pharmacy chains, is exactly the type of problem that Ubisecure is perfectly placed to solve. &nbsp;Healthcare remains one of the key priorities for the European Commission, and its sustained rapid growth, combined with strict privacy demands make it a very good match for a hybrid cloud IAM solution.</p>

 0 dB City — Towards Integrated Urban Transportation System&nbsp;2.0 <p>This blog post aims to start a thought process on how to integrate urban mobility and logistical systems with management and stewardship of common urban assets as a means to unlocking greater quality of urban&nbsp;life.</p><p>The provocation takes transportation-induced noise as a measurable proxy from which other outcomes are extrapolated: road safety, speed, pollution, congestion, dwell time and therefore use of public areas. The aim is to provide an institutional, data and infrastructural mechanism for mutual dependencies.</p><p>We would like to invite municipal governments, groups working with neighborhood transition, actors from the urban logistics sector, smart city innovators, landowners, urban planners, activists and all other interested parties to collaborate on the new approach to managing urban logistics — everything connected to how goods, people and ideas get to travel across urban space and their relationship with our quality of&nbsp;life.</p> Introduction   How can urban liveability be improved in times of increased demand for mobility and e-commerce deliveries?  What is the total cost of mobility and logistics at a city level if we take into account things like citizens’ physical health, mental well-being, or road&nbsp;safety?  Can an in-delivery birthday present interact with the urban environment sponsoring its improvement?  <p>The Covid-19 pandemic, urbanization, growing online markets, new digital business models and availability of online goods combined with the demand for shorter delivery times put significant pressures on the logistical system and in return on the tangible and intangible features of the urban environments (e.g. road quality, noise), their citizens (well-being, health, behaviour in urban space) and fellow&nbsp;species.</p><p>In the context of the increased urban pressures for reduced delivery times and its costs, the emergence of new approaches such as 1) containerised urban last-mile delivery 2) marketplaces for city logistics 3) platforms for the integrated management of delivery times and space 4) city hubs: shared use of small-scale distribution centres or 5) transport vehicle capacity sharing emerge and will gradually reshape how urban logistics is performed.</p><p>While both the old and stagnated as well as the transitioning urban logistics systems greatly affect urban environments, liveability and health of the urban population via transport-related externalities, multiple key performance indicators (KPIs) are being recognized to frame sustainable urban logistics systems’ performance assessments (see: [<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4034714">1</a>]). These include societal and organizational KPIs such as road safety, air pollution, noise, accessibility, land use, dwell time, lifecycle emissions or infrastructural expenditures etc.</p><p>However, little research has been done on the systemic, cost and incentive analysis of these KPIs on a city level, including private public and civic actors’ interests and liabilities. Hence, the suggested approach aims to explore, analyse, and develop a framework for their accounting and contracting. This has a chance to combine the city level transport related externalities with logistical system actors’ pathways to increased levels of system efficiency and sustainability.</p> Optimizing for&nbsp;Commons <p>Towards shared assets logistical systems — beyond time, costs and the whole city approach.</p><p>As in some cities, both the public and private sectors have engaged with various local initiatives to address the pressures, urban logistics today pretty much functions in the same way it did decades ago. It is mostly optimized to serve two purposes — to reduce the delivery time and its&nbsp;costs.</p><p>Partially inspired by real-life business success cases of interconnected logistical ecosystems through platforms (such as Amazon), there have been multiple proposals for central IT platforms where multiple market participants record their delivery capacities, share data, and further; physical infrastructures.</p><p>Although companies such as Amazon have built up an infrastructure that forecasts logistics demand and monitors its entire supply chain capacity in real-time such an integrated system, is still optimized for mostly cost and delivery time from the perspectives of individual enterprise and has a danger of creating monopolies and imbalance of interests between private, public, and civic&nbsp;actors.</p><p>To address the future challenges that freight and delivery face, we need to think about logistics as a whole city problem. For this purpose, system-level change, harmonized regulatory, infrastructural and data-sharing frameworks have not yet been established.</p><p>Transitioning the logistical system means not only the necessity to pool the innovation capacity of the niche innovations and major logistics system players but also urban citizens as well as common urban assets such as urban green, tranquillity, species contributing to urban biodiversity or good quality public space for&nbsp;all.</p><p>A city-wide, common <a href="https://radiclecivics.cc/">civic assets</a> optimization has a chance to unlock the full potential of just, sustainable, and healthy urban logistics systems. Therefore, the project proposes a whole city data infrastructure and financing framework for common, shared civic&nbsp;assets.</p> Civic Asset&nbsp;Trust <p>Remaking local transportation rules and use of urban space through new institutional infrastructure for&nbsp;commons.</p><p>Living by a noisy street can reduce your lifespan. Studies reveal that adults living in areas with traffic noise higher than 60 dB were more likely to have a stroke than those who lived in quieter areas [<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150623200112.htm">1</a>]&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1098892_traffic-noise-may-reduce-life-expectancy-increase-strokes">2</a>].</p><p>Tranquillity is treated here as a common asset — an asset having value which no single person or entity can take credit for creating. Examples include natural assets, safety, air quality, land values (yes! — <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">see here</a>) or little noise in urban&nbsp;spaces.</p><p>Let us walk through a little case&nbsp;study.</p><p>The city of Stockholm, Berlin, Lisbon, or Montreal owns and manages streets and public areas. Residents are interested in boosting the quality of life through good quality of urban surfaces, unlocked room for events, community space, pedestrian, bike flows, reduced noise&nbsp;etc.</p><p>They establish a Common Asset Trust (CAT) which aims to manage intangible assets such as tranquility, good air quality, greenery and recreation spaces on a city, district, or neighborhood level. The area defines where the common assets are protected by the rules and mechanisms established by all inhabitants i.e. members of the&nbsp;CAT.</p><p>The Common Asset Trust becomes an integral actor in the logistical system. It serves as an institution that ensures that the system not only serves the producer, delivery company and the client but also that its benefits, costs, and liabilities to society are adequately rebalanced.</p><p>The CAT establishes new rules for the usage of common spaces such as streets. For example, the trustees can decide that noisy and heavy delivery vans (or private cars) should be charged a premium for usage of the space in between the buildings. They occupy space to stop and deliver a package, drive through or park on the street which could be used otherwise for leisure activities or greenery, damage road surface and contribute to poor mental&nbsp;health.</p><p>Through liability and benefit rebalancing mechanism the CAT finances e.g. road and sidewalk repairs, noise-reducing green infrastructure or invests in optimization of parking &amp; dwell time e.g. designated areas or data based meters which calculate the parking price per vehicle length, and noise that it generates.</p><p>The CAT also manages the long-term benefits of the scheme focused on mobility such as appreciation in land value in the area, increased footfall, improved well-being, or greater social cohesion through more accessible public space. A percentage of the spill-over value only visible at a municipal and/or federal level can be recaptured through e.g. smart contracts.</p>Fig. 1. Transportation system level indicators and societal level indicators — value and liability rebalancing mechanism [ *KPIs repurposed from: Andruetto, C., et al. Indicators for Sustainability Assessment in City Logistics: Perspectives of Society and Logistic Service Providers. 2023 Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting, Available at SSRN: <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4034714">https://ssrn.com/abstract=4034714</a> or <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4034714">http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4034714</a> ]<p>Further design components the system could include the following:</p><p>Delivery companies share data, staff and physical infrastructure (e.g. DHL, Hermes&nbsp;etc.)</p>  Shared logistical data, especially on last-mile delivery allows for vehicle sharing, and more efficient route planning for all deliveries in the area rather than deliveries by one delivery company at a specific&nbsp;time.  Shared physical infrastructure incl. vehicles for delivery, which reduces the amount of vehicles needed for delivery in the area, the burden on public space and costs to the delivery companies.  <p>Civic infrastructure ensures the coupling of the logistical system with urban liveability and&nbsp;health</p>  Civic City hub is established through a public-private partnership or Common Asset Trust scheme. The goods are delivered and redistributed there for last-mile delivery. Packages are bundled together and put into common, shared vehicles as well as smaller vehicles, e-bikes&nbsp;etc.  Civic data infrastructure forms a whole-city model including logistics and civic infrastructure. This means, in practice that every delivery leaves a data mark in city space including data on vehicles’ speed, weight, size, engine noise, emissions (based on vehicle model), dwell time in space, time of the day. The delivery data is then juxtaposed against data on noise regulation for specific streets and neighbourhoods. For example, a delivery by a heavy, noisy van going through a quiet neighborhood street will be charged more. The cost of the delivery increases or decreases based on these coupled variables. The cost of delivery is distributed between the client (based on size and weight of the package), the producer, and the delivery&nbsp;company.  Civic financing — street repairs, sidewalk improvements, green infrastructure are financed through the rebalancing mechanism unlocked through the civic data infrastructure. The mechanism also incentivises logistical companies to invest or co-invest in quiet, low-emission vehicles, skip side streets as shortcuts, find strategies to reduce dwell&nbsp;time  Civic choice — new digital ordering infrastructure is established to provide choice to the clients who wish to get their goods delivered fast (noisy) and expensive or quiet, with longer-delivery time.

However, most of the existing quantitative studies have been conducted to measure how various elements of the supply chain and decisions are affected when only a limited number of costs are considered. Little research has been performed on the total cost of logistics to crystallize its definition, define challenges, as well as outcomes. Additionally, as the logistic system contributes to multiple unaccounted externalities and their associated costs to public and civic assets, such as noise, pollution, road safety and their health hazards, road damage and repair, or unlocking of space in the city for alternative uses and their option&nbsp;value.</p><p>The total cost of logistics on a whole city level could include and enmesh private, public and civic interests, and brings forward multiple fundamental questions such&nbsp;as:</p>  What variables should be included in the total cost calculation?  Is minimizing the total cost of logistics helping logistics system actors such as companies, citizens, cities to perform, or live&nbsp;better?  What are the cost, supply, demand and time interdependencies between logistics system elements, their externalities and urban liveability for&nbsp;all?  Fig. 3. Delivery vans, heavy trucks, demolition &amp; renovation related objects, logistical leftover occupying common public space in the city — Berlin (photos by the&nbsp;author)Fig. 4. “Gehweg-schäden” and “Straßen-schäden” — the most popular signs describing the quality of public space in Berlin; damaged pedestrian sidewalks, space occupied primarily by car parking and traffic, pedestrian zebra crossing and more — Berlin (photos by the&nbsp;author) Systems perspective <p>With increasing comprehension of complex systems and the emergence of technological tools for effective system-scale organization, the time is ripe to look at the future of logistics through a systems&nbsp;lens.</p><p>This reveals the possibility of shifting logistics and transportation from an economy concerned with mere optimization for time and costs towards an outcome-oriented service economy, operating at a societal and system&nbsp;level.</p><p>Leveraging the deep interdependence of logistics and other domains of social and economic activity unlocks opportunities for the creation of direct, indirect, and synthetic value and the mitigation of future liabilities (like noise, air pollution, city congestion, road safety, long-term unemployment, and energy dependence). Taking the next step from integrated conveyance networks to an integrated system financing model can move us closer to a future of truly sustainable urban logistics systems.</p>Fig. 5. Drafting further infrastructure for Multi-stakeholder value transportation system — TBC New spatial finance instruments for logistical systems <p>Urban form, and therefore urban behavior, green infrastructure, or quality of public life and space are determined by transportation systems because proximity and the consequently reduced transportation costs for people, goods, and ideas are the raison d’être of&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Every vehicle delivering goods to the client leaves a mark in space contributing to the shaping of the urban environment which it penetrates. How space becomes and not how space is, or might be, should be the focus of the new spatial planning efforts in order to efficiently, justly and sustainably couple together logistical systems and the quality of civic life. Strategies such as route optimization, traffic avoidance or dwell times in space, all leave seemingly intangible and tangible marks that in the long-term, contribute to the perceived quality of spaces, it’s further planning, repurposing, widening or narrowing of streets, establishment of new public spaces or green pocket&nbsp;parks.</p>  What if the tracked, geo-located good in motion (package, meal) and its carrier (truck, van, cargo bike) — understood as a mark in space- a data point engaged in an array of autonomous transactions with civic infrastructure which they&nbsp;pass?  <p>Urban trees, contributing to reduced CO2 and noise sequestration, flexible street and flex-parking spaces which open and close for freight depending on the need of civic events, restaurants or delivery demands, whole city blocks during children walking to the nearby school or waiting time at a traffic light are all quantifiable, tangible functions of urban life which positive values up until now are decoupled from the logistical systems which define their amounts (trees or free from traffic public space), scale, distribution and quality (safety).</p><p>For example, in Sweden, new vehicles such as slow-moving electric trailers are a great evolution toward silent and low-emission transportation. As their increased popularity is definitely a positive phenomenon, the optimization for urban space which they unlock compared to large vehicles, the noise which they emit or help to minimize or emission targets which they help to reduce are still unaccounted for.</p><p>At the same time, taking a step further, considering increased future population growth, densities and delivery demands, urban governance and spatial strategies need to expand their scope from narrow considerations of land use to take into account all bodies inhabiting the urban. Spatial planning and governing systems are not fit for purpose for the current time of climate, environmental, biodiversity, or mental health crisis where recognition of further, more fine-grained interdependencies is necessary.</p><p>Therefore, we need new data and new maps to redefine the relation between space — efficiency — noise — delivery time and costs — environmental gain, damage &amp; value. Extracting and supporting the more tangible, non-monetary value of the urban environment shaped largely via logistical systems is the true challenge.</p><p>New mode of financing for the civic infrastructure through vehicles, citizens, goods and services in movement is necessary to address the urban logistics in transition. However, the true value of the new scheme cannot be achieved if it is not coupled with local community development and already existing city spatial planning&nbsp;agendas.</p><p>Plans such as for example the <a href="http://carbonneutralcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stockholm-Freight-Plan-of-Urban-Mobility-Strategy.pdf">Stockholm Freight plan</a> aim to address some of the issues around citizens’ well-being, quality of the urban environment and freight delivery. The institutional infrastructure around it aims to deal with the complexity of the&nbsp;problem.</p><p>In this context, we posit that new instruments of measuring and accounting for logistical system actors’ liabilities to society, ranging from carbon emissions, biointegrity loss, noise and up to community impacts and individual mental well-being are necessary to create a basis for transforming logistical systems and its accounting models in line with the scale of the&nbsp;crises.</p><p>The potential project aims to experiment with instruments which allow reallocation of capital towards long term common urban assets, seeing them as crucial to the civic approach to achieving SDGs at an urban&nbsp;level.</p> Pilot project&nbsp;proposal <p>We would love to collaborate with potential partners on a project structured around the exemplary draft work packages (open for discussion).

<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/research-detection-fraud-fingerprints/">FIFRAUD project</a>, which was launched in March 2021 to find more effective ways of detecting identity fraud through cross-referencing existing databases rather than relying on single use submitted customer data, has been declared an overwhelming success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-funded by the <a href="https://www.bretagne.bzh/">Brittany region</a> and in collaboration with the <a href="https://b-com.com/en">b&lt;&gt;com research institute</a>, the project saw the implementation of groundbreaking anti-fraud functionality into our identity verification solutions after a research period of 16 months.&nbsp;</p>



 Thinking outside the data. 



<p>Traditionally, the identity verification process would only be carried out on information submitted by the user during the onboarding stage. The process did not include any cross-referencing with older data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, some types of fraud are not easily identifiable, and only become evident when compared to previously submitted identity documents, as fraudsters sometimes reuse identity elements from one attempt to the next. In isolation, these incidents can evade detection, and it is only when compared with previously used identity documents that they are flagged as fraudulent. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The aim of the FIFRAUD project was to find an efficient solution to this challenge.</p>



 Ambitious research integrated into production. 



<p>One of the main aims of the project was to minimize false rejections (documents wrongly considered fraudulent), while maximizing true rejections (documents rightly considered fraudulent). Given the newly introduced functionality, one&nbsp;of the main challenges of the FIFRAUD project was to ensure that the identity verification process with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fr/produits/idcheck-io/">IDCheck.io</a> was still able to be completed in under 10 seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An important step in achieving the goals and overcoming the challenges was to design a machine learning algorithm that enabled fast and precise comparison between certain identity elements of the submitted document with the same elements of identity documents in the client’s database, after the client’s approval. IDnow’s biometrics research team was able to propose an innovative and extremely fast comparison method (1 millisecond per comparison) for the detection of fraudulent identity elements between new and existing documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the course of the project, an in-depth analysis of the database over a 14-day period detected five repeat fraudsters, each of whom submitted multiple documents containing common elements. Thanks to the cross-referencing document analysis, the detection of fraudulent documents increased to above market standards, while the false rejection rate (i.e, documents that are considered fraudulent when they are not), was able to be kept well below the target rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the FIFRAUD research project concluded in late 2022, several of our customers have implemented the tried and tested improved anti-fraud functionality to detect fraud and enhance their identity verification process further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to the success of the FIFRAUD project, research has been extended to add additional identity elements to the comparison step of the process.&nbsp;</p>

 Germans want more digital services but ignorance and security concerns remain.&nbsp; 



<p>Digital services were already gradually growing in popularity and usage before the COVID-19 pandemic. But since then, the demand for more digital processes has rapidly increased across the board – in finance and banking, in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel and hospitality sectors</a>, and in healthcare and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/insurance/">insurance</a>, to name just a few. In Germany, the private sector as well as the government – at local and national level – have therefore been working on the digitization of everyday processes for years. </p>



<p>The same development can be observed at the EU level. In March 2021, <a href="https://eufordigital.eu/library/2030-digital-compass-the-european-way-for-the-digital-decade/">the European Commission presented a vision for the digital transformation in Europe by 2030</a>. A core element of this so-called “Digital Decade” is the creation of digital identities for EU citizens. To make this happen, the EU Commission is working on legislation, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">Electronic IDentification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS)</a> which is intended to enable a simple and uniform identification framework for all EU citizens via an identity wallet. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though the demand for digital services in Germany is growing, security concerns about the storage of personal data remain high and often hinder further digitization efforts. To find out more about the future of digital identity in Germany, we created the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/portfolio/digital-identity-index-2023-deutschland/">Digital Identity Index 2023</a>, which examines:&nbsp;</p>



  Areas in which Germans already rely on digital identification processes&nbsp;  Sectors in which they would like to employ digital services in the future&nbsp;  Views on the EU’s plans for the identity wallet&nbsp;  Important factors on the use and adoption of identity wallets&nbsp;  



<p>For the Index, 2,040 adults were surveyed as part of a representative poll with <a href="https://yougov.de/">market research company YouGov</a>.*&nbsp;</p>



 Digital services: Reality or wishful thinking?&nbsp; 



<p>According to the survey, the vast majority of Germans are annoyed by the long waiting times associated with manual, in-person processes and applications (59%). Inflexible appointments and limited opening hours (58%) are also perceived as sources of frustration. However, despite these opinions, the adoption of digital methods is still not as high as one would expect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, although two-thirds of Germans would like to use more e-Government&nbsp;services, only 9% actually do so. Half of the population would also like to view their health records digitally or submit their sick notes online. Although both services are available, only 16% of the population make use of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As there seems to be a general preference for digitized processes in most areas of everyday life, it is surprising that so many Germans continue to prefer paper-based employment and rental contracts. In fact, 40% of respondents said that they would not digitally sign such contracts. Little wonder then that <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">qualified electronic signatures (QES)</a> have only been used by 6% of Germans.&nbsp;</p>



 Popularity of different remote identity verification methods.&nbsp; 



<p>While QES is still considered niche, many Germans (63%) have already used a digital or remote identity verification solution at least once. The most common identification methods are in-person identification in post offices (40%), the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent method via a video chat with an agent</a> (38%), and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">fully automated identification solutions with a photo/selfie</a> (14%). The latter, although quicker and more convenient, is likely less widespread because of regulatory restrictions, as automated identification processes are not approved for all use cases in Germany. For example, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">it can be used for car rentals to verify driver’s licenses</a>, but not for AML use cases, such as opening a bank account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, German users seem to prefer private-sector solutions, such as VideoIdent to the state-issued eID, with only 8% having ever used <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">the eID function of the German ID card</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2023 Index also shows that many citizens have already used remote identity verification processes several times, e.g., 16% have utilized a VideoIdent process multiple times, 18% have gone through the identification in a post office branch more than once. The usage indicates that there is a clear need in the German market for digital identity solutions that can be reused for verification and authentication. Yet only 1% of the population have ever used a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital identity wallet</a> which enables you to reuse your digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



 Identity Wallets: Germans prefer to trust national providers with their data.&nbsp; 



<p>From the German population’s point of view, the main arguments against the EU’s plan for identity wallets, itself a core element of the eIDAS 2.0 regulation, is the lack of data security against identity misuse or forgery (44%), targeted hacker attacks (43%), and the possible loss or defect of the smartphone (41%). Around one in three Germans is also concerned about surveillance, either from companies or the state. These concerns are then reflected in the selection criteria for an identity wallet: Security (55%), data protection (46%), and user-friendliness (36%) are most important to Germans, when choosing an identity wallet. &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the survey, respondents are also skeptical of companies outside the EU. Only 4% of respondents trust non-German companies to process their data securely and provide a user-friendly experience, compared to 28% who trust companies based in Germany to be able to strike that balance. Another 26% believe only German government institutions or agencies could fulfill these criteria in an identity wallet.&nbsp;</p>



 The future of digital identity in Germany.&nbsp; 



<p>Our Digital Identity Index 2023 shows that there is still room for improvement in the use of digital services in Germany. Users still often opt for analog processes rather than digital due to security and safety concerns, or often because they’re unaware of the existence of digital services. The Index also shows that the population is open to non-governmental remote identification solutions, such as VideoIdent, as enablers for digital services. In fact, they often prefer these solutions to the state-provided online ID card function (eID) – even ten years after its introduction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In view of the upcoming changes and opportunities that identity wallets will bring throughout the EU, it is incredibly important to listen to the requirements and preferences of users. In Germany, policymakers and industry leaders will need to balance security with user experience to create a future-proof digital identity ecosystem that can be reused for verification and authentication in everyday digital services. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Index has demonstrated that the desire for German, or at least European identity wallets remains. After all, the more solutions are considered secure in the eyes of the German population, the more likely they are to be used in a wide variety of use cases throughout different sectors.&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>As a founding steering member of ToIP, Continuum Loop is pleased to see the mission of the OWF aligning so closely with that of ToIP.</p>
<p><a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">The OWF</a> is an open-source project of the Linux Foundation that aims to develop a digital wallet “engine” that anyone can use to build secure, privacy-respecting, interoperable multi-purpose wallets. The OWF compares this wallet engine to the open-source browser engines that currently power all major Internet browsers.</p>
<p>As the mission of the OWF is highly relevant to the ToIP Foundation, the ToIP Foundation is joining the OWF as an Associate Member. The ToIP Foundation will support the development of OWF code projects by providing requirements, specifications, governance tools, and best practices on how OWF code modules can accomplish interoperability using the ToIP stack.</p>
 The Wallet Report 
<p>Continuum Loop has been at the forefront of defining a digital wallet, clarifying the industry and ecosystem, and providing organizations with guidance on moving forward as the ecosystem develops. In 2019, we published “<a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/state-of-digital-wallets-series/">The Current and Future State of Digital Wallets</a>,” a report which provides an in-depth overview of the digital wallet ecosystem and its evolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During our webinar “<a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/the-wallet-report-update/">The Wallet Report – 2021 Update</a>,” Darrell O’Donnell and Drummond Reed reviewed the key takeaways from the report and provided updates on the digital wallet industry. They discussed the growth of single-use wallet apps, the slow adoption of DIDComm, and the potential for cloud/custodial digital wallets despite security concerns. They also touched on the challenges of digital wallet standards and interoperability and the need for trust registries.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to see ToIP joining the OWF as an associate member. We look forward to the ongoing dialogue between the two organizations as they work towards the continued growth and adoption of decentralized digital identity solutions!</p>

<p>Part of our continued work with SSX involves making Sign-In with Ethereum both as easy as possible for developers to integrate and having support for various environments and use cases. We've recently heard from developers that they wish to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, but still would like to retain email-based login flows for their users. Typically this is to ensure that there is:</p>  Support for a traditional user base that may not be fully ready to use Sign-In with Ethereum, but some users have expressed interest and  A means to still communicate with an existing user base through a means like email.  <p>In our previous work on <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/integrations/discourse?ref=blog.spruceid.com">enabling Sign-In with Ethereum for discourse forums</a>, we saw a similar workflow where users were first required to sign in using their email, link their Ethereum address, and then they could Sign-In with Ethereum. </p><p>To get developers up and running with this approach, we've shipped a Next.js app that implements a login flow with NextAuth.js, SSX, and RainbowKit, but requires a user to first log in using their email. To check out the example, first clone SSX, install any required dependencies, and navigate to the example by entering the following in your terminal:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/spruceid/ssx
cd ssx
yarn install
cd examples/ssx-test-nextauth-email</code> <p>Next, make sure to rename <code>.env.example</code> to <code>.env</code>, and install dependencies by running <code>yarn</code> in your terminal. </p><p>This example also comes bundled with a fake local SMTP server with a web client that allows access to a mailbox using <a href="https://www.docker.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">docker</a>. To run this local server, enter the following in your terminal:</p> <code>docker run -d -p 1080:1080 -p 1025:1025 --name mailcatcher schickling/mailcatcher
</code> <p>Once the container is running, in a separate tab, navigate to the fake server by going to http://localhost:1080 in your browser. </p><p>Finally, this example uses SQLite for testing and Prisma as an adapter to connect the dapp to a database, but you can change the example database anytime. </p><p>Run the following commands to start the application:</p> <code>npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate
yarn dev
</code> <p>Once started, you should be presented with the following screen, prompting you to first sign-in using an email address. After hitting “Sign-In with Email” and entering any email address, you should be able to access the magic sign-in link with the server running on localhost:1080.</p><p>Find the sign-in email sent, and hit the “Sign in” button to be redirected back to the dapp in a protected page only accessible by signed-in users.</p><p>Finally, connect your wallet using the provided button in the nav via RainbowKit. Once connected, hit “Link Your Ethereum Account” to Sign-In with Ethereum and link your Ethereum address to your email login.<br></p><p>Once this is complete, you can log out, and Sign-In with Ethereum directly using the account you linked. </p> <p>As mentioned previously, we want to support any developer looking to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, no matter the requirements. We see this kind of workflow as a stepping stone in finally enabling users to fully Sign-In with Ethereum, especially as direct-to-wallet messaging and communications mature. </p><p>As we continue to build out SSX, we invite you to <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/issues/new/choose?ref=blog.spruceid.com">request any features or examples</a> you're looking for, especially when looking to support Sign-In with Ethereum. Alternatively, we also welcome all open-source contributions to <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SSX</a> from developers.</p> <p>Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

<p>I wouldn’t call myself a serious developer anymore, but I used to be, and I still love creating programs. So I took Holochain’s new scaffolding tool for a spin, just to see what it’s like. And I did it — I made my first-ever hApp, and it works! It’s not pretty, and it took more like a couple hours to think out my design, download packages, and get familiar with the tool, but on a subsequent try I was able to speed-run the scaffolding in under 10 minutes.</p><p>Now, I have been breathing Holochain for the past five years, so I have a decent understanding of how it works. I’ll be honest, it takes effort for us to break free of the centralised mindset. But your first decentralised app doesn’t have to be perfect — all that matters is that it works. The beauty of this tool is that it helps you get there quickly.</p><p>Colleagues and friends in the Holochain world have created a few scaffolding tools for various iterations of Holochain over the years. Many of them were visual, allowing non-developers to easily prototype a hApp without having to write code.</p><p>This one is different: it’s entirely CLI-driven. While we still believe it’s crucial to empower everyone to create a hApp, we recognise that current reality means this stuff is still mostly the domain of developers. So, after receiving a lot of feedback, the new scaffolding tool has been designed to support them first.</p><p>I remember watching a video in which Guillem Cordoba, the creator of the new scaffolder, demoed it. I could see the excitement in the faces of the other developers — Eric Harris-Braun, co-creator of Holochain and himself a prolific hApp dev, later said this:</p><blockquote>For people who have been in the web app development world for a while, you might remember when Rails came out with its scaffolding, how much of a game changer that was for building Web2 apps—the way you could scaffold an app that runs in literally ten minutes. And what we’ve got coming out will be, I believe, just as powerful for Web3 apps. That gives developers a super powerful ability to just get started.</blockquote><p>And like the Rails scaffolder, I see it as being just as useful for experienced hApp devs as for new ones. We all find ourselves writing the same boilerplate code over and over again, and that’s a sign that that stuff should be automated.</p><p>So what can we do with this thing? Let’s find out!</p> Creating a gardeners’ swap hApp <p>A little aside: My Holochain journey started back in 2017, in a vast expanse of rocks and weeds. I’d been tasked with turning it into a community garden space, and I was looking for software that would help gardeners track their participation in shared projects such as walnut trees and ‘squash jungles’.</p><p>I never did find what I was looking for. Instead, I found something weird and wonderful: a group of folks creating an internet protocol that works like a community garden. Years later, I’m still hanging around those folks, and I’m even starting to see them create the <a href="https://hrea.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">beginnings</a> of the kind of software I’d imagined all those years ago.</p><p>That garden management hApp is probably out of my reach, so I’ll try building something smaller: a garden swap. People can use it to list extra seeds, plants, and produce they have available or are looking for.</p> Getting set up <p>I used the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/?ref=blog.holochain.org">instructions on the Developer Portal</a> to install the Holochain dev environment. (You can read more about it in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holonix-the-beginning-of-your-happ-development-journey/">first article</a>.) After that’s set up, I scaffold an empty project:</p> <code>$ nix-shell https://holochain.love --run "hc scaffold web-app gardenswap"</code> <p>What I see is immediately comforting; it looks like it’s going to guide me through the process with a bunch of questions:</p> <code>? Choose UI framework: ›
  Vue
  Svelte
❯ Lit</code> <p>I’ll go with Lit, which adds the bare minimum needed to make the DOM dynamic, because that seems old-fashioned — like me.</p> <code>? Do you want to set up the holonix development environment for this project? ›
❯ Yes (recommended)
  No</code> <p>In the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holonix-the-beginning-of-your-happ-development-journey/">previous article</a> we learned that Holonix lets us create and share reproducible development environments; this step is going to make sure that the scaffolded code has all the right runtime dependencies alongside it.</p><p>Now I see a bunch of gobbledigook, followed by this cheerful message and a bunch of help text:</p> <code>Web hApp "gardenswap" scaffolded!

Notice that this is an empty skeleton for a Holochain web-app, so:

- It won't compile until you add a DNA to it, and then add a zome to that DNA.
- The UI is empty, you'll need to import the appropriate components to the top level app component.

Set up your development environment with:
  cd gardenswap
  nix develop
  npm install

Then, add new DNAs to your app with:

  hc scaffold dna</code> <p>That sounds easy enough. I’m going to follow the instructions above; the <code>nix develop</code> command is what gets me into the Holonix development environment by looking for a file called <code>flake.nix</code> in the project directory.</p> <code>paul@panda:~/Holochain$ cd gardenswap
paul@panda:~/Holochain/gardenswap$ nix develop</code>  Scaffolding some code <p>Now I’m in and it’s time to start generating code. It told me to just type in <code>hc scaffold dna</code>, but I’m going to save a step by adding the DNA name to the end of that command. This is a simple hApp, only one DNA with the same name as the hApp itself:</p> <code>[nix-shell:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc scaffold dna gardenswap

DNA "gardenswap" scaffolded!

Add new zomes to your DNA with:

  hc scaffold zome</code> <p>And now it’s time to scaffold a ‘zome’ — a module to hold my actual code. Again, it’s just a simple DNA with only one zome (actually two — more on that in a moment):</p> <code>[nix-shell:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc scaffold zome gardenswap
? What do you want to scaffold? ›
❯ Integrity/coordinator zome-pair (recommended)
  Only an integrity zome
  Only a coordinator zome</code> <p>It’s nice of the scaffolder to recommend a choice to me. I’ll go with that.</p><p>Now it asks me to confirm the folder name choices — just in case there’s something already there, I guess.</p> <code>✔ Scaffold integrity zome in folder "dnas/gardenswap/zomes/integrity/"? · yes
Integrity zome "gardenswap_integrity" scaffolded!
✔ Scaffold coordinator zome in "dnas/gardenswap/zomes/coordinator/"? · yes
Coordinator zome "gardenswap" scaffolded!</code> <p>Here’s creating two zomes — an integrity zome and a coordinator zome. The first one defines data types and validation rules for them, and the second one defines API functions for working with the data.</p><p>Now it’s doing some Rust stuff — downloading crates, that sort of thing. Finally it gives me the next step — to start adding entry definitions to my zome:</p> <code>Add new entry definitions to your zome with:

  hc scaffold entry-type</code> <p>The first type I’m going to scaffold, the thing that the whole app revolves around, is the listing. Offers and requests will look pretty similar, so we’ll use the same type for both, along with a flag to indicate which one it is.</p> <code>[nix-shell:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc scaffold entry-type listing</code> <p>First it asks me to choose a data type for my field. I’m vaguely familiar with Rust and Holochain types already, so I kinda get what these all mean. I’m going to start off with a field pointing back to the person who created the listing.</p> <code>Which fields should the entry contain?

? Choose field type: ›
  String
  bool
  u32
  i32
  f32
  Timestamp
  ActionHash
  EntryHash
  DnaHash
❯ AgentPubKey
  Enum
  Option of...
  Vector of...</code> <p>Next it offers to generate code that creates links from people to the listings they create — because a Holochain DHT is a graph database, not an SQL database, you always have to explicitly create both sides of a relationship, either as fields or links.</p> <code>✔ Should a link from this field be created when this entry is created? · yes</code> <p>Now it asks me to describe the relationship between the agent and the listing. I call it ‘creator’:</p> <code>✔ Which role does this agent play in the relationship ? (eg. "creator", "invitee") · creator</code> <p>Finally, it asks me to name the field. I go with the recommended name, which came from my previous answer:</p> <code>✔ Field name: · creator</code> <p>Now I start the process again, for the next field, the flag that will indicate whether the listing is an offer or request. I choose <code>Enum</code>, or a list of choices.</p> <code>? Add another field to the entry? (y/n) › y
✔ Choose field type: · Enum
? Enter the name of the enum: › listing_type
✘ Input must be Pascal case.</code> <p>My first error — so helpful. I feel like I’m getting a free Rust education! Let’s try again.</p> <code>✔ Enter the name of the enum: · ListingType</code> <p>Now it asks me for variant names:</p> <code>? Enter the name of the next variant: ›</code> <p>Odd language, since I haven’t created any variants yet, but I can forgive such a helpful little tool. Careful to stick with PascalCase this time, I define the two variants:</p> <code>✔ Enter the name of the next variant: · Offer
? Add another variant to the enum? (y/n) · y
✔ Enter the name of the next variant: · Request
? Add another variant to the enum? (y/n) · n</code> <p>Then I name the field (this time I can use snake_case):</p> <code>✔ Field name: · listing_type</code> <p>Now it asks me if I want to include the field in the scaffolded UI code. Guess it’s going to generate a basic UI for me; that’s helpful!</p> <code>✔ Should this field be visible in the UI? · yes
✔ Choose widget to render this field: · Select</code> <p>Now I’ll add two simple string fields — a title and description. You’ll note that there are two types of UI widget to choose from: <code>TextField</code> and <code>TextArea</code>. The former is good for a title; the latter is better for an expanded description.</p> <code>✔ Choose field type: · String
✔ Field name: · title
✔ Should this field be visible in the UI? · yes
✔ Choose widget to render this field: · TextField

✔ Choose field type: · String
✔ Field name: · description
✔ Should this field be visible in the UI? · yes
✔ Choose widget to render this field: · TextArea</code> <p>Finally, a flag that lets a gardener hide the listing when they’re not currently offering or wanting something but may want to again in the future.</p> <code>✔ Choose field type: · bool
✔ Field name: · is_active
✔ Should this field be visible in the UI? · yes
✔ Choose widget to render this field: · Checkbox</code> <p>Now I tell the scaffolder that I’m done defining fields. Next it asks me what sorts of ‘CRUD functions’ I want to create. Sort of — more like ‘UD’; create and read are already assumed.</p> <code>Chosen fields: creator, listing_type, title, description, is_active

? Which CRUD functions should be scaffolded (SPACE to select/unselect, ENTER to continue)? ›
✔ Update
✔ Delete</code> <p>The next question exposes the finer details of designing for the DHT’s graph database, but it helpfully recommends a choice for me. It’s asking me if the first entry in an update history should point to the newest entry (by default, an updated entry only points to its immediate replacement).</p> <code>? Should a link from the original entry be created when this entry is updated? ›
❯ Yes (more storage cost but better read performance, recommended)
  No (less storage cost but worse read performance)</code> <p>And it’s done! As before, it finishes off with guidance on what my next step should be:</p> <code>Entry type "listing" scaffolded!

Add new collections for that entry type with:

  hc scaffold collection</code> <p>I’ve learned that Holochain doesn’t have a built-in idea of a table or collection, but you can create one using links off a well-defined and easy-to-find base entry called an ‘anchor’. Let’s try the command and see what it does.</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc scaffold collection
✔ Collection name (snake_case, eg. "all_posts"): ·</code> <p>I’m intuiting that the suggested name means one can create a collection of all entries of a certain type. So I call it <code>all_listings</code>.</p> <code>✔ Collection name (snake_case, eg. "all_posts"): · all_listings</code> <p>Now it’s asking me about the intended scope of this collection.</p> <code>? Which type of collection should be scaffolded? ›
❯ Global (get all entries of the selected entry types)
  By author (get entries of the selected entry types that a given author has created)</code> <p>The next question reveals something cool; it’s obviously picking up on code that’s already been generated. It allows me to select from a list (currently one item long) of existing entry types.</p> <code>? Which entry type should be collected? ›
❯ Listing</code> <p>Now it generates the collection code, along with some helpful advice for when I start working on the UI:</p> <code>Collection "all_listings" scaffolded!

At first, the UI for this application is empty. If you want the newly scaffolded collection to be the entry point for its UI, import the element in `ui/src/holochain-app.ts`:

  import './gardenswap/gardenswap/all-listings';
 
And insert it in the `&lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;` like this:

  &lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;all-listings&gt;&lt;/all-listings&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> <p>I recall that there was another option offered to me, to create a by-author collection. That sounds important too; I want people to be able to drill down and only see one person’s listings.</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc scaffold collection
✔ Collection name (snake_case, eg. "all_posts"): · listings_by_creator
? Which type of collection should be scaffolded? ›
✔ Which type of collection should be scaffolded? · By author (get entries of the selected entry types that a given author has created)
? Which entry type should be collected? · Listing

Collection "listings_by_creator" scaffolded!</code> <p>Okay, the next step is getting a bit into advanced territory. Maybe this is unnecessary for an introductory article, but I think it’s interesting to learn how to remodel things I took for granted back in my MySQL days (I told you I was old-fashioned). So we’re going to do an entry type that references another entry type (in SQL terms this would be a ‘foreign key’ relationship). It’ll be a listing ‘format’ — things like “1 pint” for a cherry tomato listing, or “packet of 20” and “bulk pack of 100” for pumpkin seeds.</p><p>The first field is an entry hash, which will point to the listing we’re attaching a format to.</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc scaffold entry-type listing_format

Which fields should the entry contain?

✔ Choose field type: · EntryHash</code> <p>Just like when I pointed to an agent ID (which also mimicked a foreign key relationship), it asks me if I want to link back from the referenced entry to this entry. And I do, of course.</p> <code>✔ Should a link from this field be created when this entry is created? · yes</code> <p>Then it asks what sort of entry we should point to, giving us a list of already defined entry types. From there it suggests a field name — once again, it’s choosing the most sensible default to save us time.</p> <code>✔ Which entry type is this field referring to? · Listing
✔ Field name: · listing_hash</code> <p>Lastly I’ll add a simple text field for the description and an integer field for the current quantity, and finish it off with CRUD functionality.</p> <code>✔ Choose field type: · String
✔ Field name: · description
✔ Should this field be visible in the UI? · yes
✔ Choose widget to render this field: · TextField

✔ Choose field type: · i32
✔ Field name: · quantity
✔ Should this field be visible in the UI? · yes
✔ Choose widget to render this field: · Slider

Chosen fields: listing_hash, description, quantity

✔ Which CRUD functions should be scaffolded (SPACE to select/unselect, ENTER to continue)? · Update, Delete
✔ Should a link from the original entry be created when this entry is updated? · Yes (more storage cost but better read performance, recommended)

Entry type "listing_format" scaffolded!

Add new collections for that entry type with:

  hc scaffold collection</code> <p>You’d think I would create a collection for this, some sort of listing-to-format collection. But in this case, because I already told the scaffolder to link from the listing to the format that references it, the listing entry is the collection anchor for all the connected format entries.</p><p>And for my final touch I’ll add a place where gardeners can introduce themselves. It’ll have just a few text fields — name, location, and bio. Of course it also needs to link to an agent ID. This is pretty similar to what we’ve seen already.</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc scaffold entry-type profile

Which fields should the entry contain?

✔ Choose field type: · AgentPubKey
✔ Should a link from this field be created when this entry is created? · yes
✔ Which role does this agent play in the relationship ? (eg. "creator", "invitee") · person
✔ Field name: · person

✔ Choose field type: · String
✔ Field name: · name
✔ Should this field be visible in the UI? · yes
✔ Choose widget to render this field: · TextField

✔ Choose field type: · String
✔ Field name: · location
✔ Should this field be visible in the UI? · yes
✔ Choose widget to render this field: · TextField

✔ Choose field type: · String
✔ Field name: · bio
✔ Should this field be visible in the UI? · yes
✔ Choose widget to render this field: · TextArea

Chosen fields: person, name, location, bio

✔ Which CRUD functions should be scaffolded (SPACE to select/unselect, ENTER to continue)? · Update, Delete
✔ Should a link from the original entry be created when this entry is updated? · Yes (more storage cost but better read performance, recommended)

Entry type "profile" scaffolded!

Add new collections for that entry type with:

  hc scaffold collection</code> <p>And that’s it! Now let’s try it out.</p> Trying my new hApp  <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ npm install
... lots of NPM output follows ...
[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ npm start
... more NPM output, plus Rust compilation output ...</code> <p>Wow! It’s… not pretty, but it’s something! On the left screen, in front of a staggering amount of console output, I see two hApp windows running the scaffolded UI. On the right, I see something called the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-playground?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain Playground</a>. It’s like a hApp inspector — it taps into a running conductor, which in this case is hosting the two agents whose UIs appear on the left. As the agents start interacting and contributing data to the DHT, you can see the graph of all the DHT’s data in the upper-right panel. It’s sort of a mix between a diagnostic tool and a learning tool.</p> The beginnings of a UI <p>There’s not much to see here, really, so I’m going to edit the HTML templates a bit. Recalling the suggestion the scaffolder made when I scaffolded my first collection, I open up the UI entrypoint file:</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ vim ui/src/holochain-app.ts</code> <p>(Yes, <code>vim</code> — I really am old-fashioned.) I add a new line right before the <code>@customElement('holochain-app')</code> line:</p> <code>import './gardenswap/gardenswap/all-listings';</code> <p>And replace everything inside the <code>&lt;div id="content"&gt;</code> element with this:</p> <code>&lt;all-listings&gt;&lt;/all-listings&gt;</code> <p>And magically, the UIs hot-reload just like we Web2 devs expect them to. But there aren’t any listings, and there’s no way to add one, so I’m going to make a couple more modifications. I add one more import after the previous one:</p> <code>import ‘./gardenswap/gardenswap/create-listing’;</code> <p>And one more element after <code>&lt;/all-listings&gt;</code>:</p> <code>&lt;create-listing&gt;&lt;/create-listing&gt;</code> <p>Now, when it hot-reloads, I see a form to enter new listing details! However, if I type something in and save it, I get an error. After a bit of sleuthing, I discover it’s because the <code>creator</code> property isn’t part of the form, so it’s valueless when I try to save it. So I open up the file for the form:</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ vim ui/src/gardenswap/gardenswap/create-listing.ts</code> <p>And I hard-wire the creator ID to be the agent ID of whoever’s typing in the form. In the <code>createListing</code> function I change this line:</p> <code>creator: this.creator,</code> <p>To this:</p> <code>creator: this.client.myPubKey,</code> <p>After it hot-reloads, I try creating a new listing, and this time it works!</p> That was fast! <p>So there you have it. In speed-run mode I was able to scaffold the entire hApp and make edits to the UI in 8 minutes and 30 seconds without copy/pasting a single command! Of course it took longer the first time I tried it — there were packages to download, I had to figure out what I wanted my data model to look like, and I was learning a bunch too. And there’s obviously a lot more work to be done on UI, permissioning (right now people can edit and delete each other’s listings!), and putting something useful into the automated tests (you’ll find them in the <code>tests/</code> folder). But having the skeleton of a fully working, fully peer-to-peer dApp in less than 15 minutes is a pretty great feeling. I’ve got something to play around with, to show others, and to start building on.</p><p>Here's the speed run at 2×, if you want to watch what I did:</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Thinking of identity systems as foundations of relationships can help us understand how and when we should be using them.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The architectures of traditional , administrative identity systems do not reflect the fluid multi – pseudonymity of real life , so they are mismatched with how people actually live .” (Windley, 2023)</p></blockquote>
<p>I recently read Phil Windley’s new book, “Learning Digital Identity: Design, Deploy, and Manage Identity Architectures” (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Digital-Identity-Design-Architectures/dp/1098117697/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">available here</a>), and I highly recommend it to any listeners of this podcast. The book elegantly distills down the most important concepts of digital identity. As I read, I found myself taking copious notes and making new associations between concepts that I hadn’t made before, leading to a flood of new ideas.</p>
<p>This conversation expands nicely on the one Phil and I had on the SSI Orbit Podcast in 2021 (<a href="https://northernblock.io/musings-on-wallets-identity-metasystems-with-phil-windley/">here</a>), and inspired my recent blog post <a href="https://northernblock.io/offering-outputs-not-restrictions/">“Offering Outputs, Not Restrictions”</a>. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode with Phil Windley, we discuss, <br><br></p>
 
 The differences in our knowledge needs between the physical world (tacit) and the digital world (explicit) are what make digital identity management complicated. 
 Short-lived vs. long-lived relationships: a comparison. 
 If the real world has pseudonymous relationships, why can’t this be true online? (looking at recent Twitter and Meta verified account initiatives) 
 Does the role of Identity Providers (IdPs) change as we move towards more user-controlled systems, rather than administrative identity systems? 
 How does the term “Relying Party” translate into SSI? 
 Breaking down trust and trustworthy, and differentiating between confidence and trust. 
 Examining the tradespace between Privacy, Authenticity, and Confidentiality. 
 How attribute-based access control (ABAC) will benefit from verifiable credentials.

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>I’m Dumont Lubos and I am from Slovakia. I joined Ontology in&nbsp;2018.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am 31 years old and happily married. I have an engineering degree focused specifically on material engineering, however, I work in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) as a CAD designer. When I was younger I was a gamer, I used to play competitive games like Battlefield or CS but I do not have enough time to play anymore. My main hobbies are cycling, hiking and travelling. I am also a fan of many TV series including sci-fi and fantasy series. I do not have a pet, however, I had many cats and dogs throughout my childhood.</p> If you had a superpower, what would it&nbsp;be? <p>My superpower would be being ultra smart, so I would be able to quickly find cures for diseases and develop new technologies helping humanity to progress&nbsp;further.</p> When did you first get involved in Ontology? <p>I joined Ontology back in 2018 and I started with my local Czech/Slovakian/SK Ontology group. Later on, I became an admin of Ontology English and Trading groups and I also began helping with news synchronization on different platforms. Last but not least I am an Ontology Harbinger.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>First of all, Ontology has a great team, working 24/7 on the project. However, the main thing I like is the focus Ontology has had since day one and that is decentralized identity. Ontology worked on this idea years earlier than the potential competition, therefore the technology is much more developed. The next thing I like is that Ontology is not just a blockchain, it is a whole suite of tools, wallets and protocols that create this ever-evolving ecosystem.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>My main focus is helping users in our community. Since I have been with Ontology for years, I have a lot of helpful information, so the most exciting thing for me is when I can promptly answer users’ questions and even better when I can help them out with their issues and guide them. For the same purpose, I have also written multiple articles and guidelines to support community members.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>Speaking about my career as a CAD designer, I would say the moment when I was hired was the most important. I was finishing university and I was able to find this job even before I finished, so I had a smooth transition from university to entering the workforce. Also, I participated in some exciting projects which gave me a lot of experience and improved my soft&nbsp;skills.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I am excited to work with Ontology’s super-motivated team and I am even more excited that I can witness the success of Ontology and its future breakthrough into the mainstream industry from the front&nbsp;seat.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I think for Ontology’s future success and especially the success of Web3 as a whole, it is necessary to have an onboarding experience that is as simple as possible, so there will be no hassle for newbies. We can take an example from Web2 where all you need is a device and a web browser and you do not need any special knowledge about processes. You just type a website and you are good to go. User experience in Web3 has to be comparably simple. Therefore I think that in five years, we will have much simpler solutions which will be ready for mass adoption.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-dumont-lubos-b871dfe5cf4f">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Dumont Lubos</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Last week in regulatory updates, the Central Bank of UAE launched a Financial Infrastructure Transformation Programme (FIT), the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that no crypto ATM within the country is registered with them, and the US Senate Banking Committee held a hearing on “Crypto Crash: Why Financial System Safeguards are Needed for Digital Assets”. Additionally, The Securities and Exchange Commission sent Paxos a Wells notice.</p>



 🇦🇪 UAE’s Central Bank (CBUAE) launched on February 12 a <a href="https://www.centralbank.ae/media/mdupathy/cbuae-launches-a-financial-infrastructure-transformation-programme-to-accelerate-the-digital-transformation-of-the-financial-services-sector-en.pdf">Financial Infrastructure Transformation </a><a href="https://www.centralbank.ae/media/mdupathy/cbuae-launches-a-financial-infrastructure-transformation-programme-to-accelerate-the-digital-transformation-of-the-financial-services-sector-en.pdf">Programme</a><a href="https://www.centralbank.ae/media/mdupathy/cbuae-launches-a-financial-infrastructure-transformation-programme-to-accelerate-the-digital-transformation-of-the-financial-services-sector-en.pdf"> (FIT)</a>. 



<p>The aim of this release is to aid the jurisdiction’s financial system thrive by enhancing its digital transformation, thus “enabling the CBUAE to be among the top central banks globally.”. In this respect 9 key initiatives have been considered:</p>



<p>1. Card Domestic Scheme: a card payment platform aiming to facilitate the growth of e-commerce and digital transactions.</p>



<p>2. eKYC: a platform that would facilitate the onboarding of customers and on-going monitoring.</p>



<p>3.<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/"> Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC):</a> a CBDC used for both cross-border and domestic payments would solve current issues with cross-border transactions and innovate UAE’s domestic payments system.</p>



<p>4. Open Finance: a system that would enhance the inter-connectivity and inter-operability</p>



<p>of financial players and institutions.</p>



<p>5. Supervisory Technology (SupTech): a system aiding the regulatory and supervisory processes.</p>



<p>6. Innovation Hub: a platform where<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/fintech/"> FinTech </a>services can collaborate, engage with each other, promote research and enhance their development.</p>



<p>7. Instant Payments Platform: a payment platform to steer the jurisdiction towards a cashless society.</p>



<p>8. Financial Cloud: aims at a sovereign financial infrastructure.</p>



<p>9. Excellence &amp; Customer Experience: improve customer experience</p>



<p>The jurisdiction aims at fully developing and implementing the FIT programme by 2026.</p>



 🇬🇧 FCA to take action against crypto ATM operators. 



<p>The<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/financial-conduct-authority-fca/"> Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) </a><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-takes-action-against-unregistered-crypto-atm-operators-leeds#:~:text=No%20crypto%20ATM%20operators%20currently,and%20disable%20illegal%20Crypto%20ATMs.">announced</a> on February 14 that no crypto ATM within the UK is registered with them.</p>



<p>An initial investigation was conducted by the Force Cyber Team at West Yorkshire Police resulting in issuing cease-and-desist letters to the identified ATM operators. The letter warned them that “any breach of regulations would result in an investigation under money-laundering regulations.”</p>



<p>All findings were shared with FCA who then stated that “Crypto ATM operators, in the UK must be registered with the FCA and comply with the UK Money Laundering Regulations”.</p>



<p>This information is not new, as on March 11, 2022, FCA <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/warning-illegal-crypto-atms-operating-uk">announced</a> that they have “[…] warned operators of crypto ATMs in the UK to shut their machines down or face enforcement action.”</p>



<p>Currently UK based crypto ATM operators are under scrutiny: “The FCA will review evidence gathered during these visits and consider further potential enforcement action.„</p>



<p>You check whether a UK based VASP is registered with the FCA <a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/s/">here</a>.</p>



 🇺🇸 SEC – regulatory 



<p>On February 14, the Senate Banking Committee held a 2-hour hearing named “Crypto Crash: Why Financial System Safeguards are Needed for Digital Assets”.</p>



<p>Its aim was to identify reasons for the crash of the crypto market and mitigation thereof. Speakers, such as Senator Tim Scot and Linda Jeng, chief global regulatory officer of Crypto Council for Innovation, targeted the SEC, calling them out for not taking preemptive measures to protect investors.</p>



<p>“The SEC has not initiated any formal rulemaking process to update securities laws that are decades old to account for the unique attributes of digital assets that are determined to be securities.”&nbsp; – Linda Jeng</p>



<p>“To think the SEC has failed to take any meaningful preemptive action to ensure this type of catastrophic failure does not happen again,” – Senator Tim Scott</p>



<p>In the same hearing, Senator Elizabeth Warren discussed the lack of regulation for decentralised platforms (DeFi and DAO) and the need to regulate them. The bill she proposed in December 2022 <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/digital-asset/">(Digital Asset </a>Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2022) was said to be brought forth once again for consideration, as it would require among other things, for financial market players to not use mixers; miners, validators and providers of un-hosted wallets to abide by AML law.</p>



<p>The Committee has publicized the video of the hearing and can be accessed <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/crypto-crash-why-financial-system-safeguards-are-needed-for-digital-assets">here</a>.</p>



<p></p>



 🇺🇸 SEC – enforcement action 



<p>On February 3rd, the SEC has sent Paxos, a Wells notice, as revealed by the entity in a <a href="https://paxos.com/2023/02/13/paxos-issues-statement/#:~:text=Paxos%20categorically%20disagrees%20with%20the,safety%20of%20its%20customers'%20assets.">February 13 statement</a>.</p>



<p>The SEC notice targets Paxos’ offering of BUSD (Binance USD – a 1:1 USD-backed Binance stablecoin “approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and issued in partnership with Paxos” as <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/busd">described</a> by Binance).</p>



<p>In the letter, the SEC claims that BUSD qualifies as a security under federal law, however Paxos failed to register it as such and intends to take legal action against the company.</p>



<p>The letter is not publicly available, however Paxos made the following statement on their website:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Paxos categorically disagrees with the SEC staff because BUSD is not a security under the federal securities laws. This SEC Wells notice pertains only to BUSD. To be clear, there are unequivocally no other allegations against Paxos. Paxos has always prioritized the safety of its customers’ assets. BUSD issued by Paxos is always backed 1:1 with<a href="https://paxos.com/busd-transparency/">&nbsp;US dollar-denominated reserves</a>, fully segregated and held in bankruptcy remote accounts. We will engage with the SEC staff on this issue and are prepared to vigorously litigate if necessary.„</p>

<p>Now that Holochain has reached its beta and is stable enough for developing serious hApps, it’s time to introduce the tools you’ll be using. This first article goes into Holonix, the dev environment that distributes those tools.</p> What is Holonix? <p>Holonix is our name for an environment that includes pretty much all the tools you need to write, test, and deploy a Holochain application. It’s not an IDE or text editor; it’s simply an ‘overlay’ on your existing Linux or UNIX shell (and that includes WSL2 for Windows) that makes the right versions of all the necessary command-line tools available and ready to use.</p><p>You’ve probably used this sort of thing before. It’s often called a ‘reproducible development environment’, and tools like Vagrant, Docker, Virtualbox, and Python’s virtualenv are commonly used to set these up and distribute them among developers who want to share a predictable toolset.</p><p>Holonix is built with <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Nix,</a> a package manager that can be installed in your existing OS. Instead of directly changing the state of your system, though, it can create an ‘overlay’ that you can enter and leave as needed. Anything you’ve already got installed, it will ‘shadow’ with its own version. This approach is much lighter than a VM and even somewhat lighter than a Docker container. But just like those other tools, outside of that environment, your familiar shell environment is preserved — just the way you like it.</p><p>You can even have a separate Nix environment for each hApp project you create, by putting a file called <code>flake.nix</code> in there with all the dependencies you need. It lets you target and work with different Holochain versions per project. You can think of this file as a <code>package.json</code> or <code>Cargo.toml</code> file — but for your entire shell and all its commands. You can check this file, along with the <code>flake.lock</code> file, into your Git repo to make sure you and other developers always have the right version of the Holochain dev tools when you’re working on the project.</p><p>One nice thing about Nix is that it lets your host environment ‘leak’ through into the new dev environment. Nix merely adds the things specified in your <code>.nix</code> file. So if your <code>PATH</code> environment variable points to the locations of all sorts of weird dev tools that you can’t live without, you’ve still got that inside Holonix.</p><p>So what does Holonix contain?</p>  The <code>holochain</code> conductor runtime itself  A dev tool called <code>hc</code> (I’ll talk about that in another article)  <code>hc scaffold</code> command to scaffold a new example or empty hApp  <code>hc launch</code> command to run the hApp in a Launcher window  <code>lair-keystore</code> command to run Holochain’s secret keystore  A specific version of Rust and Cargo  Specific versions of a few necessary libraries, like OpenSSL  <p>What doesn’t it contain?</p>  An editor or IDE — that means you can use your favourite one.  Node.js and NPM, which is used by the scaffolding tool and Tryorama test framework, so make sure you have a recent version installed. You can also configure Holonix to include Node.js and other tools for you; see below.  <p>And I want to stress once again that, if you already have Rust, Cargo, or even Holochain installed somewhere in your system, it doesn’t clobber those — it only points to its own versions when you’re in the Holonix shell.</p> How do I install Holonix? <p>First you need to install Nix on your system; it’s available for all three major workstation OSes. Then you load and apply the Holonix setup (called a ‘flake’). From zero to Holonix is not exactly a one-liner, but it is a three-liner and that ain’t so bad. (And we are working on a one-liner.) Go to the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/quick-start/?ref=blog.holochain.org">quick-start guide</a> and it’ll get you set up in a few minutes!</p><p>Now, once you’ve finished the quick-start install, you have a fully working environment. But every time you leave it and enter it again, it checks our <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain?ref=blog.holochain.org">GitHub repo</a> for the newest version, so your project code might get out of sync with the dev tools you get.</p><p>So you’ll likely want to create project-specific Nix setups that ‘pin’ the dev tools to a specific Holochain version. That’s easy; all you need to do is create a nix file in your project’s root directory — and in fact the scaffolding tool will do that for you. (That’ll be in my next article.)</p><p>There’s a page of <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install-advanced/?ref=blog.holochain.org">advanced setup tips</a> if you want to do something special, including keeping your preferred shell (I like <a href="https://fishshell.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">fish</a>, and I know others are fond of <a href="https://www.zsh.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Zsh</a>) and connecting your IDE to the Rust analyzer that comes with Holonix.</p><p>If you want to customise your project’s environment and share it with other developers, this guide also gives you an example of <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/get-building/install-advanced/?ref=blog.holochain.org#the-anatomy-of-a-flake.nix">how to do this with Node.JS</a>. Nix <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&amp;3B=&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">hosts</a> a lot of other packages that you can include too.</p> What if I don’t want to use Holonix? <p>That’s fine; the packages are all available from crates.io and npmjs.com. Setting that up is outside the scope of this article, but you can <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/get-building/install-without-nix/?ref=blog.holochain.org">read more</a> about it on the Developer Portal.</p> Next steps <p>Now that you’ve got Holonix running and have a decent idea of what it’s for, it’s time to build something. Stay tuned for another article, in which I walk through the scaffolding of an app I’ve always wanted to build.</p><p>If you need some installation help, go to the <a href="https://discord.gg/HhhxQkNUsr?ref=blog.holochain.org">Dev.HC Discord</a> and ask an admin to give you the ‘Developer’ badge. The door is always open and the welcome mat is broad, comfy, and well-trod-upon by beginners and experienced devs alike. We’ll see you there!</p>

 We sit down with Vivek Mishra, Senior Manager at Hana Bank to talk about the banking services most susceptible to financial crime, the increasing role of machine learning, and the impact of ‘the world’s largest biometric ID system’, Aadhaar on AML/KYC procedures in India. 



 



 What are some of the most common areas of weakness, or common failings, in a financial institution’s financial crime prevention strategy? 



<p>It is mandatory for financial institutions to implement an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> / <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/combating-financing-of-terrorism-cft/">Counter Terrorism Financing</a> program to detect and deter financial crime. However, many struggle to keep AML programs updated and fail to review them on a regular basis. I believe there are five major or critical common areas of weakness:</p>



  Regular review of regulatory changes: Financial crime regulation is very dynamic and keeps on changing as per the latest trends and scenarios. Many institutions fail to keep up with the latest regulatory changes, which can result in non-compliance and legal and reputational risks. It’s important for financial institutions to have a robust compliance management system in place that allows them to stay informed about the latest regulatory changes and ensure that their AML and CFT programs are up to date.<br>&nbsp;  



  Inadequate Customer Due Diligence: CDD is one of the most important tasks for financial institutions to undertake to identify and verify customers and understand the nature of the relationship. However, many institutions do not have adequate CDD procedures in place or conduct CDD on a regular basis.  



<blockquote><p>Financial institutions must have adequate technology to detect and prevent financial crime. This includes transaction monitoring systems, customer data management systems, and sanctions screening systems. Without appropriate technology, institutions will be unable to detect suspicious activity, which can be a significant compliance risk.&nbsp;</p>Vivek Mishra, Senior Manager at Hana Bank.</blockquote>



  Improper risk assessment: Risk assessment is one of the most critical tasks of every financial institution’s AML/CTF program. Although financial institutions must conduct a risk assessment of the money laundering and terrorist financing risks they face, many institutions do not have a proper understanding of the risks. This can lead to a failure to identify and mitigate risks, and to implement appropriate controls.<br>&nbsp;  



  Shortage or lack of training: Financial institutions are required to provide AML and CFT training for their employees, but many institutions fail to do so, or the training is inadequate. This can lead to employees not understanding their responsibilities and being unable to identify and report suspicious activity. Training is important and must be provided to every employee of a financial institution.   



 Are there any banking use cases that are considered more perilous, or susceptible to financial crime than others?&nbsp; 



<p>The below are banking use cases considered more susceptible to financial crime:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/nft-non-fungible-tokens-new-art-money-laundering/">Cryptocurrency/NFTs</a>: Cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital assets that can be used to facilitate financial transactions, so are particularly <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">susceptible to financial crime</a> because of their anonymity and lack of regulation, which makes it easier for criminals to launder money and finance terrorism. Of course, there have been many recent cases where regulators have cracked down on cryptocurrency organizations with inadequate controls.<br>&nbsp;  



  Private banking: Private banking is an extremely lucrative and competitive global industry. Private banking provides highly personalized and confidential products and services to wealthy clients. They are susceptible to financial crime because of the availability of limited customer information compared to retail banking clients.&nbsp; Private banking services may also be subject to less regulatory oversight than retail banking services, which can make it easier for criminals to launder money through these services. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Remittance and money transfer services: As remittance and money transfer services are often used by criminals to move money across borders, they can be particularly susceptible to money laundering and terrorist financing because of the lack of transparency in transactions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Correspondent/Nested Banking: This type of banking can be particularly susceptible to financial crime because the correspondent bank may not have the same level of information about the respondent bank’s customers as it would for its own customers.&nbsp;

 What role does technology (and especially machine learning) play in combatting financial crime? Are there any innovative uses of technology that Hana Bank is using/ looking to use in the coming years?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In my opinion, machine learning can be used in various ways to combat financial crime like:&nbsp;</p>



  Transaction monitoring: Technology plays a critical role in analyzing the amounts of transaction data to detect suspicious activity and identify potential money laundering or terrorist financing. Almost every financial institution and nonbanking financial institution is using some kind of technology to analyze transactions, such as unusual transaction amounts, frequency, and location, to identify potentially suspicious activity.&nbsp;<br>  Fraud detection: Machine learning can be used to detect fraudulent activity by analyzing transaction data and identifying patterns or anomalies that indicate fraud.&nbsp;<br>  CDD &amp; Risk Assessment: Machine learning can be used to assess the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing by analyzing large amounts of data, such as customer demographics and transaction history to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate high-risk activity. Machine learning can also assist in compliance and risk management by identifying potential compliance breaches and helping to prioritize risk management activities.&nbsp;<br>  Sanctions screening: Before a financial organization starts doing business with a new customer or engages in certain transactions (e.g., international wire payments), it should review the various country sanctions program requirements, as well as published lists of known or suspected terrorists, narcotics traffickers, and other criminals, for potential matches. Machine learning can be used to screen customers and transactions against sanctions lists to identify individuals or entities that are prohibited from conducting financial transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>It’s important to note that machine learning is not a silver bullet; the quality of the model and the data from which it learns is crucial for its performance. Additionally, machine learning models must be tested, monitored and maintained to ensure they are functioning as intended and are not producing biased or inaccurate results.&nbsp;</p>



 Are there any new or different fraud signals that you would like to see incorporated in the future of traditional identity verification providers’ tools?&nbsp; 



<p>I’d like to see organizations use artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent fraud signals in real time. A more advanced system should be capable of continuously updating and adapting to new fraud patterns, as well as cross-referencing multiple sources of data to verify a user’s identity. In addition, I would like to see the integration of biometric authentication methods, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning, to provide a more secure and efficient verification process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Location-based verification could also be used to identify fraud by analysing an individual’s location, such as their IP address, GPS coordinates, and Wi-Fi signal, to confirm their identity.</p>Vivek Mishra, Senior Manager at Hana Bank</blockquote>



<p>These are just some examples of new or different fraud signals that could be incorporated into identity verification providers’ tools in the future. It’s important to note that new or different fraud signals should be carefully evaluated for their effectiveness and compliance with regulations before being incorporated and implemented into existing technology.&nbsp;</p>



 Do you think a one stop shop platform-based approach is of importance to financial institutions when choosing AML/KYC or identity verification providers?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>A one stop shop platform-based approach can be important for financial institutions when choosing AML/KYC or identity verification providers because it allows them to access multiple services through a single interface, which can simplify the process of onboarding new customers and monitoring existing ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, a one stop shop platform can also offer a more comprehensive solution that integrates various compliance checks, such as identity verification, fraud detection, and sanctions screening, which can help financial institutions more effectively mitigate risks and comply with regulations. There are several advantages of choosing a one stop shop platform-based approach, such as improved data quality, cost effectiveness, and enhanced risk management etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s important to note that a one stop shop platform approach should not be the only criteria to consider when choosing providers. Financial institutions should also evaluate the provider’s reputation, reliability, and compliance with regulations, as well as their ability to meet the specific needs of the financial institution. Additionally, a one-stop shop platform should be regularly monitored and updated to ensure it remains compliant with regulations and the latest best practices in AML/KYC and identity verification.&nbsp;</p>



 The KYC stage is often seen as the box-ticking part of the onboarding process. For organizations that have this opinion, what are they missing out on?&nbsp; 



<p>Organizations that think the KYC stage is a box-ticking part of the onboarding process are likely missing out on several key benefits like:&nbsp;</p>



  Risk management: By only completing the minimum requirements for KYC, organizations may miss important information that could help to identify and manage these risks.&nbsp;<br>  Fraud prevention: Organizations may miss important information that could help prevent fraud.&nbsp;<br>  Reputation: The KYC stage is an opportunity for organizations to build trust and establish a positive reputation with their customers. By only completing the minimum requirements for KYC, organizations may miss the opportunity to build a stronger relationship with their customers.&nbsp;<br>  Data quality: A thorough KYC process can provide a more efficient onboarding process and improve the customer experience by reducing the number of times a customer is required to provide the same information.&nbsp;  



<p>The KYC stage is not just a box-ticking exercise, but a critical part of the onboarding process that can help to prevent financial crime, improve compliance, and establish a positive reputation with customers. Organizations should implement a robust and thorough KYC process that meets the regulatory requirements and is tailored to the specific risks and needs of the organization.&nbsp;</p>



 Terrorist financing appears to be becoming an increasingly prevalent problem in financial services. Are there any specific signals, or behaviors that an organization should be mindful of? Are there certain preventative steps they can take to better protect themselves against instances of terrorist financing?&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">Terrorist financing </a>is a serious problem in financial services and organizations should be mindful of specific signals or behaviors that may indicate terrorist financing. These can include transactions to-from high-risk jurisdiction, charitable donations, using front companies for cash transactions, transactions through virtual-currencies or prepaid cards etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Preventive steps include:&nbsp;</p>



  Developing a robust compliance program&nbsp;  Enhanced transaction monitoring&nbsp;  Conduct Enhanced Due Diligence on high-risk customers&nbsp;  Conduct risk-based monitoring&nbsp;  Implement Know Your Customer policies&nbsp;  Information sharing&nbsp;  



<p>As the prevention of terrorist financing is a continuous process, organizations should regularly review and update their AML/CFT compliance programs to ensure they remain effective and compliant with regulations.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



 What impact has the recent Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) scam had on the reputation of the Indian banking system? How do regulations regarding KYC and AML in India fare against other nations?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The recent <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/business/what-is-dhfl-scam-india-s-biggest-ever-bank-loan-fraud-all-you-need-to-know-about-rs-34-000-crore-dhfl-scam-news-204346">DHFL scam</a> has raised concerns about the overall integrity of the Indian banking system and the effectiveness of regulations in preventing financial crimes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulations regarding KYC and AML in India are governed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>KYC and AML regulations in India are considered to be comprehensive and in line with international standards. The Indian government has also taken steps to strengthen regulations in recent years, such as the implementation of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in 2002 and the introduction of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations in 2012.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the effectiveness of the regulations in preventing financial crimes has been called into question by the DHFL scam, and other recent fraud cases. It has been reported that the regulators failed to detect and prevent the fraud and money laundering activities in DHFL and several other scams. This has led to calls for stricter enforcement of regulations and greater oversight of the financial sector.&nbsp;</p>



 Has the world’s largest biometric ID system, Aadhaar, had a positive or negative impact on AML/KYC procedures; improved effectiveness of KYC processes and decreased financial fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>It has had a great impact on AML/KYC procedures in India. The Aadhaar card, which is issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India, serves as a government-validated proof of identity and address for individuals in India. This has made the KYC process more efficient and effective as it eliminates the need for multiple forms of identification and allows for the easy verification of customer information. It also helps in reducing financial fraud by providing a secure and tamper-proof way to store and transmit identification information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of biometric authentication in Aadhaar has also made it more difficult for criminals to impersonate others. However, as it is not mandatory for financial institutions to use Aadhaar-based eKYC, this can lead to variation in the quality and effectiveness of the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Welcome to our series on unexpected Google Workspace admins. Like many of you who have built startups, I expected to do the things I’ve done before and many things that were new. I expected to be a product manager, technical contributor, writer, and in charge of finance and HR. I also expected to be a janitor, but I did not expect to be a Google Workspace admin!</p>

<p>As I’ve discovered, my story is not entirely unusual. Lots of other founders have become unexpected admins. In this series, I’ll interview them and let each tell us what happened, what they learned, and what they’d recommend to new founders.</p>

<p>Our first unexpected admin is Sunil Dhaliwal, YeshID’s lead investor through his company Amplify Partners. Sunil and I were chatting on the phone about a month ago and he started telling me about how HE was a Google admin back when starting a company. His stories were funny, familiar, and helpful. So we wanted to make it the first in our series.</p>

<p>Tell me about your role and your company.</p>
<p>I am the founder and general partner of Amplify Partners. We are a venture capital firm that invests in early-stage startups working in the technology sector, with a focus on companies that are leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other advanced technologies to build innovative solutions in developer tools, computing infrastructure, and cybersecurity. We have 22 employees.</p>

<p>How and when did you become the Google Workspace administrator? </p>
<p>Ok, it is story time, isn’t it? When I started Amplify, I was using my personal Gmail address. One of my good friends said to me, “That's low rent. You're going to go out and raise money for a fund. You’d better get a domain.” So, I upgraded and bought a domain. I went with Google because I was familiar with it and it was easy enough to set up on my own. It was G Suite at the time. And from that moment, I was the Google super admin. I didn’t even know what that meant. But it doesn’t really matter when you are employee #1. I was happy I had an email that worked. </p>

<p>Then I hired my first employee. From the moment that happened, I was like “wait - what the hell is this thing that I’ve got to set up?” So, in addition to starting a business, investing money, managing a portfolio of companies, and trying to raise my own capital, I had to play Google admin.</p>

<p>How long did you hold this role?</p>
<p>Embarrassingly, it was probably five years. In that time, we went from 1 person to 10 people. But once you're at 10 people, you have over 20 email aliases.</p>

<p>Early on, the only thing I needed to do was provisioning. People came and went so infrequently that it wasn't a big deal. But over time we reached a point where I looked in Google Workspace and I was like, “Who are all these email addresses and what are all these applications?” At that point I realized, we need a centralized IT/security function.  I should not have still been running IT in any way, shape, or form.</p>

<p>What is the strangest thing you encountered using Google Workspace? Or funny mishaps you want to share?</p>
<p>A major part of our job is to meet tech companies that are developing interesting tools. And of course, we want to try them out. Often these apps and services ask for permission to access Google. </p>

<p>I did not want to be in the business of governing the IT habits of a small handful of employees. I trusted our team to be smart, use discretion, and stay on top of what applications were connecting into our G Suite. I didn’t require any admin approvals. I just let them go off and do what they needed to do.</p>

<p>I remember the day I logged in to Google Workspace and saw 35 apps that I had never heard of that all had access to our systems. Many of these companies weren't even in existence anymore. Immediately I was on the phone with my team saying, “I am disconnecting this thing,” and “do we need this anymore?” I got us down to 5 applications.</p>

<p>Did you ever find active accounts for users that did not exist or had left the company?</p>
<p>Definitely. I have had those moments where I’ve wondered, “Who is that person?” </p>

<p>And we are a small company!</p>

<p>Inevitably, someone would remind me – remember they were contracting for a while, or they helped us with an event, or they were an intern who worked for us for a summer. Our Google Workspace became this little time capsule of people who had come and gone at Amplify. </p>

<p>I still log into Google Workspace maybe once every 6 months and am still like, “Why does this email exist?” So I have to ask the IT folks to go through and clean up. In the past 2 years, we put a process in place where we have a person responsible for offboarding accounts when needed. </p>

<p>How do you think about security at your company?</p>
<p>We are a very asset-light company. We don’t store data locally. We use a handful of business apps that are all cloud-based. We don’t build or run a large number of IT applications.  We’re a collection of identities and cloud accounts that contain data. </p>

<p>We are 100% focused on identity. It is our number #1 entry point. Like many other cloud-first companies, I care more about identity &amp; credentials than device compromise or intrusion. That is the core of what we think about.</p>

<p>What is one thing you wish you had set up / known earlier in your career as an Unexpected Google Workspace admin?</p>
<p>Don’t be in the business of administering IT if you are running a company. It isn’t a good use of your time. If you are getting dragged into these details as a founder, it will eventually be a problem. </p>

<p>Turn on 2-factor auth for everything. It's just good hygiene. Make it required. Don’t ask for your employee’s opinions about it, and ignore how much they howl about it. If you train them, they will use it.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has sparked a cryptocurrency revolution, inspiring<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>technology enthusiasts. In recent years, it has been surpassed by various exciting developments and applications. Recently, a new type of NFT based on Bitcoin and its ability to decorate individual parts of a bitcoin block have emerged – Bitcoin NFTs called Ordinals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What are Bitcoin Ordinals&nbsp; 



<p>Ordinals Inscriptions are digital assets similar to NFTs, such as images, games and other digital content inscribed on smallest units of Bitcoin&nbsp; Satoshis. To create Ordinals, users must download Bitcoin Core and sync the node to the blockchain. Upon completion of the sync, a wallet for Ordinals is created and some satoshis sent to it. The <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/26482871f33f1051f450f2da9af275794c0b5f1c61ebf35e4467fb42c2813403i0">first</a> of these appeared in December 2022 (2022-12-17 04:49:30 UTC) with an exponential increase in interest since then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The introduction of Ordinals has brought about a lot of changes related to Bitcoin transactions. It also allows for more varied use cases due to its capacity to represent digital assets like artworks or music collections via tokens recorded on the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



 The impact of Ordinals on block size&nbsp; 



<p>The introduction of Ordinals has had a pronounced impact on the size of Bitcoin blocks. In February, the average block size increased to 3.46MB, more than 80% higher than it was from October 2022 to January 2023. The top block mined was a size of 3.95MB. This is due to decorative elements such as colours being added or enriched when creating an Ordinal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The chart below illustrates the fluctuation in average block size over the last 150 days. It clearly shows that there has been significant growth in block size since the introduction of Ordinals. The data suggests that this trend will likely continue in the future as more features are incorporated into Bitcoin transactions using these enhanced signatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The impact of Ordinals on bitcoin transactions&nbsp; 



<p>The popularisation of Ordinals has also affected transaction numbers, with the average number of transactions per block declining recently since February 2023. Alongside this downward trend, there is a visible increase in transaction size, with the average number being more than 2x higher in February compared to the previous 150 days. Although this trend is promising for Bitcoin users, it remains to be seen how it will affect overall transaction costs and speed in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ordinals have had a considerable impact on Bitcoin’s transaction sizes and rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Impact of Ordinals on transaction fees&nbsp; 



<p>The growing interest in Ordinals and the impact on block size and transaction volume has a real impact on the average<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/transaction-fee/"> Transaction Fee.</a> In February of 2021, its value was 20% higher than it had been during the previous 150 days. When adjusting this figure for volatility due to market fluctuations in November – when FTX’s collapse saw a spike in both transactions and their associated fees – that number jumps significantly to over 40%. This is largely attributed to a rise in transactions size and decrease in transactions number per block.&nbsp;</p>



 Will the Ordinals stay 



<p>It is difficult to judge whether Ordinals are another passing fad or something that will stay with us in the market longer. What is certain is that now and in the near future BTC transactions will become more expensive but on the other side more transaction fees go to miners who secure the network. Ordinals will have an impact on the economics of BTC. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In this vlog, 1Kosmos CMO, Michael Cichon, is joined by 1Kosmos Chief Strategy Officer, Mike Engle, to discuss how to deliver the privacy, security and convenience people have come to expect online.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Oh, hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, Chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos. I’ve invited Mike Engle, our Chief Strategy Officer, Co-founder here today to talk a bit about customer authentication and onboarding. Slightly different than what we see on the workforce side, but sometimes the two get conflated as if the users are one and the same. Mike, can you talk a little bit about the differences on the customer side versus, for example, passwordless authentication for the workforce?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, there’s really one big difference. You can, for the most part, make your employees do something in order to keep your company safe. For example, you have to connect to your remote systems and log into your workstation. You can just give them all the tools and say, “If you don’t use these tools, you’re not coming to work.” But with customers, it’s much different. Customers have choice. They can go to bank one, bank two, or whatever site it is, and so you have to treat them very nice and almost entice them to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So on the customer side, there’s a little bit stronger of a business need to balance the convenience, the user experience with this need to manage fraud and keep fraud in a small box.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right. On the employee side, there’s very little acceptable risk. For example, it’s not okay if 10 people log into my infrastructure that aren’t who they say they are. Just not okay, not one. On the customer side, a lot of organizations have an acceptable level of fraud, and the reason they do that is because there’s this dial between how much friction you put in versus how much fraud you allow. You could turn the friction up all the way and make them authenticate every five seconds or do all kinds of things, and then you’ll have no fraud, but you won’t have any customers either. So that’s where there’s a little yin and yang going on there.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Right. I totally get it. So the very first touchpoint that a customer has with a digital business, it’s the onboarding process, or arguably one of the first. So what are you seeing out in the field as far as organizations addressing or modernizing their new account origination process?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, I’ll put them into two buckets. One is in either highly secure or highly regulated environments. So that’s banking where you have anti-terrorism laws, know your customer type rules that have to be followed. Then there’s just general e-commerce websites. So you’re going to sign up for a new shopping account. They do not have a requirement to really prove who you are. They just want to transact business, collect money, and really hope that it’s the right person and get paid. And so for the KYC, right, say banking, crypto or government resources, healthcare, where you really need to know who it is, that’s where you introduce some of the modern mechanisms where you can prove that this is the person remotely doing things like document verification, identity verification, et cetera.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So how do you do this and still deliver an avant brand experience? I mean, as a marketing person, certainly you want to be regarded as a contemporary brand, not one that’s out of step with the times. So talk about the brand experience. How do you this? You combat things like synthetic identity. I realize some businesses aren’t required to deal with that, but who wants to do business with a fake person or a fake identity? So how do you modernize the brand experience and still manage the impersonation issues?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Well, it’s using modern tools. So the way that we’ve opened accounts for 10, 20, 30 years really is type your data in, ask some questions maybe, and then try to verify it either now or later. The data that’s been used there is all been stolen, leaked on the dark web, et cetera. That’s your credit file data. What’s the first car you purchased or did you ever own property at this address? Unfortunately, that’s still the standard here in the US for most financial institutions, but they’re all trying to figure out how to se modern tools. And those modern tools are scanning your driver’s license or tapping into an existing identity that’s trusted. This driver’s license is pretty trusted. Can there be fakes? Of course. But the bar becomes much higher when you’re inspecting something that has some real providence.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. All right. So my driver’s license goes in my wallet and online you’re collecting this information and some businesses are providing now digital wallets, correct?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
They are, yes. We’re seeing the war of the wallets right now starting to slosh around. That’s right.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So what makes a good digital wallet from a bad digital wallet, if there is such a thing?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, no, the standards are, they’re out there, but there’s just so many people adopting either parts of the standard or there’s a couple different standards out there. So there’s services that will tie wallets together. For example, something called WalletConnect, and you have different security models and you need to also be able to address, but what if I don’t have a phone or an app? So we’ve handled all of these edge cases, and that’s really important is that you have the breadth of tools at your disposal to proof who somebody is, right? The big word now is inclusion for banking, for identity verification and all these things. So how do you include the most people into this program? And then flexibility. So again, I don’t have an app or some other thing that you provide alternate mechanisms and that’s maturing really quickly.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. All right. So we talked about combating identity fraud on the front end, but you also have identity impersonation after the account’s created with account takeover. Those attacks are rampant on consumers these days. So are there some wallets that are better at combating ATO than others?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Not really. The wallets aren’t really involved in this much yet here in the US In some other countries, there’s either government sponsored or maybe bank sponsored wallets, Singapore, South Korea, a couple in the Nordic regions, where the wallet really is trusted. And you can reach out remotely and say, “Let me see your credential.” Can you do your biometrics? And it’s very trusted. So in the meantime, we can leverage a couple things. For example, a friend of mine got a call with a Zelle scam yesterday, and it’s amazing what they’re doing. So they will send you a Zelle message. So your phone number, Michael, I can find that right now. I can send you a Zelle message that says $2,500 requested, and then I call you pretending to be the bank, right? Pretty convincing. All I need you to do is go in there, press 1, 2, 3, and you’re sending me money.</p>
<p>It’s kind of the ole switch-a-roo trick.so how could you mitigate that? Well, imagine if I had to look into a camera and verify who I am before I try to perpetrate this fraud. There’s no way that I’m giving my face to the bank, but that would stop it dead in its tracks. So these are some of the tools. Or maybe ask me to verify my identity by scanning my Pennsylvania driver’s license, right? There’s ways that you can up the level of trust inside of the network and even between multiple parties.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. All right. Well, when you start to take, again, this information, this personal information, we’re all familiar with the GDPR rules or the right to be forgotten rules. It would seem to me that as you acquire this information about customers, you have to start seeing after privacy and control. Using the physical wallet as a metaphor, my wallet’s certainly private. It’s under my control to the best of my ability. How is this managed online?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Very much the same way. So think about your wallet being in your possession. The way we do that digitally is with cryptography. So what I do is I will give you your own encryption key and think about that as your digital wallet. As long as you have that key and nobody else does, you’re in control of the assets inside of that wallet, your driver’s license data, your biometrics, et cetera. So modern cryptography, public, private, key pair technology is really the enabler here and what is going to allow us to interact. It’s what’s behind decentralized finance as well, like Web3 type stuff.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay, great. Well, listen, I think that’s about all the time we set aside for this morning. We do have the webinar coming up, folks seeing this before the webinar. It’s on February 23rd at 1:00 PM Eastern Time, 10:00 AM Pacific time. It’s called The Five Ways to Modernize Customer Onboarding and Defeat Account Takeover. After that February 23rd, that webinar will be on demand available on our website. So Mike, thanks very much for your time today. Appreciate your sharing your expertise.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
My pleasure. Talk soon.</p>

<p>The last few years have seen significant moves by the EU, and other global governments to mandate the widespread implementation of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital identity wallets</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As this process has increased its momentum, IDnow is proud to have been invited to become a founding member of the <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">OpenWallet Foundation</a> (OWF). OWF, which is a section of the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>, the global authority on open-source software, has been tasked to create the baseline features and underlying philosophy of digital identity systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The OWF’s mission is to develop an open-source engine, which enables secure, privacy-protecting and interoperable multi-purpose wallets that anyone can use to build digital identity solutions. This collaboration between global technology, finance and university leaders will serve a wide range of wallet use cases (making payments, proving identity, and storing validated credentials), which in turn will enable a trusted digital future for all.&nbsp;</p>



 Pursuing open-source and transparent solutions.&nbsp; 



<p>Many governments favor open-source and transparent solutions because in this setup all software code is made public and is considered more secure due to constant public review, without potential proprietary back doors that could erode trust amongst users. In addition, open-source technology fosters interoperability between services, which is more important than ever in a connected global economy and especially in the context of digital identity. Open-source projects, such as the OpenWallet Foundation, hence, serve as a great model for infrastructure that is vital for digital societies and benefits all parties. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For a decade, IDnow has been committed to making the connected world a safer place. Joining the OWF as one of its founding members upholds that pledge by supporting an initiative with a shared dedication to open-source technology. As a European leader in identity proofing technology that serves customers in highly regulated spheres, we have also taken steps to become a leader in regulation and standards advocacy, for example, as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-supports-european-digital-identity-ecosystem/">active members in the IDunion</a>, members of organizations like <a href="https://trustoverip.org/why-toip/overview/">TrustoverIP</a> (hosted by the Linux Foundation), <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-among-first-etsi-ts-119-461-certification/">heading up task forces at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)</a>. &nbsp;</p>



 “Digital identity knows no borders”.&nbsp; 



<p>Armin Bauer, Co-Founder and Managing Director Technology at IDnow, comments on IDnow joining the OWF: “It is a pleasure for IDnow to be a founding member of the OpenWallet Foundation. In our opinion, digital identity knows no borders, and therefore requires interoperability in the form of international open-source standards to reach mass adoption. Together with the OpenWallet Foundation and many great peer organizations, we will create a system that best serves and protects society on a path to true digital identity. We are looking forward to contributing our technological and practical experience that we have gained from more than 30 million verified identities per year.”</p>
