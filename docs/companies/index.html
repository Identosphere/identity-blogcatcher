  <p>In an era where cyber threats are constant, organizations must prepare not for if a breach will happen but when. The urgency to identify, address, and bounce back from security incidents has never been greater. Privileged Access Management (PAM) plays a vital role in bolstering defenses and streamlining responses to these incidents. However, many organizations still struggle to unlock its full benefits, leaving critical vulnerabilities exposed.</p>
<p>Modern PAM solutions offer a range of capabilities that extend far beyond traditional access control. By integrating PAM into incident response strategies, organizations can significantly improve their ability to identify threats, contain breaches, and streamline recovery processes. Join us as we explore how PAM can be leveraged to transform human risk into human assets, providing full visibility and control over internal risks.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look at the state of PAM and compare common versus emerging capability areas. He will discuss to which extent these capabilities can support not only protective requirements but support in the analysis of incidents and thus streamline incident reporting.</p>
<p>Aleksandr Dymov, Product Manager at Syteca, will showcase the Syteca platform, a comprehensive cybersecurity solution designed to meet the diverse needs of modern organizations. He will present a case study and provide a live demo, illustrating how Syteca's customizable security toolkit enables granular PAM and advanced user activity monitoring to secure organizations against insider threats.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pam-your-secret-weapon"></a>

				  Our success in developing OpenID for Verifiable Credentials is paving the way for new use cases and quicker adoption.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Gareau</p>
<p>Our mission at Indicio is to make decentralized identity accessible and practical for real-world adoption. A key to this is our active involvement in developing and supporting OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VC) and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP). Part of the emerging <a href="https://www.european-digital-identity-regulation.com/">European eIDAS 2.0 identity standards</a>, these protocols specify how Verifiable Credentials can be used, building on OpenID Connect (OIDC), a widely used framework for authenticating user access to applications and websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OID4VC</a>: Streamlines the issuance of Verifiable Credentials using familiar web technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html">OID4VP</a>: Facilitates the presentation of these credentials, ensuring interoperability with existing OpenID-based systems.</p>
<p>These protocols make the transition to decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials easy for many organizations, as they are familiar with the underlying authentication technology and don’t have to replace their identity and access management systems. This means companies and organizations can quickly implement seamless operations and services that deliver immediate value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Gartner Research notes in its <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5560195">2024 Market Guide to Decentralized Identity</a>, the technology “represents magnitudes of improvement in terms of efficiency, cost and assurance” for authentication, account security, fraud, privacy, and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio’s OID4VC in action</p>
<p>An example of Indicio’s work with these protocols is the<a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/"> IATA One ID Proof of Concept (POC)</a>. This was developed with our strategic partner SITA, along with Delta Airlines and the Government of Aruba, and showcased at the joint<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/events/all/wfs--wps/"> IATA World Financial Symposium (WFS) and IATA World Passenger Symposium (WPS) </a>in October 2024.</p>
<p>The POC showed how two different Verifiable Credentials, a <a href="https://www.icao.int/Meetings/TRIP-Symposium-2021/PublishingImages/Pages/Presentations/Digital%20Travel%20Credential%20%28DTC%29%20Policy%20and%20Guiding%20Principles.pdf">Digital Travel Credential</a> using the DIDComm protocol and a <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/one-id/">One ID</a> credential using OID4VC, can work seamlessly together to facilitate seamless check in, baggage management, lounge access, and international border crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POC showed just how easy it is for a person to enroll in both at the same time with a passport and mobile phone, and then use them for instant, seamless authentication through each step of the passenger journey from home to destination. This was the first ever One ID implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see <a href="https://youtu.be/StRH7uOqxQA?feature=shared">a demonstration</a> from a recent <a href="https://indicio.tech/how-decentralized-digital-identity-is-creating-simpler-more-streamlined-air-travel/">meeting of the Indicio Identity Community Meetup</a>.</p>
<p>At Indicio, we see the future as a multi-credential, protocol, and standard world, and our goal is to provide the best implementation of each to meet our customer needs and to ensure that all work together so that our customers can seize every opportunity.</p>
<p>Our success in implementing&nbsp; OID4VC and in combining and bridging different credentials and protocols has made Indicio a trusted partner for global organizations looking to implement cutting-edge identity solutions.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to explore how OID4VC can revolutionize your identity ecosystem, or to explore our solutions in education, finance, health, agriculture, the public sector, and travel and tourism, we’re here to help you every step of the way. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Reach out to Indicio today!</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> A&nbsp;Game-Changer in Data Backup and&nbsp;Cyber Resilience&nbsp; 
<p>On December 10th, 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cohesity.com/press/cohesity-becomes-worlds-largest-data-protection-provider-after-completing-combination-with-veritas-enterprise-data-protection-business/">Cohesity and Veritas&nbsp;announced</a>&nbsp;that they have finalized their union. This is a major development as it will create the largest player in the rapidly growing market for cyber resilience and data protection. Data is not only fundamental to all organizations’ business processes but now also defines the very infrastructure upon which these processes depend.&nbsp; Cyber-attacks and ransomware are an existential threat to this data and data protection solutions are essential for cyber resilience.&nbsp; This union represents a pivotal moment in the worldwide marketplace for these solutions.&nbsp;</p>
 Why This Merger is Important&nbsp; 
<p>Digitalization of business processes has increased the potential impact of cyber threats.&nbsp; This, taken together with increased regulation on cyber resilience, makes the market for these solutions strong. Based on our current research the Cloud Backup market size was last estimated at over $5.75B with an annual growth rate of 18.7%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The merger of Cohesity and Veritas underscores the importance of dependable, scalable, and innovative data protection solutions for cyber resilience. Both these vendors are recognized as leaders in our recent Leadership Compass report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80868/cloud-backup-for-ai-enabled-cyber-resilience">Cloud Backup for AI Enabled Cyber Resilience</a>&nbsp;with each bringing their own complementary strengths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Complementary Strengths&nbsp; 
<p>Cohesity brings its modern, cloud-native approach to data management and Veritas brings its long-standing expertise in enterprise-grade data protection. By combining their strengths, the new entity is well placed to address the full spectrum of data protection and cyber resilience needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cohesity offers the Cohesity Data Cloud (CDC), built on SpanFS, an immutable filesystem ensuring data integrity and security plus instant file serving of backed-up NAS data, and using SnapTree chain-free metadata such that essentially each point-in-time backup can be accessed as rapidly and efficiently as if it had been originally made via a full backup.  Veritas products include Veritas Alta™ Data Protection, NetBackup – an enterprise backup and recovery solution, and Backup Exec - designed for backup and recovery for small to mid-sized businesses. Together these combine modern architecture with a wide range of capabilities and coverage.&nbsp;</p>
 The Importance of&nbsp;ML and&nbsp;GenAI&nbsp; 
<p>An important market trend is the evolution of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in particular generative AI (GenAI).&nbsp; ML and GenAI provide capabilities that can be helpful to enhance cyber resilience, and we expect cyber resilience solutions to exploit these technologies where appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both vendors have recognized the importance of ML and GenAI both in terms of the opportunities they provide as well as the data protection needs, they introduce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Veritas uses GenAI/ML with the AI-powered Operational Assistant, Veritas Alta™ Copilot. Alta Copilot brings the power of GenAI to Alta View, making it more intuitive and accessible for all users to detect suspicious activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cohesity’s AI framework, including the patent-pending Cohesity Gaia, leverages GenAI throughout the platform to offer operational insights, anomaly detection, information insights, and predictive analytics. Gaia enables users to search based on meaning rather than search based on characters, and converse with their data using natural language. The platform also includes AI-driven data classification and threat detection, utilizing machine learning to enhance security and compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our view, in future an organization should be able to give a GenAI based backup and disaster recovery solution a set of resilience objectives, compliance requirements and cost constraints for the system to build, evaluate, and implement the technology elements and support the manual processes needed to meet these.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Impact on Customers&nbsp; 
<p>Not all marriages last and customers may be anxious about what this union may mean for them.&nbsp; Both companies recognized that it is easier to lose customers than to gain them. In February 2024, when they&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cohesity.com/press/cohesity-and-veritas-data-protection-business-to-combine-forming-a-new-leader-in-ai-powered-data-security-and-management/">announced</a> their intention to combine, the announcement included a “no customer left behind” <a href="https://www.cohesity.com/product-roadmap-strategy/">product roadmap</a> in which “...all products will be supported for many years. Customers can migrate when and if they want, on their own schedule.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what we expect the new entity to provide:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transitional Arrangements&nbsp;– to ensure that all capabilities from the existing products remain available with the opportunity to mix and match between the two product ranges.&nbsp; No enforced customer migration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced Capabilities:&nbsp;a unified portfolio that combines the best of both companies' technologies. These will likely be based around the Cohesity Data Cloud (CDC), to provide a unified interface and exploit the wide range of data connectors from Veritas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Global Reach and Support:&nbsp;With their combined resources, the new entity will be better positioned to provide support and expertise across regions and industries. This is particularly important for enterprises operating in highly regulated sectors such as healthcare, finance, and government.&nbsp;</p>
 Technology Advances to Watch For&nbsp; 
<p>The Cohesity-Veritas merger is not just a consolidation of market share but a bold move to accelerate technological advancements in data backup and recovery. Key innovations we anticipate include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI and Machine Learning for Data Resilience:&nbsp;Leveraging Cohesity’s AI-driven analytics and Veritas’s deep integration capabilities, the new entity is likely to push the boundaries of predictive and autonomous data recovery. This could minimize downtime and enhance ransomware recovery strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seamless Multi-Cloud Integration:&nbsp;As businesses increasingly adopt hybrid and multi-cloud environments, the combined expertise of Cohesity and Veritas will result in more robust and seamless cloud-native solutions, protecting data and data defined infrastructure in a common way across diverse environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comprehensive Data Governance and Compliance:&nbsp;With increasing regulations on data protection and cyber resilience worldwide, the union offers an opportunity to deliver solutions to help organizations to meet and exceed their regulatory obligations.&nbsp;</p>
 Our Opinion&nbsp; 
<p>The union of Cohesity and Veritas is a transformative moment for the data protection and cyber resilience market. As the largest player in the market, the combined company has the power to set new standards, influence industry trends, and drive the next wave of innovation. For customers, this means access to unparalleled technology and expertise, though the path forward may ultimately require customers to adapt and align with new offerings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As dust settles on this announcement, one thing is clear: the data protection and cyber resilience market has forever changed, and we are just beginning to understand the full impact of this historic combination.&nbsp; Stay tuned and book now for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2025">EIC</a>&nbsp;in May 2025 to hear the latest news.&nbsp;</p>

             December 2024   
	 
		 
			 Bitcoin Hits $100K: The Tokenization Tipping Point? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Last week, Bitcoin hits $100k!</p>
<p>This milestone, fueled by institutional adoption and a promising regulatory shift under new SEC Chair Paul Atkins, sets the stage for a transformative 2025 in onchain finance and tokenization. It is clear that institutional capital is going onchain, it is crucial to start bringing assets onchain now. The tokenization trend is inevitable.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>But to reach that tipping point, we must overcome a few critical challenges.</p>
 Challenge 1: Lack of Actionable Data 
<p><br>
The Problem:<br>
Private assets often lack actionable data that allow all ecosystems to easily read the data of the tokens, such as Net Asset Value (NAV). Without this, other applications like data aggregators, distributors, and other service providers, can not provide accurate data to their audience.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
ERC-3643 is designed to solve this. With its built-in AssetID smart contracts, tokenized assets gain a unique onchain identity. Asset data (Asset type, NAV, ISIN, LEI, ESG ratings…) can be verified and directly linked to AssetID. This allows the ecosystem service providers to access verified asset information.</p>
 Challenge 2: Limited Accessibility 
<p><br>
The Problem:<br>
Despite the promise of tokenized RWAs, they remain out of reach for most investors. Take BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, as an example. Its $454 million market cap in Ethereum is held by just 23 investors, with 40% owned by a single Web3 company. High minimum investments exclude smaller investors from participating. Many institutions are still hesitating to open their onchain products to retail investors. They are afraid of losing control and fail to enforce compliance.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
The ERC-3643 token standard enables issuers to tokenize more accessible financial products while maintaining full control and automated compliance. ERC-3643 tokens are permissioned tokens. They ensure issuers decide who can participate, and under what conditions, and even allow for token freezing or recovery. Issuers can scale by using this token standard and open onchain assets to smaller investors. The protocol has already been used many times to tokenize securities available to retail investors, such as open-ended public funds, or even with prospectus exemptions in Europe.</p>
 Challenge 3: Fragmented Liquidity 
<p><br>
The Problem:<br>
Secondary markets for RWAs remain siloed. Distributors can only offer assets within their isolated order books, leaving unmatched trades, inactive markets, and frustrated investors.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
Shared liquidity. Imagine all distributors leveraging a shared order book while retaining full control of their platforms and investor relationships. In the new era of tokenized assets, trading offers are universal. Investors publish a trading offer on one platform, and it is instantly visible across all others. Smart contracts ensure compliance by design: Onchain identity checks confirm the buyer’s eligibility, enforce transfer restrictions, and verify wallet balances. Unauthorized transactions are denied instantly. The best part is delivery vs payment enabling instant settlements. Trades are completed in seconds without counterparty risk or intermediaries, creating a seamless and risk-free experience.</p>
<p>This vision is no longer theoretical. ERC-3643 tokens, combined with the open liquidity protocol DINO, make it a reality. By sharing an onchain catalog of offers, blockchain has been turned into a giant marketplace.</p>
<p>But unlocking this potential requires collective action.</p>
 
 For asset issuers: Adopting the open source ERC-3643 standard ensures compliance and future interoperability. 
 For asset administrators: Defining their operating models to support seamless onchain operations. 
 For distributors: Connecting to the ERC-3643 catalog of tokens and starting managing onchain transactions. 
 
<p>At Tokeny, our mission is to provide the best in class tokenized assets orchestration platform and expertise for all stakeholders to thrive in this financial revolution, empowering institutions to upgrade finance, onchain.</p>
<p>Change is no longer optional, it’s an opportunity, let’s make 2025 a bull market for RWAs!</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) has long been the backbone of enterprise security. As digital transformation accelerates and compliance requirements grow more stringent, the need for a flexible, scalable, and future-proof IAM framework has never been more critical. This is where the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric comes into play - a holistic framework expertly designed to tackle these challenges head-on.</p>
<p>But why is a comprehensive IAM blueprint so crucial? According to recent data, only 40% of companies currently have a complete IAM blueprint in place, while 26.8% are in the process of developing one, and a concerning 33.1% have no blueprint at all. This gap highlights a significant vulnerability for many organizations, leaving them exposed to risks that could be mitigated with a well-defined IAM strategy. The Identity Fabric addresses this very issue by providing a structured, adaptable approach to IAM, ensuring that organizations not only close this gap but also stay ahead of future challenges.</p>
<p>Building on its successful design and widespread adoption, KuppingerCole analysts and advisors are currently finalizing the updated revision of the Identity Fabric for 2025, scheduled for release soon. This new version is not just a routine update; it is a carefully crafted evolution that leverages valuable feedback from the industry, incorporates insights and experiences from end-user organizations, and integrates the latest market and technology trends.</p>
 Understanding the basics: What is the Identity Fabric? 
<p>At its core, the Identity Fabric is a comprehensive, holistic framework for architecting, evolving, and modernizing IAM systems. It is essential for organizations looking to keep pace with the demands of their future challenges, ensure compliance, and address evolving business requirements. Identities are the cornerstone of cybersecurity frameworks, and the Identity Fabric offers a structured approach to managing them effectively.</p>
<p>The benefits of the Identity Fabric are multifaceted. It not only provides a robust high-level model for IAM but also ensures that systems are adaptable to future challenges. This adaptability is crucial as the digital landscape continues to evolve, bringing with it new threats and opportunities. The business value of the Identity Fabric lies in its ability to streamline IAM processes, reduce operational costs, and enhance the overall user experience.</p>
 Applying the Identity Fabric: Why is it so useful? 
<p>The Identity Fabric is not just a theoretical framework; it is a practical tool that can be applied across various IAM scenarios. Whether you are designing a new IAM platform or evolving an existing one, the Identity Fabric provides the entry point for a clear roadmap. Areas of application include:</p>
 
 Strategy Definition for New IAM Platforms: Implementing new IAM platforms requires more than just technical know-how - it demands a strategic vision. The Identity Fabric helps define long-term goals and ensures that the platform is built with future scalability in mind. 
 Strategy Definition for Evolving IAM Platforms: Just as new platforms need a strategic direction, so do existing systems undergoing transformation. The Identity Fabric guides the modernization process, ensuring that legacy platforms meet both current and future business requirements. 
 Architecture Design for New IAM Platforms: When building new IAM platforms, the Identity Fabric framework ensures a robust, scalable, and flexible architecture. This architecture can adapt to changing business needs and technological advancements, making it future proof. 
 Architecture Design for Evolving IAM Platforms: For organizations with existing IAM systems, the Identity Fabric offers a pathway to modernization. By aligning legacy systems with the framework, businesses can enhance functionality and improve scalability without the need for a complete overhaul. 
 Review and Analysis of Existing IAM Service Platforms: To fully leverage the Identity Fabric, organizations must first understand their current state. Thorough reviews and analyses help identify gaps, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement, allowing the Identity Fabric to guide the necessary changes. 
 Portfolio Management: Effective IAM is not just about managing individual systems - it’s about managing a portfolio of services and solutions. The Identity Fabric ensures that all elements are aligned with business objectives and that resources are allocated efficiently. 
 
 Evolving the Identity Fabric for 2025: A Sneak Peek 
<p>The upcoming 2025 update to the Identity Fabric brings several exciting enhancements, each aimed at ensuring that the framework remains relevant in the face of both technological and business changes.</p>
 
 A Revision of the Conceptual Design: The new Identity Fabric will feature a slightly updated conceptual design that encapsulates all relevant themes. The structure of the Fabric will be more refined, looking at all types of identities, with all relevant IAM capabilities consolidated into IAM services and mapped to tools and market segments. 
 Integration with the IAM Reference Architecture: One of the key enhancements in the 2025 update is the integration of the Identity Fabric with the existing IAM Reference Architecture. This ensures that the Reference Architecture is aligned within the Fabric context. 
 Development of Detailed Blueprints: The 2025 update will also enable new applications of the Identity Fabric through deriving detailed, bespoke, and individualized detail identity fabrics. Crucial will be a new model of a two-tiered refinement of the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric (IF), which aims to provide a structured framework for managing identity and access within different organizational contexts. 
 
<p>The Identity Fabric can be adjusted two levels of abstraction:</p>
 
 Level 1: Master Identity Fabric (IF) - This is the core framework designed to manage functions and services across various identity and access management (IAM) requirements. It acts as the central IAM blueprint applicable to a broad range of organizations. 
 Level 2: Tailored Identity Fabrics per Business Model and/or Maturity Level&nbsp;- At this level, the Master Identity Fabric is refined into more specific models to serve different organizational needs and maturity levels. These refined models serve as role models for other organizations and are designed to meet the distinct challenges and requirements of various industries. 
 
<p>This hierarchical approach allows for greater flexibility, ensuring that the Identity Fabric can be adapted to fit specific organizational contexts while maintaining a standard core framework.</p>
 Looking Ahead: The Future of IAM 
<p>The KuppingerCole Identity Fabric 2025 is more than just an update - it’s a strategic evolution that prepares organizations for the future of IAM. By adopting this enhanced framework, businesses can ensure that their IAM systems are not only capable of meeting today’s challenges but are also ready for the unknowns of tomorrow. As identities continue to be at the core of cybersecurity, the Identity Fabric offers a clear path to resilience, adaptability, and long-term success.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the official release of the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric 2025, where these enhancements and more will be fully detailed, providing a cutting-edge framework for the next generation of IAM.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a critical pillar in cybersecurity frameworks, safeguarding sensitive systems and data from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Privileged credentials—such as those used by administrators, developers, or automation scripts—are often the target of cyberattacks due to the expansive access they provide. As such, organizations require robust PAM solutions that go beyond traditional boundaries to address emerging challenges such as shadow IT, insider threats, and secure remote access.</p>
<p>The demand for PAM solutions is driven by the growing complexity of IT environments, which now encompass hybrid infrastructures, multi-cloud ecosystems, and remote work arrangements. However, deploying and managing PAM solutions comes with its own set of operational challenges. Organizations must navigate the integration of these tools into existing systems, ensuring seamless functionality while managing privileged identities across distributed environments.</p>
<p>Effective PAM solutions today are more than just vaults for storing passwords—they enable organizations to enforce dynamic, time-limited access controls, continuously monitor user activity, and generate comprehensive audit trails. These capabilities are not only essential for security but also for meeting regulatory requirements. Syteca, formerly Ekran System, has redefined its offerings to meet these evolving demands, placing functionality, usability, and real-world applicability at the core of its approach.</p>
 The Growing Competition in the PAM Market 
<p>The PAM market has evolved rapidly over the past decade, with established players and new entrants competing for a share of this critical space. This growth reflects a broader trend in cybersecurity, as organizations increasingly prioritize the protection of privileged credentials. However, the shift toward hybrid and multi-cloud environments has added new dimensions to the challenge.</p>
<p>Organizations are no longer looking solely for tools that secure credentials; they need PAM solutions that provide agility, scalability, and ease of use without compromising security. Features like Just-in-Time (JIT) access, seamless integration with Zero Trust architectures, and compliance with ever-changing regulatory landscapes have become standard expectations.</p>
<p>Vendors are responding to this demand with diverse offerings, from feature-rich enterprise solutions to specialized tools tailored to specific industries. In this crowded market, differentiation is key. Solutions that adapt to unique business needs while addressing broader challenges, such as securing remote access and monitoring insider activities, are more likely to succeed. Syteca’s recent transformation and expanded capabilities position it as a strong contender in this competitive landscape.</p>
 Why Ekran System Became Syteca 
<p>In May 2024, Ekran System rebranded as Syteca, a strategic decision that signifies the company’s evolution and commitment to addressing the challenges of modern cybersecurity. The new name reflects Syteca’s expanded focus on delivering innovative system security and technology management solutions.</p>
<p>This transformation is more than a rebranding exercise; it marks a shift in how the company approaches Privileged Access Management. Syteca aims to align its tools with the practical needs of organizations, emphasizing usability and efficiency. Enhanced features, such as real-time threat detection, advanced session recording, and streamlined workflows, underline the company’s goal to offer comprehensive yet intuitive solutions.</p>
<p>By rebranding, Syteca positions itself as a forward-thinking player in the PAM market. The company is not only addressing the challenges organizations face today but also anticipating the needs of tomorrow, ensuring its solutions remain relevant in an ever-changing landscape.</p>
 Key Use Cases Highlighting Syteca’s Capabilities 
<p>Syteca’s approach to PAM is best understood through its real-world applications. These use cases demonstrate how the solution addresses critical security challenges across various industries and scenarios.</p>
<p>1. Detecting and Securing Shadow Accounts</p>
<p>Shadow IT accounts—those created without authorization or outside central control—pose significant security risks. These accounts are often overlooked, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. Syteca automates the discovery of shadow accounts across Windows servers and Active Directory, onboarding them securely into its secrets management system. Once onboarded, passwords are rotated, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance. Security teams can then evaluate and either disable or remove unauthorized accounts, reducing exposure to potential threats.</p>
<p>2. Mitigating Insider Threats with Privileged Account Monitoring</p>
<p>Insider threats remain a major concern for organizations, particularly when dealing with privileged accounts. Syteca addresses this challenge by continuously monitoring Active Directory for new privileged accounts. Discovered accounts are secured with two-factor authentication (2FA), session recording, and role-based access control (RBAC). These measures ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive systems, with all activities logged and auditable. This proactive approach helps organizations detect suspicious behaviour early and mitigate risks effectively.</p>
<p>3. Securing Sleeping Accounts</p>
<p>Inactive or dormant accounts often go unnoticed, becoming an attractive target for attackers. For example, the account of a former employee may still be active and exploitable. Syteca’s automated discovery tools identify these sleeping accounts, onboard them into the secrets management system, and rotate credentials to cut off unauthorized access. In real-world scenarios, this capability has helped organizations close security gaps caused by oversight, ensuring that no dormant accounts remain vulnerable.</p>
<p>4. Managing Third-Party Database Administrators (DBAs)</p>
<p>Organizations often rely on external contractors, such as third-party DBAs, to maintain critical systems. These contractors require temporary yet secure access to isolated networks. Syteca facilitates this through a combination of Jump servers, ticketing system integrations, and controlled access mechanisms. Contractors can only access specific resources via pre-approved workflows, with passwords rotated after each use. Session recording ensures that all activities are logged, providing full accountability.</p>
<p>5. Enhancing Security in Healthcare</p>
<p>In healthcare settings, securing access to electronic health records (EHRs) is paramount. Hospitals and clinics use Syteca to enforce strict access controls, such as 2FA and time-based restrictions, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access patient data during working hours. Additionally, audit capabilities allow administrators to monitor and review all activities involving sensitive data, helping organizations maintain compliance with industry regulations like HIPAA.</p>
<p>6. Enabling Secure File Transfers for Marketing Agencies</p>
<p>Collaborating with external vendors often requires temporary access to sensitive systems. For a marketing agency, Syteca facilitates secure file transfers via an FTP server. Access is granted only through secrets management, with manual approval workflows ensuring that each request is vetted. Passwords are rotated after use, and sessions are recorded for auditing. This approach allows agencies to collaborate confidently without exposing sensitive client data to unnecessary risk.</p>
 The Future of PAM 
<p>The cybersecurity landscape is evolving rapidly, and Privileged Access Management is at the forefront of this change. Organizations face mounting pressure to secure their privileged credentials while navigating complex IT ecosystems and regulatory requirements. Syteca’s transformation and its ability to address diverse use cases illustrate its commitment to meeting these challenges.</p>
<p>By focusing on usability, scalability, and real-world applicability, Syteca provides organizations with tools to address critical security gaps. Whether detecting shadow IT accounts, mitigating insider threats, or securing third-party access, Syteca demonstrates how PAM solutions can evolve to meet the needs of today’s security-conscious organizations.</p>
<p>As competition in the PAM market intensifies, solutions like Syteca will be instrumental in helping organizations achieve their security goals. With its comprehensive feature set and forward-thinking approach, Syteca is well-positioned to redefine what it means to manage privileged access effectively in the 21st century.</p>

			 What the electronic seal is and what it is for 		 
				 
				 
				 
			 What the electronic seal is and how it works 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>The electronic seal is a digital technology that guarantees the authenticity, integrity and origin of the digital documents to which it is applied. It was introduced by EU Regulation 910/2014 (eIDAS), which defines it as a set of data in electronic form “which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form” with the aim of guaranteeing the origin and integrity of the document.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This tool can be considered as a kind of digital stamp, used predominantly by legal entities (companies, organisations) to certify the origin and integrity of digital documents. Unlike an electronic signature, which identifies a natural person, an electronic seal associates the document with an organisational entity, protecting it from unauthorised modification and guaranteeing its authenticity.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 The qualified electronic seal (QeSeal) 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>The qualified electronic seal is created using a device that contains a qualified certificate, which guarantees the highest level of security and reliability for the authentication of digital documents. This is an advanced version of the electronic seal, which offers additional legal guarantees thanks to its compliance with strict European standards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Unlike the advanced electronic seal (AdESeal), a qualified electronic seal is created by means of a device containing a certificate issued in compliance with the requirements laid down by EU legislation. It can, therefore, be defined as the equivalent of a qualified electronic signature, the only difference being that it does not refer to a natural person, but to a legal entity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So while, through a digital signature, the data of the natural person who applied it can be traced, a qualified electronic seal makes it possible to trace the name of the legal entity. For this reason, it can be used for myriad activities, even by numerous parties belonging to the same company or organisation. It can, for example, be used to prove ownership of business documents, to protect intellectual works, for certificates of incorporation, for the management of medical records and medical reports as well as for many other purposes.</p>   						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How to Obtain It 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>To obtain it, a legal entity must go through an even more stringent verification process, conducted by a Certification Authority authorised by a government agency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>InfoCert was among the first Qualified Trust Service Providers to be certified for the Qualified Electronic Seal, gaining recognition for its qualified validation services. This allows InfoCert to issue electronic seals for multiple uses, such as the <a href="https://infocert.digital/consumer/eprel/">eSeal for EPREL</a>, the European Product Registry for Energy Labelling, with which companies wishing to apply for the energy classification of their products must register.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Find out more about the <a href="https://infocert.digital/consumer/eseal/">Electronic Seal</a>.</p>

Fri, 12/06/2024 - 07:34


            <p>Sentinel-1C will supply vital radar imagery for understanding climate change and preserving our planet</p>
<p>Kourou, December 6, 2024 – The Copernicus Sentinel-1C Earth observation satellite, built by prime contractor Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), was successfully launched by a Vega C rocket operated by Arianespace from Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.</p>
 
    
 
<p>Sentinel-1C © ESA</p>
<p>Sentinel-1C is part of Copernicus, the Earth Observation component of the European Union’s Space Programme. This programme is managed by the European Commission and funded by the EU with a partial contribution of the European Space Agency (ESA), the organisation responsible for the development and launches of dedicated Sentinel satellites. ESA also operates some of the missions and ensures the availability of data.</p>
<p>Sentinel-1C will join the Sentinel-1A satellite in orbit, providing images of the Earth’s surface, day and night and in all weather conditions, for a broad array of science applications designed to protect our planet.</p>
<p>This crucial data will be used to monitor landslides, earthquake zones, volcanic activity and variations in polar ice cover. They will also provide valuable insights for monitoring deforestation, the use of water resources and supporting emergency responders and search and rescue teams in the event of natural disasters. In addition, Sentinel-1C is the first satellite of the Sentinel-1 mission to be equipped with an&nbsp; Automatic Identification System payload, enabling it to play a vital role in maritime safety by improving traffic management, avoiding collisions and monitoring ships in critical areas.</p>
 
    
 
<p>Sentinel-1C preparation for fit check ©Thales Alenia Space_ImaginE</p>
<p>The Sentinel-1 mission comprises two satellites in Sun-synchronous orbit operating in tandem to provide optimal global coverage with a 12-day repeat cycle. Their pre-tasking capability means that data can be acquired consistently over long periods, which is essential for analyzing environmental trends. &nbsp;This data is accessible to public authorities, companies and citizens around the world on a free, full and open basis.</p>
<p>As prime contractor for the Sentinel-1 mission on behalf of ESA, Thales Alenia Space is responsible for satellite design, development, integration and testing. Each Sentinel-1 satellite is built on the PRIMA spacecraft bus developed by Thales Alenia Space for the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and carries a C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument developed by Airbus Defence &amp; Space. This SAR instrument enables precise mapping at resolutions up to 5 meters and coverage out to 400 kilometers.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m delighted with the successful launch of the Sentinel-1C satellite, which will supply vital radar imagery for a broad array of science applications to help preserve our planet,” said Giampiero Di Paolo, Deputy CEO, Senior Vice President Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space. “The teams at Thales Alenia Space, who are contributing to 11 of the 12 missions in the Copernicus programme, can be proud of this success, which marks a new phase in our collaboration with the European Commission and the European Space Agency.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a launch mass of around 2.2 metric tons, Sentinel-1C will operate in low-Earth orbit at an altitude of 700 km and has a design life of 7.25 years. It will be joined in orbit by its twin Sentinel-1D, currently undergoing cleanroom tests at Thales Alenia Space’s facility in Cannes. These latest Sentinel-1 satellites feature an innovative world first: a patented mechanism to separate the radar antenna from the spacecraft bus on re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere at the end of their lifetime, thus helping mitigate orbital debris.</p>
<p>Leonardo contributed to the development of the Sentinel-1C and 1D satellites by supplying the attitude sensors (Autonomous Star Tracker) and the power units that feed the radar, ensuring continuous availability of images.</p>
<p>Data from the Sentinel-1C satellite will be collected by several European centers, including the ground station of the e-GEOS space center, a joint venture between Telespazio (80%) and the Italian space agency (20%), located in Matera, Italy.</p>
<p>About Copernicus </p>
<p>Copernicus is the Earth observation component of the European Union’s Space Programme, looking at our planet and its environment to benefit all European citizens. It provides accurate, timely and easily accessible information to improve the management of the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure civil security. The world’s most advanced Earth Observation system, Copernicus provides continuous, free, and reliable Earth observation data and services to public authorities, companies and citizens around the globe.</p>
<p>Copernicus comprises several families of satellites and a series of monitoring networks (e.g. ground based weather stations, ocean buoys and air quality monitoring networks) to provide robust integrated information and to calibrate and validate the data from satellites.</p>
<p>The satellites are built by European prime contractors for ESA. A program of this scale enables Europe to better anticipate the consequences of global warming so that we can safeguard our planet.</p>
<p>The programme is managed by the European Commission and is co-funded by the European Union and ESA. The European Space Agency is responsible for the coordination, implementation and evolution of the programme, as well as the operations of some spacecrafts.</p>
<p>Thales Alenia Space, a key Copernicus partner</p>
<p>Thales Alenia Space is a major contributor to 11 of the Copernicus programme’s 12 missions. Sentinel-1 monitors land and sea in all weather conditions, day and night, thanks to its radar capabilities. Sentinel-2 and -3 acquire high-resolution optical imagery over land and coastal waters. Sentinel-4 and -5 are dedicated to meteorology and climatology missions. Sentinel-6 monitors the planet’s oceans. As well as being prime contractor for the Sentinel-1 and -3 satellite families, Thales Alenia Space also supplied the Sentinel-2 image ground segment and helped build the imaging spectrometer on Sentinel-5P and the Poseidon-4 radar altimeter on Sentinel-6. In 2020, Thales Alenia Space was awarded five contracts for the six new Copernicus Expansion missions, as prime contractor for the CIMR, ROSE-L and CHIME satellites and supplier of the CRISTAL and CO2M mission payloads. These new satellites will measure human-induced atmospheric carbon dioxide, survey sea ice and snow cover, support new optimized services for sustainable farming and biodiversity, observe sea-surface temperature and salinity as well as sea ice density and strengthen land monitoring and emergency management services.</p>

<p>Interoperability is the cornerstone of decentralized identity, ensuring that diverse ecosystems can seamlessly interact&nbsp; with each other. At Indicio, we are constantly working to advance&nbsp; interoperability so that customer solutions will be able to work with all the emerging standards and protocols and effortlessly scale to meet opportunities. This is why we are excited to participate in the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/join-the-didcomm-interop-a-thon/">upcoming DIDComm Interop-a-thon, organized by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://didcomm.org/">DIDComm</a> is short for Decentralized Identifier Communication, an open standard for secure, private, peer-to-peer communication between Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). It’s one of the least-well understood aspects of decentralized identity and one of the most powerful —&nbsp;especially for business. DIDComm enables each party in a decentralized identity ecosystem to seamlessly authenticate the other over a secure channel before sharing data. But it also enables a mobile device to function with the capacity of an API, enabling anyone with a mobile phone and digital wallet to become their own, highly available, easily permissioned, data platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many people think about decentralized identity as an “identity verification” solution — not surprising given the scale of current identity fraud —&nbsp;DIDComm enables decentralized identity to go beyond that and create trust networks for much richer digital relationships and data sharing.</p>
<p>For the upcoming Interop-a-thon, Indicio is providing our <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-public-mediator-2/">robust mediator</a>. Mediators play a critical role in the DIDComm protocol, enabling message routing between mobile devices, ensuring smooth and secure communication. Developers will be able to access the Indicio Mediator to test routing and communication scenarios in a secure, reliable environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we are committed to supporting the decentralized identity community. By supporting events like the DIDComm DIF Interop-a-thon, we’re not only contributing infrastructure but also championing the values of collaboration and innovation that drive this space forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can’t wait to see the incredible advancements that emerge from this event. If you’re attending, be sure to test with our mediator and share your experiences with us. Together, we’ll continue to build a decentralized future that works for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  Name: Juliano C. C. Tavares<br>Team: Engineering<br>Based in:&nbsp;Paraná, Brazil   About Juliano <p>I always knew I wanted to work in computing, and my journey began with university projects. My focus then was distributed systems and wireless networks, so I started specializing in those. I worked for a few years with wireless networks and embedded systems, completing a master's degree in IoT during that time. After a few years of working in the field, I realized that I liked working with web development much more and started to follow that path.</p><p>SpruceID came into my life years later as a professional challenge. It is very exciting to develop ambitious projects and open-source libraries that contribute to the digital future.</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>I'm currently a senior software engineer at SpruceID, working mainly with front-ends and occasionally touching some wild Rust code. I believe my biggest contributions here were in the SSX project, which is a wrapper for our other library SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum), and also this year in the project with Utah. I had the opportunity to work here on some things I was very interested in learning about (e.g., WebAssembly and mobile development) and things I had never imagined working with (Rust front-end). We definitely have a lot of challenges and opportunities to learn and apply new tools and technologies.</p> What do you find most rewarding about your role? <p>I am very happy when we finish a project, and it starts to be used by customers. At SpruceID, in addition to the projects that the end user will use, we also have libraries that other developers can build with. There is a huge potential for people who will be reached by our work.</p> What are some of the most important qualities for someone in your role to have, in your opinion? <p>Curiosity and persistence. We work with technologies that are still evolving, and our decisions will shape many of the paths forward.

            <p>Thales has been approved as a silver support partner of SOC-CMM, highlighting our commitment to help organisations enhance their security operations. Through this accreditation and partnership, we’re trusted to deliver Security Operations Centre (SOC) Maturity Assessments that meet what’s widely recognised as the global standard.</p>
 The Importance of Independent Assessments 
<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, independent and objective assessments like SOC-CMM are vital. They provide an unbiased evaluation of an organisation's security operations, identifying strengths and areas for improvement to help ensure the SOC is developing in the right direction or operating at peak efficiency and effectiveness. An external review can bring fresh perspectives and insights that internal teams might overlook, helping to uncover hidden vulnerabilities and optimise security processes.</p>
 Why SOC-CMM Assessments Matter 
<p>SOC-CMM assessments provide a structured framework for evaluating the maturity of a SOC. This includes assessing business drivers, governance, capabilities, processes, and overall effectiveness in managing security operations. By following the SOC-CMM framework, organisations can benchmark their SOC against industry standards and best practices, ensuring they meet or exceed these benchmarks.</p>
<p>The assessment covers key pillars such as business alignment, people, processes, technology, services and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>SOC-CMM assessments help companies identify gaps in their security operations and provide a clear road map for improving SOC capabilities. This allows them to prioritise improvements and allocate resources more effectively, leading to more robust and resilient security operations.</p>
<p>Demonstrating a commitment to high standards in cybersecurity can also build trust with customers, partners, and stakeholders, ultimately enhancing an organisation's reputation.</p>
<p>Michael Cormack, Managing SOC Consultant at Thales, said: “One of the common frustrations we hear from our customers is that the return on investment is not always understood by the business. By identifying inefficiencies and areas where resources are not effective, we’ve helped our customers to streamline their security operations, strengthening their business case and continued investment and growth towards SOC so they can stay ahead of the developing threat landscape.”</p>

<p>This article is the sixth and final article in a series about our <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking product</a>, Track &amp; Trust. Our previous articles described how the system works. Now, we dive into the results of our pilot operations. TLDR – We successfully tracked all the goods to their final delivery locations despite serious challenges!</p>
 The Track &amp; Trust Mission in Southern Lebanon 
<p></p>
<p>We chose to track shipments of solar equipment for the Track &amp; Trust Pilot. Destined for clinics and schools serving refugees in Beqaa Valley, Lebanon, these shipments were critical to the region. The area is home to over 300,000 Syrian refugees, according to <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/lb/bekaa-zahle#:~:text=As%20of%2001%20January%202023,total%20number%20of%20registered%20refugees.">UNHCR</a>, and they all need medical care. Our partners, <a href="https://aidpioneers.com/home">Aid Pioneers</a>, <a href="https://multiaidprograms.org/about-us/">Multi Aid Programs</a>, and <a href="https://al-manhaj-lb.org/home/">Al-Manhaj</a>, collaborate to provide logistics, education, and medical care on the ground.</p>
<p>The clinics and schools require continuous a continuous electrical power supply. Due to Lebanon’s severe energy crisis, the public grid provides only about two hours of electricity per day, making the delivery of efficient healthcare services an immense challenge. In absence of a stable grid, most of the region’s essential services rely on generators, leaving the financial stability of operations at the whim of the ever-increasing price of diesel. Typical health clinics have thousands of dollars in monthly operating costs due to the need to purchase this fuel. To address this, Aid Pioneers is replacing diesel power systems with clean, abundant solar energy, one clinic at a time. By reliably shipping the equipment from Tripoli to Beqaa Valley, they achieve this goal with our help. Specifically the shipments we’ve tracked during the pilot contained all the equipment needed to outfit two clinics with enough solar power to cover all their needs. Aid Pioneers partner, <a href="https://multiaidprograms.org/about-us/">Multi Aid Programs</a><a href="https://multiaidprograms.org/">&nbsp;</a>runs the clinics which received the solar and medical equipment we tracked.</p>
 Tracking Impact 
<p></p>
<p>Using Track &amp; Trust, Aid Pioneers and their partners gained a clear view of what was happening to the parts in their shipment. As a result, they avoided extra trips, saving work and potential exposure to danger. Our team planned this deployment long before the recent conflict broke out, and our system performed well in the midst of a very difficult situation. Effective management of the challenges that arose was crucial to the success of the project.</p>
<p>During the shipments, ground personnel encountered outages of critical infrastructure, losing power and 4G connectivity several times. Fortunately, our Track &amp; Trust mesh node infrastructure filled the gap, and our battery backup system enabled the system to run despite the power grid being down. The system’s design allowed it to handle such outages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When 4G connectivity was lost, our mesh nodes cached delivery data until it could be passed between nodes. Utilizing technologies developed with our partner, <a href="https://www.weaverlabs.io/">Weaver Labs</a>, we ensured the data was secure. Next, we used a satellite-enabled mesh node to post data that would have otherwise been lost via Iridium satellite uplink, developed by our partner <a href="https://ororatech.com/">Ororatech</a>.</p>
<p>Aid Pioneers received hundreds of updates about the status of the goods from us. To ensure the integrity of the data, we cryptographically signed and anchored these updates to the ASI Alliance blockchain, making them highly trustworthy. This extra step was crucial to the project’s success. Together the result is highly trustable <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking</a>.</p>
 Energy Independence One Clinic at a Time 
<p></p>
<p>Two major sets of shipments were completed under the watchful eye of Track &amp; Trust, and a third set is currently being shipped to Lebanon. With 110 kWp of power, the solar systems make two entire clinics energy independent for the next twenty years. Additionally, we tracked a container of medical goods, which <a href="https://al-manhaj-lb.org/home/">Al-Manhaj</a> and <a href="https://multiaidprograms.org/about-us/">Multi Aid Programs</a> are using to save lives and provide medical treatment in Tripoli and the Beqaa Valley.</p>
 Track &amp; Trust Proof of Resilience 
<p>The design of Track &amp; Trust allows it to work in various contexts, providing resilience and <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking</a>. Adaptable to different scenarios, our system is highly versatile. As we continue to develop and refine our system, we will meet the changing needs of our partners.</p>
 Next Steps 
<p>Following this piloting success, we will examine plans to make the system more user-friendly. Logistics organizations that could use more resilience in their field operations are also being contacted. If this series of blog posts has piqued your interest, please <a href="mailto:rebecca.johnson@datarella.com">reach out</a>, and we will schedule a call or demo.</p>

 Digitalization ‘for all’? An Update on Germany’s Public Sector from the 2024 Smart Country Convention <p>As governments around the world step up to regulate artificial intelligence and biometrics, a different class of technology aims to disrupt digital identity: digital wallets. Caribou is leading a research project that aims to advance migrants’ identification needs in digital identity wallet policy and technology design. <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/identity-and-migration/">Explore the&nbsp;project</a>.</p><p>Since 2018, the Smart Country Convention has set out to bring together Germany’s digital economy and political decision-makers, as well as other stakeholders in the ever-growing field of public sector digital transformation.</p><p>The event is hosted by Messe Berlin, the Berlin Expo Center, and bitkom e.V., one of Germany’s largest industry associations for the digital economy. According to <a href="https://www.smartcountry.berlin/en/concept/facts-and-figures/">its website</a>, the Smart Country Convention — or SCCON for short — has become “the biggest event for smart cities, smart regions and e-government” in Germany. Indeed, with more than 18,000 attendees, over 17,000 square meters of exhibition space and a conference program featuring more than 650 speakers on 7 stages, the event is a large-scale, upbeat demonstration of what the future of the German public sector might look like — or at least what technology vendors, policymakers and other professionals in this field imagine it&nbsp;will.</p><p>In between ping-pong matches, live podcast recordings, and free frozen yoghurt, keynote speakers and panelists discussed the current state of digital transformation in the German public sector. They shed light on challenges, best practices and how to work towards Germany’s policy priorities for digital transformation, as outlined in the <a href="https://digitalstrategie-deutschland.de/static/eb25ff71f36b8cf2d01418ded8ae3dc2/Digitalstrategie_EN.pdf">2022 Digital Strategy</a> of the now defunct <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v3r046pzzo">Traffic Light Coalition</a>. These insights also revealed the stark discrepancy between the image projected by SCCON and where the country actually stands. Take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRtjBQ5YSaQ">opening keynote by Kai Wegner</a>, the governing mayor of Berlin, on the second day of SCCON. He announced that Berliners can now register/change their address online — if they have downloaded the AusweisApp, opened a BundID account, have an NFC-enabled smartphone or special card reader, and either the German national ID card, the eID card for citizens of the European Union and the European Economic Area, or an electronic residence card with an active eID function (and remember the PIN code they need for all of this to&nbsp;work).</p>October 16, 2024, Day 2 Opening&nbsp;Keynote.<p>The excitement and sense of digital awakening evoked by Wegner’s keynote, set against a backdrop of flashing lights and cinema-size screens, illustrates the immense undertaking Germany has ahead of it. So far, the country <a href="https://www.bundesrechnungshof.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Berichte/2023/onlinezugangsgesetz-volltext.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2">has fallen far short of its stated goal of digitizing access to nearly 600 public services by 2022.</a> On the day of the deadline, only 19% of these services were available online. <a href="https://insm.de/aktuelles/publikationen/digitale-transformation-deutschland-scheitert-beim-e-government">By the beginning of 2024, only 153 services had gone online nationwide.</a> In terms of the overall target, this represents an implementation rate of just 26.6% — a full year after the original deadline. Germany’s sluggish pace makes the city-state of Hamburg,<a href="https://dashboard.digitale-verwaltung.de/"> where 284 public services are available online</a>, the (literal) North Star of this ongoing restructuring process.</p><p>At the heart of this public administration overhaul is the issue of digital identity management and how governments, whether at the federal, regional or local level, enable access to services. It’s against this backdrop that another name has emerged in the competition for the most innovative city: Wiesbaden. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSLpFpihvSg&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa9sr2tZEOY0My7i62E7Wo82&amp;index=24">Maral Koohestanian, Deputy Mayor of Wiesbaden, was one of four panelists who discussed the state of digital identity in Germany at this year’s SCCON, moderated by Clemens Schleupner of bitkom.</a> Koohestanian, <a href="https://voltdeutschland.org/neuigkeiten/maral-koohestanian-fuehrt-volt-in-die-bundestagswahl-2025">who is now leading the Bundestag election campaign for Volt</a>, emphasized Wiesbaden’s pragmatic approach. <a href="https://webid-solutions.com/de/ressourcen/presse/egovernment-wiesbadens-politik-beschliesst-videoidentifikation-stadtweit/">Working with WebID and ekom, the city has adopted VideoID to provide access to public services.</a></p><p>According to Koohestanian, Wiesbaden’s approach is unique in Germany. Many people have already been introduced to VideoID, for example when opening a bank account. So the process is known and accepted. In comparison, the identity verification approach taken by Berlin and other cities is based on the national eID infrastructure, as mentioned above. While Germany’s national eID infrastructure covers three types of documents (i.e. the national identity card [Personalausweis], the eID card for EU/EAA citizens, the electronic residence permit), VideoID can be used to verify around 200 international identity documents. VideoID therefore is open to more users, also because it requires less specific equipment.</p><p>During the panel discussion, Koohestanian underlined the advantage that VideoID offers in terms of the inclusiveness of the approach and its overall user acceptance. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSLpFpihvSg&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa9sr2tZEOY0My7i62E7Wo82&amp;index=24">The numbers she presented</a> seem to speak for themselves: When registering a wedding date at the Wiesbaden registry office, 98% opted to do so online, compared to 2% of people who preferred to register in person (in all cases, the ceremony itself takes place in person). Of the online users, 92.5% chose VideoID, compared to 7.5% who preferred the eID option. If people want to register/change their address online, <a href="https://www.wiesbaden.de/medien/rathausnachrichten/PM_Zielseite.php?showpm=true&amp;pmurl=https://www.wiesbaden.de/guiapplications/newsdesk/publications/Landeshauptstadt_Wiesbaden/141010100000474138.php">in Wiesbaden this service is for now carried out exclusively via&nbsp;VideoID.</a></p><p>Koohestanian’s emphasis foreshadowed the theme of the next day’s opening keynote by Federal Minister Lisa Paus (Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth). “Some people today are afraid that the digitalization train could leave without them,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU6Prs2rOdo&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa-wn8ynMFrNZCEFGBL60Pga&amp;index=57">Paus said in her speech</a>, stressing the need to strengthen inclusion, participation and accessibility of the digital transformation in Germany. While focusing on the inclusion of the elderly, Paus raised the question of how to ensure that digitalization is for all. As important as this question is, it however first requires a definition of what ‘for all’&nbsp;means.</p><p>Looking at the emerging digital identity ecosystem in Germany, ‘all’ currently seems to include only those who have access to the country’s existing eID infrastructure, i.e. people with German citizenship, EU citizens living in Germany, and non-EU citizens who have successfully applied for a residence permit. This may sound like Germany has all its citizens and residents covered. But the situation is more complicated than it might seem at first glance. Take, for example, non-EU citizens who come to Germany to take up a job offer. <a href="https://www.bamf.de/EN/Themen/MigrationAufenthalt/ZuwandererDrittstaaten/Migrathek/Einreisebestimmungen/einreisebestimmungen-node.html">If they enter on a work visa, this title is usually valid for up to 12 months.</a> During this time, they will have to deal with the German bureaucracy, especially the immigration authorities at their place of residence to apply for and receive their electronic residence permit.</p><p>At present, this interaction can be a largely paper-based, face-to-face process, depending on the local authority, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIE-jsSUZ3g&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa9sr2tZEOY0My7i62E7Wo82&amp;index=54">a topic that was the subject of another panel discussion at SCCON.</a> During this panel discussion, Engelhard Mazanke, head of the Berlin Landesamt für Einwanderung, the city-state’s immigration authority, explained that practices vary widely across Germany. Not every immigration authority allows things to be sent to them as PDFs. Often documents have to be submitted in the original, perhaps even with an apostille. Mazanke criticized the fact that migration-related procedures are always dealt with on the assumption of potential misuse, even when processing applications for what he described as the ‘Rolls-Royce’ category of all residence permits, the EU Blue Card. Opportunities for digitizing processes and simplifying bureaucracy are limited if this is the default attitude towards non-Germans, he explained.</p><p><a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/wiesbaden-und-koeln-bedenkliches-videoident-verfahren-soll-gang-aufs-amt-sparen/">Concerns about misuse are also a reason for criticism of the use of VideoID in Wiesbaden.</a> The German eID infrastructure, on the other hand, is regarded as highly secure. In the context of eIDAS 2.0, it provides the only means of identification suitable for verifying the identity of Germany-based EUDI wallet users in accordance with LoA high requirements. At the SCCON panel on digital identity, the representative of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior raised the issue of the reliability of identity systems outside Europe when asked how people in Germany who are outside the national eID infrastructure could be integrated into the country’s emerging wallet ecosystem. About an hour later, on another stage, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIE-jsSUZ3g&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa9sr2tZEOY0My7i62E7Wo82&amp;index=54">Tobias Lindner, Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office, emphasized the need for attractive migration processes and for Germany to present itself as welcoming and service-oriented to new residents and citizens.</a></p><p>As such, SCCON brought to the fore another challenge for Germany’s digital transformation efforts. Not only is there a tension between inclusion and security concerns. The messages from government officials and policymakers tell different stories, illustrating the fragmentation of political decision-making and implementation processes. Given the centrality of digital identity to Germany’s vision of modern statehood, it would certainly be a good topic for the country to start speaking with one&nbsp;voice.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digitalization-for-all-fb86e03ad679">Digitalization ‘for all’?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>How can we ensure that the person presenting a credential is truly the same person who received the credential? This is a crucial question, especially when dealing with sensitive information. Our approach is to have the biometric provider issue a short-lived credential attesting to a recent biometric check whenever the issuer or verifier needs to confirm the physical presence of a credential holder. This biometric check credential can be used by the issuer to embed biometric-binding attributes into the primary credential of interest (the credential issued by a standard issuer, such as a bank or government authority), and then it can be used by the verifier to check that it is the same person presenting the primary credential. Let's break down the process:</p>  Enrollment: The first step involves the user providing a biometric sample, such as a thumbprint or face scan, which the biometric provider can use to generate a biometric enrollment credential. The key advantage here is that the biometric data remains on the user's device—there's no need for the biometric provider to maintain a large, potentially vulnerable database. This credential, signed by the biometric provider, is secure and tamper-proof.  Issuance: The biometric provider can use the enrollment credential from the previous step to derive a separate biometric check credential that is shared with the issuer of the primary credential. The biometric check credential does not contain the biometric data, but is evidence that the biometric provider was able to successfully check a biometric that matches a specific privacy-preserving biometric ID. The issuer embeds into the primary credential some attributes identifying the issuer of the biometric check credential and the biometric ID that was used. These are known as biometric-binding attributes.  Verification: When verifying the primary credential, relying parties will also request a fresh biometric check credential. The user’s wallet will enable the biometric provider to perform a new biometric check and issue the associated credential containing the same biometric ID that was recorded in the enrollment credential. The verifier can then confirm that the biometric ID in the primary credential matches the biometric ID in the biometric check credential, proving that it is the same physical person who was issued the primary credential.  <p>As an example, let’s look at how a bank can tie a customer identity credential to an individual’s biometric. Before issuing the credential, the bank would request that the customer shares a fresh biometric check credential. This will trigger the wallet to enroll the customer’s biometric as part of issuing the biometric check credential. The bank can then embed the biometric-binding attributes into the customer identity credential that they issue. When the customer wants to prove their identity to a verifier, the verifier can require a recent biometric check credential along with the bank-issued identity credential. This will trigger the wallet to have the biometric provider run a biometric check and issue a new biometric check credential which will then be used to confirm that the person presenting the bank identity credential is indeed the same person who originally received it.</p><p>By making the biometric provider a recognized issuer within the credentialing ecosystem, we streamline the process. All necessary integrations happen on the user's device, ensuring data security while allowing for robust biometric proofing and credential binding. This method eliminates the need for each participant in the ecosystem to integrate directly with the biometric provider, reducing complexity and cost. Additionally, the biometric provider can monetize their services as these credentials are utilized throughout the ecosystem.</p><p>You can learn more by reading our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/solutions/biometric-bound-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">documentation on biometric-bound credentials</a> and the <a href="https://docs.dock.io/developer-documentation/wallet-sdk/biometric-plugin?ref=blog.dock.io">biometric service provider plugin for wallets</a>.</p>

            <p>What if we solve society's problems by looking at nature's toolbox? We continue our series with a focus on superhydrophobicity, and investigate how it can help keep optical equipment functioning in an optimum manner in the harshest conditions.</p>
 What is superhydrophobicity? 
<p></p> 
 
  
     
               © Thales 
       
   
 
<p>“Picture a lotus leaf” encourages Julie Cholet, Research Engineer at Thales. “When water lands on the surface it adopts a spherical configuration and is repelled. This is superhydrophobicity. For an object like a lotus leaf, it enables the surface to minimise its contact with water.”</p>
<p>This property is widely seen in nature, where certain plants and animals have evolved to repel water for survival. This so called "lotus effect" refers to the leaf's ability to self-clean due to its ultra-water-repellent surface. When a water droplet lands on the leaf, it simply beads up and rolls off, carrying dirt and debris with it—much like how wax resists water. This ability to reject water is not just limited to the lotus; many plants have evolved similar strategies to protect themselves from excess water, dirt, and pathogens, each with its unique biological purpose.</p>
<p>“Almost all plants and animals are hydrophobic because no living organism wants to get completely soaked,” points out Edwin Plokker, Curator at Museumfabriek (“Museum factory”), a natural history museum in Enschede in the Netherlands. “In the animal kingdom, superhydrophobicity is crucial to improve the chances of survival.”</p>
<p></p> 

   
      
   
 

 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many animals, particularly insects, amphibians, and aquatic species, have developed ways to repel water. For example, water striders use superhydrophobic legs to "walk" on water, and certain frogs have water-resistant skin to prevent drowning. Birds, like penguins, have tightly packed feathers coated with oils that create a superhydrophobic surface, allowing them to stay dry in freezing waters and maintain their body heat.</p>
 Replicating natural phenomena 
<p>Such properties have inspired researchers at Thales to study how to replicate these natural phenomena. At the Group’s <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/global/innovation-by-thales">Research &amp; Technology</a> centre in Palaiseau, just south of Paris, Julie Cholet and her team focus on multifunctional surfaces that combine superhydrophobic properties with other functionalities, such as antireflective surfaces, inspired by insects like the Greta oto butterfly, which has transparent wings that naturally minimise reflection and glare.</p>
<p></p> 
 
  
     
               © Thales 
       
   
 
<p>“We take this inspiration into our clean rooms where we study micro- and nanofabrications. The possible uses for such surfaces are very wide, particularly in optical systems used in vehicles,” explains Julie Cholet. “For these Thales systems, often featuring high-performance video cameras, it offers a durable solution because you don’t need maintenance.”</p>
<p>Through these naturally inspired advances, the team aims to enhance performance, durability, and safety. One example where these technologies have been tested is the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/defence-and-security/naval-forces/above-water-warfare/gatekeeper">Gatekeeper</a>, an electro-optic security system with cameras that need to provide ships with a continuous 360° panoramic visual overview in harsh environmental conditions. Having high-performance, durable surfaces that can withstand extreme humidity while maintaining optimal functionality can provide a key operational advantage.</p>
<p>“Nature developed these properties through evolution,” points out Julie. “Our research in superhydrophobicity goes back a decade, but we are already seeing great results – and it’s only just the beginning!”<br>

<p>This is an old debate that has been discussed in directory circles for many years. To virtualize or not to virtualize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virtualization continues to have challenges. Directories and databases continue to increase in complexity and diversity. As the cost of owning a virtual directory has increased so has the required features to compensate for the complexity and diversity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is. Scroll on, or be very cautious if you decide to click. That’s the warning coming from just about everywhere as the 2024 holiday season ramps up.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-ai-deepfakes-and-scams-are-changing-the-way-we-shop-online/">McAfee’s 2024 Global Holiday Shopping Scams Study</a> pinpoints AI-generated deepfake texts, emails and web sites promoting fake products, deals and giveaways as the main concern for holiday shoppers this year, with <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-ai-deepfakes-and-scams-are-changing-the-way-we-shop-online/">70 per cent</a> of American shoppers saying AI-driven scams are changing the way they shop online, and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241115918692/en/McAfee%E2%80%99s-2024-Global-Holiday-Shopping-Scams-Study-Highlights-Growing-Concerns-Over-AI-Powered-Scams-Including-Deepfakes-Impacting-Holiday-Shoppers">59 per cent</a> saying they’re more concerned by scams this year than they were last year.</p>



<p>Deepfake technology uses AI to create fabricated content such as video or photo impersonations, fake or cloned voices, images, or email. It makes content look like the real thing, within the proper context, and sounds or reads like&nbsp;a legitimate message. Behind the fake site or message is a bad actor waiting to pounce.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/11/07/new-chrome-safari-edge-firefox-warning-do-not-use-these-websites/">Forbes</a> and other outlets recently warned the billions of users of the most popular web browsers Chrome, Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox about bad actors who had infected 1,000+ web sites to create and promote fake product listings that landed high in search listings and were backed by 121 fake web stores. Estimated losses ran into the tens of millions over the past five years, and affected hundreds of thousands of consumers—and that was just from one scam campaign under investigation.</p>



<p>Leading into the holiday season and massive sales days like Black Friday, <a href="https://home.barclays/news/press-releases/2024/11/deal-or-steal--black-friday-shoppers-at-risk--as-only-half-carry/">Barclays</a> is warning shoppers not to be lax about scam checking, particularly those that come via email—the most reported type of shopping scam. Barclays is urging customers to check email alerts of sales that claim to be from a legitimate retailer like Amazon or Costco advertising their Black Friday deals before making a purchase.</p>



<p>In fact, being hypervigilant about checking the authenticity of holiday sales <a href="https://www.choice.com.au/consumers-and-data/protecting-your-data/data-privacy-and-safety/articles/how-to-check-if-email-or-text-is-scam">messages and email</a>s and the <a href="https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/education/basics/how-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit">URL</a>s they point you to, is key to beating the scammers.</p>



<p>Here’s our best advice:</p>



 Be suspicious of messages with: 



 
 Unsolicited offers or deals that seem too good to be true 



 Poor grammar or odd phrasing (but don’t rely on this being the case, as scammers and their AI-generated solicitations are getting more sophisticated) 



 A sense of urgency, such as “limited time offers” or “act now or miss out” messages 



 Links to unfamiliar websites. 
 



 Use secure payment methods 



<p>Use only reputable payment systems like credit cards or PayPal, which offer buyer protection. Avoid wire transfers or sending money via gift cards. <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">Or use a MySudo virtual card</a>.</p>



 Before purchasing, look for reviews of the online store or product you’re interested in 



<p>But remember: AI-generated fake reviews are now commonplace, so be cautious if the reviews seem overly positive or generic.</p>



 Be alert to fake holiday giveaways and contests, and fake social media profiles 



<p>Giveaways and contests that ask for personal information or require you to click a link are almost certainly scams. Always check the authenticity of any giveaway and don’t share your personal information unless you’re sure it’s with a legitimate source.</p>



<p>Scammers use AI to create fake social media profiles that look like real people, offering fake promotions or asking for donations. Look for verification badges or use reverse image search to confirm the person or brand is legitimate.</p>



 Be careful of pop-ups and banner ads that offer discounts, prizes or exclusive deals 



<p>Understand that these could redirect you to fake websites or lead to malware downloads.</p>



 Only click on links from trusted sources 



<p>If you see a link in an email or message that seems too good to be true, manually type the URL into your browser. Or, if it’s a merchant you have used before, use your bookmark for the site if you have one.</p>



 Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) 



<p>Adding an extra layer of security to your accounts on shopping sites, email accounts, and banks, can protect you from scams that want your login credentials. Don’t share or reuse passwords across different sites, especially for sensitive accounts.</p>



 Warn family and friends 



<p>Tell your people about the risks of AI-driven scams, especially older adults who may be less tech-savvy. You can also avoid deepfake scams involving loved ones, particularly the common <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-to-use-mysudo-to-save-loved-ones-from-voice-deep-fake-scams/">grandparent scam</a>, by using MySudo:</p>



<p>1.&nbsp;Set up a&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;and assign it a&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-6-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;that you&nbsp;only ever give out to your closest family and friends.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp;Be diligent about only giving out the number to your loved ones so that you build and protect a&nbsp;trusted communication channel with your inner circle.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp;Tell your loved ones they can trust the safe Sudo number. If that number rings, the call recipient will know it’s a legitimate communication and it’s you on the end of the phone line. If you’ve been diligent in protecting your safe Sudo number, it is very unlikely a criminal would have it.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/easy-invite-a-friend-function-is-now-in-mysudo/">Invite your family and friends</a>&nbsp;to use MySudo and use the app’s&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/securely-chat-with-your-friends-with-free-sudo-handles/">handle</a>-based&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/encyrption-in-mysudo/">end-to-end encrypted</a>&nbsp;calling to communicate with each other.</p>



<p>Share scam alerts, and follow organizations like the <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/scams">Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a> and <a href="https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker">Better Business Bureau (BBB)</a> to learn about and report scams.</p>



 Check the website’s URL 



<p>Always double check the website’s URL starts with “https://” and includes a secure padlock symbol in the address bar. <a href="https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/education/basics/how-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit">Learn more</a>.</p>



 Keep software updated 



<p>Regularly update your devices, browsers, and security software to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p>



 Keep up with AI trends 



<p>Get familiar with common AI scam tactics so you can spot them early and easily.</p>



 Fight AI with AI 



<p>Some antivirus and security software now includes AI-powered features that help detect phishing attempts, malicious links, and other scam activities. Use these tools for added protection.</p>







 Use <a href="http://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo">MySudo</a>&nbsp;to set up a dedicated shopping email and phone number for buying online year-round, but particularly during holidays 



 
 Set up a dedicated shopping Sudo: 



 Name your Sudo. This is the name you want to go by when using this Sudo. It might be your own name or a nickname. 



 Add a purpose. Call it Shopping Sudo or something else you’ll remember. 



 Confirm the email address that displays during Sudo set-up. 



 Add a phone number. 



 Supercharge your privacy by adding a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">virtual card</a>. Virtual cards are secure stand-ins for your actual cards or bank accounts and protect your personal information and your money. 



 Use your Shopping Sudo’s details instead of your personal details for all your shopping-related activities: 



 Use your Sudo email to open store accounts and sign up for deals and discounts. 



 Use the private browser in your Sudo to find the perfect product or search for sensitive purchases. The browser is ad and tracker free and keeps your browsing history, bookmarks and tabs all within the relevant Sudo. 



 Once you’ve found a great deal, check out and pay for it with your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">virtual card</a>. A virtual card doesn’t reveal any of your personal information when you make purchases. You might use your Sudo phone and email at the checkout, too. 



 If your parcel gets lost or you need to contact customer service about any other issue, use the phone number or email for that too. 



 Use MySudo Browser Extension to autofill your Sudo details directly into shopping carts and online forms. 
 



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-browser-extension/">MySudo Browser Extension</a> lets you sync MySudo on your mobile device with your web browser on your desktop so you can use your Sudos without having to go into the app on your mobile device and manually copy them across.</p>



<p>This makes opening an account or buying online faster, easier and more secure. Simply put the cursor into a form field, click on the MySudo icon and fill all the available fields that MySudo can autofill or open the browser extension pinned to your browser toolbar and copy/paste directly from there.</p>



<p>Your desktop will stay in sync with the Sudos in your mobile device. So, if you create a new Sudo or modify an existing Sudo, it will automatically update over on your desktop.</p>



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">Start using MySudo</a></p>







 Use RECLAIM to find out which companies have your personal information 



<p><a href="http://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim">RECLAIM</a>, powered by <a href="http://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo">MySudo</a>, is a digital identity footprint management tool that helps you reclaim control of your <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a> from the companies that store and might sell it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>RECLAIM tells you which companies hold your personal information and where your information might have been caught in a&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/?s=data+breach">data breach</a>. It then gives you step-by-step instructions for protecting your information going forward, either by using&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo">MySudo</a>&nbsp;or asking the company to delete your personal information altogether.&nbsp;Start using&nbsp;<a href="http://reclaim.mysudo.com/">RECLAIM.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

This approach allows them to test various strategies in diverse contexts, and identify what works best and for whom. However, this comes with a challenge for portfolio managers, how can they make confident decisions when presented with fundamentally different types of evidence?</p><p>Take two digital upskilling programs for entrepreneurs. One has gathered a selection of insights that shows high participant satisfaction scores and a series of uplifting stories. The other has modest results from a well-implemented randomized evaluation. Which one should get continued investment? This question reveals an often frustrating challenge in portfolio management: while demonstrating impact is key to scaling successful interventions, an end-to-end approach to measurement isn’t always feasible. This requires a framework to join disparate kinds of evidence.</p><p>This challenge emerges from the nature of portfolio work itself. Programs may be at different implementation stages, involve distinct initiatives, or offer different opportunities for measuring change based on their design and context. These differences naturally lead to varied impact measurement approaches. A startup testing a new financial inclusion solution requires different evaluation metrics than an established program preparing for national expansion.</p> Descriptive studies give an indication of immediate outcomes but may overstate long-term impact <p>Caribou’s analysis of 143 studies in our recently updated <a href="https://evidence.strivecommunity.org/">Small Business Evidence Map</a> shows that different evaluation approaches tell different parts of an impact story. Initial assessments, like ex-post surveys or interviews, often present a positive view of a program. By capturing immediate reactions and experiences, they help programs adapt to local contexts and highlight key components that drive&nbsp;success.</p><p>This aligns with Bertrand and Mullainathan’s (2001) insights into <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=260131">subjective survey data reliability</a>. Data often captures immediate reactions and intentions rather than long-term behaviors. Participants, especially young entrepreneurs, may express optimism about their future, influenced more by personality and outlook than by any tangible support they received. McKenzie and Woodruff (2014) <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/cbf23c46-7c97-5a20-b403-a5fe1f0ffe5f/content">document similar patterns</a> in business training evaluations, where participants’ stated intentions often diverged from actual implementation when faced with day-to-day time and resource constraints.</p><p>One of Caribou’s partners recently conducted a survey on the impact of a digital upskilling platform for entrepreneurs in a middle-income country. They asked about entrepreneurs’ perception of their business’ growth over the previous three&nbsp;months:</p><p>The data alone might be encouraging — over half of surveyed entrepreneurs reported business growth. This aligns with what we often see in entrepreneurship programs: participants tend to express optimism about their business trajectory. However, in this case their optimism has nothing to do with any support they received. Additional data reveals a fuller&nbsp;picture:</p><p>Comparing the control group to entrepreneurs who were actually invited to participate in the program shows almost identical levels of perceived growth. What initially looked like evidence of program success — high rates of perceived business growth among participants — was simply capturing the natural optimism of entrepreneurs and perhaps broader economic conditions. Without this comparison group, this positive outlook might have been mistakenly attributed to the&nbsp;program.</p><p>This example illustrates a broader point: the validity of findings depends heavily on study design and the potential for biases. <a href="https://catalogofbias.org/biases/selection-bias/">Selection bias</a>, <a href="https://catalogofbias.org/biases/recall-bias/">recall bias</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_bias">attribution bias</a> are common challenges. Without proper comparison, positive outcomes may be incorrectly attributed to a program’s influence. Yet understanding underwhelming or null results often requires looking beyond the numbers. Qualitative insights and implementation analysis can reveal more about the mechanisms behind underperformance.</p> Causal studies provide more reliable, and (usually) more modest, estimates of effectiveness <p>Causal studies, including <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/resource/introduction-randomized-evaluations">Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)</a>, attempt to address these challenges by measuring actual behaviors rather than intentions. Their strict design and focus on specific pathways make it easier to attribute change to a program, though often they can only test limited pathways at a time. Between purely observational studies and RCTs lie other methods — like qualitative comparative analysis and process tracing — that can help establish causal relationships while accommodating complexity.</p><p>While causal studies excel at establishing causality, they often do so at the cost of generalizability. They are costly and may miss subtle mechanisms or long-term effects shaped by cultural, institutional, or local contexts. The trade-off between internal validity (precision in measurement) and external validity (ability to generalize) can be significant in portfolio evaluation, yet often lies beyond the scope of experimental designs (see Ravallion 2001 for an <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/410881468180273314/pdf/773500JRN02001000Vanishing0Benefits.pdf">entertaining and insightful discussion</a> of such methodological tensions).</p> Why not both? Strategically matching impact evidence&nbsp;types <p>Effective portfolio facilitation requires matching evidence approaches to specific needs. A mixed methods approach can strengthen causal claims by combining qualitative insights with quantitative rigor. Qualitative methods can reveal underlying mechanisms, while descriptive quantitative analysis helps identify patterns that need further&nbsp;testing.</p><p>This matching process requires careful judgment. For instance, an upskilling intervention might seem ready for scaling based on participant support, but portfolio managers need to understand if it actually improves business outcomes and under what conditions. Meanwhile, a program showing modest impacts in an RCT may offer key implementation lessons that could boost impact in different iterations through a careful analysis of its components.</p> Four practical ways to achieve a nuanced understanding of portfolio impact <p>Understanding impact requires both rigor and context. As development practitioners, we need to appreciate the value and limitations of both observational and causal studies to develop a nuanced understanding of intervention outcomes. At Caribou, we employ four specific strategies to effectively navigate the challenges of diverse impact approaches within a portfolio:</p>  We strategically mix impact approaches within projects and portfolios. A mixed methods approach can be used either within specific projects or across a portfolio of projects to get a fuller picture of impact. Within a single project, combining descriptive with causal studies can provide both qualitative insights and rigorous validation. However, using both methods for every project is rarely feasible due to resource or time constraints. At the portfolio level, employing a mix of study types across different projects can balance depth and rigor — using observational methods where exploratory insights are needed and causal studies where robust validation is possible. This strategic use of mixed methods gives us a more comprehensive understanding of impact across varied contexts. However, resource-intensive causal studies may not be needed for every scenario, especially if strong evidence is already available.  We exercise caution in interpretation. In practical terms, this means recognizing the limitations of each study type and not overrelying on any one method. For instance, when descriptive studies indicate a positive outcome,we consider whether biases might influence these findings. If causal evidence is lacking, we use the insights cautiously and look for additional validation before making major decisions or scaling interventions.  We adapt evaluation methods by program phase. In early stages, we use descriptive methods to gather insights and inform design. As programs mature, we incorporate causal methods to validate impact and ensure robustness.  We communicate findings transparently. We communicate clearly about the type of evidence used and its limitations, helping decision-makers make well-considered choices.  <p>By strategically combining and understanding the strengths and limitations of observational and causal studies, portfolio managers can overcome the challenges of using diverse impact approaches and instead, embrace their contributions. This helps achieve a balanced understanding of what works, for whom, and in what&nbsp;context.</p><p>If you are interested in discussing our approach, please contact us at <a href="mailto:marius@cariboudigital.net">Marius Karabaczek</a> or <a href="mailto:niamh@cariboudigital.net">Niamh&nbsp;Barry</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/blending-impact-evidence-types-across-portfolios-a-strategic-approach-to-decision-making-b001b73f756c">Blending impact evidence types across portfolios: A strategic approach to decision-making</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A look at <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a> in response to&nbsp;Vitalik <p>Vitalik Buterin’s recent <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/12/03/wallets.html">reflections on the future of wallets</a> underscore some of the most critical challenges facing the Web3 ecosystem today. Usability, security, and cross-chain interoperability are more than technical hurdles — they’re the foundation for making decentralized technologies truly accessible. At Ontology, these are the very issues we’ve been tackling as we build the infrastructure for self-sovereign identity and secure asset management in the Web3&nbsp;age.</p> The Wallet as the Gateway to&nbsp;Web3 <p>Vitalik aptly describes wallets as a user’s primary gateway to the decentralized world. Yet, for many, that gateway is still intimidating. Complex interfaces, fragmented support across chains, and opaque recovery mechanisms create barriers for all but the most technically savvy&nbsp;users.</p><p>We believe the future lies in wallets that seamlessly integrate usability with the robust principles of decentralization. To that end, we’re working on solutions that simplify multi-chain access while ensuring that users always remain in control of their assets and identities. The goal is clear: make wallets as intuitive as Web2 applications, but without sacrificing the self-sovereignty that makes Web3&nbsp;unique.</p> Redefining Security for Decentralized Systems <p>One of the blog’s most important points is the need for improved wallet security, particularly through social recovery and multisig options. These mechanisms offer a path to eliminate the vulnerabilities of single points of failure without reintroducing centralization.</p><p>At Ontology, our work in decentralized identity (DID) aligns perfectly here. DIDs enable users to control access to their own data and assets, with features like verifiable credentials and decentralized recovery mechanisms providing an additional layer of security. These innovations ensure that users can safeguard their wallets without relying on centralized platforms or entities.</p> Cross-Chain Interoperability and the Modular&nbsp;Wallet <p>As Vitalik points out, wallets must evolve to become modular, interoperable hubs for managing assets, identities, and decentralized applications (dApps). In this vision, a wallet isn’t just a tool for storing tokens — it’s a dynamic platform for accessing the entire Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>This shift mirrors our approach at Ontology. Through integrations with major blockchains and dApps, we’re enabling users to manage assets, interact with services, and control their identities seamlessly. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), play-to-earn games, and reputation systems demands a wallet infrastructure that isn’t tied to one chain but instead functions as a bridge across ecosystems.</p> Decentralized Identity as the Missing&nbsp;Link <p>Vitalik touches on a critical element of future wallets: identity. Wallets that incorporate decentralized identity and reputation can transform how users interact with Web3. At Ontology, we’ve long recognized this need. Decentralized identity (via our ONT ID framework) allows users to prove who they are, manage credentials, and build a reputation across platforms — all without compromising their privacy or&nbsp;control.</p><p>Imagine a world where users can log into dApps with a DID, conduct transactions using zero-knowledge proofs, and access services based on verifiable credentials — all from a single wallet. That’s the future we’re working&nbsp;toward.</p> The Path&nbsp;Forward <p>Vitalik’s vision for wallets is both an inspiration and a validation of the work many in the decentralized space are undertaking. At Ontology, we’re excited to contribute to this evolution by delivering the tools and infrastructure needed to make wallets more than just a utility — they should be the foundation of a user’s entire Web3 experience.</p><p>As we collectively tackle these challenges, the ultimate goal remains clear: to make Web3 usable, secure, and accessible to everyone, empowering individuals with the tools they need to truly own their digital&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Interested in trying out a wallet that provides a gateway into Web3, complete with the ability to control your identity?

<p><a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/en-gb">Thales</a> today announced the launch of Data Risk Intelligence, a groundbreaking Imperva Data Security Fabric (DSF) solution that proactively addresses the risks to data wherever it resides. This is the first solution uniting the risk and threat identification capabilities of the Imperva Data Security Fabric with the data protection capabilities of the Thales CipherTrust Data Security Platform, following Thales’s strategic acquisition of Imperva in December 2023.</p>
<p>In today’s modern digital landscape, organisations face challenges in managing security across an ever-growing attack surface while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards. With data and operations spread across cloud, on-premises and hybrid systems, security teams require constant, comprehensive visibility into where their data is, the types of data they have, and the potential risks to that data. In fact, according to the <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/data-threat-report">2024 Thales Data Threat Report</a>, 93% of enterprises reported an increase in threats compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Empowering Security Teams and SOCs with Enhanced Visibility and Control</p>
<p>The combined intelligence and contextual insights from Data Risk Intelligence provide a unified visibility of risks to critical data with a unique view of the strength of encryption for data across an organisation’s entire data estate. With this enhanced visibility, Data Risk Intelligence empowers CIOs, CISOs, and data risk specialists to accurately identify the most critical data that are at risk by severity and likelihood, enabling them to effectively prioritise risk mitigation with clear recommendations for corrective action.</p>
<p>Data Risk Intelligence delivers a highly confident risk score and clear recommendations for corrective action that are based on a wide-ranging set of data risk indicators through advanced analytics, built upon user permissions, data source vulnerabilities, use of encryption following NIST standards, monitoring of suspicious activities, and other customisable inputs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Todd Moore, Vice President, Data Security products at Thales: “The ability to view data risk in key dimensions across organisational risk, asset risk, and regulatory risk in one place is extremely impactful. Data Risk Intelligence is the first of many integrations between the Thales and Imperva platforms that empower our customers to protect their data and all the paths to it. ​ Through our combined platforms, Thales has all ​ the tools to help our customers understand their data security risks and provide a clear set of actions to mitigate these risks.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“The risks to enterprise data are multi-dimensional and organisations are struggling to address the volume and breadth of these risks while still maintaining optimal business operations,” said Jennifer Glenn, Research Director, Data and Information Security at IDC Security and Trust Group. “Centralising data risk visibility and management offers valuable context about the data – and its vulnerabilities – enabling organisations to prioritise protection where it’s needed most.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Key Benefits of Data Risk Intelligence:</p>
 
 Enhanced Risk Prioritisation: Combines risk-related intelligence from Data Security Fabric and CipherTrust Data Security Platform to deliver precise risk scores that drive confident decisions. 
 Comprehensive Visibility: Provides a unified view of data risks across the entire data estate, reducing complexity, delivering risk indicators, and recommending protective measures. 
 Customisable Risk Indicators: Allows organisations to tailor risk indicators to their specific environment, highlighting the most critical threats. 
 Encryption Integration: Leverages the encryption capabilities of the CipherTrust Data Security Platform to ensure data protection at all levels. 
 Advanced Analytics: Utilises posture-based and machine-learning behavioural risk indicators to identify and prioritise the highest-risk data.

<p>In the second release of 2024 we have improved OAuth 2.0 flow support to include URL encoded client credentials, made numerous improvements and corrections. Often the key element of any update is security. Within IDS 2024.2 release we’ve made available the very latest Tomcat patch as well as tested support for RedHat 8 and 9. We would like to point out that Redhat 7 / Centos 7 is no longer being supported by the open-source community, therefore support of this operating system has been removed from our System Recommendations pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For our long-standing customers, we are working to release updates to a number of SSO service modules. &nbsp;These are external elements which ease configuration or use of SSO within Identity Platform. Our IDaaS service naturally receives these updates as they are available, however, if you have a premises-based installation, we would ask you to open a Service Desk ticket to request the updated code for these external to SSO modules. We would also like to point out that the modules&nbsp;have only been tested on SSO 9.5.0 found within this IDS 2024.2 release of Identity Platform, so would encourage you to update your Identity Platform prior to updating the modules. If you have any questions, Operations is happy to help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As with all software, Ubisecure would like to encourage you to upgrade your Identity Platform in a timely manner. Please contact your Integration Partner or Ubisecure Account Representative with any questions. Ubisecure encourages all customers to review and schedule service upgrade to this latest release. Bringing system flexibility, security, and new features to ensure the best user experience possible for your businesses is our goal.&nbsp;</p>

   The post discusses the critical role of standards development in shaping modern technology and emphasizes the importance of early organizational engagement. Referencing an NSA/CISA report, it argues that participating in standards not only offers organizations influence and insights into technological trends but also drives innovation and ensures representation of their needs.

<p>I’ve been meaning to write a response to the report that came out this summer from the National Security Agency on standards development. With many of my clients taking a break for turkey and pie, I’m finally catching up on some writing. Let’s talk standards!</p>



<p>Standards development isn’t just an abstract exercise for senior engineers or academic theorists. It’s the foundation upon which modern technology is built and evolves, influencing everything from cybersecurity frameworks to consumer electronics. Every time you use the Internet, you’re benefiting from the collective brainpower that built the capabilities to get you there. A recent report from the NSA and CISA, “<a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3854885/nsa-publishes-enduring-security-framework-document-providing-recommendations-fo/">Recommendations for Increasing U.S. Participation &amp; Leadership in Standards Development</a>“, underscores the importance of standards development and provides a roadmap for bolstering U.S. involvement in shaping the future of critical technologies.</p>



<p>I’ll be honest: I’m not as anxious about U.S. leadership in the standards space, though I agree that the U.S. has, as a nation, lost some of its influence. That said, I think the content of this article applies to every single organization out there that relies on the Internet to conduct business. If you want to influence the digital world, you have to participate in defining how that world works.</p>



 Why Standards Matter to Organizations 



<p>Organizations (by which I mean companies, governments, educational institutions, etc etc etc) that participate in standards development often find themselves in a position of influence. They drive innovation while ensuring their needs and perspectives are addressed. Standards participation provides a direct channel to discuss regulatory challenges, improve interoperability, and gain early insights into technological trends. Despite these benefits, many organizations hesitate to get involved, perceiving the process as costly, time-consuming, or overly complex. OK, granted, they aren’t entirely wrong in that perception, but I think the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>



<p>From my experience working with standards bodies and related NGOs since 2010, it’s clear that active participation is the key to meaningful impact. The organizations that dedicate time and resources to this effort are the ones that shape the dialogue, influence regulations, and, ultimately, improve the functionality of the Internet and related technologies.</p>



 Early Engagement: A Competitive Advantage 



<p>One point from the NSA/CISA report that I keep coming back to is the emphasis on early engagement in standards development. Getting involved early in emerging technologies lets organizations take the lead, shaping standards to fit their goals. Whether it’s contributing to the development of cryptographic standards to counter the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/05/25/preparing-for-the-quantum-shift-in-cybersecurity/">looming quantum threat</a> or collaborating on protocols to enhance digital identity, early involvement ensures organizations are not just reacting to changes but actively shaping them.</p>



 The Consequences of Sitting on the Sidelines 



<p>The report highlights a harsh reality: failing to engage early risks allowing other players—potentially with competing interests—to dominate the conversation. This isn’t just a hypothetical concern; history is full of examples where delayed participation led to standards that didn’t account for the needs of key stakeholders, creating hurdles for businesses and end-users alike. (I’m going to point to RFC 8471, “The Token Binding Protocol” as one example some of my readers will be familiar with.&nbsp;That specification was pretty much abandoned because it <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/OkdLUyYmY1E/m/w2ESAeshBgAJ">didn’t meet the need</a>.)</p>



<p>A particularly compelling example lies in the realm of cybersecurity. Standards for multi-factor authentication and passwordless systems, for instance, have been driven by those actively participating in groups like the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>. Organizations that joined these efforts early have seen the benefits of enhanced security measures that align with their operational realities.</p>



 The Role of Academia and Workforce Development 



<p>The report also rightly emphasizes the importance of fostering a standards-savvy workforce. Academic institutions should play a critical role here, but they can’t do it alone. Organizations must invest in training their employees, encouraging mentorship, and prioritizing standards participation as part of professional development. This investment isn’t just about building internal expertise—it’s about ensuring the longevity and relevance of the organization in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>



 A Call to Action

 This Month in Digital Identity — December&nbsp;Edition <p>Welcome to the December edition of our monthly digital identity series! This month, we explore how digital identity technology is safeguarding academic integrity, ensuring the credibility of research in an era of rising identity fraud. Dive into the GAO’s call for robust civil rights protections as federal agencies increasingly rely on AI and facial recognition. Discover the transformative potential of Digital Travel Credentials and decentralized identity in revolutionizing international travel. Lastly, we’ll examine the urgent need for unified frameworks to align emerging technologies with civil liberties.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at what you’ll find in this month’s insights:</p> Protecting Academic Integrity with Digital Identity Technology <p>The scholarly publishing industry is grappling with an alarming rise in identity fraud and unethical practices like paper mills and author impersonation, undermining trust in academic research. To counteract these challenges, STM Solutions has unveiled a comprehensive report titled “Trusted Identity in Academic Publishing: The Central Role of Digital Identity in Research Integrity.” Developed in collaboration with a Researcher Identity Task and Finish Group, this initiative aims to provide practical guidelines for the effective use of digital identity technology.</p><p>The report calls for stronger identity verification mechanisms while respecting inclusivity and privacy. It emphasizes how digital identity solutions can authenticate researchers while maintaining their autonomy, thus preserving the credibility of academic contributions. A crucial aspect of this framework is its scalability, which accommodates the diverse range of research disciplines and global contexts without being intrusive.</p><p>This strategic document also advocates an industry-wide approach, urging publishers, institutions, and researchers to unite for seamless integration of identity verification systems. By doing so, the academic community can address fraud more effectively, sustain open collaboration, and enhance trust in published findings.</p> GAO Highlights Need for Civil Rights Protections Amid Federal Data&nbsp;Use <p>As federal agencies increasingly rely on advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and facial recognition, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about their impact on civil rights. Despite the growing adoption of these tools, a recent GAO report reveals that existing federal guidelines fall short in protecting against biases, inequities, and potential abuses of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>While some agencies, such as Homeland Security, have begun creating frameworks to address ethical concerns, the overall response remains fragmented. For instance, the Privacy Act of 1974 governs data handling but does not encompass safeguards for emerging technologies. This leaves significant gaps in accountability, allowing for inadvertent discrimination and systemic inequities.</p><p>GAO recommends that Congress establish robust, government-wide civil rights guidelines tailored to emerging technologies. These should include privacy safeguards, risk assessments, and ethical oversight to prevent misuse. Furthermore, the report stresses the importance of bridging workforce skills gaps by investing in specialized training, enabling public agencies to navigate the complexities of these evolving&nbsp;tools.</p><p>This call to action underscores a need for comprehensive policy reform, ensuring that technological advancements align with societal values and protect citizens’ fundamental rights.</p> Revolutionizing International Travel: Digital Identity Innovation <p>Imagine arriving at your tropical destination just 30 minutes after stepping off the plane. This seamless travel experience is now a reality, thanks to a groundbreaking trial conducted by SITA, Indicio, and Delta Air Lines, in collaboration with Aruba’s government. Using Digital Travel Credentials (DTC) and IATA’s OneID, the initiative has redefined how travelers journey from Atlanta to&nbsp;Aruba.</p><p>The process begins with the DTC, a cryptographically secure digital version of a passport, allowing travelers to preauthorize their journey. At Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta, IATA’s OneID streamlines check-ins, baggage handling, and boarding processes. Upon landing in Aruba, passengers cross the border within seconds, holding the data required for verification securely on their mobile&nbsp;devices.</p><p>The initiative demonstrates the potential of decentralized digital identity technology, merging efficiency, security, and privacy. By combining the DTC and OneID workflows, travelers experienced reduced wait times and an overall enhanced travel experience. This innovation highlights a significant leap toward a unified, interoperable digital travel&nbsp;system.</p><p>The success of this trial is more than a technological milestone—it is a glimpse into the future of international travel. During the IATA World Passenger Symposium in Bangkok, SITA’s Michael Zureik will present the findings, signaling a major shift toward global adoption of decentralized identity solutions.</p> Emerging Technologies and the Call for Unified Civil Liberties Frameworks <p>The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified alarming gaps in the way federal agencies handle civil rights issues associated with emerging technologies. AI and facial recognition tools, while enabling efficiencies, have also amplified biases and raised concerns about discriminatory practices. Existing laws, such as the Privacy Act of 1974, focus on privacy but fail to address the civil liberties challenges posed by modern&nbsp;tools.</p><p>GAO’s analysis of 24 federal agencies revealed inconsistent approaches to mitigating these risks. While some, such as the Department of Homeland Security, have developed initial risk assessment tools, these efforts lack uniformity and coordination across agencies. Moreover, workforce shortages and outdated regulatory frameworks hinder the effective adoption of ethical practices.</p><p>To close these gaps, GAO urges Congress to create a government-wide framework addressing ethical data use, transparency, and accountability. The report also highlights the need for investments in workforce training and infrastructure, enabling agencies to better respond to technological advancements while protecting civil liberties.</p><p>This recommendation seeks to balance the promise of innovation with the need to uphold social justice, ensuring that government operations remain fair, inclusive, and trustworthy.</p><p>We look forward to bringing you more insightful updates as we continue to explore the latest trends and innovations in the field of digital identity. Together, we can contribute to a more secure and inclusive digital&nbsp;future.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/this-month-in-digital-identity-december-edition-d7c4fd503c87">This Month in Digital Identity — December Edition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Bank fraud continues to rise sharply worldwide, driven by an increasing proliferation of AI-driven impersonation, deepfake attacks, and the rapid emergence of <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/insights/understanding-fraud-as-a-service/#:~:text=Fraud%2Das%2Da%2DService%20(FaaS)%20represents%20an,fraud%20more%20easily%20and%20efficiently.">fraud-as-a-service (FaaS)</a> cybercrime. The risks of bank fraud are further compounded by the increasing worldwide adoption of digital banking and <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/embedded-finance.html">embedded finance</a>, creating new opportunities for malicious actors. While banks continue to invest heavily in developing their fraud detection, response, and prevention capabilities in line with rapid developments in the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/industry/financial-services/global-financial-services-regulations.html">regulatory landscape</a>, many are left with highly fragmented strategies that struggle to meet the evolving threat landscape. One of the key reasons behind this is the lack of holistic thinking about how “upstream” fraud prevention works in concert with “downstream” fraud prevention to drive real-time access decisioning at all stages of the customer journey. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Hi, everybody. My name is Mike Engle, co-founder and head of strategy here at 1Kosmos. I’m joined today by Jens Hinrichsen. Say hello, Jens.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Hello, everybody.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Jens is our head of sales here at 1Kosmos, spends a lot of time in the trenches. And today we’re here to talk about remote caller verification. We have an acronym for that, RCV. But Jens, would you mind giving your quick pitch on what RCV is for the folks out there?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah, I would love to. And I think certainly also, Mike, with all the conversations that we’re both fortunate to have with a variety of organizations globally, please chime in with some of your own perspective as well. But I think remote caller verification, whether it is IT service desk for employees, contractors, other third parties that are interacting with an organization and have access to the inner sanctum, if you will, of an organization versus, say, contact center or call center. Where for years the industry has been working on solutions to mitigate fraud from a customer or outside facing standpoint, this is really about these emerging threat actor groups. Not even so much emerging, but Scattered Spider certainly has taken the cake recently in terms of being in the press most from MGM, Caesers, a host of other organizations where they have as a group socially engineered their way through the IT service desk of an organization.</p>
<p>So in the case of 1Kosmos, hi, I’m Mike Engle, I’m a co-founder. Service desk agent’s like, “Oh, my gosh, I got a co-founder on the call.” And if it’s not Mike and it’s a threat actor group, very charming, you name it, they can socially engineer their way in, get the credential reset, and then have Mike’s access to the company. So it is a big area of threat. It’s a big area of inefficiency also that organizations are trying to get better shored up. Mike, any other thoughts you have on that?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, so a lot of friends in the industry, I talk to them about this and they don’t have the right tools typically. So they’re using old, tired methods or no methods. They just turn it off because they can’t trust it. And an example would be secrets. What’s your employee ID? What was your date of hire? What was the amount of your last payroll deposits? Which I wouldn’t know that. So sometimes those are too hard and don’t work or they’re too easy to guess and anybody can use them. So social engineering has been around forever, but they’ve gotten really good at finding the information, the legacy ways that people have been using over time. What are some of the ways that they’re using now to get into help desks?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Well, it’s interesting, too. I think back to the point we made earlier from a fraud standpoint, I mean, there’s been social engineering going on for ages. Whatever that chain looks like, phishing, malware, getting information, and then pretending to be a customer of an organization, malicious actors are looking for economic gain and other impact for a variety of reasons. But where you can have big impact is when you’re able to infiltrate an organization. It’s one thing to steal $50,000 from a customer of an organization. It’s a big deal. You want to mitigate that, but as far as being able to get into the inner bowels of an organization’s IT stack moving laterally, whatever the case is, that is a huge area of focus these days.</p>
<p>So a lot of the, call it, the social engineering talent, the charms, I mean, Mike, you and I have even through different circles heard some of these calls and they’re … Wow, if I’m the service desk agent, yeah, I’m believing this person. You don’t have an ID for what reason or you don’t know this for whatever reason? Sure, of course. So I think it’s really been the same playbook focused on this avenue now. And again, it is really, really easy for these sophisticated threat actors to sound very believable, have core information that’s needed that would get a service desk agent to say, “Mr. Engle, co-founder of 1Kosmos, that’s fine that you don’t have this and this, but I’m going to issue a new credential to you right away. I want to make sure you’re happy.”</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right, and they may create a sense of urgency. I’m a doctor, I got a patient here at a table and I can’t unlock my stethoscope, whatever it is. So yeah, that’s a common tactic as well that we’ve seen them use. And then once they get that initial credential, they’re typically 50% of the way of getting into the core network and things go downhill from there. And so yeah, the traditional KBA, which you would think stands for knowledge based authentication.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Knowledge based authentication. Right.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
We actually refer to it as known by anybody, KBA. So it really is close to useless. And whenever I opened a new financial services account and they pop up those five questions, what was the type of car you had when you were five years old or whatever, I run for the hills if I can. So what can we do about it? How does 1Kosmos, for example, mitigate this threat?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah. And even, Mike, before we go there, and I think one of the examples, what’s one of the KBA examples you’ve used before? It’s like your grandmother’s shoe size when she was nine or something. Well, whatever the iteration is, before we even get into solution, I think some of the really interesting parts that we’ve gotten more intimate with is even the other ways that organizations are trying to address this. So KBA, sure, that’s one. Known by anybody, as you said. OTP. Hey, I’m going to push you an OTP. Well, we still don’t know it’s Mike. And then we’re also seeing a lot of organizations, not even necessarily just at the highest level of privilege, but even more broadly where it’s an escalation to the manager. And you do the math on that in terms of just sheer productivity loss and in some cases you might not still be actually verifying it’s that genuine user.</p>
<p>So there’s these kind of clunky ways and tools that we as an industry have been trying to address this. And so to your question, Mike, it’s like, well, gosh, what is a way that an organization can do this where it’s effectively automated? So somebody is still calling into the service desk, but you’re removing the onus of verification from the service desk agent because the reality is service desk agents are being asked to do so many things already and they’re always do it in this amount of time, get it faster, faster. So you don’t want to forsake quality, but how do you have a very easy process for both agent and user, whether genuine or a malicious actor, to undertake that then gives the credence that, yes, this is actually Mr. Engle calling in? And so there are a few ways to do it. One that really gives, I’ll say, the minimum viable baseline would be a one-time identity verification or identity proofing event where I call into the service desk and I’m pretending to be you.</p>
<p>And the service desk agent says, “Okay, Mr. Engle, I’m going to send you a link either to your phone, to your email address.” There are a variety of things that you have to take into consideration obviously in terms of companies that might not have employees be able to have phones or are they company owned, et cetera. Those are all things that you see and we navigate accordingly, but the very simple process of opening up a link, scanning the front and back of a driver’s license, a passport, some other government issued document, and then doing a matching selfie against the image that’s on that document. And what we can do with very high assurance is give a thumbs up or thumbs down. And all we would do is simply say the agent, “Yep, this is Mr. Engle,” or in my case, pretending to be you, “No, this is not.” And so that’s a really simple initial way to do it. The really exciting part, and this is what permeates the next generation, which is actually here now and gaining steam, is the user control.</p>
<p>That reusable identity of, hey, once I have verified myself, once I essentially have an identity wallet that I can then present wherever it’s needed that proves that I am like Engle and I don’t have to go back through the whole process of scanning something, selfie, et cetera. So the elegance is there. You get high assurance, quick and easy, reduces call center times. And then again, you’re removing that, again, onus on the service desk agent of having to be the one. And there are other companies, too, Mike, where it’s, “Hey, can you hold your ID up to the camera?” It’s hard enough to tell that they’re real when you’re holding them, much less over a camera.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah. And when I hold my license up to a camera, now what’s the other person doing with that information? First of all, they can’t verify it. It’s too hard. You can’t see the little security features and then now I’ve just showed you my driver’s license number. That’s something you don’t want floating out there on a video call. So yeah, the privacy preserving aspects are really key. If you can assure the help desk and your remote callers, your remote employees, or customers that it’s safe, then they’ll trust it and feel good about using it as well. That’s a great point. Yeah, so I think we’ve about done it. I guess one last thing is how hard is it to implement a tool like identity-based biometric verification for a service desk?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah. What’s the usual answer? Well, we could have had it in yesterday, so you got a couple of flavors. And I think the great thing for us as an industry is you can literally start as fast as you can start with, call it, a touchless integration where you’re simply calling out to an API. That link that we talked about earlier that gets sent to the user, that’s essentially a service. It’s a hosted service and you’re not having to replumb or do anything on day one within your organization. You can address the threat, make it a simpler process literally within a couple of weeks. And then the subsequent steps that I know we’ve observed with our customers is there are things that you can do to tighten some of the workflows, whether it’s ServiceNow or whatever the service desk system or backend might be.</p>
<p>But then that next step, and it can come pretty quickly, is the organization’s adoption and use of that reusable identity. And it’s a pretty powerful thing when we think about especially at the point of, say, onboarding. Whether it’s say HR onboarding, contract, or third-party onboarding, you’re doing that verification once. The user now owns it. You made a great point about privacy preservation. I mean, that’s what we’re all in the space for, right? It’s one thing to have a point in time, but you have to make sure it’s privacy preserving. But then also, let’s make it efficient for everybody. Do the verification once and then all you’re doing is you’re essentially authenticating into systems or doing high-risk transactions or whatever the case is after that.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right, right. And you can’t implement something like this without uttering the words ROI, right?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
You have the obvious security benefits, stop bad guys, but the user experience is actually better. And then an organization can have 100,000 calls into a help desk a year. It’s an average of 30% to 50% are password reset or identity related, so why not remove that and save those calls from even coming in? You can automate this, you can do it in a self-service password reset manner as well, SSPR. So yeah, a lot of reasons to do it.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah. Well, no, and you’re right. And it’s fun to build these business cases alongside organizations because it’s not just a security risk mitigation. There are very direct, like you said, Mike, very direct savings, overall operating efficiencies. Even to the point where as an organization lifts its security posture, they’re getting better policy. Their cyber insurance policies are coming down or at least not going up as quickly as they might go, depending on what most of us are feeling in the industry. So that’s a great point, that this is a really a multi-pronged business case. And I think we’ve observed 10, 20, 30X return on an investment in even just the first year.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah. Yeah, it’s a no brainer. So hopefully we’ll get the phone calls before the bad guys get in and not after, but either way …</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Mike’s personal number is…</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
That’s right. Well, cool. Thanks so much for joining. It’s been fun chatting with you about this. Hopefully somebody out there will see it and will spark some ideas to make a difference in the world of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Brilliant. Great chat, Mike.</p>

<p>Colorado Expands Digital ID Options with Samsung Wallet Integration</p>



<p>Colorado residents can now add their driver’s license or state ID to Samsung Wallet, allowing for digital use in certain situations, such as at select TSA checkpoints like Denver International Airport. Users can verify their identity by unlocking their phone and using a QR code or digital ID, ensuring only necessary information is shared securely. Colorado has previously made digital IDs available through Apple and Google Wallets, as well as the state’s myColorado app. While digital IDs are gaining acceptance, they are intended to supplement, not replace, physical IDs, which residents should continue to carry. The Colorado DMV highlights this initiative as part of the state’s commitment to innovation, convenience, and enhanced security for its citizens. <a href="https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/local/2024/11/22/colorado-adds-samsung-wallet-to-digital-id-drivers-license-options/76483946007/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kXzlNb8msbCku-S2pHaZ6AWHtyjo9zaxOvr7XPOWmIMw5nU4bmZWzU8WasrHBz-6I14A4">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>UK Releases DIATF 0.4: Paving the Way for Digital Identity Certification in 2025</p>

<p>North Korean Hackers Exploit AI and Remote Work to Fund Weapons Program with Stolen Crypto</p>



<p>Security researchers at Cyberwarcon revealed that North Korean hackers have stolen billions in cryptocurrency over the past decade by posing as venture capitalists, recruiters, and IT workers to fund the country’s weapons program. These campaigns involve creating false identities using AI and infiltrating multinational corporations, often with the help of U.S.-based facilitators to bypass sanctions. Key tactics include phishing, malware-laden downloads disguised as meeting tools or skills tests, and fraudulent employment schemes that exploit remote working trends. Despite sanctions and investigative efforts, experts warn that North Korean hacking operations remain a persistent and evolving threat to global cybersecurity. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-billions-in-crypto-by-posing-as-vcs-recruiters-and-it-workers/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--HooWu2ULJc5fzd6WYvpzhfz2ncc8Brxp0GzrbYS-gfeNGRga8R8n89W4L7mpB9nHijUDa">(Source)</a></p>

 ⚖️ Policy and Regulatory 



 



<p>DOJ Pushes for Google Chrome Sale in Landmark Antitrust Battle</p>



<p>Australia has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media platforms like Instagram, Snap Inc., and TikTok, effective in late 2025. The legislation, backed by 77% of Australians, aims to tackle youth mental health issues but raises concerns about privacy and digital surveillance. Critics argue it could lead to excessive data collection and limit access to support networks, while supporters, including parent groups, view it as a necessary move against cyberbullying. Tech companies are pushing back, claiming the law lacks clear implementation guidelines. This decision is a political win for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese but may complicate Australia’s relations with U.S. tech firms. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-passes-social-media-ban-children-under-16-2024-11-28/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--HooWu2ULJc5fzd6WYvpzhfz2ncc8Brxp0GzrbYS-gfeNGRga8R8n89W4L7mpB9nHijUDa">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Finastra Investigates Data Breach of Secure File Transfer Platform, Impacting Global Banks</p>



<p>Pornhub Challenges UK Age Verification Rules as New Digital Identity Solutions Emerge</p>



<p>Pornhub has controversially claimed it is a social media platform, not a pornography website, to argue it is not subject to age verification requirements under the UK’s Online Safety Act until July. The company has previously blocked access in U.S. states requiring age checks and may implement options like facial age estimation or ID uploads. Meanwhile, Spain-based TechPump has partnered with Gataca to launch an age verification system using a free self-sovereign digital identity (SSI) wallet that protects user anonymity while verifying age. Gataca’s solution complies with the EU’s Digital Services Act and has been approved by Spain’s Data Protection Agency for secure age data processing. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/techpump-signs-with-gataca-as-pornhub-plays-word-games-with-ofcom?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--HooWu2ULJc5fzd6WYvpzhfz2ncc8Brxp0GzrbYS-gfeNGRga8R8n89W4L7mpB9nHijUDa">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>NY Attorney General Fines Geico and Travelers $11.3M for COVID-Era Data Breaches</p>



<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has fined Geico and Travelers Indemnity Company $11.3 million for data breaches during the COVID-19 pandemic that exposed the personal information of over 120,000 individuals. The cybersecurity failures allowed attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in Geico’s online quoting tool and access sensitive data, including driver’s license numbers, likely contributing to identity theft and fraudulent unemployment claims. This enforcement action highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity measures. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/11/26/geico-and-travelers-fined-113-million-for-data-breaches-exposing-120000/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8SXFJuLxXOhkT_jnH2JSooqwsScJ5O7_BepGTLl3Ns4Fqx63gYd1dLmvU2M058Y02-6atI">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Australia’s Fast-Tracked Age Verification Bill Sparks Privacy and Democracy Concerns</p>



<p>The Australian government is moving to fast-track legislation for age verification on social media and pornography sites, despite limited public consultation. Critics argue this rushed process undermines democratic decision-making and raises privacy concerns, especially as the law requires collecting personal or biometric data, which could lead to data misuse and push minors to less regulated platforms. Digital rights advocates are divided on its effectiveness, with some suggesting a broader digital duty of care instead of targeted restrictions. Exemptions for sites like YouTube and unclear enforcement only add to the controversy surrounding user safety versus government control. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/rush-to-pass-australia-age-verification-law-causing-outcry?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--r3hXEs_pX45ZnVNpxp_zZDuNng6vItVL5pZIe3noAQW8UaYUmJBrtKcWY44LfuDp2ThvK">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Bluesky Faces EU Scrutiny for Non-Compliance with Digital Services Act Amid Rapid Growth</p>



<p>According to the European Commission, BlueSky, a fast-growing social media platform competing with Elon Musk’s X, has breached EU regulations by failing to disclose details such as its number of EU users and legal establishment. Despite a nearly 300% increase to 3.5 million daily users after Musk’s controversial endorsement of Donald Trump, Bluesky has not complied with the Digital Services Act (DSA). The Commission has not yet contacted Bluesky directly and is seeking member states’ help to find an EU representative. Although it doesn’t meet the 45 million EU monthly user threshold for very large online platforms under the DSA, continued non-compliance could result in penalties of up to 6% of global annual revenues. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9083d7f8-d2e6-4e08-a324-8def68258efd?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-nLLgwsdo5K8GNDG2dUVSVmuM--1vaSORTtA363uShnTvmFORf-5Wkx0y28RCPkZLo-JF">(Source)</a></p>

The company activated its response plan, involving external advisors and taking some systems offline to contain the breach.

      Redefining Sustainability: The End of Greenwashing 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In their insightful articles (<a href="https://www.sciencenorway.no/economy-greenhouse-gas-emissions-greenwashing/how-blockchain-technology-can-effectively-combat-greenwashing/2421574?utm_source=chatgpt.com">here</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bse.3338">here</a>), Professors Arne Nygaard and Ragnhild Silkoset highlight the pervasive issue of greenwashing, where companies falsely present products as environmentally friendly, thereby eroding consumer trust and undermining genuine sustainability efforts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>They eloquently argue that blockchain technology is the key to tackling greenwashing by ensuring that sustainability claims are traceable, transparent and verifiable. At UNISOT, we see blockchain not just as a technical solution but as a foundational element in redefining trust in global supply chains. Our <a href="https://unisot.com/digital-product-passport/">Digital Product Passports (DPP)</a>, powered by Enterprise Blockchain technology, provide an immutable and transparent record of a product’s entire lifecycle. This aligns with Nygaard and Silkoset’s emphasis on the need for reliable, traceable, and tamper-proof product information to mitigate greenwashing.</p>
   UNISOT’s Solutions in Action&nbsp; 
       
  Full Transparency Across the Supply Chain 
 
<p>Nygaard and Silkoset stress the importance of transparency, emphasizing that consumers and regulators demand trustworthy documentation of environmental claims. UNISOT’s blockchain-based platform ensures that data entered at every step of the supply chain -whether it’s sourcing raw materials, manufacturing or distribution – is immutably stored and easily accessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example:<br>
A clothing manufacturer can prove its fabrics are made from 100% recycled materials, with verifiable data on sourcing, energy use and CO₂ emissions. This aligns with the authors’ call for “proof, not promises.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Trust Through Decentralized Verification 
 
<p>The authors criticize the traditional reliance on centralized certification bodies, which can be susceptible to errors, biases or even corruption. Blockchain decentralizes this process, enabling all participants in the supply chain to input, audit and access data independently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UNISOT’s Impact:<br>
Smart Digital Twins provide a decentralized, interactive record of each product, ensuring that sustainability claims are verified by multiple stakeholders – not just the company making the claim.&nbsp;</p>
       
 Consumer Empowerment Through Digital Product Passports 
 
<p>Nygaard and Silkoset highlight how blockchain can empower consumers by giving them easy access to verified product data. UNISOT’s DPPs make this a reality. By scanning a QR code or NFC tag, consumers can instantly access a product’s history, including:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Carbon footprint&nbsp; 
 
 
 Ethical Sourcing Certifications&nbsp; 
 
 
 Compliance with environmental standards&nbsp; 
 
<p>Example:<br>
A customer buying sustainable seafood can verify that the fish was ethically farmed, transported with minimal emissions, and complies with regulatory standards like the EU Digital Product Passport mandate.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Combating Greenwashing with Immutable Data 
 
<p>A key point raised by Nygaard and Silkoset is the role of blockchain in preventing greenwashing by ensuring data integrity. Companies can no longer alter or selectively report data to present a false image of sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UNISOT’s Solution:<br>
Our Enterprise Blockchain backbone ensures that every claim – whether about emissions, sourcing or recycling – is recorded in a tamper-proof manner. Any discrepancy between what is claimed and what the data shows is immediately apparent.&nbsp;</p>
       
  Real-Time Monitoring and Reporting 
 
<p>Nygaard and Silkoset emphasize the importance of real-time tracking to provide accurate and up-to-date information. UNISOT’s integration with IoT devices ensures that real-time data on energy use, emissions and material flows is continuously recorded and accessible.&nbsp;</p>
         <blockquote>
<p>“Blockchain technology offers a more robust solution against the risk of greenwashing than traditional trademarks and certification systems.” – Professors Arne Nygaard and Ragnhild Silkoset</p>
</blockquote>
          Why This Matters&nbsp; 
<p>Nygaard and Silkoset argue that trust is the cornerstone of a sustainable economy and that companies who invest in transparency and verifiability stand to gain a competitive advantage. With upcoming regulatory changes, such as the EU’s Digital Product Passport and increasing consumer demands for transparency, companies that fail to act risk not only fines but also irreparable damage to their reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 UNISOT: Turning Vision Into Reality&nbsp; 
<p>By adopting UNISOT’s solutions, companies can move beyond vague sustainability claims and embrace a future where every claim is backed by immutable data, every product has a story, and every consumer has the power to make informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battle against greenwashing isn’t just about avoiding bad press; it’s about building a better, more sustainable world. As Professors Nygaard and Silkoset highlight, blockchain technology is the solution to unethical practices, and UNISOT is here to lead the way.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">John Tolbert</a></p> The Rapid Digitalization of OT, ICS, and IoT: Opportunities and Security Risks 
<p>In many enterprises, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT) systems were kept isolated from IT environments, both logically and physically. ICS is generally considered a subset of OT. Internet of Things (IoT) devices, however, were designed to be networked, enabling real-time or latent data transmissions to applications to generate insights and to provide remote control capabilities. The connectivity of OT, ICS, and IoT systems to the cloud or corporate networks has increased across many industries, from manufacturing and pharmaceuticals to oil and gas and aerospace.</p>
<p>While this sea change in network connectivity and access policies offers benefits such as predictive maintenance, asset optimization, and enhanced productivity, it also dramatically expands the attack surface. Cyber attacks targeting OT, ICS, and IoT systems are no longer hypothetical. Attacks can have direct and severe consequences, from halting production lines to causing environmental damage or even endangering lives. Cybersecurity in OT and ICS needs to address unique constraints, including:</p>
 
 Reliability requirements: OT systems often operate on very strict schedules and have uptime requirements that cannot be violated without severe safety and financial consequences. Security updates or patches need to be carefully planned to avoid disrupting critical processes. Allowing real-time patch updates directly from vendors is most often prohibited. 
 Legacy systems: Many OT systems run on outdated hardware and software that lack the capacity or compatibility for modern security solutions. This means performing timely security updates may be practically impossible. Other measures may be needed to protect and contain such legacy systems. 
 Physical access: In industrial environments, devices and sensors may be spread across large areas or even in distant, isolated locations, which makies physical security, network segmentation, and secure remote access imperative. 
 
<p>To address these limitations, security strategies must be adapted to meet the unique requirements of OT/ICS/IoT, with specific attention paid to the differences from standard IT infrastructure.</p>
 Key Differences in Securing OT, ICS, and IoT Environments 
<p>Despite the overlap between IT and OT, the two are distinct in their technological requirements, operational demands, and security challenges.</p>
 
 IT Security: IT security solutions rely on a variety of well-established tool types like firewalls, EPDR, SIEM, SOAR, and IAM to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality. IT environments tend to prioritize agility, which allows more frequent software updates and rapid deployment of new security measures without significant downtime. IT tools use common protocols like HTTPS, SMTP, SMB, LDAP, etc., and for which many security solutions already exist. 
 IoT Security: IoT devices can be found in a wide range of environments, from smart homes to warehouses to industrial facilities. They are often resource-constrained, with limited processing power and memory, which can restrict the type and complexity of security protocols they can support. Many IoT devices were simply not designed with security in mind. IoT devices use protocols such as CoAP, MQTT, and XMPP, which are less common in traditional IT and thus, IT security tools are less likely to have out-of-the-box support for. Vendor-provided or third-party IoT security solutions generally focus on ensuring data integrity, communication confidentiality over IoT protocols, protecting against device spoofing, and managing device identities and access. 
 OT/ICS Security: OT/ICS systems are generally custom-engineered for specific applications, often running on special or proprietary protocols like ModBus, DNP3, OPC-UA, and S7. Security in OT/ICS environments focuses on maintaining uptime, integrity, and safe operations, with stringent requirements to avoid disruptions. Certain OT protocols lack built-in support for encryption or authentication, requiring additional protective measures. In most ICS and Critical Infrastructure Systems (CIS), safety of workers and the surroundings takes precedence over even computing security. 
 
<p>Security strategies for IT and OT therefore need to account for these differences. IT security focuses more on malware prevention via endpoint protection detection and response (EPDR), identity and access management (IAM), and network segmentation, while OT security demands robust intrusion detection, continuous monitoring, and a deep understanding of OT/ICS/IoT protocols to detect anomalous or malicious behavior.</p>
 Navigating the Divide Between OT Engineering and IT Software Engineering 
<p>Another difficulty in securing OT, ICS, and IoT environments is the difference in worldviews between OT engineers and IT software engineers. OT engineers prioritize reliability and safety, because failures in OT environments can have immediate and severe consequences. Conversely, software developers tend to prioritize rapid innovation and adding functionality, which can be a higher priority for their IT customers.</p>
<p>This culture clash can lead to friction in implementing security measures for IT and OT systems. Some challenges include:</p>
 
 Risk tolerance: OT engineers have a low tolerance for change and untested solutions, while IT software developers are accustomed to coding and testing new technologies frequently to keep up with IT customers’ demands. 
 Update and patch schedules: Software vendors may push regular software updates to deploy new features and security patches, whereas OT engineers have to schedule patches and updates comparatively infrequently, perhaps just one or two times per year, and see these as potential disruptions to uptime or performance. 
 
<p>Organizations can take two different approaches here. The first is to leverage IT security systems where they make sense: deploying EPDR agents where permitted by OT vendors, using OT/ICS/IoT-aware Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions to find and stop malicious actors, using SIEM and SOAR systems for collection and analysis of all telemetry and additional response actions. The other approach is to implement dedicated OT/ICS security solutions. These OT/ICS security solutions can cover additional functions such as asset discovery and classification, scanning of USB devices (used for updating firmware) for malware, as well as monitoring and anomaly detection, and are designed to work in these environments with HMIs, PLCs, SCADA, and IoT devices.</p>
 Keeping Pace with Digitalization: Adaptive Security Strategies 
<p>As OT digitalization accelerates, security measures need to be agile, capable of adapting to emerging threats, and proactive in addressing potential vulnerabilities. Key strategies include:</p>
 
 Zero Trust Architecture: Zero Trust models work on the principle of “never trust, always verify,” ensuring that every request for access is authenticated and authorized. This approach reduces lateral movement in networks, limiting the scope of damage if a device is compromised. Zero Trust Network Access is particularly important for securing remote access by vendors and contractors into OT/ICS networks. 
 Network Segmentation: Network segmentation divides the network into isolated segments or zones. In OT, this means separating different parts of the production floor or critical control systems from non-critical zones, thus limiting the exposure of sensitive systems to potential threats. OT centric security solutions are often designed to enforce separation in accordance with the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture. 
 Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection: IT and OT systems can benefit from anomaly detection tools that learn regular patterns of behavior and trigger alerts when unusual activity occurs. Since some OT components lack basic security features like authentication, monitoring for deviations in traffic and user behavior can help detect and contain potential threats before they escalate. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>Securing OT/ICS/IoT environments in the current era of rapid digitalization is a multifaceted challenge that requires a tailored approach for each organization.

With every second on the track critical, the challenge showcased how data can shape decisions that define race outcomes.</p><p>The challenge focused on predicting four essential components of pit stop strategies: the number of stints, tire compound choices, laps per stint, and average lap times. Using innovative approaches and advanced algorithms, participants modeled scenarios accounting for starting grid positions, driver performance, and unpredictable race conditions like weather changes or mid-race interruptions. The goal was to provide actionable insights for teams navigating the complexities of modern Formula 1 strategy.</p><p>The challenge demonstrated the intersection of sports and data science by combining real-world datasets with predictive modeling. It highlighted the importance of adaptability and precision as models needed to handle variations in track conditions, driver strategies, and car performance. This competition emphasized leveraging analytics in one of the world’s fastest and most data-intensive sports.</p>2024 Mexico GP Prediction Challenge — Top&nbsp;10 Podium  1st Place: Aleksandr Lazutin&nbsp;[Poland] <p>Aleks used three Random Forest Regression models to predict stints, tire life, average lap time, and a Random Forest Classifier to predict tire compounds. The model incorporated predictions for individual drivers and the entire grid, offering flexibility in application for race strategy. By organizing predictions into a modular structure, Aleksandr ensured each component could function independently while supporting the broader&nbsp;model.</p><p>He accounted for driver and team variability by including performance metrics, historical data, and team-specific strategies. The model incorporated external factors like weather and mid-race incidents, ensuring it adapted to dynamic race conditions. Outputs provided detailed stint breakdowns and timelines to support decision-making.</p><p>Aleks ensured the model could be implemented without complications by delivering structured outputs and comprehensive documentation. This design enabled the evaluation team to apply the model efficiently, ensuring its top ranking in the challenge.</p> 2nd Place: Yuichiro “Firepig” [Japan] <p>Firepig created a three-step model that used decision trees, linear regression, and random forests to predict tire strategies, laps per stint, and average lap times. The model started with tire compound predictions, followed by stint and lap estimates, and ended with lap time calculations. Firepig’s approach allowed it to adapt to changing race conditions, such as weather or race interruptions.</p><p>The model integrated data like grid position, tire compounds, and driver performance to align predictions with real-world racing strategies. Firepig included options for mid-race updates by allowing inputs like current laps, stint numbers, and weather conditions. This structure ensured the model could adjust to unpredictable scenarios during the&nbsp;race.</p><p>Firepig refined predictions using detailed feature engineering and cross-validation. The model secured second place in the competition by designing a tool that handled race variability and provided practical outputs.</p> 3rd Place: Yunus Gümüşsoy [Türkiye] <p>Yunus’ model combined XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost to predict stints, tire compounds, laps per stint, and average lap times. Yunus focused on building a robust data pipeline, merging historical and current-season data to create a comprehensive dataset. The model incorporated track-specific factors like altitude and straights to align predictions with the unique demands of the Mexican Grand&nbsp;Prix.</p><p>He integrated weather data, driver inputs, and car performance metrics to handle dynamic race scenarios. This adaptability allowed the model to remain effective under varying conditions. The implementation included clear input guidelines and outputs designed for practical use in race-day strategy planning.</p><p>Yunus secured third place by delivering a flexible, well-documented solution that bridged data science and Formula 1 strategy. His focus on track-specific insights and comprehensive data preparation set the model&nbsp;apart.</p> 2024 Championship <p>Our challenges offer prize pools from $10,000 to $20,000, distributed among the top 10 participants.

  <p>Most cyberattacks are identity-based and come in via endpoints. Identity Security on one hand and Endpoint Protection on the other thus are cornerstones of every successful cybersecurity strategy. EPDR (Endpoint Protection, Detection &amp; Response) has evolved as a unified approach that goes beyond traditional anti-malware and EPP (Endpoint Protection Platform) and adds detective and responsive capabilities. It also closely integrates with further detective and responsive technologies such as XDR (eXtended Detecton &amp; Response).</p>
<p>In this webinar, Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look at the status and future of EPDR, on what to consider when defining the own approach for an comprehensive and integrated approach on cybersecurity, and how the vendor landscape looks like. He will discuss the state of the market and the approaches on endpoint security, from unified solutions to integrating / orchestrating different best-of-breed solutions from EPP to Email Security and UEM (Unified Endpoint Management), but also the interplay of EPDR with SIEM, SOAR, and XDR.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/strengthening-endpoint-security"></a>

				  The inexorable growth in passenger numbers has driven the travel industry to an overwhelming conclusion: the only way forward is decentralized identity, digital wallets, and Verifiable Credentials. In the first trial of its kind, with Delta Airlines and the Government of Aruba, SITA and Indicio showed how well they work and how easy they are to implement.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>With yearly passenger numbers expected to grow from a little over four billion this year to eight billion by 2040 — or sooner — “the travel industry has decided that the future of identity is digital wallets and verifiable credentials,” said Michael Zureik, Head of Digital Travel Strategy and Innovation at SITA, at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm7Vm_6B70">recent Indicio Meetup.</a></p>
<p>To handle this demand and make travel less stressful and more streamlined, <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a> — a global supplier of IT to airlines and airports — has worked with Indicio to develop trusted, authenticated, digital travel documents that can be seamlessly authenticated.</p>
<p>First implemented in <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/transformative-innovation-arrives-at-arubas-queen-beatrix-international-airport/">Aruba</a>, these digital credentials take the data embedded in a passport, combine it with liveness check, authenticate both, and then return the data to the passenger in the form of a <a href="https://www.sita.aero/resources/videos/digital-travel-credential/">Digital Travel Credential</a> or DTC, a specification for deriving a digital passport from a physical passport’s embedded chip, established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a global body that regulates travel documents.</p>
<p>The Government of Aruba is the first sovereign government to accept a DTC, which means a passenger can present their DTC from home, get preauthorization for travel, and then cross the border simply by looking at a camera.</p>
<p>The focus of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/">Meetup</a> was on the next steps in this digital journey, which were successfully completed with a recent trial combining an ICAO-compatible DTC with <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/one-id/">One ID</a>, a digital credential standard created by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for seamless airport and travel services (but which doesn’t include border crossing).</p>
<p>Working with <a href="http://delta">Delta Airlines</a> and the <a href="https://www.arubahop.com/">Government of Aruba</a>, SITA and Indicio built a system to first create and issue the DTC and One ID then combined both credentials to add check-in, bag drop, lounge access, and boarding to booking, travel authorization, security, and immigration.</p>
<p>One of the key goals of the trial, said Zureik, was to show how different credentials can easily work together and complement each other to streamline the traveler experience on an international flight.</p>
<p>The trial showed just how easy it is to enroll in both at the same time with a passport and mobile phone, and then use them for instant, seamless authentication through each step of the passenger journey from home to destination.</p>
<p>What we learned, said Zureik, is that these technologies are ready. IATA’s One ID fits easily into the DTC ecosystem, and both were able to be implemented into airport, airline, and border gate processes quickly — six weeks — and without requiring any party to adopt new hardware or systems.</p>
<p>It was, said Zureik, “paramount” that Verifiable Credentials can be easily integrated and interoperate with existing airport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Mike Ebert, Indicio’s Director of Software Engineering, described how this was made possible by combining two types of Verifiable Credential formats — AnonCreds and SD-JWTs — and two types of communication protocols — DIDComm and OpenID4VC. This meant that the credentials were compatible with emerging European eIDAS identity standards but that they also provide strong privacy-preservation.</p>
<p>One key aspect of the Indicio-SITA implementation is that it is fully decentralized. Relying parties do not need to subscribe to or access a centralized database to verify traveler information. This unique architecture is not shared by other travel technology providers, but it is critical for the safe and secure management of people’s biometric data.</p>
<p>With a Verifiable Credential, biometric data doesn’t need to be centrally stored so that there’s something to check when a passenger looks into a camera. Instead, the passenger stores their biometric data securely on their phone and they can elect to share it in a way that can be verified without pinging stored data in a central repository.</p>
<p>As Ebert noted, this reduces the risk of a single point of failure (the database of biometric data goes offline), identity theft (if you don’t have to store people’s biometric data, it can’t be stolen), and it also eliminates the possibility of centralized tracking and provides the privacy protection that people and regulators now demand.</p>
<p>Acuity Market Intelligence described Indicio’s implementation of biometrics in Verifiable Credentials as “masterful” in its 2024 Prism Project Report.</p>
<p>To watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StRH7uOqxQA">demonstration of the DTC and One ID</a> and learn more about the benefits of managing biometric data with Verifiable Credentials, and the wider use cases for “government-grade” digital identities in tourism, watch this fascinating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm7Vm_6B70">episode</a> of the Indicio Meetup.</p>

<p>Optical technology at the cutting edge of innovation</p>
<p>Each Carb-Chaser satellite will carry a hyper-compact multispectral interferometer. These highly innovative instruments are made possible by miniaturizing key technologies used in major programs such as the Meteosat geostationary weather satellites and Copernicus, with its 12 European environmental monitoring missions. They will offer the capability to locate individual CO₂ plumes and attribute their source to a specific industrial facility, even in complex atmospheric conditions (wind, aerosols, water vapor, etc.).</p>
<p>Based on a Thales Alenia Space proprietary patented technology, this multispectral interferometry approach marks a breakthrough in terms of dependability and performance, further enhancing the ability of these satellites to offer reliable operational data with shorter revisit cycles to establish an overview of industrial sites on a global scale.</p>
<p>Certified data for strategic applications</p>
<p>The future Carb-Chaser constellation will provide independent, verifiable and certified CO₂ measurements spanning the entire value chain, including carbon services markets. Thanks to its high-precision geolocation capability, emissions will be accurately attributed to specific industrial facilities. These data will then be verified by in-situ surveys performed directly at the sites concerned.</p>
<p>Measurements will also be certified by the French Space Agency (CNES), the European Space Agency (ESA) and scientific experts specializing in atmospheric studies. This official validation will ensure these data can be included in regulatory frameworks, especially for carbon quota systems and carbon border adjustment mechanisms.</p>
<p>Complementary fit with major European space missions for environmental monitoring</p>
<p>Carb-Chaser will operate in synergy with existing European programs dedicated to measuring carbon emissions, such as MicroCarb and CO2M. While MicroCarb is a scientific mission to assess CO₂ fluxes on a global scale, and CO2M will measure human-induced CO₂ on a regional scale, Carb-Chaser will monitor local-scale emissions. Carb-Chaser data will also be used in conjunction with data from the CO2M program to compile atmospheric inventories and track progress toward climate goals.</p>
<p>These three missions, while distinct, will complement and feed into each other to provide a global, integrated picture of carbon emissions and support international efforts to reduce the impact of human activities on the climate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A French consortium at the heart of industrial innovation</p>
<p>Led by Thales Alenia Space, the Carb-Chaser project brings together a consortium of dynamic French SMEs such as U-Space, WaltR, Everimpact, SPASCIA and QAIrbon, as well as the IRT Saint Exupéry technological research institute. Together, the partners will combine their expertise to accelerate the ecological transition while strengthening Europe’s technological sovereignty. In addition to the scientific advances it will deliver, Carb-Chaser will have a direct economic impact on key regions of the French space industry, including Occitania, Brittany and the PACA region (Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur).</p>
<p>As part of the ambitious France 2030 strategy, Carb-Chaser reflects France and Europe’s determination to become world leaders in carbon emissions monitoring. This pioneering program marks a decisive step forward in efforts to combat climate change and opens the way to new markets for space technologies.</p>
<p>About France 2030 </p>
<p>Devised in consultation with local and European business and academic partners, France 2030 offers the country exceptional resources to meet the ecological, demographic, economic, industrial and social challenges of today’s changing world. This unprecedented plan for innovation and industry reflects a dual ambition. First, sustainably transform key sectors of our economy — such as energy, automotive, aerospace, digital and space — through innovation and industrial investment. And second, position France not just as a player, but as a leader in the economy of the future.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, members of the SpruceID team attended the 39th installment of the Internet Identity Workshop, or IIW. The biannual conference is on the cusp of its third decade, and one reason we love it is that it still embodies the collaborative, grassroots spirit of its 2005 founding era. This ethos still guides the open, standards-based world of identity, making IIW an ideal place to check in on important developments and ideas.</p><p>Held at the Computer History Museum near Google’s campus in Mountain View, California, each installment of IIW begins with an iconic opening circle to introduce all attendees and solicit session proposals on the fly. This “unconference” structure means you never know quite what you’ll see at IIW until it starts – and input was on hand from every corner, from Microsoft and Google to solo entrepreneurs and the government administrators bringing the next wave of identity to life.</p><p>Over 3 days and 177 discussion sessions, the breadth of topics at IIW was huge, but a few key themes came into focus for us: Collaboration and convergence across groups of stakeholders; the new concept of “personhood credentials”; and the cryptographic innovation known as Zero Knowledge Proofs.</p> Personhood Credentials <p>SpruceID may be a bit biased, since Wayne Chang, SpruceID CEO was part of the team that rolled out the idea in a whitepaper earlier this year, but it was gratifying to see a lot of discussion of<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-joins-harvard-and-microsoft-researchers-for-new-personhood-credential-proposal/"> “personhood credentials”</a> at IIW. Broadly, a personhood credential is a kind of verifiable digital credential that shows its holder is a natural person, without revealing other personal information. The broad goal is to help combat disinformation and spam online by making it easy to identify content posted by a real human.</p><p>Various breakouts delved into technical details of implementing personhood credentials and potential applications, such as in “know your customer” procedures for financial services. But the discussion also turned to deeper quandaries, including a challenge to the premise of the personhood credential: Why is the burden of proof on humans? One panel on “approved AI agents” explored how digital credentials could be used to identify autonomous agents online, sparking a lively debate about trust and accountability in the digital age.</p> Zero Knowledge Proofs <p>Finally, there was both a wealth of discussion and a significant piece of news about Zero Knowledge Proofs, a recent innovation in privacy-enhancing cryptography. ZKPs remain largely theoretical, but would make it possible to do something wildly interesting with digital information: prove the truth of a claim, without revealing the underlying details. For example, a ZKP-based digital credential could be presented at a bar to prove you’re old enough to buy a drink, without revealing your specific date of birth.</p><p>There were sessions presenting things like digital wallets built to handle ZKPs in verifiable credentials, and software libraries that will make the technology easier to implement. But probably most exciting was the announcement that Google is hard at work on building ZKPs that work on the mDoc credential standard, using existing hardware. The search giant announced that it plans to make their techniques open-source in early 2025, which could spark a flurry of further technical advances and even real-world implementations.</p> Collaboration in Overdrive <p>The most interesting part of IIW 39 may not have been a technical topic at all, but the powerful mixing and collaboration on display everywhere you looked. That’s particularly notable because attendees represented a cross-section of the identity world in every sense. Founders of the first IIW 20 years ago rubbed elbows with young engineers bringing those pioneers’ ideas to life.&nbsp; Government staffers leading the charge on mobile drivers’ licenses shared their issues with vendors building the tools they need.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, representatives of key standards came together to share insights and reconcile approaches. Teams developing mDocs/mDL, OpenID, European identity groups, the Open Wallets Foundation, and the Decentralized Identity Foundation kibitzed and compared notes with an eye towards getting these systems to work together better. With everyone in the same room, there were significant breakthroughs in finding shared solutions to sticky problems.</p><p>With digital identity gaining real-world traction in recent years, it's exciting to see the spectrum for digital credentials shifting from being discussions of theory, to competing standards, to now who wins/how we all win by moving into the marketplace of implementation.</p> From Theory to Practice <p>This new work on ZKPs embodies perhaps the single overarching theme of IIW 39: a lot of things that the identity world has spent years talking about and refining are now actually becoming reality. For example, we saw intense interest in our work on California’s mobile driver’s license (though again, we’re biased) and discussion of strong privacy requirements that would be considered for Utah’s state digital ID. Utah appears to be truly committed to protecting the privacy of users, a gratifying payoff to decades of commitment to safety-centric design in digital ID.</p><p>The passage from ideas to reality even capped off this year’s IIW: many attendees went from Mountain View straight to Sacramento, where the California DMV was hosting<a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/mdl-for-technology-developers/hackathons-2024/?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> an mDL hackathon</a>. After days focused on aligning the principles and architecture of digital identity, developers were able to get their hands dirty building real-world tools and exploring ways digital identity can fulfill its promise of better security, privacy, and trust in the digital age.</p> Turning Conversations into Solutions <p>Wrapping up these recent discussions, we're energized by the progress and collaboration happening in the world of digital identity. The transition from theory to implementation is becoming more tangible, with advancements like personhood credentials and Zero-Knowledge Proofs paving the way for privacy-first solutions. As we continue to tackle challenges and refine standards, we’re excited to contribute to a future where secure, user-controlled digital interactions are the norm.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 A simple compliance requirement that needs to be completed asap or the most important part of the customer journey? Industry experts have their say. 



<p>The customer onboarding stage is arguably the most important touch point between a bank and its customer. Unfortunately, it’s also the part that a lot of banks are doing wrong, which can lead to compliance fines, fraud attacks and loss of reputation and revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To discuss how to create an optimal onboarding experience that can both fight fraud and improve user experience, we partnered with Transform Finance to organize the ‘Why you’re doing remote onboarding wrong’ webinar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderated by our very own Head of Product Marketing and Customer Communications, Ellie Burns, the webinar featured insights from Anna Stylianou, Founder of AML Cube and Bertram Storr-Paulsen, Head of KYC Services LC&amp;I Denmark, Nordea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now available on-demand, the hour-long webinar covers a variety of topics, from how to meet regulatory compliance requirements and secure your onboarding process to how to build a trustworthy and convenient user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Missed the webinar? Here’s our five key takeaways!</p>



 
   
     
                     Why you’re doing remote onboarding wrong 
                     Are you doing onboarding wrong?

Our eclectic mixture of panelists challenge conventional methods and reveal innovative ways to balance fraud prevention with user convenience. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/why-youre-doing-remote-onboarding-wrong/">Watch now </a>
           
             
         
           
         
       
       
 


 1. Relationships with regulators need to improve. 



<p>“We’re not even halfway there,” appeared to be the general feeling during the webinar. However, according to participants, there are signs that the relationship between banks and regulators is trending in the right direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/aml-compliance-2024-amld6/">Anti-Money Laundering Authority in Frankfurt (AMLA)</a> is likely to make a significant impact, offering a more unilateral and consistent regulatory perspective. Having an open environment where banks can discuss what is failing; what is working well; and how learnings can be exchanged will only improve the relationship between banks and regulators regarding anti-money laundering and other fraud risks.</p>



 2. Change is inevitable. Is your culture ready to adapt accordingly? 



<p>As one of the biggest challenges of entering new markets is complying with different regulations and requirements, banks need to have a culture that is willing to innovate quickly and adapt accordingly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Onboarding customers the old way – via traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) processes like photocopying and stamping documents – is no longer acceptable; banks need to embrace new identity verification methods and onboarding procedures to fight fraud and cut costs in the modern age.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>For some reason, in financial services, compliance and fraud are always treated separately, with separate teams etc, but they’re actually inextricably linked, especially during the onboarding stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>Head of Product Marketing and Customer Communications, Ellie Burns</blockquote>



<p>“So, how can banks ensure compliance teams and fraud teams are collaborating to make processes and onboarding flows as secure, trusted and seamless as possible for the customer?” asked Ellie.</p>



 3. The importance of balancing fraud and compliance. 



<p>Balancing effective fraud prevention with an onboarding process that works for all, regardless of risk level, is no easy task. The reality is that some customers are just not tech savvy or literate enough to use certain solutions, so banks need to be prepared to still ‘handhold’ the more vulnerable customers and offer more traditional onboarding options too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s also important to remember that when doing so, banks need to be prepared for the repercussions of these ‘old-fashioned’ approaches, such as increased fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Communication is key, especially between different departments with different goals. However, despite appearances, there are many common goals that should demand alignment between compliance teams and fraud teams. As such, these departments need to work together to find solutions that are both compliant and prevent fraud. It should never be an either/ or.</p>



 4. Technology has a major part to play. But so too do humans! 



<p>There is no such thing as the ‘perfect onboarding solution’, not only due to different regulatory requirements but also customer preferences. Even across the European region there are different approaches to customer onboarding. For example, in the UK there are data checks and document checks, while in Germany, there is video verification and of course eID.&nbsp; It’s also worth bearing in mind that as people tend to be multi-bankers, they’re often faced with multiple ‘perfect solutions’ following different standards and steps. Plus, of course, what is perfect for one person may not be for another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While a lot of solutions focus on things like multi-factor authentication to make onboarding smoother, faster and more automated, there are other solutions that use live facial detection, which requires in-person assistance and face-to-face interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Webinar participants agreed that there is still a danger in relying too heavily on fully automated processes as artificial intelligence is still not to be 100% trusted yet, especially with social engineering like APP scams. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/video-identity-verification-fraud-prevention/">value that video verification can provide</a> should not be underestimated.</p>



 5. Is fraud prevention just a game of Whac-A-Mole? 



<p>Of course, the aim of banks is to stop fraud dead in its tracks – but the reality is that fraud is a constant, never-ending game of cat and mouse, with fraudsters evolving and developing ever-sophisticated attacks to penetrate defenses and vulnerabilities. So, if the banks can’t stop 100% of fraud, then the aim of the game is to make it as difficult as possible&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, how exactly can banks make it difficult for fraudsters? As bad actors often work around the clock using increasingly sophisticated fraud attacks, it can be difficult for banks to fight back. As such, there needs to be a more connected approach where banks are incentivized and feel willing to share information and learnings with one another. A multi-layered approach to fraud prevention is necessary as fraudsters work in a similar way!</p>

<p>Full disclosure: this post is all about encouraging you to become a member of <a href="https://idpro.org">IDPro</a>®. They didn’t ask me to write it, but they’re a client, and I’ve been a fan long before we started working together.</p>



<p>If your company has a digital presence, at some level, you’re a technology company. That might not seem obvious if you’re running a retail chain or a healthcare clinic, but it’s true. The systems that underpin your operations—whether they’re managing customer logins, ensuring secure employee access, or verifying partner identities—are deeply rooted in the principles of digital identity.</p>



<p>And yet, for many organizations, the people working on these systems may not even realize they’re part of a larger field called “identity management.” They’re solving complex problems in access control, authentication, and identity proofing—often in isolation, without the benefit of shared best practices or peer guidance. That inefficiency? It makes me sad—especially because there’s a better way.</p>



<p>That’s where professional organizations like IDPro come in. I’ve been an IDPro member since long before I started contracting with them, and their value to practitioners and companies alike is impressive.</p>



 Why IDPro? 



<p>What is IDPro? It’s a professional association dedicated to fostering ethics and excellence in digital identity management. It provides tools, resources, and a vibrant community for anyone working in this space, whether they’re seasoned veterans or just discovering that identity is part of their job.</p>



<p>IDPro offers a lot:</p>



 1. A Vendor-Neutral Body of Knowledge 



<p>IDPro’s freely available <a href="https://idpro.org/body-of-knowledge/">Body of Knowledge</a> (BoK) is a Big Deal. It’s a Creative Commons-licensed, vendor-neutral resource designed to help identity practitioners level up their expertise. Whether you’re trying to understand the basics of multi-factor authentication or grappling with complex federation protocols, the BoK offers practical, accessible guidance. I helped design the publication process, ensuring the BoK includes only the best, peer-reviewed material in the field. </p>



 2. CIDPRO® Certification 



<p>For companies that want to invest in their staff’s professional development, the <a href="https://idpro.org/cidpro/">CIDPRO</a> certification is an excellent foundation-level credential. It’s built by practitioners, for practitioners, and is designed to validate a broad understanding of identity management concepts. Certified employees bring enhanced credibility and capability to their organizations. There are great resources on the website that walks you through what the exam is like and the material it covers. You can even sign up to take a test exam!</p>



 3. A Thriving Community 



<p>IDPro’s member-only virtual discussions are some of the most valuable professional conversations I’ve had. The organization fosters a community where identity practitioners can exchange ideas, troubleshoot challenges, and share best practices in a thoughtful and respectful environment. This sense of connection is invaluable, especially in a field as fast-changing and complex as identity management. From authentication and IGA to identipets (because what’s a community without pet photos?), the channels are where some of the best identity conversations—and laughs—happen.</p>



 4. Advocacy and Networking 



<p>IDPro isn’t just about individual growth—it’s about lifting the entire field of identity management. From advocating for the industry with policymakers to hosting facilitated gatherings at major conferences like Identiverse, IDPro helps promote the conversation around identity while providing meaningful networking opportunities. Whether it’s a hallway chat at a conference or a casual meetup at the pub, the networking opportunities here are second to none.</p>



 Why Companies Should Care 



<p>When companies invest in organizations like IDPro, they’re not just supporting their employees—they’re ensuring their own success. Digital identity is foundational to security, compliance, and customer trust. By giving your teams access to IDPro’s resources, certification programs, and community, you’re equipping them to solve identity challenges more effectively. Go, team!</p>



<p>And let’s not forget: investing in professional development helps attract and retain top talent. Identity professionals who feel supported and connected are more likely to stay with your organization and bring their best to the table. </p>



 A Call to Action 



<p>If you’re reading this and wondering if IDPro membership is right for your organization, of COURSE it is. I would go so far as to say that if you’re not ready to dive into the deep end of <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/09/20/more-on-standards-development/">standards development</a>, this is a great way to start engaging with the smartest people in the identity world. Every company with a digital presence has a stake in the future of identity management; IDPro is the best partner I can imagine to help you navigate that future. Membership offers value at every level, from individual practitioners to corporate teams.</p>



<p>Seriously, get your company an IDPro membership—you won’t regret it. And when you do, tell the team at <a>membership@idpro.org</a> that I sent you!</p>

<p>A <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">digital wallet</a> co-developed by Anonyome Labs and Indico which will transform trusted data sharing in the agriculture industry has won a prestigious <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/events/supernova/2024">Constellation Research SuperNova Award</a>.</p>



<p>The Trust Alliance New Zealand (TANZ) Digital Farm Wallet took out the award in the “Digital Safety, Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity” category of the long-running awards program which recognizes disruptive and transformative solutions for end users.</p>



<p>TANZ’s Digital Farm Wallet uses <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/reusable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> to create a secure data-sharing ecosystem in which farmers, growers, and other parties in the value chain (such as food producers, processors, retailers and exporters) can easily capture and share data across the sector while keeping it secure, protected and controllable.</p>



<p>The wallet allows farmers to securely hold critical data for their farms, such as their farm ID, greenhouse gas emissions, and farm boundaries, and share it directly and securely with reliant parties. Using the wallet eliminates the need for large third party databases and repetitive and time-consuming manual information sharing and prevents farmers’ data from being shared without their consent and to the detriment of their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the TANZ Digital Farm Wallet is set to transform New Zealand’s agriculture industry. The project trial proved that directly sharing authenticated information between farmers and distributors in a secure, privacy-preserving way has significant cost benefits. Farmers in the trial spent less time filling out forms and managing data and more time farming. Going forward, the data-sharing ecosystem will also achieve a more streamlined, transparent supply chain, in which farmers can prove their promises about their produce (such as organic status) and consumers can verify the claims for themselves at the time of purchase.</p>

<p>TANZ <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/node/33436/vote/application/view/1050">says</a> the Digital Farm Wallet has already won buy-in from important players in the industry, including banks, regional councils, and meat packagers.</p>



<p>The TANZ Digital Farm Wallet project was prompted by the recognition that trusted data sharing is vital to maintaining and growing New Zealand’s primary sector. It is an excellent case study for the agriculture sectors of other countries and for other industries that rely on trusted data sharing.

<p>Anonyme Labs’ Chief Technology Officer, Dr Paul Ashley, says the company is proud to be leading the way with the increasingly popular decentralized identity technology of verifiable credentials: “This project has shown that replacing legacy paper-based documents and processing with a solution based on digital verifiable credentials increases trust, reduces costs, and opens new avenues for participants to interact in a secure and privacy preserving way.” If you would like to learn more about the TANZ Digital Farm Wallet or discuss your own needs for a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">digital wallet solution</a>, we’d love to talk to you. <a href="https://anonyome.com/contact/">Contact us</a> today and head to our web site for a<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/how-rc-works/"> live demo video</a> of what we offer.</p>

<p>DOJ Pushes for Google Chrome Sale in Landmark Antitrust Battle</p>



<p>U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General (DOJ) is pushing for a federal judge to require the sale of Google’s Chrome browser as part of its antitrust case against the company. The DOJ argues that Google’s deals with phone makers like Apple to secure default search positions and the integration of Chrome with its search engine maintain its illegal monopoly in online search, which constitutes 90% of global searches. The agency also wants court oversight of Google’s Android division or its divestiture, and for websites to have the option to opt out of contributing data to Google’s AI models. Google argues that these proposals would hinder innovation and harm consumers. A court decision is expected in 2025 after a hearing in April. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/20/g-s1-35111/after-a-court-win-the-justice-department-is-trying-to-make-google-sell-its-chrome-browser?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--GsxhfLWhRNgcbPZVwmIqJAHh5U-x29JXDWWHpQb7wk6PDr9LJ7brOugw_9PX-81bMKNrv">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Finastra Investigates Data Breach of Secure File Transfer Platform, Impacting Global Banks</p>

<p>DocuSign Phishing Surge Exploits Trust in Regulatory Communications, Highlighting Gaps in Verification Security</p>



<p>Researchers report a 98% increase in phishing attacks since November 8, primarily targeting businesses through Docusign impersonations. These scams exploit trust by mimicking legitimate agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services, sending urgent, fraudulent requests via authentic-looking DocuSign templates. Victims are pressured to respond quickly, with attacks using accurate terminology to evade security. This situation highlights the need for stronger verification protocols and staff training to reduce risks, as businesses face both immediate financial losses and long-term disruptions. Robust validation processes for sensitive communications are essential. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/docusign-phishing-targets-us-state/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EJI9eZEoVxOCbGAtOoUcP80pQ0xBhxRVoXqIPpEOUh1WyrtlChrt06fCC-NzLBGXrggb7">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Roblox Strengthens Parental Controls and Safety Measures Amid Child Protection Scrutiny</p>



<p>Roblox has introduced new parental controls and content safeguards amid concerns about child safety, following allegations that it prioritizes growth over user protection. Parents can now manage daily usage limits, block game genres, and access ratings for games. Users under 13 will be unable to text chat outside of games, in addition to an existing voice chat ban. Roblox claims these features were planned before the Hindenburg report and denies any inflated user metrics. The company has faced criticism from child advocacy groups and regulatory challenges, including a ban in Turkey for alleged child exploitation content. These updates reflect a wider industry trend toward stronger protections for minors. As of September, Roblox reported 88.9 million daily active users, with 40% under 13. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/roblox-new-child-safety-measures-41e916dd?mod=tech_lead_pos1&amp;utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8FZalS99VMJ14B7hxw7TEPb2-q3cTwXNl5qMjBD5G9ep_2KqF7Nh5FDhDOKxur78ctD3vw">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Attackers continually refine their methods to compromise user identities and gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems. One particularly insidious threat is <a href="https://help.evilginx.com/">Evilginx</a>, a phishing framework designed to bypass traditional multi-factor authentication (MFA) by operating as an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) — sometimes known as man-in-the-middle (MitM) — proxy. Evilginx intercepts and manipulates communication between users and legitimate sites, enabling attackers to steal credentials, session cookies, and other sensitive data. It’s a favorite tool of threat groups such as the Russian-based Star Blizzard, as <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-341a">warned in a joint advisory</a> from CISA, the UK National Cyber Security Centre, the Australian Cyber Security Centre, and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, among other governmental security bodies.</p>  
<p>Threat researchers and incident response teams have reported a noticeable surge in phishing campaigns utilizing Evilginx, exploiting MFA’s reliance on session validation. Even with MFA in place, Evilginx captures session cookies after authentication is complete, granting attackers unauthorized access to accounts. In many cases, it can also bypass Windows Hello for Business. This makes it a particularly effective tool for targeting Microsoft Entra ID environments. This article peels back the layers on Evilginx, looking at how it&nbsp; operates, why it’s effective, and the best defenses to help keep your organization secure.</p> 
 The Evolution of Evilginx  
<p>Originally developed as a pentesting tool to demonstrate the vulnerabilities of traditional MFA, Evilginx has evolved to become a cornerstone of sophisticated phishing campaigns. Using a modified version of the open-source nginx web server software, early versions focused on basic credential harvesting. Newer iterations, however, incorporate advanced features like session cookie interception and real-time proxying to bypass MFA entirely. Now named Evilginx 3 and written in Go, the framework is stable, adaptable and set up to target platforms like Microsoft Entra ID. It comes with built-in “phishlets” to easily configure identical login experiences for Microsoft 365, Citrix, Okta, and other sites.</p> 
 Understanding Reverse Proxies  
<p>Reverse proxies are a legitimate, widely-used technique where a proxy server handles requests and responses on behalf of the origin server. It sits between an endpoint, such as a user’s desktop, and public facing traffic and websites. Requests from the endpoint are intercepted by the reverse proxy server, which then sends the requests on to the origin server. This helps organizations manage incoming traffic, distribute loads across servers, and strengthen security by shielding the internal server structure. It also allows organizations to cache content that may be commonly used by their users, saving loading time.&nbsp;</p> 
 Reverse Proxy Flow  
<p></p> 
 How Evilginx Works  
<p>Evilginx leverages the concept of a reverse proxy, but configured specifically to capture a user’s credentials and session cookies once they are tricked into accessing the Evilginx URL instead of the legitimate target server.</p> 
<p>The process goes something like this.</p> 
<p>1. Phishing lure: The attacker lures the victim into clicking on a phishing link sent by email or SMS, which takes them to the Evilginx-created phishing site:</p> 
<p></p> 
2. Fraudulent site: The phishing site consists of a fake login page that looks and behaves exactly like the legitimate site, complete with a valid TLS certificate and lock icon. When the user tries to log in, Evilginx forwards the request to the real service:
<br> 
<p></p> 
<p>3. Credential harvesting: The user enters their username and password on the fake page, which Evilginx captures and sends to the genuine site. Evilginx also collects and passes back second factor authentication factors, such as OTPs and out-of-band authentication (eg. push notification to the MS Authenticator app).</p> 
<p>4. Session hijacking: If successfully authenticated, the legitimate service will return session credentials (tokens, session cookie), which Evilginx intercepts. The attacker uses the captured credentials and session cookies to directly access the user’s account.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>5. Account takeover: Once the attacker has control of the session, they can change the user’s password and other information, locking the victim out.</p> 
 Handling Federation Redirects  
<p>But what if Entra ID is configured to redirect to a different IdP (like ADFS) to perform federated authentication?</p> 
<p>The flow is very similar to the simpler flow above, except Entra is going to return a 302 redirect to the downstream IdP. As long as Evilginx is configured to be aware of the redirect host, it will spin up a new “host” under its subdomain, and proxy the redirect to the browser to go there instead:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>So even if the user enters their credentials in the downstream IdP, the result is the same. The downstream IdP issues a federation token (eg. SAML or OIDC) which Evilginx uses to get the final session tokens from Entra ID:</p> 
<p></p> 
 How Attackers Use Evilginx  
<p>Attackers leveraging Evilginx often start by targeting the weakest link: unprotected personal devices. A common scenario involves a phishing email sent to an employee’s personal email address, which is less likely to be secured by corporate defenses. For example, if you work for Acme.com, you might receive a spear-phishing email that appears relevant to your role or recent activities. Once you click the link, expecting to authenticate, the attacker’s Evilginx server intercepts the login process as described above, capturing credentials and session cookies, and eventually locking you out of your account entirely.</p> 
<p>Generative AI has made these attacks easier and far more effective. By mining public data about employees — such as their social media profiles, published work, and LinkedIn connections — attackers can craft highly convincing, customized phishing campaigns (aka “spear phishing”) within minutes. Moreover, Evilginx makes it easy to set up the phishing site, providing exact replicas of login pages for Microsoft Entra ID, Okta and other popular services.</p> 
 Inside an Evilginx Attack on Entra ID  
<p>In this attack demo, you can see how easy it is to hack into and take over an Entra ID account using Evilginx, even with “stronger” MFA with number matching turned on.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 
  
   
   
   
  
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Defending Against Evilginx  
<p>Protecting against Evilginx attacks starts with basic, foundational defenses like two-factor authentication (2FA). While not immune to compromise — attackers can still steal session cookies — 2FA adds a layer of difficulty that may deter some threats. Another critical measure is network traffic inspection, particularly for enterprises. Monitoring where traffic is directed can help identify phishing URLs and flag malicious activity, though detection often occurs after users have already clicked on links.</p> 
<p>Employee phishing awareness training can also reduce the risk of falling for phishing attempts, although it’s unrealistic to expect perfect vigilance. Mistakes are inevitable, especially as attackers craft increasingly targeted, convincing lures.</p> 
<p>The most effective strategy lies in adopting FIDO passkeys for authentication. Passkeys use domain binding, which ensures that authentication attempts will only succeed if the domain matches the one the passkey was registered with. This effectively renders reverse proxy tools like Evilginx useless, as they cannot impersonate the bound domain.</p> 
<p></p> 
 What About Windows Hello for Business?  
<p>Although Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) is a FIDO2 compliant authenticator, the way it is usually configured makes it vulnerable to Evilginx attacks. Most organizations set up WHfB to be the primary authentication method, with a more insecure fallback option, such as password plus an SMS OTP or Microsoft Authenticator. To make this worse, there are <a href="https://github.com/yudasm/WHfB-o365-Phishlet">Evilginx phishlets</a> available that specifically bypass WHfB&nbsp; authentication (in case it was used last time by the user) by forcibly downgrading the flow to use the more vulnerable fallback methods.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The key is to enable policies in Conditional Access that don’t allow a less-secure (non-phishing-resistant) fallback option. If you do, the attackers will exploit it, making it pointless for deploying WHfB in the first place.</p> 
 How HYPR Thwarts Evilginx Attacks  
<p>HYPR is designed to outsmart the most sophisticated AitM tactics, including Evilginx attacks. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">HYPR Enterprise Passkeys</a> leverage FIDO passkey standards, binding the domain to the key so that only login attempts on the correct domain can succeed. This effectively shuts down reverse proxy tools that rely on intercepting session cookies or credentials. HYPR only uses phishing-resistant, FIDO Certified <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> methods — it never falls back to a shared secret that can be phished or intercepted. It can be used as the primary authentication method or a phishing-resistant fallback for Windows Hello for Business.</p> 
<p>See what this protection looks like during the same phishing attack demonstrated above.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 More Layers of Identity Protection  
<p>On top of our leading passwordless architecture, our identity risk engine, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a>, adds another layer of security by detecting and responding to risk signals — even if the correct credentials are used. Account recovery is another area frequently exploited by attackers. They employ social engineering to impersonate a legitimate user and convince the help desk to provision new credentials. HYPR’s <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification solution</a> prevents this by ensuring someone is the rightful account owner before allowing credentials to be issued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The TopSky - ATC upgrade will enable COOPANS to improve air traffic management in Europe through advanced features that will lead to a better and faster coordination, and more precise decision-making for air traffic controllers, allowing them to handle more flights. The enhanced user interface will provide clearer visualization of essential information and optimized ergonomics to streamline operations.</p>
<p>The upgraded system will strengthen the integration of radar data and flight plans, enabling better surveillance and greater accuracy in detecting aircraft trajectories. The advanced real-time decision support capabilities will facilitate the management of complex situations, thereby improving the safety and productivity of air operations.</p>
<p>With this upgrade COOPANS is also decisively moving forward in line with the ambitious Single European Sky (SES) project of the European Union, which aims to harmonize and optimize air traffic management across Europe, creating a single and efficient airspace.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The upgrade of our system to the state-of-the-art TopSky-ATC solution is a significant milestone in order to be able to manage increasing air traffic in a safe, efficient and sustainable way in the future. A modern, open, and modular ATM system will ensure flexibility, adaptability, and interoperability, enabling seamless integration of new technological advancements. The commitment and professionalism of all our staff, who worked so hard on the specifications for the system modernisation, played a key role in ensuring that we could continue with this highly successful cooperation" said COOPANS Alliance Board Chairman Philipp Piber.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"We are pleased that COOPANS has selected Thales’ TopSky - ATC One offering, including its system upgrade and innovative governance model. This decision ensures that COOPANS will benefit from the most advanced air traffic control (ATC) technology available, as Thales continues to lead the evolution of the industry. By partnering with Thales, COOPANS will enhance interoperability, efficiency, and safety in air traffic management. Together, we are shaping the future of airspace, advancing toward a more integrated and sustainable system in line with the ambitious objectives of the Digital European Sky project." said Christian Rivierre, VP Airspace Mobility Solutions, Thales.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to a new governance model, Thales ensures that the priorities of its Air Navigation Service Provider customers are met, enabling the continuous evolution of TopSky – ATC solution to consistently address industry demands while improving the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of air operations across Europe.</p>
<p>The system upgrade is currently in the development phase. Until 2028, hardware deployment, software integration, and intensive validations will take place in parallel, along with operational and technical training. The implementation of the upgraded system in COOPANS is planned in three waves from 2028 to 2030. </p>

  <p>In the modern digital landscape, organizations are confronted with growing cybersecurity challenges that demand stronger authentication methods. Zero Trust frameworks have become essential for bolstering security postures, placing a significant emphasis on identity verification. As traditional passwords become more vulnerable, passkeys are gaining traction for their phishing-resistant capabilities and their potential to transform authentication within Zero Trust environments.</p>
<p>Implementing passkeys, however, is not without its hurdles. Organizations must navigate evolving software ecosystems, inconsistent user experiences, and complex recovery processes. Balancing security requirements with user convenience remains a key challenge. This webinar will explore the various types of passkeys, their benefits, and the trade-offs between security and usability in achieving passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>Alejandro Leal, Research Analyst at KuppingerCole, will discuss the shift towards identity-centric security measures and the role of passkeys in building resilient digital environments. He will provide insights into how passkeys contribute to minimizing attack surfaces and enhancing overall security postures within Zero Trust frameworks.</p>
<p>Andre Priebe, Chief Technology Officer at iC Consult, will offer a high-level explanation of Zero Trust benefits from passkey adoption. He will explain passkey technologies, current implementation challenges, and best practices for adopting and scaling passkeys within organizations, focusing on improving security without compromising user experience.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-world"></a>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>As technology continues to evolve at a breakneck pace, so do the risks lurking in the shadows of digital transformation. The cybersecurity landscape is no longer just about firewalls and antivirus software—it’s a high-stakes chess game with increasingly cunning adversaries. To stay ahead, we must not only understand these next-generation threats but also embrace smarter, more adaptive strategies.</p>
 The New Face of Cyber Threats 
<p>AI-Driven Cyberattacks: Smarter, Faster, and More Dangerous</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a tool for innovation—it’s becoming a weapon in the hands of cybercriminals. AI automates attacks, identifies vulnerabilities at lightning speed, and creates malware that learns to outsmart detection systems. Defenders can’t afford to play catch-up. Staying proactive with AI-powered countermeasures is the only way to level the playing field.</p>
<p>Deepfakes: Trust Eroded in the Digital Age</p>
<p>What if you could no longer trust what you see or hear online? Deepfake technology has weaponized deception, enabling attackers to impersonate executives, manipulate public opinion, and execute devastating social engineering attacks. The fallout includes financial fraud, reputation damage, and a society questioning the authenticity of all digital content.</p>
<p>IoT: Billions of Devices, Billions of Risks</p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized our lives, connecting everything from home appliances to critical infrastructure. But this connectivity comes at a price. Many IoT devices are built with weak—or nonexistent—security measures, making them easy targets. Worse, these devices can serve as backdoors to larger networks, amplifying the threat.</p>
<p>Ransomware: Evolving and Escalating</p>
<p>Ransomware has shifted gears, becoming more calculated and destructive. Attackers now employ double extortion tactics—encrypting data while also threatening to leak it unless hefty ransoms are paid. This evolution demands more robust defenses, including smarter recovery plans and airtight data backups.</p>
 Strategies to Outpace the Threats 
<p>Leveraging AI to Fight AI</p>
<p>If attackers are arming themselves with AI, so must defenders. AI-powered security tools can sift through massive data sets, detect anomalies, and react to threats faster than any human team ever could. Machine learning ensures systems grow smarter with every attack, turning past threats into future advantages.</p>
<p>Zero Trust: A Security Framework Built for Complexity</p>
<p>Zero Trust flips the traditional security model on its head: trust no one and verify everyone. By constantly authenticating users and devices, this model minimizes risks like unauthorized access and lateral movement. Yet, it’s no magic wand—Zero Trust is complex to implement at scale, which explains its slow adoption rate.</p>
<p>Behavioral Analytics: The Power of Predictive Insight</p>
<p>In cybersecurity, behavior often reveals intent. Analyzing user actions—like irregular login patterns or unusual data transfers—can flag potential threats before they escalate. Behavioral analytics provides the critical early warnings organizations need to respond swiftly and decisively.</p>
<p>Setting the Bar Higher for IoT Security</p>
<p>The IoT ecosystem needs more than innovation; it needs standards. Industry collaboration is essential to enforce stricter measures like device authentication, end-to-end encryption, and regular firmware updates. Securing billions of connected devices isn’t just desirable—it’s non-negotiable.</p>
<p>Ransomware Resilience: A Comprehensive Playbook</p>
<p>To stay resilient against ransomware, preparation is key. Think regular backups, segmented networks, and well-trained employees. Add a strong incident response plan, and you’ve got the foundation for bouncing back without caving to criminal demands.</p>
<p>Building Resilience for an Unpredictable Future</p>
<p>The battle between cybersecurity professionals and threat actors isn’t going anywhere—it’s only intensifying. Agility, collaboration, and innovation are non-negotiable in this fight. By adopting advanced technologies and forward-thinking strategies, we can fortify our systems and stay one step ahead of the adversaries shaping tomorrow’s threats.</p>
<p>Join us in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024">December in Frankfurt at our cyberevolution conference</a>, where we will continue to discuss the cyber threat landscape and its future.</p>

<p>A bad actor isn’t only a poorly skilled thespian (ha ha). It’s also a person (or group) who intentionally acts to cause harm to a person or organization via computers, devices,&nbsp;systems or&nbsp;networks.</p>



<p>This type of bad actor most commonly affects individuals when they steal their <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a>, such as name, address and credit card details in a <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breach</a> (though not all data breaches are malicious).</p>



<p>To date, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/privacy/state-of-digital-privacy-americans">more than 60%</a> of Americans have been the victim of a <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>. In 2023, data breaches in the US increased by a massive <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ITRC_2023-Annual-Data-Breach-Report.pdf">78% </a>over 2022, and impacted an estimated <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ITRC_2023-Annual-Data-Breach-Report.pdf">353,027,892 people</a>.</p>



<p>Breaches don’t discriminate by industry. In fact, no industry is safe, with public administration, finance and healthcare the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1307426/number-of-data-breaches-worldwide/">most at-risk industries</a> for data compromise.</p>



<p>What’s more, data breaches don’t only happen on the internet. <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">Personal information</a> can be exposed via Bluetooth, text message, and the good old-fashioned stolen wallet or phone, too.</p>



<p>So, once a bad actor has your <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a>, what do they do with it? Here are the top 10 things going on right now:</p>



 
 Identity theft: Using your stolen information to impersonate you for financial gain or to commit crimes 



 Financial fraud: Accessing your bank accounts, credit card information, or other financial accounts to make unauthorized transactions 



 Phishing: Sending fraudulent emails or messages pretending to be from legitimate organizations to trick you into revealing more information or clicking on malicious links 



 Social engineering: Manipulating you into divulging confidential information, often by posing as someone you trust or using your stolen information to build credibility 



 Account takeover: Gaining unauthorized access to your online accounts (email, social media, etc.) using your stolen usernames and passwords 



 Tax fraud: Using stolen personal information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds 



 Medical identity theft: Using your stolen information to get medical services and prescriptions, or to fraudulently file insurance claims 



 Employment fraud: Using your stolen information to illegally gain employment or benefits 



 Blackmail or extortion: Threatening to expose your sensitive information unless you pay a ransom 



 Creating fake identities: Using your stolen information to create new identities for various fraudulent purposes.

   Academia is facing challenges in managing non-human identities (NHIs), which are essential for modern research systems but often treated like human users. As NHIs grow in complexity, issues like token sprawl, access management misalignments, and compliance difficulties arise, especially in collaborative environments like high-performance computing. Traditional directories fail to manage these iden

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Academia has always been about pushing boundaries—whether in knowledge, technology, or collaboration. But as research grows more complex and reliant on technology, so too does the need to address a hidden layer of identity management. I’m talking about non-human identities (NHIs): those workloads, APIs, batch jobs, and software systems that work tirelessly behind the scenes. This is more than service accounts and bots. This is the underlying infrastructure for modern IT systems. </p>



<p>NHIs aren’t a new concept, but how we manage them today isn’t just outdated—it’s risky. Let’s dig in.</p>



 What Are NHIs? 



<p>Think about the processes that underpin research in a university. Automated data collection? That’s an NHI. Research simulations running on high-performance computing (HPC) systems? Also NHIs. APIs that manage sensitive student and research data? You guessed it—NHIs. These identities are everywhere, yet we still treat them like human users in many cases, with joiner/mover/leaver workflows and directory mappings.</p>



<p>And while this “fit them into the human box” approach might work on a small scale, it doesn’t secure the infrastructure they’re tied to. That’s a problem.</p>



 Why NHIs Are a Challenge 



<p>NHIs often inherit the same challenges as their human counterparts, only amplified by scale and complexity. Here’s a snapshot of the issues:</p>



 
 Token Sprawl: OAuth account tokens being passed around like candy at Halloween. (I feel like I need to make an analogy about cavities and decay, but I’ll just leave that here because iew.) 



 Access Management: Misaligned permissions, often shared across workloads, create opportunities for breaches. 



 Auditing and Compliance: Many HPC environments and collaborative research projects struggle to track what access NHIs have, much less prove compliance with regulations. 



 Security Gaps: Relying on directories and manual processes doesn’t cut it when workloads operate across different systems and organizations. 
 



<p>A common example? Research collaboration in HPC environments. These systems often involve shared resources accessed by NHIs with wildly varying permissions. Without precise controls, compliance becomes a nightmare, and auditing feels like playing whack-a-mole with invisible targets.</p>



 Directories: The Bottleneck We Can’t Ignore 



<p>But wait! We have directories to keep everything organized! Won’t that help? (All my enterprise IAM friends just did a full-body cringe reading that.)</p>



<p>Here’s the thing about directories: they’re fantastic for managing human identities in traditional environments. But when it comes to NHIs, directories quickly become a bottleneck. Why? Because they assume every identity—human or non-human—can be neatly slotted into a joiner-mover-leaver model.</p>



<p>For NHIs, this model is fundamentally flawed:</p>



 
 No Natural Lifecycle: Workloads, APIs, and batch jobs don’t “move” or “leave” in the same way people do. They’re created and destroyed based on operational needs, often spinning up and down in milliseconds. A directory simply can’t keep pace with this churn. 



 Token Dependency: OAuth tokens are often used as a workaround, passed around to grant temporary access. But this approach doesn’t scale—it’s prone to sprawl, lacks visibility, and creates security risks when tokens are misused or stolen. 



 Lack of Context: Directories were designed for human-centric workflows, meaning they lack the context required to manage the nuanced relationships NHIs have with systems, resources, and data. 
 



<p>The result? Academic IAM systems often end up overburdened and unable to scale to the demands of modern, complex environments. Imagine trying to cram a sprawling HPC infrastructure into a directory originally built to manage faculty and students—it’s like forcing a square peg into a round hole.</p>



 The Role of DevOps, IT, and IAM Teams 



<p>Managing NHIs isn’t a one-team job—it’s a cross-functional effort. DevOps and IT teams usually own the operational infrastructure, while IAM teams handle policy enforcement. But these groups often speak different “languages,” making collaboration tricky.</p>



<p>That’s where standards and architecture frameworks come in. Efforts like the IETF’s WIMSE draft aim to create a shared understanding of how to secure NHIs in multi-system environments. It’s a step in the right direction, but adoption isn’t straightforward.</p>



 Building Better NHI Management 



<p>So, how can academia start tackling the NHI problem more effectively?</p>



 
 Establish Clear Ownership: Decide who is responsible for managing NHIs, from provisioning to decommissioning. 



 Adopt Standards: Leverage frameworks like <a href="https://spiffe.io">SPIFFE</a> and <a href="https://ietf-wg-wimse.github.io/">WIMSE</a> to create consistent, scalable trust models. Learn how to use the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals Framework</a> and the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-specification-1_0.html">Continuous Access Evaluation Profile</a> (CAEP).  



 Invest in Automation: Automate the boring stuff, like token issuance and revocation, to reduce human error. (Hot take: CAEP can help here, too.) 



 Foster Collaboration: Create spaces for DevOps, IT, and IAM teams to align on priorities and processes. 
 



 Looking Ahead 



<p>The future of NHIs in academia isn’t just about solving today’s problems—it’s about enabling the next generation of research. Imagine a world where workload identities are as dynamic as the systems they operate in, seamlessly supporting complex collaborations across institutions. Standards and open-source tools will be key to making that vision a reality.</p>



<p>But here’s the catch: it’s not just a technical challenge. NHIs require governance, funding, and attention from leadership to ensure they’re managed sustainably. Without these, even the best tools won’t fix the problem.</p>

  <p>Organizations are confronted with unprecedented challenges in managing and securing identities across hybrid environments due to the growing complexity of the digital landscape.</p>
<p>While Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) solutions provide a foundation, the increasing complexity of identity ecosystems demands a more comprehensive approach to maintain visibility, security and control.</p>
<p>Modern identity management requires solutions that can bridge the gap between IGA and directory management. Advanced tools can consolidate visibility across hybrid environments, provide fine-grained control, and enhance delegation capabilities. These solutions complement IGA by addressing the limitations of native directory management and improving overall security posture.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look at the challenges of breadth vs. depth in managing target systems, but also the common scenario of different teams being responsible for different parts of the infrastructure such as the IGA solution vs. Microsoft Active Directory. He will provide insights not only when to use multiple solutions, but also discuss approaches on a TOM (Target Operating Model) that leads to consistent management of diverse environments.</p>
<p>Robert Kraczek, Global Strategist at One Identity will showcase how solutions like Active Roles can serve as connectors to various directories, providing a single pane of glass for hybrid environments. He will demonstrate how these tools enhance security, improve efficiency, and complement existing IGA solutions to address the complexities of modern identity ecosystems.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enhancing-identity-ecosystem"></a>

			 Satjapong Meeklai is Senior DevSecOps Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>Hi guys. My name is Satjapong Meeklai. I’m Thai, born and live in Bangkok. I’ve always been passionate about technology since I was young so I spent most of my time using computers and the internet to learn new things. After finishing high school, I decided to study computer science at a university in Thailand. And fortunately after graduating, I got a Japanese government scholarship to continue my higher education in Tokyo. After obtaining a master degree, I came back to Thailand and devoted myself as a technician because I love doing hands-on works, trying various types of roles in this field and eventually, decided to focus on becoming a DevSecOps engineer who work in Fintech and Web3 startups because I believe in the industries so I’m trying to make some contributions to this major shift to happen which hopefully will create positive impacts to other people around the world.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>After completing my master’s degree, I was drawn to data science and AI, so I pursued a role as a data scientist. I joined an early-stage startup focused on sentiment analysis, where I wore many hats due to the small team. Besides building machine learning models, I handled data cleaning, preprocessing, backend development, and DevOps. Through this experience, I discovered a passion for DevOps, leading me to shift my career in that direction.</p>
<p>I continued working in startups, valuing their fast-paced, impactful environments. For four years, I was the lead DevOps engineer at Opn, a Thai fintech company that became a unicorn. Managing a team of nine, I contributed meaningfully to the company’s success, which remains one of my proudest achievements.</p>
<p>While at Opn, I became interested in Blockchain and Web3, eventually leaving to join a small Web3 startup in digital asset custody. Although the company closed due to market challenges, my interest in Web3 grew. This led me to Tokeny, a platform for tokenizing traditional assets, which I see as a bridge to open finance in the Web3 era. I’m excited to help drive this transformation.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>So far it has been very pleasant for me. People here are kind, nice, but work hard. They’re good at what they do. I can feel the determination of what we want to build and deliver to the community. We are here to create changes. That is what I can tell after working here for several months.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I think not dying in vain would probably be something I’m passionate about the most. I want the existence of myself to have a positive impact and influence on people around me. I no longer dream of changing the world myself but I’d like to support, contribute, and be a part of that something together with others to create positive results for the community, society, country, and/or the world instead. In the end, what I care about the most is myself being in a position where I’m proud and happy about myself, the decisions I made, the things I do, and do not regret how I live and what I’ve done to people around me.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Be one of the early employees of an incredibly successful tech company while being a good, caring leader to my family.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>First you should believe in your own vision. Then try to align that vision with the company. Then you will find that whatever you do, either for yourself or the company, is meaningful by themselves.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>I’m excited about our mission to build the world of open finance and how this will change the world of traditional finance. It’s pretty interesting to see what will change in 5 to 10 years from now with the power of the Web3 industry and Tokeny.</p>

 A Need for Verifiable Digital Credentials in Government <p>Government agencies face significant challenges in delivering secure, reliable identity credentialing and verification processes that are built for today’s digital world. Protecting residents' data from unauthorized access is essential, as is providing secure, accessible ways for residents to easily verify their identities across digital and physical channels as they go about their day-to-day.</p><p>The outdated, paper-based systems that exist today slow down government processes and introduce vulnerabilities, such as fraud, inefficiencies, and elevated administrative costs. These challenges not only affect the security and privacy of residents’ data, but also put a strain on government resources. We believe that to meet the demands of a digital-first society, agencies must transition away from paper-based credentials, which are vulnerable to tampering, to secure, verifiable digital credentials. Read on to learn more about the top 10 real world applications in government today, and how SpruceID is helping partner with agencies for digital transformation.</p> Today’s Top 10 Real-World Applications <p>When it comes to verifiable digital credentials in government, 10 use cases is just barely scratching the surface. However, the list below outlines several in-demand applications today where digital credentials bring significant advantages, greatly benefiting both government entities and the people they serve:</p>  Mobile Driver’s License (mDL): Physical IDs may be the norm, but they are easily lost, stolen, or damaged, making residents vulnerable to identity theft and fraud. Law enforcement, businesses, and government agencies spend valuable time verifying IDs, and the reliance on physical cards slows down services and increases errors. With high-assurance verifiable digital credentials (VDCs), verification becomes faster, more secure, and far less vulnerable to tampering with. The added convenience and security offered by a mobile driver’s license creates a streamlined, fraud-resistant environment where residents don’t have to rely on easily compromised physical cards. Read more about <a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/california-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com">how SpruceID helped the State of California implement their mobile driver’s license program</a>, and the benefits they’ve seen so far.  Outdoor Licenses and Permits: Today’s outdoor licenses and permits (such as boating or fishing licenses) are largely paper-based, which are easy to lose or counterfeit, and enforcing them can be difficult. Conservation officers lack real-time verification tools, making enforcement difficult and allowing illegal activities to go unchecked. Digital permits with VDCs provide instant, reliable proof with an easy way to verify the credentials, supporting conservation efforts and reducing illegal activities—all while protecting public lands and waters. Learn about <a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/utah-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com">how SpruceID worked with Utah to launch digital off-road vehicle permits</a> and how they’ve benefitted.  Incarcerated Individuals and Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement: Today, approximately 27% of formerly incarcerated individuals are unemployed. This statistic highlights the significant barriers to employment these individuals face, particularly in accessing proper identification. The criminal justice system’s reliance on outdated, paper-based records not only creates vulnerabilities in identity management and record accuracy but also complicates access to essential rehabilitative services. These inefficiencies lead to security risks, identity errors, and hindered re-entry support. Verifiable digital credentials can help facilitate access to job applications, housing, and social services, while removing barriers to re-enter society and rebuild their lives.  Marriage and Birth Certificates: Paper marriage certificates, birth certificates, and even social security cards are essential but vulnerable to loss, damage, and forgery, which complicates access to legal rights and government services. Verifying these documents can also be a slow process, creating roadblocks for individuals needing to prove familial status for health benefits, citizenship, and legal matters. VDCs ensure secure, instant access to these vital records, protecting individuals’ identities and preventing fraudulent claims. They can also help streamline processes such as enrolling your new baby onto your health insurance — as discussed in <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/new-baby-new-headache-how-verifiable-digital-credentials-could-simplify-insurance-enrollment/">our recent blog post</a>.  Social Services Access (SNAP/Medicaid): Accessing social services with paper-based documentation is cumbersome and prone to errors. Individuals who qualify may face delays or rejections, while ineligible recipients can exploit the system, diverting funds from those in need. By using VDCs, agencies can improve efficiency and reduce fraud by allowing for real-time verification of eligibility, ensuring benefits reach the right individuals faster and reducing strain on the social services infrastructure.  Civic Participation: Fraud and manipulation risks increase, threatening the integrity of civic participation such as responding to RFCs (requests for comments) or submitting feedback to political representatives. Verifiable digital credentials create a secure, accessible way to ensure that for example, someone is a resident and not a bot, without oversharing information. This approach has also been considered for simultaneously improving our voting systems’ security and engagement with the new generation.  Land and Property Records: Paper-based land records can be misplaced, tampered with, or falsified, leading to property disputes, unclear ownership, and legal issues that impact families and businesses. To mitigate these issues and more, VDCs provide a secure way to manage property records, ensure property rights are protected, and enhance transparency in property ownership.  Disaster Relief: In times of disaster, quickly verifying the identity and eligibility of individuals seeking relief is crucial but challenging with traditional paper documents. When someone loses their paper documents, aid can be delayed, misallocated, or vulnerable to fraud, hindering the response and leaving affected people without timely support. VDCs allow for quick, secure verification of those in need, ensuring relief reaches the right people and enable response teams to act efficiently during critical moments. Our credentials are accessible even in remote areas, without wifi or cell service.  Government Employee Access and Verification: Current reliance on physical IDs for government employees and veterans can lead to unauthorized access, fraud, and security breaches. Verifiable digital credentials provide a secure way to verify identity of government employees such as military or veterans, protecting restricted spaces and sensitive information, while allowing instant access to necessary services and benefits that are exclusive to military and veterans, among other government employees.  Cross-Border Travel Credentials: Physical cross-border travel documents such as customs clearance forms, visas, and health certificates and more are vulnerable to forgery and theft, creating security risks and causing delays at border crossings. VDCs offer a way to consolidate identity, customs, and health credentials into one streamlined verification process. This speeds up clearance, improves safety, and enhances global security and health compliance, delivering a more efficient experience for travelers and border authorities alike.  <p></p> SpruceID’s Solution <p>SpruceID works with a variety of public sector agencies to issue verifiable digital credentials, creating a system of trust, security, and convenience that can be applied across numerous government applications. Our Credible platform supports issuing a range of digital credentials, from mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) to professional certifications. These credentials use cryptographic digital signatures, ensuring that they cannot be falsified, shared through screenshots, or recreated by AI-generated deepfakes.</p><p>Our solutions prioritize minimal disclosure of personal data, enabling residents to verify credentials with only essential information (for example, only needing to show your age to enter a bar while keeping your personal address hidden). This keeps personal data secure and compliant with privacy regulations, all while eliminating government tracking or surveillance. In addition, Credible helps to drive increased efficiency, as digital processes streamline verifications and reduce administrative bottlenecks, ultimately saving time for both agencies and residents. By minimizing reliance on paper, agencies significantly lower overhead costs related to printing, mailing, and administrative handling, creating a cost-effective, privacy-centric solution.</p> Shaping the Future of Digital Identity in Government <p>We envision a future where government agencies fully leverage verifiable digital credential solutions that align with standards and advance alongside open-source industry collaborations.&nbsp;</p><p>Through partnerships with agencies such as the California DMV, we demonstrate our commitment to creating scalable, interoperable solutions. By embracing VDCs, government agencies can protect citizens, enhance services, and reduce administrative burdens, empowering everyone securely and efficiently.

<p>In the open-source world, there is a well-known dilemma: it’s very difficult to find funding for deep infrastructure-level projects. We knew, when envisioning Holochain, what we wanted to bring into the world — the capacity for groups of people to create digital spaces in which to engage without the need for any intermediaries or web servers. We wanted it to work with nothing but the computers of the very groups of people wanting to engage.</p><p>Well, that counts as a deep open-source infrastructure-level project. So we came up with a strategy to create a company that needed Holochain’s new infrastructural capacity, and could market its business proposition and plan. But instead of being owned by venture capital, it would be owned by an open-source foundation on behalf of all the eventual users of that infrastructure.</p><p>That vision led us to launch Holo as a distributed cloud hosting company for Holochain apps, that would also use Holochain itself to manage that cloud infrastructure, and do the value accounting between hosts and app providers. This was a complex and tall order.&nbsp; And so for the past years, all of us in the Holo/Holochain world have been driving primarily to meet Holo’s needs, as we’ve been implementing Holochain itself. Admittedly, it’s taken us significantly longer than we initially thought to build out the depth of the Holochain feature set, along with the complex infrastructure that Holo needed to offer generalized Holochain-based cloud hosting. It’s been hard going. In the meantime, the world has also changed around us, revealing new demands of where and how Holochain actually wants to be used in today’s market, demands that are different from what we initially envisioned.</p><p>To meet these changes, and to increase our capacity to deliver, we are updating our strategy, which means a significant organizational restructuring. You can read the announcement of this restructuring on the <a href="https://press.holo.host/243118-shifting-gears-to-delivery-volla-phone-apps-powered-by-holochain?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holo.host press site</a>.</p><p>But what does this mean more specifically for the Holochain Foundation? Foremost, the Foundation will move from being a passive holder of the Holochain intellectual property, on behalf of the community, into being the active operational entity supporting and managing the Holochain development team.</p><p>Part of our “coming of age” is realizing that we can’t do everything we might like. Focus matters. Our strategic plan for delivering on our mission of “fostering the evolution and thriving of the Holochain framework and related ecosystems”, begins with just one thing: The stability and reliability of Holochain, such that it can be deployed as industrial-strength, mission-critical infrastructure by commercial projects as well as our community stakeholders. What this means in practice is testing, testing, testing! This includes:</p>  Continued build-out of our “Wind Tunnel” performance testing framework so that we can verify that Holochain’s operating envelope, across each one of its features, meets or exceeds the demands of the specific projects currently bringing Holochain applications to market.  Ensuring the sufficiency of testing code coverage of each of Holochain’s key features and undertaking any refactors necessary to bring them in line with our stakeholder’s needs.  Upgrading our release patterns so that stakeholders delivering mission-critical apps can conditionally enable the more experimental and not-fully-tested features, while those stakeholders who are on the bleeding edge can help develop and test those very features.  <p>We believe that the Holochain Foundation’s coming-of-age shifts us into delivering on our mission by serving our stakeholders better. We are deeply committed to our partners and ecosystem stakeholders that are currently delivering or developing Holochain apps, both the newer ones like the Volla and its Messages app for the new Quintus Volla Phone, data provenance solutions from Kwaxala, verified data for semi-fungbile token solutions including the recently released Jade City vaults, decentralized game data for esports, the new Visible Verification project, and the a project with Carbistry in the voluntary carbon market domain; and also to those partners who’ve been with us for a long time, like Darksoil Studio, Humm Hive, Neighbourhoods, Coasys, Lightningrod Labs, Carbon Farm Network, Valueflows, and others; and of course, supporting the features needed by the reorganized Holo and HoloFuel organizations. We are also preparing for larger-scale adoption of Holochain solutions in 2025, including collaborations with major players in the industrial supply chain and media industries.</p><p>As part of the reorganization and living into our commitment to focus, I will be stepping in as Executive Director of the Holochain Foundation. This will allow our current Executive Director, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maryfcamacho/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Mary Camacho</a>, to concentrate on Holo’s new direction, as well as her passion of enabling commercial projects both directly and via new structures within the Foundation.</p><p>There’s much more in store for the Foundation going forward, especially around expanded and more formal structures for stakeholder involvement and engagement in Holochain’s development. This will take us a while to roll out, but you can expect more details in the next months. If your work depends on Holochain and you have feedback for what you would like to see from the Foundation going forward, please email me and Paul at <a href="mailto:feedback2024@holochain.org">feedback2024@holochain.org</a> [Editor: we have changed this address since publication; please try this new address if you couldn't get through before].</p><p>Thanks for being with us as we grow up and into our next phase.</p><p>– Eric Harris-Braun</p><p>PS: We’ve been working on an update to the Holochain White Paper this year, and <a href="https://holochain.org/papers/?ref=blog.holochain.org">it’s finally published</a>! It makes the claim for a practical Byzantine fault tolerant system for everyday use, as distinct from systems that are robust but costly in practice. It’s accompanied by another paper, Players of Ludos, which tells the story of how Holochain works through the activities of a group of nomadic board game players.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@a_sobotyak?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Anton Sobotyak</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-bear-standing-in-the-middle-of-a-forest-H2HBg5Ov86o?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></p>

 We explore some of the challenges our customers have faced this year and how they plan to tackle fraud in 2025. 



<p>By the end of this year, more than <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identity-first-future-trends-2024/">70 billion identity verification checks</a> will have been made. In a world of just 8 billion, these numbers appear absolutely staggering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, when you consider how frequently people have their identity verified in this ‘always on, always connected’ world, the number is perhaps not as high as it would originally seem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nowadays, people have their identity verified and reverified without giving it much thought, undergoing data and document checks and age verification to use most digital services. In the not-too distant past, if you wanted to open a bank account, rent a vehicle or use a particular service, you would invariably be required to visit a brick-and-mortar store, clutching at least two forms of paper identification. Even then, the process was unlikely to conclude on the same day, with prospective customers often needing to wait a further series of days until their identity could be verified and they could access said service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nowadays, thanks to a range of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/in-person-verification/">in-person</a> identity verification services, this can be done in a matter of minutes, affording unrivalled convenience that many would have thought impossible just a decade ago. Striking a balance between offering an identity verification process that is secure for the business but convenient for the customer is essential. Without it, the business runs the risk of fraud attacks, which can impact its reputation and bottom line and ultimately lead to customer abandonment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To discover the challenges that our customers have been facing in 2024 and what next year may look like, we conducted the inaugural IDnow Customer Survey 2024, featuring a number of clients across the UK, France and Germany. Respondents held a variety of positions from Product Managers to Head of Compliance.</p>



 Top 3 identity verification challenges in 2024. 



  Increasing operational efficiencies and cutting costs (53%).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Keeping conversion rates high (47%).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Managing the volume and wide range of different types of fraud attacks / Keeping up with technological developments in fraud and identity verification (both 41%).  



 How our customers tackled fraud in 2024. 



<p>The costs of a business falling victim to fraud go way beyond financial. Yes, fraud impacts the bottom line, but it can also have a disastrous effect on company reputation and lead to customers losing trust in the brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To safeguard against this and prevent fraud, six out of 10 of our customers said they had conducted training sessions to enable staff to better identify internal and external fraud risks, while 53% said they had invested in new fraud prevention technologies. Just over a third (35%) said they had deployed multi-layered identity verification procedures, including data, biometric and database checks, such as for PEPs and Sanctions.</p>

 Preparing for fraud challenges in 2025. 



<p>When asked what the biggest fraud challenge for the year ahead was, an equal number of respondents (59%) cited reputational damage from fraud attacks and the financial cost of tackling and managing fraud. This was followed very closely by just over half (53%) who said they were concerned about how a lack of consumer awareness could lead to increased fraud risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the types of fraud that customers were most concerned about, 24% of businesses seemed to be most worried about social engineering, such as phishing, while around the same number cited ID document forgery and manipulation. To a lesser extent, customers said that money mules and identity theft (both 18% each) were the primary fraud challenges in 2025. Interestingly, just 12% cited deepfake attacks (despite it becoming an <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5183263">increasingly commonplace method</a>), while just 6% of respondents cited insider threats as the top fraud challenge for 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked how they planned to fight fraud in 2025, the majority of respondents ranked effective training and upskilling staff as the most important action to be taken, followed by access to AI technologies. Internal appointment of new people responsible for fraud fighting and risk mitigation was considered the least important action to take.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, while some businesses have already deployed multi-layered anti-fraud solutions this year, a large majority of businesses expect it to be very important (70%) and somewhat important (12%) going forward. Only 6% claimed that it was not important to them at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IDnow, we recognize the importance of keeping up to date with the latest developments and techniques in fraud and run regular training sessions and courses for our clients.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p>The password is a remnant of an era before hacking and credential-based attacks became a widespread problem. Although the internet has changed significantly since the early days, passwords have only become longer and more complicated. In parallel, cybercriminals have targeted operating systems with increasing sophistication and frequency as computers have become more accessible worldwide. For years, IT professionals have discussed the idea of eliminating passwords because they can easily be compromised. In addition, passwords can be costly, time-consuming, and difficult to manage, often resulting in poor user experience. Furthermore, the fact that password reuse is a common practice among customers and employees, only exacerbates the problem.  

In the context of Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM), passwordless authentication solutions should have features and capabilities to detect, prevent, and minimize fraudulent activities and unauthorized access within an organization. Effective fraud prevention measures are crucial for protecting both the financial and reputational assets of a business. Passwordless authentication solutions should also support a variety of consumer devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers, ensuring seamless access across different platforms and operating systems.

  <p>Understanding the impact of AI on securing privileged identities has become a critical concern in today's rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape. As artificial intelligence continues to advance, it presents both opportunities and challenges for organizations striving to protect their most sensitive access points. The rise of AI-powered threats has significantly altered the traditional identity attack chain, requiring a fundamental shift in how we approach privileged identity security.</p>
<p>To combat these emerging threats, organizations must leverage cutting-edge technologies and adopt innovative strategies. By implementing AI-driven security solutions, companies can enhance their ability to detect and respond to sophisticated attacks targeting privileged identities. These advanced systems can analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, identifying anomalous behavior and potential security breaches before they escalate. Additionally, machine learning algorithms can continuously adapt and improve security measures, staying one step ahead of evolving AI-powered threats.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, will provide expert insights into the changing landscape of privileged identity security in the age of AI. He will discuss the latest trends in AI-driven threats, their impact on the identity attack chain, and offer strategic recommendations for organizations to strengthen their security posture. Martin will also explore the potential of AI as a defensive tool and how it can be leveraged to enhance privileged access management.</p>
<p>Morey J. Haber, Chief Security Advisor at BeyondTrust will share practical experiences and best practices for safeguarding privileged identities against AI-powered threats. He will present three key tips that organizations can implement to protect themselves from emerging AI-driven attacks.

<p>Web 5 is a decentralized platform that provides a new identity layer for the web to enable decentralized apps and protocols.</p>

<p>In the current web model, users do not own their data or identity. They are given accounts by companies and their data is held captive in app silos. To create a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center, we must empower them with self-owned identity and restore control over their data.</p>

 
  
  
  Components of Web 5
 

<p>There are three main pillars of the decentralized web platform, all of which are based on open standards.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F3o23aim9vcy6p5ljnegk.png"></a></p>

 
  
  
  Decentralized Identifiers
 

<p>The identifiers we know and use today are owned by the government, a company, an organization, or some other intermediary. For example, our email addresses and social media handles are identifiers associated with us but are owned and controlled by the service providers. These companies have the right to ban, disable, or delete these identifiers and we have little to no control over this.</p>

<p>So before we can realize truly decentralized applications, we need decentralized identifiers that users own and control. This removes the dependency on centralized entities to authenticate and represent us.</p>

<p>​​<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a W3C standard. They have a standardized structure that essentially links to you and your information.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fem04i5oym7ov53uqh8ju.png"></a></p>

<p>They are a long string of text that consists of three parts:</p>

 
 the URI scheme identifier, which is did 
 the identifier for a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-methods">DID method</a>
 
 the DID method-specific identifier 
 

<p>DIDs are the only component of Web5 that touch a blockchain, which is generally limited to anchoring the keys/endpoints linked to the ID.</p>

<p>That being said, anchoring DIDs on Bitcoin (or any blockchain) is not a requirement. In fact, what's great about having the standardized formatting for DIDs is that they can be anchored anywhere or not anchored at all and this still works, although with varying levels of decentralization.</p>

<p>Here are examples of DIDs on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain, and the web. Notice they all use the same format: scheme, DID method, and DID method-specific identifier.<br>
</p>

 
 <code>did:btcr:xyv2-xzpq-q9wa-p7t
did:ens:some.eth
did:web:example.com
</code> 

 



<p>Because personal data is not stored on the blockchain, the DID essentially acts as a URI that associates the subject of the DID (the person, company, or object being identified) with a DID document that lives off-chain.</p>

<p>DID Documents are JSON files stored in decentralized storage systems such as IPFS, and describe how to interact with the DID subject. The DID Document contains things like the DID subject's public keys, authentication and verification methods, and service endpoints that reference the locations of the subject’s data.<br>
</p>

 
 <code>{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8",
      "type": "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",
      "controller": "did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8"
    }
  ],
  "authentication": ["did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8"]
}
</code> 

 



 
  
  
  Verifiable Credentials
 

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> are a fully ratified W3C standard that work hand in hand with Decentralized Identifiers to enable trustless interactions - meaning two parties do not need to trust one another to engage, but claims made about a DID subject can be verified.</p>

<p>For example, Alice needs to prove she has a bank account at Acme Bank. Acme Bank issues a cryptographically signed Verifiable Credential which would be stored in Alice's identity wallet.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fefm890yotoj5io28ol95.png"></a></p>

<p>The credential contains the issuer as Acme and the subject as Alice, as well as the claims, which are Alice's account number and full name.</p>

<p>Upon request for proof of banking, Alice presents the Verifiable Credential that's cryptographically signed by both Alice as well as her bank.</p>

<p>This is an easy, machine-readable way to share credentials across the web. The Verifier does not know or trust Alice, but they do consider Acme trustworthy, and they have essentially vouched for Alice therefore distributing trust.</p>

 
  
  
  Decentralized Web Nodes
 

<p>Today, centralized entities act as our data stores. Applications hold all of our content and preferences on their servers.</p>

<p><a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">Decentralized Web Nodes</a> (DWNs) change this by allowing us to decouple our data from the applications that we use, and instead host our data ourselves in our own personal data stores.</p>

<p><a href="https://bsky.social/about/">BlueSky</a> is a good example; it's a decentralized social media app. With BlueSky, your tweets and your connections aren't stored with the application. They are stored with you. So you can present your content on any decentralized social media app you want, not just BlueSky.</p>

<p>Your DWNs can hold both public and encrypted data. For example, in the case of a decentralized social media app, you'd want data like your posts and your connections to be public but things like your DMs to be private.</p>

<p>Your decentralized web nodes do not live on the blockchain. You can host your web nodes anywhere (your phone, computer, etc) and can replicate them across your devices and clouds and all data will be synced.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhfafo8u2dosqqjdddlbp.png"></a></p>

<p>While self-hosting your DWNs provides a means for decentralizing your data, we recognize some users will be more comfortable with others hosting their web nodes for convenience sake. We envision there will be vendors offering to host your web nodes for you. The good part about that is you can encrypt any private data so unlike today where cloud hosts can scan everything that you host there, you can still maintain some privacy even if you have your web nodes hosted by intermediaries.</p>

<p>Your DWNs are associated with your Decentralized Identifiers and are listed in a DID document.</p>

<p>Notice the <code>serviceEndpoint</code> section of the DID doc specifies service endpoints and provides URIs to the decentralized web nodes.<br>
</p>

 
 <code>{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:web:example.com:u:alice",
  "service": [
    {
      "id": "#dwn",
      "type": "DecentralizedWebNode",
      "serviceEndpoint": {
        "nodes": ["https://dwn.example.com", "00:11:22:33:FF:EE"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:web:example.com:u:alice",
      "type": "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",
      "controller": "did:web:example.com:u:alice"
    }
  ],
  "authentication": ["did:web:example.com:u:alice"]
}
</code> 

 



<p>Given an application has the address to your DWN, they can send you a request for data.</p>

<p>This represents a request from an application to obtain all objects within a DWN that follow the <code>SocialMediaPosting</code> schema:<br>
</p>

 
 <code>    POST https://dwn.example.com/
    BODY {
      "requestId": "c5784162-84af-4aab-aff5-f1f8438dfc3d",
      "target": "did:example:123",
      "messages": [
        {
          "descriptor": {
            "method": "CollectionsQuery",
            "schema": "https://schema.org/SocialMediaPosting"
          }
        },
        {...}
      ]
    }
</code> 

 



<p>The data within DWNs are JSON objects that follow a universal standard, thus making it possible for any application to discover and process the data given its semantic type.</p>

<p>If this data is public, those objects will be automatically returned to the application, and if the data is private, the node owner would need to grant the application access to that data.</p>

 
  
  
  Identity Wallets
 

<p>Obviously all of this is pretty complicated, especially for non-technical users. So we need a simplistic, easy to use interface that will allow people to access and manage their identity.</p>

<p>A well designed identity wallet would provide ways to manage the data stored in decentralized web nodes, the decentralized IDs and the context in which they should be used, verifiable credentials, and authorizations.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fk8gqpts8kuhjh6d8ldza.png"></a></p>

 
  
  
  Decentralized Web Apps
 

<p>Web 5 enables developers to build decentralized web applications (DWAs) on top of it and it’s all open source! You're free to use it as your foundation and focus your attention on what you really care about, your app. Web5 brings to DWAs what cloud and application servers bring to enterprise apps. It does the hard part. It brings decentralization. By building your apps on top of Web 5, you get decentralization and identity and data management as part of the platform.</p>

<p>This is definitely a fundamental change in how we exchange data, but it's not a total overhaul of the web we already know. This works like Progressive Web Apps, but you'd add the decentralized web node SDK and then applications are free to really go serverless because the data isn't stored with them.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1yv3um97u6y5zz37g2dx.png"></a></p>

<p>The sky's the limit to what you can build on top of this platform, but here are some cool basic examples.</p>

 
  
  
  Music Applications
 

<p>No one likes recreating their music playlists over and over again for different apps. With Web 5, you wouldn't have to do that.</p>

<p>In this example, Groove has access to write to Alice's decentralized web node and adds a new entry.</p>

<p>Tidal has access to read from Alice's DWN, so can read the new entry that was added by Groove, and now Alice has her playlist readily available on both apps.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8gnd47k4yr70be8e055w.png"></a></p>

<p>With the continuous utilization of the data across apps, not only do Groove and Tidal get access to Alice's data, but they use it to improve her user experience, thus creating a stronger experience than Alice could have ever gotten had she not used this tech.</p>

 
  
  
  Travel Applications
 

<p>Your travel preferences, tickets, and reservations are scattered across so many different hotels, airlines, rental car agencies and travel apps, making it really difficult to coordinate. Heaven forbid there's any hiccup in the system such as a delayed flight. You end up trying to get in touch with the car rental place to let them know you'll be late for your reservation, and if it's really late, you'd want to call the hotel to ask them not to give away your room. All while you're hustling and bustling at the airport.</p>

<p>Web 5 can help unify these various app experiences.</p>

<p>If Alice gives the hotel, the airline, and the rental car agency access to the <code>Reservation</code> and <code>Trip</code> objects in her DWN, they can react and adjust accordingly to any changes made.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fa2ktpx7xrv3iupmbud5q.png"></a></p>

<p>These are just a few applications that can be realized by building on top of Web 5. There's so many more possibilities once the web is truly decentralized the way it was always intended to be.</p>

  <p>At the recent <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/news-releases/dmv-recognizes-companies-for-outstanding-mdl-use-cases-at-first-community-hackathon/">California DMV Hackathon</a>, the Block team, represented by members from Square and TBD, won the Best Privacy &amp; Security Design award for building a prototype of an instant age verification system. This solution utilizes mobile drivers’ licenses (mDLs) to provide secure, privacy-centric transactions for age-restricted purchases with Square’s Point of Sale (POS) system.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll explore the core technical components behind our solution, which centered on using TruAge technology to enable seamless, secure age verification.</p>

 
  
  
  How TruAge QR Code Verification Works
 

<p>At the heart of our prototype is the ability to scan and verify a <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/truage/">TruAge Age Token QR code</a>. These QR codes contain a verifiable credential (VC) that confirms a person’s legal age without exposing unnecessary personal information. Here’s a breakdown of how we approached verifying these credentials in our solution.</p>

 
 
<p>Decoding the QR Code Payload </p>

<p>The first step in the verification process was reading the QR code provided by the customer. TruAge QR codes follow a standard format which encodes the verifiable presentation (VP) in a compact <a href="https://cbor.io/">CBOR</a> format.</p>

<p>Our team implemented a scanner using our open source web5-swift SDK that reads the QR code and decodes the CBOR-encoded payload. This CBOR format is efficient, allowing the verifiable presentation to be transmitted and processed quickly, minimizing any delays at the point of sale.</p>
 
 
<p>Converting CBOR to JSON </p>

<p>Once we decoded the CBOR data, the next step was to parse it into a JSON-based verifiable presentation using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VC) Data Model v1.1</a>. This model is critical to ensuring interoperability across different platforms and services, as it standardizes how credentials are represented and exchanged in a decentralized manner.</p>
 
 
<p>Validating the Issuer’s DID </p>

<p>After converting the data into a verifiable format, we needed to validate the digital signature on the credential. We retrieved the issuer’s Decentralized Identifier (DID) from the TruAge server, which provided us access to a sandbox environment containing their list of authorized DIDs.</p>

<p>Using DIDs, we were able to validate the cryptographic signature to ensure that the credential was issued by a trusted TruAge provider. This validation step is critical for ensuring that the credential has not been tampered with and is issued by a legitimate authority.</p>
 
 
<p>Credential Content Verification </p>

<p>Once the issuer’s signature was validated, the next step was to check the contents of the verifiable credential itself. In this case, we looked for proof that the individual was over 21 and verified that the credential had not expired.</p>

<p>This lightweight verification process ensures that businesses can quickly and easily confirm a customer’s legal age, while protecting their privacy by not exposing sensitive information like birthdates or addresses.</p>
 
 

 
  
  
  Building the Integration: Web5 and TruAge Libraries
 

<p>To bring this solution to life, we used a few key technologies:</p>

 
 <p>iOS: Our team developed the iOS implementation using the web5-swift library, which allowed us to efficiently handle the scanning, decoding, and parsing of the TruAge QR codes on Apple devices. </p> 
 <p>Android: For Android, we modified the TruAge library provided by Digital Bazaar to make it compatible with our solution. This involved adapting the library for seamless integration with our QR code parsing and validation logic. </p> 
 

 
  
  
  Privacy and Security at the Forefront
 

<p>Our approach ensures that personal information is protected at every stage of the transaction. By focusing solely on verifying the specific data point needed (in this case, whether someone is over 21), we avoid collecting or storing any unnecessary information. This is a win for both businesses and consumers, as it minimizes risk while maintaining a smooth user experience.</p>

<p>By integrating this technology into <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/point-of-sale/retail">Square’s Retail POS system</a>, we not only enhanced security but also brought innovative, privacy-preserving solutions to small businesses that need to comply with age verification laws. This prototype has the potential to extend to many other use cases, from secure employee onboarding to identity verification for suppliers and customers.</p>

<p>The community has just voted to end KILT Delegator rewards now rather than later — marking a strategic move from incentives toward sustainable growth.The delegator rewards were originally planned to last two years after Golive, but the community extended them for another year. Now, the community has decided to end this additional phase ahead of schedule, signaling a shift in priorities: lower inflation over higher&nbsp;rewards.</p> What’s Changed? <p>Delegator Rewards Ended: Effective immediately, Delegator rewards are set to 0%, lowering inflation significantly. However, Delegators can continue staking and play a role in KILT’s governance.</p><p>Collator Rewards Remain: Collators keep the KILT network operational, and their rewards will continue to support network reliability.</p> Why the&nbsp;Change? <p>Delegator rewards were initially intended to incentivize participation and stake on the most reliable collators, but they were intended to eventually phase out. It was a critical step in KILT’s growth, and the role delegators have played has been invaluable in maintaining the reliability of the KILT network. Now, with a strong foundation in place, the community is ready to move forward by reducing inflation and focusing on KILT’s expanding utility.</p><p>With bonding curves, KILT is entering a new era of utility, making the delegator reward incentives no longer necessary.</p> What’s Next? <p>The KILT community’s decision showcases the power of decentralized governance in action, bringing about meaningful change that serves both current and future participants. Your input continues to be crucial as KILT rolls out new features and community-driven initiatives.</p> Gratitude to the KILT Community <p>A heartfelt thank you to all KILT Delegators, Collators, and community members for your unwavering support, valuable input, and dedication. Together, we’re crafting a stronger and more sustainable future for KILT.

<p>The paper, by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drpaulashley/?originalSubdomain=au">Dr Paul Ashley</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-mulhearn-65490b1a5/?originalSubdomain=au">Ellen Schofield</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-mulhearn-65490b1a5/?originalSubdomain=au">George Mulhearn</a> from Anonyome Labs, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gowriram/?originalSubdomain=au">Dr Gowri Ramachandran</a> from QUT, considers how new European standards for the EU Digital Identity Wallet mandate support for a hardware security module (HSM) which can perform important cryptographic operations for very strong security and privacy protection for a user.</p>



<p>The paper outlines how an existing digital identity wallet can be enhanced to leverage an HSM, examining both inbuilt and external implementations, and presents a compatible matrix by analyzing the existing credential standards and different HSM cryptographic capabilities.</p>







<p>Watch this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_14zTBLJ_Y">short video</a>&nbsp;about the new European digital identity wallet.</p>



<p>The paper concludes that supporting the EU DI Wallet technical Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF)—common standards and technical specifications and common guidelines and best practices for a Digital Identity Framework—is feasible and practical for mobile digital identity wallet applications, but tradeoffs will occur in algorithmic compatibility, user experience, and performance.</p>



<p>We will publish the full paper after the symposium.</p>

See the <a href="https://www.symposium-dlt.org/img/SDLT_Program.pdf">symposium program</a> for more information.<br><br>Distributed ledger technology is an emerging technology, which provides the way to store and manage information in a distributed fashion. It enables the creation of decentralized crypto-currencies, smart contracts, eGovernance, supply chain management, eVoting and so on, over a network of computer systems without any human intervention.</p>



<p>Unprecedented reliability and security over other cryptographic schemes has expanded the application domains of blockchain including financial services, real estate, stock exchange, identity management, supply chain, and Internet of Things.</p>

				  A powerful, portable, privacy-preserving way to share and reuse authenticated data using Verifiable Credentials that saves farmers time, money, and tedium, while connecting stakeholders and unlocking value across the agriculture sector  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, Nov. 6, 2024: With the launch of Indicio Proven® Digital Farming, authenticated data can now be shared instantly and reused endlessly across the agriculture value chain — suppliers, government agencies, financial services, and vendors —all while maintaining the farmer’s ownership of their data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Farming is data-intensive work, with multiple data sources, and regulatory, and market requirements. Each hour spent on data management takes farmers away from farming — with a measurable economic cost. To meet the challenges of data management in agriculture, Indicio developed a flexible and scalable ecosystem solution using Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a Verifiable Credential, a farmer can hold and manage authoritative, certified farm data from their phone and share it seamlessly with other stakeholders in the agricultural value chain all while maintaining data privacy and protection.</p>
<p>It’s an easy-to-implement solution that ensures farmers fully own their data. It eliminates the need for this data to be stored by third parties in order to be authenticated. Thanks to cryptography, the data shared from a credential cannot be tampered with — and the credential origin is always known.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that data can be reused over and over again with the absolute certainty that those who need to see it can verify it as authentic. It gives farmers the power to be their own data platforms, while radically simplifying their data management burden.&nbsp;</p>
 Benefits 
 
 Farms and farmers hold and own their own data — not third parties. 
 Capture authenticated data once in tamper-proof records that can be shared from a phone.&nbsp; 
 Consent to share data is built into privacy-by-design tech. 
 Connect stakeholders across the agricultural value chain through seamless data sharing and authentication 
 Simplify regulatory compliance 
 Accelerate access to international markets 
 Proven, award-winning success in New Zealand&nbsp; 
 
 Award winning 
<p>Indicio’s Digital Farming solution was first developed for Trust Alliance New Zealand <a href="https://trustalliance.co.nz/">(TANZ)</a> , a nonprofit farming consortium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Being able to quickly share data about their goods or emissions to these key relying parties provided a huge benefit to the farmers, saving them time, creating better connections between them and their customers, and reducing the amount of effort they have to spend filling out the same forms multiple times,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-lyon-mabbett-ab9a7b1/">Sharon Lyon-Mabbet</a> Project Manager at TANZ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TANZ’s implementation has won a prestigious Constellation Research <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/events/supernova/2024">SuperNova Award</a> for Digital Safety, Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity. This is the second time an Indicio customer has won a Constellation Award.</p>

 A simple solution to an annoying and costly problem 
<p>“Verifiable Credentials are the perfect data management tool for a sector that relies on connecting multiple data sources with multiple parties for multiple purposes,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “Farmers don’t want to spend hours and hours on data management, sending the same information to multiple agencies, suppliers, and vendors. And now they don’t have to. With Indicio Proven Digital Farming, we have a capture once, reuse often technology that gives farmers full control and ownership over their data. It’s a way to turn data from being an obstacle to being an opportunity to unlock value, because now it’s easy to share authenticated data in a frictionless way with those who need to use it.”</p>
 The farmer as their own digital platform 
<p>Decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials allow farmers to hold and share all kinds of tamper-proof data that can be instantly authenticated by relying parties:</p>
 
 Farm borders 
 Farm ownership 
 Methane emissions 
 Fertilizer application (soil nitrogen levels) 
 Pesticide &amp; herbicide usage 
 Nutrient run-off 
 Water management 
 Implementation of food safety practices 
 Records for contaminant testing 
 Traceability information 
 
<p>Verifying software is simple to use and can be downloaded to a mobile device for instant in-the-field authentication.</p>

<p>If you’re alive in 2024, you’re probably used to hearing a lot about cybercrime. Large hacks, such as thefts of customers’ personal information, seem nearly constant – and they’re only projected to accelerate in coming years.</p><p>Recent advances in software development tools, however, offer hope. In February, the<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2024/02/26/press-release-technical-report/?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> White House Office of the National Cyber Director</a> issued a memo encouraging the wider adoption of what are known as “memory-safe” programming languages. That shift could mitigate up to 70% of hacks, preventing attacks that are currently causing a shockingly large amount of economic damage.</p><p>SpruceID has been an early adopter of memory-safe programming since its founding in 2020 as part of our commitment to high standards of security. Just about all of our tools are built using the memory-safe language Rust. Read on to find out more about memory-safe programming, Rust – and why all software builders should be taking similar steps into a more secure future.</p> Death By a Thousand Memory Leaks <p>Hacks based on flawed memory management are a large part of the massive economic and social harm caused by hacking – what the Council on Foreign Relations has described as a <a href="https://www.cfr.org/interview/cybertheft-and-us-economy?ref=blog.spruceid.com">“death by a thousand cuts.”</a>&nbsp; USAID estimated <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/cybersecurity/economic-growth-briefer?ref=blog.spruceid.com">$8 trillion in economic damage</a> from cybercrime worldwide in 2023. One analysis estimated that cyberattacks will cost the U.S. economy alone <a href="https://ciphertex.com/2024/05/24/the-cost-of-cyber-theft-to-the-u-s-economy-in-2024/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">more than $350 billion this year</a>. That’s more than 20 times what the U.S. federal government spends on <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/child-nutrition-programs/national-school-lunch-program/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">feeding school kids</a>.</p><p>Poor memory management is a common weakness in older but still widely-used programming languages like C and C++, and according to research by Google, memory is the root cause of<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/09/an-update-on-memory-safety-in-chrome.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> roughly 70% of all system-level hacks</a>. Very broadly, a program can be exploited when it loses track of a chunk of the short-term memory (RAM) that programs run on. Attackers can use uncontrolled or badly indexed memory to<a href="https://textbook.cs161.org/memory-safety/vulnerabilities.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> alter the intended behavior of a program</a>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/04/meltdown-spectre-worst-cpu-bugs-ever-found-affect-computers-intel-processors-security-flaw?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities</a>, which exploit memory to inject malicious code, are still a threat years after their discovery.</p><p>Wider use of memory-safe programming languages is a system-wide way to address the ceaseless torrent of hacks. The White House notice (summarized here by<a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/memory-safe-programming-languages-security-bugs/?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> Security Intelligence</a>) follows a<a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/News-Highlights/Article/Article/3215760/nsa-releases-guidance-on-how-to-protect-against-software-memory-safety-issues/?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> 2022 bulletin by the National Security Agency</a> also encouraging the move towards memory-safe programming languages. It’s unusual for agencies like the NSA to issue specific software development advice, making this guidance particularly notable.&nbsp;</p><p>The unusual push is justified because memory-safe programming presents the possibility of what might sound like a fantasy: dramatically reducing the prevalence of destructive hacks by attacking one of their root causes.</p> The Language of Choice for Secure and Reliable Solutions <p>SpruceID is committed to staying at the forefront of security standards. Our tools handle highly sensitive data and are trusted to verify its validity, often in high-security settings. With security as a top priority, we carefully design, develop, and deploy our solutions to meet these demands. That's why we build our secure applications in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Rust</a>, a programming language known for its memory safety and robustness. Its adoption by leading organizations highlights its suitability for building resilient, high-security systems, and we are glad to be part of this movement.</p><p>Rust is becoming increasingly recognized for its excellent design and is by far the most widely used memory-safe programming language. It has been integrated into critical components of Google, Linux, Windows, and Nvidia products. The February White House report can’t be seen as picking favorites, so it’s not explicit, but reading between the lines, it’s fairly clear that Rust is meant to be front and center for those mulling a path toward improved memory safety.</p><p>One of the more remarkable advantages of Rust, as <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-Android.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Google reports</a>, is that building new components with Rust provides security advantages even without re-writing or heavily modifying legacy codebases. That makes the transition far more efficient: Google began pushing Android development to memory-safe languages in 2019, and memory vulnerabilities have declined from more than 70% to just 24% of Android vulnerabilities in the years since - without overhauling existing code.</p><p>In November of last year, Microsoft announced that it was investing $10 million in improving developer tooling for Rust and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/rust-for-windows?ref=blog.spruceid.com">integrating Rust into Windows</a> and Azure environments. Microsoft also made a large contribution to the Rust Foundation, where SpruceID is also a member, and Microsoft engineers have said the Rust is mature enough to integrate into core components such as the OS kernel. Linux, the operating system that runs many industrial server systems, is also actively <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/rust-in-linux-where-we-are-and-where-were-going-next/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">integrating Rust into its core architecture</a>, shifting away from what devs consider “inherent weaknesses” in older languages.</p><p>While security is the headline, Rust does bring many other benefits. It leads to better performance in many circumstances, even in <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/rust-vs-go?ref=blog.spruceid.com">comparison to other modern languages like Go</a>. Programmers also broadly consider it a pleasure to use: Rust is far and away<a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2020?ref=blog.spruceid.com#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-lovedhttps://survey.stackoverflow.co/2020%23technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved"> the most “loved” programming language</a>, according to a survey by Stack Overflow. Programmer Gregory Szorc has explained the appeal by describing Rust as<a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2021/04/13/rust-is-for-professionals/?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> a perfect mix of innovative ideas and user-friendliness</a>. So an added benefit of Rust, and one we’ve definitely experienced at SpruceID, is that it makes it easier to attract and keep top coding talent.</p> One Important Piece of the Security Puzzle <p>While memory-safe programming languages like Rust are essential in reducing vulnerabilities, they’re only one component of a robust security program. At SpruceID, we recognize that creating secure systems goes beyond selecting a single language - it’s about designing, testing, and maintaining a multi-layered strategy for every stage of development and deployment.</p><p>Rust helps us uphold these high standards, but it’s integrated into a wider approach that includes rigorous protocols, continuous monitoring, and regular updates. Each of these components reinforces the security, reliability, and privacy that our users expect.</p> Rust is The Future <p>At SpruceID, we’re focused on building better identity systems, which are poised to become a more secure and <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/the-importance-of-protecting-digital-id-users-from-phone-home-surveillance/">more private</a> system for managing our digital lives. Building on a secure foundation, and aiding the broader transition to memory-safe programming, is a natural extension of&nbsp; SpruceID’s core mission.</p><p>This isn’t just about strong principles and good vibes, though - these recent government directives on memory safety are a strong signal that it’s the right strategic move, too. The White House sets guidelines for Federal contractors and procurement, so memory safety could become a requirement for those applications. Builders interested in working with the government should all be considering transitioning to memory-safe tools, and Rust is clearly at the top of that list.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>This article is the fifth in a series of posts about how our <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking</a> product, Track &amp; Trust, works. We described how the system works at a component level in our previous articles. Now, we dive into the challenging environment where our pilot operations have been executed. We selected Lebanon, one of the most difficult operational locations in the world, for our first pilot shipments to really prove the mettle of the system.</p>
  
 Aid Pioneers – an Ideal Pilot Partner 
<p>We have been working with our humanitarian partner <a href="https://aidpioneers.com/">Aid Pioneers</a> for many months to prepare for these shipments. <a href="https://aidpioneers.com/">Aid Pioneers</a> connects available resources from donors directly to recipient organizations. Through close collaboration with on the ground initiatives and the private sector, Aid Pioneers connects resources from donors directly with local organizations to foster sustainable, community-led change. They do this in places that need them most, making them a highly innovative humanitarian agency. They take an end-to-end approach to the supply chain, which we believe suits Track &amp; Trust perfectly. <a href="https://aidpioneers.com/">Aid Pioneers</a> needs to extend tracking of supplies beyond what typical supply chain tracking products can accomplish. We are helping them achieve this.</p>
  
 Supply Chain Tracking Challenges 
<p><a href="https://aidpioneers.com/">Aid Pioneers</a>‘ logistics environment provides a perfect showcase for what Track &amp; Trust can do. When Aid Pioneers ships a container full of medical supplies or solar power generation equipment to a Lebanese clinic or school, they hire a freight forwarder to pick up the goods. The freight forwarder then organizes the delivery to a local port via semi-truck. After that, a freight forwarder loads the container onto a ship. The ship travels to a port of entry in Lebanon, and we track its progress using a typical tracking link. However, once the container clears customs, we take over. We actively track it and pick up where traditional systems stop working.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At this point we encounter tricky conditions. Aid Pioneers local lebanese partner <a href="https://al-manhaj-lb.org/home/">Al-Manha</a>j breaks down containers into multiple pallets or depalletizes them. They do this before final delivery. After that they deliver goods to one location while others go to other locations at different times. To keep track of what was delivered when, we use <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking</a>. We also developed strategies to deal with power and connectivity outages.</p>
 Outwitting Outages 
<p>These outages always happen at the wrong time so it’s important that the system is able to handle them. We do this with built in backup batteries and a battery management system. On top of that, the communications landscape is very challenging.&nbsp; Sometimes there’s 4G connectivity and at other times there’s outages. Our mesh nodes can operate no matter, though, by caching incoming data locally. The nodes just wait until the data can be posted or handed off to other mesh nodes. This approach multiplies the effectiveness of our communications assets.&nbsp; On top of that, we positioned one of our satellite uplinks at a local school. As a result, every event is (at the minimum) recorded and transmitted asynchronously – even when conditions are at their worst.</p>
<p>These logistics challenges are not unique to Aid Pioneers’ operations. However, they are particularly pronounced in the places where they work. We believe that if our system works there and brings value to freight forwarders and humanitarian organizations, it will work anywhere. As a result of this testing we’re confident in the capabilities of Track &amp; Trust.</p>
<p>In our next post we’ll describe exactly how the our pilot operations went – and what the big value drivers are.</p>

<p>As you <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/dock-and-cheqd-form-alliance-to-accelerate-global-adoption-of-decentralized-id?ref=blog.dock.io">already know</a>, Dock and cheqd are merging their tokens and blockchains to form a powerful alliance in the decentralized identity space.</p><p>This partnership unites the blockchain capabilities of two industry leaders to accelerate the global adoption of decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, providing individuals and organizations worldwide with secure, trusted digital identities.</p><p>As part of this evolution, the Dock network will migrate its functionality and all tokens to the cheqd blockchain. This transition will enable Dock to leverage cheqd’s advanced infrastructure, delivering even greater value to both ecosystems.</p><p>During the migration, existing $DOCK tokens will be swapped for $CHEQ tokens at a conversion rate of 18.5178 $DOCK to 1 $CHEQ, ensuring a seamless and straightforward transition for all token holders.</p> How to migrate your DOCK tokens to CHEQ  Before you start   Ensure you have a compatible wallet for $CHEQ. If you don’t already have one, <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/network/wallets?ref=blog.dock.io">follow these instructions</a> to set one up. We recommend using the <a href="https://www.leapwallet.io/download?ref=blog.dock.io">Leap wallet</a>, which has a browser extension and a mobile wallet on both Android and iOS, and can be easily connected during the migration process. There is another alternative which is to use the <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/network/wallets/keplr-setup?ref=blog.dock.io">Keplr wallet</a>.  Update your wallet softwares to their latest versions. This ensures compatibility with the new system and reduces the likelihood of encountering bugs or issues during migration.  Note that the migration must be done through the <a href="https://fe.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io#/migration">Dock browser-based wallet</a>. If you use the Dock Wallet App or Nova Wallet, you can easily add your account to the Dock browser wallet by <a href="https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/dock-token-migration/adding-account-to-the-dock-browser-wallet?ref=blog.dock.io">following these steps</a>.  If your $DOCK tokens are currently on an exchange, you’ll need to withdraw them to a Dock wallet to complete the token migration, as it can only be done from an address you own. Follow our guide on <a href="https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/wallets-and-account-creation?ref=blog.dock.io#to-create-a-new-account">creating a Dock wallet account</a> to get started. We are actively working with exchanges to allow them to handle the migration on behalf of users, and we’ll publish a list of participating exchanges as soon as it’s available.  UPDATE 23/11/2024: KuCoin will support the migration of $DOCK tokens to $CHEQ. If you’re holding your $DOCK tokens on KuCoin, you don’t need to do a thing—KuCoin will handle the migration for you seamlessly. Read all the details <a href="https://www.kucoin.com/announcement/en-kucoin-will-support-the-token-merger-of-dock-and-cheqd-20241122?utm_source=TwitterContent">here</a>.    Read and understand the migration's terms and conditions. Make sure you are familiar with the terms before proceeding. You can review them <a href="https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/dock-token-migration/migration-terms-and-conditions?ref=blog.dock.io">here</a>.  The migration service will only be available until March 15th, 2025. After this date, the migration will no longer be supported. Please ensure you complete the process before the deadline.  <p></p> Migrating your DOCK tokens   Access the migration page<br>Click <a href="https://fe.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io#/migration">here</a> to visit the migration page and begin the process.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> The end of history? 
<p>In the early 1990s, as the Cold War receded into history, political theorists proclaimed the "end of history," suggesting a future dominated by liberal democratic values under a unipolar international system led by the United States. This period coincided with the rapid expansion of the Internet, which was envisioned as a tool to promote global connectivity.</p>
<p>However, the ensuing decades have seen a shift toward a multipolar world, with rising powers such as China and regional blocs asserting their influence. This shift has fragmented both cyberspace and the global economy, with nations prioritizing national security over global interests, resulting in a cyber landscape characterized by sovereignty and divergent norms.</p>
<p>Cyberspace, often perceived as an abstract concept, is actually grounded in a robust architecture that encompasses both physical and software infrastructure. This includes undersea cables, terrestrial networks, satellites, and data centers, alongside essential protocols like TCP/IP that facilitate data transfer.</p>
<p>This infrastructure is central to modern geopolitics, emphasizing that control over data and management of information flows are now as strategically important as territorial dominance was in previous centuries. Modern geopolitical strategies are increasingly focused on establishing, defending, and expanding digital domains as much as physical ones.</p>
 Two tigers cannot share the same mountain 
<p>This can be illustrated, for example, by contrasting international commitments such as the "<a href="https://www.state.gov/declaration-for-the-future-of-the-internet">Declaration for the Future of the Internet</a>," signed by over 60 governments, including the U.S. and EU, which promotes a vision of an open and secure Internet. In contrast, China's State Council's "<a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202211/07/WS63687246a3105ca1f2274748.html">Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace</a>" reflects an alternative vision emphasizing digital sovereignty and state control, indicating a global divide in cyberspace governance and Internet freedom.</p>
<p>The strategic competition between the U.S. and China also extends into the uncharted depths of the ocean, centering on the undersea fiber-optic cables that carry more than 95% of intercontinental Internet traffic. These cables are essential for everything from consumer transactions to government communications. Recently, both major American tech companies and Chinese state-owned enterprises have tightened their control over these assets.</p>
<p>The submarine cable industry is a niche but critical sector that relies on a limited global fleet capable of laying and maintaining these cables. However, this lack of expertise sometimes forces Western governments to rely on foreign powers such as China for essential repairs, creating potential <a href="https://jpia.princeton.edu/news/submarine-data-cables-latest-target-us-china-rivalry">security vulnerabilities</a>. Notably, China has strategically emphasized its role in the “maintenance” aspect, seeking to position itself as an indispensable player in the ongoing operation and upkeep of this vital infrastructure.</p>
<p>At the heart of this competition are semiconductor microchips, which are central to both civilian and military technologies. China's strategy to dominate this essential industry underlines its broader economic and political ambitions to supplant the U.S. as hegemon in the Asia-Pacific region and establish its own “sphere of influence”. This strategic competition is demonstrated by the tensions over Taiwan, a key center of semiconductor manufacturing, where Beijing and Washington's interests are sharply at odds.</p>
 Strategic Competition in the Digital Age 
<p>Global cyber conflicts and the economic impacts associated with them are reshaping international relations in profound ways. As nations vie for control over critical internet infrastructure and data flows, cyberspace has become a new domain of strategic competition, paralleling traditional conflicts over maritime and land resources. The stakes are high, as control over AI technologies and the cyber realm carries significant implications for national security, military advantage, and technological edge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a fragmented international system and divided cyberspace hinder the global cooperation needed to tackle pressing challenges such as climate change and the governance of AI. When the world's nations are divided, their collective power to address these universal issues is significantly weakened. As another Chinese proverb wisely states: "A single tree does not make a forest.”</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://datarella.com/datarella-takes-part-in-new-industry-4-0-research-project-cosmic-x/">Cosmic-X</a> project nearing its conclusion, it is finally time to lift the curtain on the blockchain solution that Datarella has built over the last two years to enable confidential computing and data sharing in Industry 4.0. In this first entry of a series of technical posts about designing, implementing, and integrating an edge-to-cloud blockchain solution, we discuss the evaluation process for selecting a suitable blockchain platform for Cosmic-X and how that platform operates on a protocol level to provide an open, transparent, and secure infrastructure for industrial use cases.</p>
<p></p>
 Evaluating Blockchain Platforms<br>
 
<p>Today, many different blockchain platforms exist, but their suitability for industrial use cases remains specific or, at times, limited. To achieve the best match between the requirements of Cosmic-X and the possibilities of blockchain technologies, the team conducted an extensive evaluation process. This evaluation compared both private and public blockchain platforms based on security, privacy, scalability, and interoperability.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.parcl.co/blog/the-4-types-of-blockchain-and-why-you-should-know-the-difference"></a></p>
<p>Current-generation blockchain platforms predominantly perform well in security and scalability, yet privacy and interoperability often fall short. To achieve privacy in industrial scenarios like Cosmic-X, organizations have almost exclusively used private or consortium blockchains such as Hyperledger Fabric in the past. However, these approaches inherently involve high infrastructure costs for the operating parties, as well as centralization and limited interoperability. In contrast, public blockchains offer resilience, cost efficiency, and a degree of interoperability. Though only recently have they started focusing on privacy and data protection. Blockchain protocols with confidential computing capabilities remain relatively new and untested. Nevertheless, when weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches, a privacy-focused public network emerges as the preferred solution in an industrial context.</p>
<p>For a public network to meet Cosmic-X’s privacy and data protection requirements, it must support the multi-tenancy paradigm. Multi-tenancy enables a single instance of a software application to serve multiple clients while ensuring logical isolation. Different clients share an underlying infrastructure, which optimizes resource use and reduces infrastructure costs. Further, it enhances efficiency in data access, management, and collaborative data sharing.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork"></a></p>
<p>Through this evaluation, the Cosmos-based <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> emerged as the blockchain platform best suited for Cosmic-X. The Secret Network functions as a public blockchain specifically developed for confidential computing. By combining established encryption techniques with trusted execution environments, it provides so-called Secret Contracts. This type of smart contract establishes consensus on computation without disclosing incoming or outgoing data. Integrated access control mechanisms enable third-party access and create an auditable processing chain. Thus, the Secret Network satisfies the need for multi-tenancy capability while retaining all the benefits of a public network.</p>
 How the Secret Network Works<br>
 
<p>The Secret Network leverages Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) to create Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) that enable Secret Contracts. These smart contracts, based on the <a href="https://cosmwasm.com/">CosmWasm</a> framework, allow for fully private computation of data. Outside a TEE, the transaction payloads and the network’s current state are encrypted at all times. Only the data owner and an authorized third party can decrypt and view data inputs and outputs. A combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes—ECDH (x25519), HKDF-SHA256, and AES-128-SIV—achieves this end-to-end encryption. Each validator in the network must run an Intel SGX-compatible CPU and instantiate a TEE that follows the network’s rules.</p>
<p>When an encrypted transaction arrives in the shared mempool of the network, a validator forwards it to their TEE, where a shared secret is derived and used to decrypt the transaction. The WASMI runtime then processes the plaintext input. Finally, the validator re-encrypts the updated contract state and broadcasts it to the network through a block proposal. If over two-thirds of the current network voting power agree on the result, the network appends the proposed block to the Secret Network blockchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/introduction/secret-network-techstack/consensus-for-secret-transactions"></a></p>
<p>For access control, the Secret Network offers Viewing Keys and Permits. A Viewing Key acts as an encrypted password that grants a third party permanent access to data related to a specific smart contract and private key. A Permit allows a more granular approach, restricting viewing access to specific parts of data for a set period. Consequently, despite its encrypted nature, the network remains fully auditable.</p>
<p>In the next post, we’ll explore how we leverage the Secret Network to secure machine data integrity directly from its point of origin to its consumption by a Machine Learning Model.</p>

 ERC-3643: The Motherboard for Composable Tokenized Assets 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in November 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>“What token standard does your platform support?” This is a question we hear often. As a regular reader of our newsletter, you might think, “Tokeny? They’re an ERC-3643 platform.” But that’s only part of the story.</p>
<p>Think of ERC-3643 as a Lego motherboard. It’s the fundamental base, the piece that holds everything else all together. The real magic happens when you start adding multiple smart contract blocks. What makes its composability powerful is the ability to reuse existing and proven smart contracts.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Here are a few of the most common “add-on blocks” our clients add to their tokenized assets:</p>
 
 Smart contracts ensure compliance: Compliance contracts make sure that only approved identities can hold tokens. They also set rules for when and how tokens can be transferred, blocking any unauthorized moves. 
 
 
 Smart contracts enrich asset onchain data: Asset identity contracts let you add data to assets, like ISIN, LEI, net asset value (NAV), and ESG ratings, making it easy for other platforms, such as distributors, to access this information quickly. 
 
 
 Smart contracts enable distribution: Distribution contracts control where the tokens can be distributed. In addition, Delivery vs. Delivery (DvD) contracts can automate buying and selling. If all requirements are met, DvD swaps will happen, without counterparty risks. 
 Smart contracts automate corporate actions: Corporate action contracts handle tasks like paying dividends or coupons, making middle and back office operations faster, smoother, and safer. 
 
<p>ERC-3643 isn’t here to compete with other token standards, it’s designed to work alongside them, offering composability and complementing their functionality. We act as a smart contract factory to ensure the smooth deployment and management of all smart contracts associated with tokens. The future of onchain finance is composable and interoperable, we are passionate about building products to achieve that vision.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions regarding this topic.</p>
<p>P.S. What is more exciting is that this week, ERC-3643 was recognized as the official standard in Project Guardian by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) for ensuring compliance in tokenized debt instruments and funds. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tokeny_erc3643-standardization-compliance-activity-7259857191317254144-Yem7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--I_xvb_kSCz56a1giGeTIDcg6nZpa8ABNVdYG3G3-hA63wJ2bzkMNzu9s9_j9g850HlDgh">Check out more details here</a>.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In our daily lives we are regularly asked to provide personal details, and in many instances, we cannot secure a service or product unless we do so. This may involve a simple request to provide proof of identity, or a much more detailed one, perhaps requiring verification. This can be time-consuming, and often a fraught process, and there is always concern for the security of that data. While online privacy concerns are at an all-time high, organizations increasingly store sensitive information digitally, in centralized databases.</p>



<p>‍</p>



<p>Global regulators continue to evolve laws and regulations accompanied by outsized penalties for companies that fail to comply with them. The annual cost of cybersecurity crime to Australia alone is estimated to be in the range of $29 billion to $30 billion. A 2023 KPMG report estimated the total cost at $29 billion per year, with direct costs to businesses accounting for a significant portion. The Australian Cyber Security Centre’s 2022-23 Cyber Threat Report highlighted a 14% increase in the average cost of cybercrime per report compared to the previous year.</p>



<p>‍</p>



<p>Increased regulation and penalties follow the foundation set by other international privacy legislation, such as Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The maximum penalties for non-compliance have been significantly increased. The penalty for a serious privacy breach up until late 2022 was just $2.22 million. Now, businesses can be charged with the greater of:&nbsp;</p>



 
 $50 million 



 three times the value of any benefit obtained through the misuse of information 



 30 percent of the company’s adjusted turnover in the relevant period 
 



<p>‍</p>



<p>These penalties are a compelling reason alone for businesses to improve the way they protect their client’s data. This is just the beginning — businesses need to understand their data obligations and where needed, implement new, compliant processes.</p>



<p>‍</p>



<p>Read on to explore why the combination of Google Cloud Platform, and ShareRing’s digital identity platform, are a revolutionary approach to personal privacy and business protection.</p>



 The data security arms race 



<p>More-and-more the transfer of our personal details is done digitally, and the risk of someone obtaining those personal details is growing exponentially. We are all aware of the growing risk of identity theft and other exploits that compromise our personal information. A centralized store of identity data is an irresistible high risk data source&nbsp; to cyber criminals and threat actors.</p>



 Digital Identity as a Service 



<p><a href="https://docs.sharetoken.io/digital-identity/sharering-link">ShareRing Link</a>, is a decentralized public infrastructure (DePIN) solution that leverages Google Cloud for its core infrastructure. ShareRing’s ecosystem is architected to ensure minimal personal data is shared, and importantly is not stored centrally. ShareRing Link is a business system that enables a user to share select personal information from an encrypted Vault to a businesses’ backend system, such as KYC information to a financial institution, or age verification to a licensed merchant, for alcohol sales, via a zero-knowledge proof function.</p>



<p>‍</p>



<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.sharering.me&amp;hl=en">ShareRing Me</a>, a digital identity app available on Android, uses Blockchain technology to collect and store verified identity data in an immutable, reusable, self sovereign Vault, a “Digital Me”, on the user’s personal smart device. At all times the User controls who they choose to share their data with from their advice. ShareRing Me also gives the user the ability to backup the heavily encrypted Vault file onto their personal Google Cloud, to ensure no data is lost.</p>



 Privacy and Data Segregation with Google Cloud 



<p>Google Cloud Platform is quickly becoming a leader in business and enterprise cloud computing worldwide. This is, in large part, due to their&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/trust-center/security">“security by design, security by default”</a>&nbsp;stance, underpinning a comprehensive and industry-leading approach to data protection.</p>



 Data Segregation: 



<p>Google Cloud customer data is siloed, which reduces the attack vectors. This is driven by their self imposed objectives to protect customer data and security, as well as the need to adhere to increased regulatory compliance requirements globally.</p>



<p>‍</p>



 
 Google Cloud uses Logical Isolation mechanisms inherent to virtualization technology to create isolated virtual environments for each customer, ensuring that their data and applications are not directly accessible to others.&nbsp; 



 ShareRing Self-Sovereignty: ShareRing Me uses a decentralized storage model to keep verified and encrypted personal data on the User’s personal smart device. 
 



 Data Encryption and Access Controls: 



 
 Encryption: Google Cloud has built-in encryption capabilities, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-key-management?hl=en">Cloud KMS</a>&nbsp;(Key Management Service) to encrypt data at rest and in transit. 



 ShareRing Smart Contracts: ShareRing uses smart contracts to automate and enforce access rules based on predefined conditions, ensuring that only authorized parties can access. Data is secured across multiple nodes in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.shareri.ng/shareledger/why-shareledgeredger/why-shareledger">ShareRing blockchain</a>, making it immutable to breach or tampering. 



 IAM and RBAC:&nbsp; Google Cloud&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/products/iam">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a>&nbsp;is used to implement granular access controls and permissions for different users and roles. In addition, Google Cloud&nbsp; also uses&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion/docs/concepts/rbac">role-based access control (RBAC)</a>&nbsp;and network segmentation to restrict access to customer data based on user permissions and network boundaries. 



 Storage: While Google Cloud&nbsp; can provide additional storage capacity, it could be used in conjunction with ShareRing to offer redundancy and disaster recovery of the encrypted Vault. 
 



 Strong technology intersect 



<p>ShareRing Founder, Tim Bos, stated – “Google Cloud’s commitment to customer data protection is a significant factor in why we chose to partner with them. Our technologies and philosophies intersect seamlessly. The extensive and industry-leading security controls Google Cloud&nbsp; provides, and ShareRing’s self sovereign identity solution, together are a much needed evolution in privacy, in a world where personal information is as precious, or moreso, as your other assets”.</p>



 Assurance of best practices in a combined identity solution 



<p>Both ShareRing and Google Cloud&nbsp; undergo regular audits and certifications to ensure compliance with various security standards, such as ISO 27001. Digital Identities are also becoming increasingly regulated. ShareRing is certified against the UK’s Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework&nbsp; (DIATF) and is seeking accreditation against similar frameworks in the EU (eIDAS 2)&nbsp; and Australia Digital ID framework as they come into play.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>In today’s hybrid and complex IT environments, machine identities are multiplying at an astonishing rate. If managing human identities was once the main concern, that focus has shifted drastically. Today (depending on who you ask, vendors, tech experts, analysts..., the figures might vary), there are approximately 45 to even 100 times more machine identities than human ones, and each one of these machine identities poses a potential security risk if not properly managed. The rapid growth of cloud, DevOps, and automation has spurred this explosion in machine identities, creating a critical need for robust management strategies to ensure secure authentication, controlled access, and safe interaction across digital environments.</p>
<p></p>
 Machines Need Identities Too – But Not Just "Machines" 
<p>While we often talk about "machines", this term actually covers a wide range of digital entities. Beyond physical machines, today’s IT landscapes include IoT devices, OT systems, bots, applications, technical accounts, containerized services, and even cloud workloads, each of which demands a unique, securely managed identity. Machine identities enable non-human entities to authenticate, communicate, and interact autonomously, safeguarding sensitive data and critical system resources.</p>
<p>This landscape of digital identities is diverse, each with distinct lifecycles, requirements for secure communication, and authentication needs. For instance, IoT devices like connected cars or smart-home systems need robust authentication mechanisms to communicate safely. Industrial OT devices like SCADA sensors need secure identities for data exchange, while Kubernetes clusters and cloud instances require identities to manage interactions within dynamic, cloud-native environments. The complexity and scope of these digital interactions mean that every identity, no matter how short-lived, needs to be handled with precision and care.</p>
 Visibility, Control, and Lifecycle Management – Core Challenges 
<p>With such a wide array of machine identities, maintaining visibility and control is paramount. However, many organizations struggle to track and manage these identities effectively. As new short-lived identities proliferate in dynamic environments, they often escape detection, leading to potential vulnerabilities. When these identities are inadequately managed, they can become weak points in security, offering potential access points for cyber threats.</p>
<p>Another challenge is lifecycle management. Machine identities, unlike human ones, often have short lifespans and require frequent updates, renewals, or deactivations. If these lifecycles aren’t managed meticulously, organizations risk having outdated, insecure identities lingering in their systems. This unmanaged sprawl of identities can compromise not only security but also compliance with standards such as GDPR or HIPAA. The implications are clear: lifecycle management must be systematic, automated, and responsive to the high turnover typical of machine identities.</p>
 The Risks of Poorly Managed Machine Identities 
<p>When machine identities go unmanaged, the repercussions can be severe. Unauthorized access to sensitive systems, privilege escalation through compromised identities, and exposed secrets are just a few of the risks. In the absence of effective monitoring, organizations miss out on the timely detection of security threats, allowing vulnerabilities to go unnoticed. Moreover, hard-coded secrets, if left unprotected, become easy targets for exploitation, leading to potential security breaches.</p>
<p>As machine identities proliferate, so too does the attack surface, leaving organizations more vulnerable to unauthorized access and data leaks. This is particularly problematic in industries where compliance and security are paramount, as mismanaged identities can lead directly to regulatory violations.</p>
 Machine Identities in a Zero Trust Framework 
<p>With Zero Trust increasingly central to security strategies, machine identities play a critical role. In a Zero Trust model, no machine is assumed to be inherently trustworthy; every interaction requires authentication and verification. This approach is essential in today’s multi-cloud and hybrid IT landscapes, where machines frequently interact across potentially insecure networks. With technologies like mutual TLS (mTLS), machine identities enable secure communication between devices, ensuring that only authenticated entities can access critical resources.</p>
<p>In a Zero Trust framework, machine identities not only secure communication but also enable ongoing verification of interactions. This principle is foundational to establishing and maintaining trust, both for human and machine identities, within an organization’s digital ecosystem.</p>
 Secure Secrets Management – An Essential Pillar 
<p>Effective management of machine identities demands secure handling of “secrets” - API keys, SSH keys, certificates, and other credentials essential for authenticating machine communication. These secrets need to be stored securely, rotated regularly, and managed centrally to reduce human error and prevent misuse. Automated secrets management allows organizations to scale this process to handle the vast numbers of identities typical in a modern IT environment, ensuring that each identity’s lifecycle is managed securely from creation to deactivation.</p>
<p>Integrating secrets management into a comprehensive identity governance framework provides additional layers of security. This approach not only minimizes security gaps but also enforces consistent security practices across both human and machine identities.</p>
 Key Takeaways: The Essentials of Machine Identity Management 
 
 Machine Identities as a Foundation for IT Security<br>Machine identities are indispensable for secure interactions and communications in modern IT environments. 
 Scaling with Growth&nbsp;<br>The exponential increase in machine identities demands robust, automated management to keep pace with this growth. 
 Lifecycle Management for Security <br>Systematic management of identity lifecycles mitigates the risks posed by outdated or uncontrolled identities. 
 Secrets Management to Close Security Gaps<br> Proper secrets management is vital for protecting machine identities and preventing security breaches. 
 Integration with Identity Governance<br> Machine identities should be part of a unified identity governance framework to ensure consistent security policies. 
 Accountability Through Ownership<br> Clear assignment of responsibilities is crucial for maintaining the security and traceability of machine identities. 
 A More Precise Term for Identity Diversity<br> The term "machine identities" may need refinement to better capture the diverse range of non-human identities in today’s digital environments. 
 
<p>In short, machine identity management is not only critical but complex, requiring organizations to adopt structured, automated, and comprehensive approaches. In a world where machine interactions outnumber human ones, secure identity management is not optional - it’s essential.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Introduction 
<p>Below are my personal highlights from the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> #39, held from October 29–31, 2024, at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. The Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) is a one-of-a-kind, unconference-style event that gathers professionals across the digital identity space to openly discuss, debate, and innovate. IIW39 set a record for attendance, with 178 sessions, giving us the opportunity not only to stay up-to-date but also to contribute through sponsorship and active participation, reinforcing our commitment to this evolving field.</p>
 <p>Images courtesy of Internet ID Workshop (<a href="https://x.com/idworkshop">@idworkshop</a>)</p> 
<p>Our team left inspired by the range of perspectives and in-depth conversations and are excited to share some of the key takeaways relevant to digital credential ecosystems. To organize the insights, I’ve grouped the most impactful sessions into three themes: trust establishment, adoption, and tech stack updates. These themes helped me categorize sessions that stood out and offered valuable perspectives for our work in digital credentials, wallets, and trust establishment infrastructure.</p>
 <br>
#1 – Trust Establishment 
<p>This IIW featured many discussions around governance, trust registries and trust establishment.</p>
 Progressive Trust in Issuer Registries with LinkedClaims 
<p>This session explored the concept of “progressive trust” in issuer registries, where entities can initially join a trust registry with minimal requirements and gradually build their credibility over time by adding claims. LinkedClaims was proposed as a potential solution to enable this approach, allowing ecosystem participants to add claims to a trust registry incrementally, thereby increasing their level of assurance as they demonstrate further compliance or meet additional standards. By setting low initial barriers for inclusion, this model supports a more accessible and open ecosystem, where entities can start with a basic level of trust and enhance it progressively. This approach provides an inclusive framework for building transparency and encouraging a steady flow of verifiable claims, enabling credentials to gain broader acceptance across different ecosystems as entities solidify their trustworthiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Well-Attended Discussion on Bridging Trust: DIDs, DNS, and X.509 
<p>Another session that ultimately brings trust establishment into the discussion was focused on creating layered assurance by bridging decentralized identifiers (DIDs) with established infrastructures like DNS and X.509. This hybrid approach allows any entity—not just credential issuers—to build more assurance by combining DIDs with established, trusted systems. This setup is particularly valuable for organizations with a strong digital presence, as it lets them leverage existing DNS or certificate frameworks to increase the assurance of their identity or credentials. We’ve already implemented this concept with DNS bridging in our<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-carter-high-assurance-dids-with-dns-06.html"> IETF draft on High Assurance DIDs with DNS</a>, demonstrating how entities can use this approach to create dependable, transparent interactions. As one of the co-chairs of the<a href="https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/32473104/High+Assurance+VID+Task+Force+HAVID"> High Assurance VID Task Force (HAVID)</a>, I’m actively engaged in advancing this approach, proving that layered trust realms can support higher assurance in decentralized ecosystems.</p>
 <p>A diagram provide by Dr. André Kudra which was showed in the IIW session</p> 
<p>European Union Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet) Relying Party Authentication</p>
<p>The topic of relying party authentication for the EUDI Wallet sparked enough discussion to span two sessions. The first session on day 2 raised several open questions around the best approach for authenticating relying parties, leading to a follow-up session on day 3 to further unpack the issues.</p>
<p>One of the key points in discussing EUDI Wallet’s architecture was the requirement for relying parties to provide certain data about themselves to the wallet and, by extension, to the holder. This requirement, stemming from the EU’s eIDAS regulation, allows the holder to have insight into what data a relying party wishes to access and how they intend to use specific credentials. This transparency is essential for enabling informed decisions by the holder and safeguarding data privacy.</p>
<p>Various technical options were explored for implementing this authentication, including traditional X.509 solutions, <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Federation</a>, and SD-JWTs (selective disclosure JSON Web Tokens). Each approach has unique strengths and challenges, with OpenID Federation emerging as a flexible option for interoperability. However, concerns around the complexity of the OpenID Federation specification led to discussions on simplifying or segmenting it to make it more accessible, particularly for the EUDI Wallet context.</p>
<p>Northern Block has been actively investing in implementing OpenID Federation across our solutions, aligning with the standard’s potential for fostering trust and interoperability in digital credentialing. Yesterday, on November 6, 2024, we presented an update at a Findynet-hosted event, sharing insights on our progress. A recording of the session is available on the<a href="https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/b0dec015-c524-4e83-b262-ad63eace5bfb@39662e39-3e1d-455b-9013-c493ab830fd3"> event meeting page</a> for those interested in learning more.</p>
<p>Additionally, the sessions considered how OpenID Federation might integrate with the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) and other European trust establishment technologies, potentially serving as an abstraction layer to connect multiple verification methods. While OpenID Federation shows promise for trust establishment in the European context, the sessions underscored that simplifying the spec could be key to overcoming current barriers. There’s clear interest in OpenID Federation’s role in the European market, and as this work evolves, it could provide a streamlined path for cross-border compatibility and trust in digital credentials.</p>
 <br>
#2 – Adoption 
<p>IIW39 offered a strong forum to gauge the state of adoption in digital credentialing and examine what’s required to drive it forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 “Has Our SSI Ecosystem Become Morally Bankrupt?” 
<p>In one of the very many thoughtful sessions at IIW39, Christopher Allen raised a challenging question: has the self-sovereign identity (SSI) ecosystem strayed from its founding principles? His <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/ssi-bankruptcy/">blog</a> on the topic served as inspiration for the session. Allen questioned whether current implementations are compromising core SSI values—such as<a href="https://www.selfsovereignidentity.it/the-10-principles-of-self-sovereign-identity-ssi/"> existence, control, access, transparency, and protection</a>—that were foundational to the concept of self-sovereign identity. Increasingly, we’re seeing the industry willingly delegate key functions to platform providers, often replicating centralized or federated models that limit user control and freedom.</p>
<p>As examples, Allen pointed to the rise of mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) and DID implementations such as did:web. These approaches may gain traction through their ease of adoption and existing infrastructure but risk overlooking some key principles as mentioned above. This trend raises concerns about whether these solutions are being designed in a way that prioritizes control for platform providers rather than the individuals using them. Allen’s critique highlights how some modern implementations of SSI risk sacrificing these core principles for the sake of convenience or widespread adoption.</p>
<p>From my perspective, these principles remain the goal for myself, our company, and many collaborators in the industry. However, achieving true self-sovereignty in a scalable way involves navigating significant structural and funding challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much like the internet was seeded by the U.S. government through projects like ARPANET, where initial government funding was critical to establishing its foundations, digital trust infrastructure requires substantial investment to reach critical mass. This foundational funding enabled others to build value on the internet through commercially driven models that continue to reshape society as a whole. Today, governments and large organizations—particularly those with a public benefit as their core mission—are often the only entities capable of making this level of investment, viewing digital trust infrastructure as a form of public infrastructure that justifies their funding.</p>
<p>But with funding comes influence. Governments and large entities exercise control over their constituents through controls (e.g., rules, laws, and regulations)—frameworks that don’t always align seamlessly with the digital world’s principles of openness and user autonomy. This creates a tension between the need for investment to build digital public infrastructure and the inherent incentive models these large entities operate under, where control and oversight are often prioritized. This represents a larger struggle in balancing innovation with institutional authority, especially as digital identity and trust infrastructure continue to develop.</p>
<p>In my view, balancing SSI’s principles with these real-world constraints isn’t an all-or-nothing endeavor. Each implementation should strive to maximize user control, privacy, and transparency, even if some trade-offs are necessary. The investments we’re seeing are undeniably driving amazing advancements, and it’s a matter of taking the best parts and continuously improving upon them. This isn’t a zero-to-one leap but rather a journey of chipping away at constraints, making incremental progress toward a digital world that aligns more closely with self-sovereign ideals.</p>
<p>This session was an important reminder for me—and for all of us in this space—not to lose sight of the vision and principles that brought us here. Even as we navigate complex environments, we must stay grounded in the values that underpin SSI, ensuring they remain central as we move forward, one step at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Public Sector Momentum and Cross-Ecosystem Acceptance 
<p>There continues to be significant momentum in the public sector around digital credentialing, with the U.S., Canada, Europe, and other regions like Bhutan each advancing in their own unique ways. In the U.S., states are increasingly adopting mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs), with many offering digital driver’s licenses through platforms like Apple and Google Wallets, while others provide their own state-specific wallets. Similarly, Canadian provinces are moving forward with their own digital wallets, and the European Union is working toward nation-state-approved wallets as part of a cohesive digital identity strategy. Each region’s approach reflects key differences and nuances in the technical stacks and governance models across these public sector ecosystems. Bhutan’s launch of its National Digital Identity (NDI) project exemplifies how even smaller nations are adopting digital credentials, contributing to a global trend in verifiable credentials across public sector initiatives.</p>
<p>While the public sector is a key driver, there are notable differences in approaches across these regions. Organizations like the Global Acceptance Network (GAN) are essential in bridging these varied approaches, fostering cross-ecosystem compatibility through multiple sessions and discussions around trust establishment at IIW39. For readers interested in how GAN supports the adoption of verifiable credentials across sectors and regions, we recommend our recent <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/the-global-acceptance-network-gan-with-darrell-odonnell">podcast episode on GAN’s ecosystem</a>, which delves into its development and vision.</p>
<p>For anyone seeking a lay of the land in public sector credentialing, Northern Block has a strong perspective from our work in both North America and Europe. Feel free to reach out to us for further insights into how digital credentialing is evolving in the public sector across these regions.</p>
 <br>
#3 – Technical Updates 
<p>With the rapid evolution of standards and interoperability frameworks, IIW39 highlighted some of the latest tech stack advancements that are shaping digital credential ecosystems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Credential Query Language (DCQL) 
<p>The Digital Credential Query Language (DCQL) proposes to offer a streamlined solution to the complexity of existing credential presentation models, presenting a simplified, structured approach to querying credentials. Developed as part of the upcoming Implementer’s Draft for OpenID4VP, DCQL is designed as an alternative to Presentation Exchange (PE), which, though flexible, has become complex and challenging to implement. With dependencies like JSONPath, regular expressions, and extensive schema filters, PE can be cumbersome and potentially insecure, especially in browser-based environments.</p>
<p>DCQL aims to address these issues by introducing a more straightforward, JSON-based syntax that is largely credential format-agnostic, allowing for simpler and faster implementation. By reducing optional elements and removing complex dependencies, DCQL lowers the technical barriers for organizations adopting digital credentials, making credentialing solutions easier to implement and scale. However, as the adoption of DCQL grows, it is expected to coexist with PE, creating a phase where both standards are in use. This dual adoption could lead to interoperability challenges, as some organizations might choose to implement only one standard. DCQL’s simplified approach thus highlights the need for careful handling of interoperability across digital identity ecosystems, especially where both PE and DCQL are expected to operate.</p>
<p>Although initially specific to OpenID4VP, DCQL’s adaptability has the potential for broader use, supporting a more consistent and accessible querying standard as digital identity implementations grow across ecosystems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Google’s Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for Mobile Credentials 
<p>Google introduced an advanced, high-performance ZKP for mobile environments, which represents a significant breakthrough in privacy-preserving credentials. With this implementation, users can present specific claims without revealing additional data, aligning with SSI principles. The optimization of ZKPs for sub-second performance opens new doors for real-world use cases in identity verification. As this technology becomes more accessible, it could drive widespread adoption across industries that require privacy-centric solutions for sensitive interactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Revocation and Status Mechanisms Comparison 
<p>Managing credential status and revocation is essential, particularly for high-volume and regulatory-sensitive use cases. The session on revocation mechanisms provided a detailed comparative analysis of various approaches, evaluating them on key criteria such as scalability, privacy, security, and deployment readiness. These comparisons offer digital identity architects a clearer framework for selecting revocation methods that best align with their operational needs and compliance requirements. As digital credential ecosystems grow, a flexible approach to revocation—one that adapts to different regulatory environments and use cases—will be increasingly critical. For more details, you can view the<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1plZCRbVaODI5KaBt0kh8l9k9vvlZkt_QkX--szY3QkQ/edit#slide=id.p"> session slides here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>IIW39 consistently provides a lens into the current adoption cycle and maturity of digital credential and wallet ecosystems. As digital identity continues to grow, events like IIW serve as critical forums to assess the evolving landscape of digital credentials, standards, and wallet functionalities. For organizations navigating this space, these insights highlight the importance of transparent governance backing credentials and ecosystems, practical adoption strategies, and streamlined technical solutions that simplify yet secure digital interactions.</p>

<p>In today’s digital landscape, offering only one sign-in method, such as a username and password, is no longer sufficient to meet the diverse needs and expectations of users. As technology evolves and global markets expand, it’s imperative for websites and apps to provide multiple, secure, and convenient login options. By doing so, businesses can enhance user experience, improve accessibility, and strengthen their competitive position. In this blog post, we’ll explore the numerous benefits of offering alternative login methods, from wider device support and increased security to enhanced user satisfaction and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>Providing alternative login methods has many benefits for users and online service providers:</p>
 
 Wider user reach<br>
Different regions, countries and user groups all have their most preferred way to login to consumer or business services. For example, BankID in Scandinavia, Finnish Trust Network in Finland, LINE in Japan, WeChat in China etc. Not offering the common services for the region where you users are coming from can limit service adoption and sales. Access to download various smartphone authenticator applications may also be limited to certain app store regions. 
 Protection from lost sales and lost business<br>
The inability to log in, for whatever reason – technical or non-technical, creates user frustration, delays and often times lost business. For an end-user, it can be easier to log in to a competitor’s service than to work out why login to your service is failing. When passwords are forgotten or text messages never arrive, having alternative options on offer increases the chance of the user signing in without any further assistance required. In the same way online shopping carts are abandoned when payment services are too difficult to use, users who can’t log in never even get a shopping cart in the first place. 
 Operating cost management<br>
Some third-party authentication services can add significant operating costs as the number of login events increases. Costs associated with an identity provider service may be easier to negotiate if the there are alternatives already available to use. Where there are multiple authentication options, these can be presented in an order that encourages the selection of the most cost-effective option. 
 Technical redundancy<br>
Imagine that the authenticator app or email client that you use continually crashes for some reason due to an unexpected mobile operating system update. Unable to click on a notification or get a generated one-time password, you are locked out of your account. Sometimes login systems are down for maintenance, upgrades, network issues or because of unforeseen difficulties. In these cases, instead of contacting support, choosing the button to sign in using an alternative provider is faster and easier. This lets the user solve their own login problems without any support burden and related costs. 
 Wider end-user device support<br>
Providing only “Sign in with Apple” or “Sign in with Google” makes things difficult if the user ever leaves the respective Apple or Google ecosystem, even if your app or service is targeted certain platform users only. Some organizations even have policies that forbid their employees from using non-corporate login systems for business use. Users could be shut out from accessing their personal information or historical records. Supporting multiple sign in methods enables users to securely access their data if they change devices or operating systems. 
 Dealing with life’s little surprises<br>
Consider the situation where SMS one-time password is the only MFA option, but the SMS never arrives, due to network failure, being out of network range, having a flat battery, a broken screen, lost or misplaced phone or service subscription halted due to an unpaid phone bill. It’s nice to have another way to sign in in these cases. 
 Improved accessibility<br>
For users with disabilities, the ability to use the authenticator or identity provider of their own choice can allow them to access online services without assistance. Different authenticators suit different users, some don’t work at all for parts of the user community. 
 End-user device compatibility<br>
Access to download various smartphone authenticator applications may also be limited to certain app stores, be region locked or be incompatible with user devices in the field running older operating systems. 
 Helping to avoid unwanted surveillance <br>
Repeatedly logging in via the same identity provider has the potential to inadvertently allow tracking your behaviour closely. By using different providers, or choosing authentication methods that are not inherently traceable by third-parties, users are empowered to choose freely in order to protect their own privacy. 
 Avoiding identity provider lock-in<br>
If there is a data breach or other security event at an upstream identity provider, immediately disabling it is the fastest approach to avoid collateral attacks. Disabling a provider is easy when there are many other alternatives still available to use. Service continuity readiness requires planned, ready-to-go contingencies. Identity providers can also cease operating at short notice for other commercial or legal reasons. Do not keep your eggs in one basket. Diversifying the range of sign in options mitigates the risks of individual solutions. 
 Meeting compliance requirements<br>
Depending on the nature and jurisdiction of the application, where sensitive, private and/or personal information is processed, compliance with relevant security, privacy and usability legislation is mandatory. Different types of transactions may require different authentication techniques mandated in legislation. This legislation can change over time. Being able to add and change authentication methods easily makes staying compliant easier. A good example is the European Digital Identity Framework, which will see the roll out of digital identity wallets for European citizens in the coming years. Public sector services and certain industries will be forced to allow sign in using these new wallets. 
 Ready for the future<br>
Technology and legislation is changing at a rapid pace. Authentication protocols, products and techniques adapt to these changes. Being ready for new trends and changes in user expectations with regard to sign-in techniques requires that applications can easily add, remove or change the sign in methods offered. Adding newly emerging biometric authentication, authentication methods based on quantum-resistant cryptography solutions or emerging AI-supported authentication tools should be a matter of reconfiguration rather than application redesign. 
 
 Designing and planning for multiple sign-in methods with best practices 
<p>Fortunately, many commercial software applications today are designed to support externalised user authentication and authorization. These applications can be configured to be connected to a Identity Provider Broker, either hosted in the cloud, or run locally on-premise. This Identity Provider Broker, or IdP Broker for short, is responsible for the secure communication with various identity services and authentication methods. It is responsible to present a list of the various different login options and all of the complex logic to integrate with these methods and services.</p>
<p>When planning the design of a new online service, the product manager, architect or product owner should insist that user authentication is performed outside of the application itself. This is sometimes called single sign-on (SSO) support, federated identity support, externalised identity or referenced using the terms of related protocols, like OAuth, OAuth2, OpenID Connect or SAML. It accelerates product development and simplifies the logic of the online service.</p>
<p>Even older, legacy applications and services can be modified to replace built-in authentication options with externalised authentication with minor application changes.</p>
 Supporting multiple sign in methods is a first step 
<p>Once authentication has been externalised and multiple sign in methods are supported, this opens the doors to other powerful functions that can enhance user experiences:</p>
 
 Support for teams and groups<br>
An external identity provider can also provide information to an application about an individual’s membership to an organisation, be it a company, team, club or family. This enables convenient sharing of information and responsibilities within an online service. 
 Cross-organisation collaboration and information sharing<br>
Sharing is not limited to your own organisation – information can be gathered from or distributed to users at other organizations – such as partners, suppliers, customers and sub-contractors. An application that is integrated with an externalised identity management system can get and access to these rich connections and permissions without building it all into their own service. 
 Performing tasks on behalf of someone else<br>
Often times, the person using an online service is doing something on another person’s behalf. It may be a consultant helping a client to get things done or an adult doing something for their elderly parents, or a care-giver assisting a person in need. This should not be done by sharing sign in credentials, rather by authorising the other party to do these tasks. 
 Performing tasks on behalf of another organisation<br>
In business, outsourcing of certain functions to another organisation is commonplace. These partners need access to the client firm information and tools provided by online services. This can be achieved through externalised authorization. 
 
 Do you need help adding more authentication and authorisation options to your online service? 
<p>Ubisecure offer software and services to allow your customers to sign in using the authentication method that they choose, from a range of options that match your security choices. Different ways to sign in can be added or removed as requirements and markets change. Support for teams, groups and on behalf of use cases can be added to new and existing services. Contact Ubisecure today for more information and a no-obligation demonstration.</p>

  Name: Dani Johnson<br>Team: Operations<br>Based in:&nbsp;Seattle, Washington   About Dani <p>I’ve worked in business operations throughout my career, and SpruceID is my second software startup. I wanted to work on the most challenging and innovative technology I could find. When I found SpruceID it felt like a perfect fit: a great home for my existing skills where I could have a broad portfolio of responsibilities, as well as an exciting set of fresh challenges.</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>As the Head of Operations, I manage accounting and finance, people operations, compliance, and the rhythm of business. I work with our outstanding legal and accounting teams and oversee financial audits and SOC 2 audits. I also work closely with our CEO and lead special projects of all shapes and sizes.</p> What do you find most rewarding about your role? <p>My role is always evolving to cover new ground, so I always have something new to learn. At SpruceID I have access to so many expert minds, and it is incredibly rewarding to be able to soak up new subject matter expertise on a regular basis.</p> What are some of the most important qualities for someone in your role to have, in your opinion? <p>Integrity, drive, and an intensely meticulous and organized nature. I was one of those little kids that always colored inside the lines. My plastic dinosaurs were in order on the shelf. </p> What are you currently learning, or what do you hope to learn? <p>I am currently working a lot on international initiatives, so I am learning about corporate establishment, banking, contracting, and employment in some jurisdictions outside the US. Fascinating and sprawling. </p> What has been the most memorable moment for you at SpruceID so far? <p>Some of my most treasured SpruceID memories are of experiences we’ve had as a team at our team gatherings. Scrambling to get the wifi working in our ad hoc offices in Kyoto, eating together in one of the shacks on Copacabana Beach, singing along to Irish traditional folk music in Dublin.</p> What is some advice that you’d give to someone in your role who is early in their career? <p>Be worthy of the trust your organization has in you.</p> How do you define success in your role, and how do you measure it? <p>When the organizational operations are running smoothly it frees up the rest of the team to innovate and explore, so in some ways I measure success in my role by how little everyone else needs to think about it. Like great service at a restaurant, you don’t really notice it, you just notice that you have what you need. That is my goal.</p> Fun Facts <p><br>What do you enjoy doing in your free time?:&nbsp;Traveling near and far, cooking, eating, and taking long audiobook walks. </p><p>What is your favorite coding language (and why?):&nbsp;Rust, of course! </p><p>If you could be any tree, what tree would you be and why?: Any kind that involves animal visitors. Pinyon pine for bear visitors, or one of those argan trees the goats climb. A big fir tree for owl and squirrel friends would be fine. </p><p>Interested in joining our team? Check out our open roles and apply online!</p> <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/sprucesystems?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Apply to Join Us</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Are you ready to play? We explain why gambling operators should always do more than the bare minimum&nbsp;when onboarding players. 



 



<p>The gambling industry has never been more lucrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bolstered in large part by the proliferation of easily accessible online gambling platforms, the industry was worth over <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/online-gambling/worldwide#analyst-opinion">$85 billion dollars last year</a>. By 2029, that figure is expected to leap to $133 billion. There are multiple reasons for the industry’s projected rapid growth, including improved access to high-speed internet and reliable payment systems. Another is the opening of numerous currently unregulated markets around the world, especially in Latin America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While for the consumer, playing online casinos, online lotteries or online sports betting may be a similar experience across countries, there are certain differences in onboarding dictated by specific regional regulatory environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, for the customer, this all happens in the background so is rarely a consideration. Gambling operators, however, especially those that are keen to expand into new territories should be aware of every nuance of the customer onboarding process, every regulatory environment, every document or data point required to be compliant and every product functionality that could make the customer experience more inclusive, intuitive and secure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the ‘Worth the risk: Why gambling operators should always do more than the bare minimum when onboarding players’ ebook available below, we explore the different customer onboarding journeys from some of the world’s most popular gambling markets, including the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-get-uk-gambling-licence/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/warning-all-unlicensed-brazil-gambling-operators/">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">Ontario</a> and many more.</p>

<blockquote><p>While onboarding requirements differ across regions, at IDnow, we believe it is crucial to protect vulnerable individuals and verify that customers are who they claim to be, regardless of the market.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, VP of Global Gaming.</blockquote>



 Know Your Player? 



<p>Although the gambling industry has never offered more opportunity, it has also never been under greater regulatory scrutiny, or at greater risk of fraud attacks or bonus abuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other challenges facing operators include the ever-increasing cost of player acquisition, and the need to comply with AML, data privacy and responsible gambling requirements. Not to mention that, like most industries nowadays, there is a user expectation for seamless, secure and frictionless 24/7 online experiences. The optimal time to address these challenges is at the beginning, during the identity verification and customer onboarding process.</p>



 The role of the gambling regulator. 



<p>The regulator’s role is to protect players. They do this by devising and regularly revising regulations and issuing fines for operators that do not comply.</p>



<p>As new jurisdictions open and regulators implement tighter control mechanisms, the number of gambling fines are only set to increase. In fact, in 2023, the <a href="https://www.gamblingzone.com/uk/the-zone/news/record-fines-for-the-gambling-industry-in-2023/">global industry saw a record number of fines ($402 million)</a>, with UK operators subjected to the most fines, followed by Australia, Ontario, the Netherlands and the US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creating regulations that work for the player, the opertaor and the national. market is no easy feat. For example, if taxes are too high or player limitations too strict, then this could push players to the black market. When this happens, governments do not benefit from additional tax and players are not protected. Striking a balance is essential.</p>



 Do more than the bare minimum when onboarding players. 



<p>At IDnow, we value our trusted relationships with regulatory bodies from around the world. It is these connections and this multi-jurisdictional expertise that allow us to empower operators to confidently navigate onboarding challenges, wherever they are based.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To enhance security and minimize risk, we recommend going beyond the basic identity checks by integrating additional screening measures early in the customer journey. Implementing these checks early, ideally before withdrawal, provides better protection and reduces the risk of fraud, safeguarding both customers and businesses from unnecessary exposure to financial harm,” added Roger.</p>



<p>Our layered, holistic approach to identity verification enables operators to add additional layers of assurance by offering a flexible solution tailored to risk appetite and regulatory needs. These layers include a range of verification checks, from data checks and financial risk assessments to biometric and video verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the ability to scale up or down in line with a country’s specific regulatory needs, IDnow ensures operators maintain robust protection against fraud and other risks, while delivering a seamless and compliant customer journey.</p>

 Meeting the target and missing the point: Putting society at the center of digital public infrastructure <p>Written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessosborn/">Jessica Osborn</a> — CEO,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emrysschoemaker/"> Emrys Schoemaker</a> —Senior Director of Advisory &amp; Policy, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/niamh-barry-mel/">Niamh Barry</a> — Senior Director of Measurement &amp; Impact, all at Caribou&nbsp;Digital.</p><p>Alongside this year’s World Bank and IMF Annual Meetings, and following the insightful <a href="https://www.codevelop.fund/global-dpi-summit">Co-Develop DPI Summit in Cairo</a> earlier in the month, Caribou Digital participated in several conversations on the social and economic impact of digital public infrastructure (DPI).</p><p>Together, these events demonstrated a welcome shift in the conversation toward the importance of putting people at the center of DPI’s design and implementation in order to increase adoption and use. Yet, this people-centric approach seems more nascent in discussions of DPI’s measurement and impact, which still often centers on institutional efficiency and access. While these are important goals (and often the initial impetus for DPI implementation), by omitting nuanced consideration of people-level impact we risk — at best — missing an opportunity for DPI to drive more meaningful development outcomes and — at worst — DPI causing people harm. Digital transformation affects the lived experiences of citizens in very real ways, and by bringing into view goals on inclusion, agency, and empowerment, we uncover a whole range of metrics that must be considered to ensure that the impact on people’s lives is positive. The need to build an efficiency-based investment case for DPI should not trump the need to build the human impact&nbsp;case.</p> DPI’s outcome problem: A “shared means to many&nbsp;ends” <p>That people are underrepresented in the conversation on DPI measurement is symptomatic of the fact that, while there is growing consensus around the <a href="https://www.undp.org/publications/accelerating-sdgs-through-digital-public-infrastructure-compendium-potential-digital-public-infrastructure">“whole of society” approach</a> to DPI implementation, this is still nascent when it comes to measuring DPI’s impact. DPI is an emergent system that is deeply interconnected, and as such it requires a systems-level theory of change and measurement approach.</p><p>The description of DPI as “<a href="https://www.codevelop.fund/insights-1/what-is-digital-public-infrastructure">a shared means to many ends</a>” highlights the numerous possibilities of use and, therefore, the numerous potential outcomes for different actors within a given system — government, civil society, private sector, businesses, households, and individuals. These are connected actors; thus, impact and information flows are also multidirectional.</p><p>As a DPI community, we have many reasonable hypotheses (see Caribou’s illustrative examples below) but not a coherent narrative on the multitude of outcomes that DPI — in its diverse forms — could enable. A shared understanding of DPI’s potential outcomes for different system actors could unlock multi-stakeholder collaboration on the “right measures” and mitigate the risk of misalignment and diminished effectiveness. Investing time in defining outcomes is crucial, ensuring they reflect the voices and needs of all stakeholders. Only then can metrics that genuinely serve these outcomes be&nbsp;defined.</p><p>Caribou’s illustrative examples of DPI&nbsp;outcomes</p> Metrics align intention and&nbsp;value <blockquote>“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://builtin.com/data-science/goodharts-law">Goodhard’s Law</a></blockquote><p>Metrics are useful ways of measuring outcomes — but only when they are aligned with a broader understanding of potential impact. Fundamentally, outcomes are expressions of what is valued; they reflect intention and galvanize collective action around what gets measured. A focus on misaligned outcomes can have lasting and challenging real-world effects; the financial inclusion sector’s fixation on account access, exacerbated by global measurement tools like <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex">Findex</a>, is a case in point. The onus is on us as a development community to ensure an inclusive and “whole of society” approach to defining and measuring the changes that can result from DPI to drive genuinely inclusive and meaningful impact.</p><p>Who gets to define these outcomes is also a critical question involving power dynamics that influence whose voices and needs are prioritized. DPI is necessarily a state-driven initiative, but it implies a rearticulation of at least a triad of relationships in the social contract: between the state and individuals, between individuals and the market, and between the state and the market. There are power dynamics and deeply held (and sometimes contested) values underpinning all three relationships, pointing to the complexity and necessity of involving all stakeholders in finding common ground and defining outcomes that&nbsp;matter.</p> A moment in time for DPI measurement <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cvmadhukar/">C. V. Madhukar</a> has said that we are at a <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/insights/grantee-impact-story/co-develop-spearheads-a-global-opportunity-for-dpi-adoption/">unique moment in time</a> in digital transformation. This unique moment offers an opportunity for the development community to align key stakeholders on a common set of DPI outcomes and the right metrics to measure those outcomes. These metrics could: 1) provide a clearer understanding of the benefits DPI delivers to different groups; 2) reveal the risks of DPI, so that products and services can course-correct, and 3) enable comparisons between approaches that could help define <a href="https://dial.global/good-dpi/">“Good DPI”</a>, akin to the influential efforts to mobilize<a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/All-ID-Must-be-Good-ID_Final_3.7.19.pdf"> consensus around “Good&nbsp;ID</a>.”</p><p>This clarity could guide funding decisions and channel resources toward solutions with the greatest potential for impact. Defining such a measurement framework requires a systems-focused theory of change that incorporates individuals, businesses, civil society actors, and governments, and that is underpinned by a critical synthesis of the existing evidence (in this regard, DIAL and Co-Develop’s forthcoming DPI Evidence Compendium is an excellent first&nbsp;step).</p> Digital development measurement practices can show the&nbsp;way <p>While the multifaceted nature of DPI presents a measurement challenge, we are not starting from scratch. As a digital development community, we have learned a great deal from measuring digital initiatives, and these form a valuable knowledge base from which to start. Some key learnings:</p>  Prioritize outcomes over adoption metrics. Measurement systems reflect values and intentions, and we must prioritize outcomes tracking alongside — easily and digitally obtained — adoption tracking to ensure that decision-making extends beyond access and use. Funders and implementers should measure the change they want to see in order to drive inclusive impact.  Based on their extensive experience supporting DPI implementation, Public Digital’s call to <a href="https://public.digital/pd-insights/blog/2024/10/the-value-of-metrics-in-digital-public-infrastructure">measure value from the perspective of service users</a> is an important reminder to focus on outcomes. Building on this, we could also draw on<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_approach"> Amartya Sen’s influential “human capabilities” approach</a>, as well as C. V. Madhukar’s emphasis on <a href="https://www.codevelop.fund/insights-1/from-government-solutions-to-societal-capabilities">societal capabilities</a> to consider outcomes from a multi-stakeholder perspective. To make a compelling case for DPI, it must be clear that DPI makes a real difference in the public’s lives and that there must be a swift response to any harm — something that matters to politicians, policymakers, planners, implementers, and, most importantly, people.  Adopt a systems-focused, complexity-aware theory of change. DPI warrants a systems-led, complexity-aware theory of change and measurement framework informed through <a href="https://medium.com/disruptive-design/tools-for-systems-thinkers-systems-mapping-2db5cf30ab3a">system mapping</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/shifting-through-the-noise-in-the-age-of-information-overload-the-power-of-evidence-synthesis-6157e5bc472a">evidence synthesis</a>, and deep and wide stakeholder consultation. As DPI is both ever-dynamic and advancing rapidly, theories of change must also evolve continuously. This approach should consider both opportunities and risks for various actors engaging with DPI. Without identifying all sides, we risk a one-sided view of impact, potentially overlooking significant risks to different stakeholders. Developing a nuanced and adaptive theory of change can support DPI to be responsive, equitable, and impactful for all involved.  Embed iterative measurement within tech systems. Data on metrics can often be captured in real time using digital solutions themselves, enabling feedback loops that drive continuous improvement. Such <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/traditional-evaluation-looks-backward-innovation-looks-forward-5bb094190e1a">cost-efficient embedded measurement</a> and <a href="https://www.betterevaluation.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/MandE_for_Adaptive_Management_WP2_What_Is_AM_%26_how_does_it_work_202009.pdf">adaptive management</a> approaches can ensure that DPI initiatives focus on delivering <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/publications/2024/mar/digital-public-infrastructure-and-public-value-what-public-about-dpi">public value</a> beyond deployment and adoption.  Utilize a multi-method approach. Iterative measurement (above) may need to be triangulated with other instruments in order to capture all required data. <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org">Findex-type </a>survey data may be required to gather some data points. Additionally, literature measurement can act as a “purpose navigator,” ensuring that deployments deliver tangible public&nbsp;benefit.   DPI impact at a societal scale requires collective action <p>By building consensus on the outcomes that matter and metrics that measure those outcomes — particularly as they reflect the lived experiences of those impacted — DPI can support inclusive growth, empower individuals, and deliver societal-scale transformation.</p><p>The knowledge, tools, and momentum to make a real difference exist, but impact requires collective action and a shared&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Please reach out to Jess (j<a href="http://jess@cariboudigital.net">ess@cariboudigital.net</a>), Emrys (e<a href="http://emrys@cariboudigital.net">mrys@cariboudigital.net</a>), or Niamh (<a href="mailto:niamh@cariboudigital.net">niamh@cariboudigital.net</a>) if you would like to discuss our thinking&nbsp;further.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/meeting-the-target-and-missing-the-point-putting-society-at-the-center-of-digital-public-ab0552e5a5f2">Meeting the target and missing the point: Putting society at the center of digital public…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The nation of Thailand has a ready response for governments around the world seeking insights on implementing digital identity at scale: Phuket.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Thai island paradise of Phuket—long known for its pristine beaches, stunning waterfalls, and vibrant nightlife—has transformed itself from a resort town to a smart city. Its thriving technology sector and “smart, safe, sustainable” approach to governance have become a prime model and critical test market for the nation’s expansive <a href="https://www.telecomreviewasia.com/news/featured-articles/4569-thailand-crafting-a-secure-and-inclusive-future-in-the-global-digital-arena/">Thailand 4.0</a> strategy. This 20-year economic development plan is designed to turn this Southeast-Asian country of more than 70 million people into a high-tech, high-income powerhouse, supported and enabled by digital identity.</p>
<p>To that end, Phuket has become a pilot region for Thailand’s new digital identification and verification infrastructure—and for good reason. The city’s tourism sector provides an ideal proving ground for using digital identity to verify visa applications, travel bookings, and access to local services in a seamless, all-digital manner. Since launching 16 months ago, the test has been a trial by fire. But it’s one that Phuket’s tech-savvy population is well-positioned to navigate and help refine.</p>
<p>In Phuket, tourists, expats, and locals use a mobile app called ThaID (as in Thai-ID) to register for banking and healthcare services. But the system also has other purposes. To crack down on counterfeit ID cards that have long plagued Phuket’s bustling nightlife venues, this facial biometrics-based mobile digital ID is now required to gain entry to the city’s clubs and bars. Yet, for all their utility, these and other early applications are just a glimpse of what digital identity has come to mean for this nation.</p>
 Phuket, Let’s Go: When Digital Identity Is More Than Just Tech 
<p>Thailand’s ambitious digital identity initiative is about more than just financial inclusion, ensuring access to services, and securing against mounting cyber threats. In recent months, it has become emblematic of a nation set on reasserting its identity as a hub of digital innovation—and reigniting an economy lagging its regional neighbors.</p>
<p>In recent years, Thailand’s growth has stagnated. Even as per capita income in China, Singapore, and Malaysia has soared, Thailand has struggled to escape what the World Bank’s 2024 Development Report describes as a “<a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/3282972/why-thailand-failed-escape-middle-income-trap">middle-income trap</a>.” A vital component of this predicament is an average annual growth rate hovering around 3% for nearly 30 years, compared to China’s average of 8.86% and Singapore’s 6.18%.</p>
<p>Roughly 531 miles north of Phuket, Thailand’s capital city of Bangkok is crafting a far more promising narrative. Modern skyscrapers, luxury hotels, high-end shopping centers, and world-class restaurants abound. Importantly, strides made by Thailand’s robust technology sector increasingly mirror Phuket’s. Over the past year, investment in artificial intelligence, data analytics, cloud computing, and cybersecurity, for instance, has contributed to the sector’s 12.8% growth rate. In October, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-22/nvidia-is-planning-to-invest-in-thailand-minister-pichai-says?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> reported that Nvidia Corp. plans to invest heavily in Thailand, joining <a href="https://datacenternews.asia/story/google-invests-usd-1-billion-in-thailand-s-digital-future">Alphabet Inc.</a> and Microsoft in building data centers and component manufacturing plants here.</p>
<p>Thailand 4.0 is designed to build on previous <a href="https://dimerco.com/thailand-4-0-the-new-economy/#:~:text=Thailand%204.0%20is%20the%20fourth,heavy%20industry%20(Thailand%203.0).">economic development</a> plans, which focused on agriculture (Thailand 1.0), light industry (2.0), and heavy industry (3.0). Expanding and leveraging Thailand’s thriving tech sector to help fuel growth and opportunity across the rest of the economy means digital identity isn’t just a nice-to-have—it’s an imperative.</p>
 Why Digital Transformation Requires Trusted Identity Proofing 
<p>Put simply, digital identity is the electronic representation of an individual’s credentials used for identity verification and proofing. Think of it as your passport, driver’s license, and bank card rolled into one secure, digitized framework verified by cross-referencing government-issued, physical world credentials. For individuals, using physical credentials to make purchases, manage finances, or receive entitlements in person is a relatively simple proposition. Doing the same in digital channels through authentication based on usernames and passwords is another thing entirely—one that has failed miserably.</p>
<p>Thanks to never-ending phishing attacks and corporate data breaches, the login credentials and personal identity files of billions of individuals worldwide have been compromised and made available to cybercriminals and threat actors on the Dark Web. In 2024 alone, nearly 3 billion people had their personal information stolen during a cyberattack targeting data broker National Public Data (NPD). This includes what some believe to be the Social Security Number for every US citizen. This past summer, a tranche of more than 10 billion login credentials were discovered in an online hacker forum.</p>
<p>Cyber thieves and other threat actors leverage this information to defraud individuals, businesses, and governments. They can siphon funds from bank accounts, apply for loans or credit cards, access government benefits, and more. They can also infiltrate corporate and government networks to breach data they can monetize downstream—sometimes with implications for critical infrastructure and national security. According to <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/government/identity-theft-drivers/">TransUnion</a>, the number of successful data breaches jumped 15% last year. Worldwide, the price tag for such attacks is projected to top $9.5 trillion annually.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that projection may prove naive. Today, new forms of AI increasingly enable threat actors of all stripes to enhance the effectiveness and scale of their operations. This is material in Southeast Asia, where dense populations and significant socioeconomic stratification make countries in the region prime targets for AI-enabled attacks. It also doesn’t help that Thailand has been home to what the FBI calls the world’s largest <a href="https://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/2024/06/01/thai-police-and-fbi-take-down-the-largest-global-cybercrime-ring/#google_vignette">cybercrime network</a>. But a growing number of governments here and around the world view digital identity as critical to mitigating these threats.</p>
 ThaID &amp; Beyond: How Digital Identity Is Taking Shape in Thailand 
<p>The ability to facilitate fast, secure interactions and transactions is foundational to every digital economy, including Thailand’s. However, it requires a universally accepted form of identity proofing that protects privacy and prevents personal identity data from being stolen and exploited by others.</p>
<p>Compared to Belgium’s <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-identity-spotlight-belgium/">itsme</a>, Singapore’s <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-identity-spotlight-singapore/">SingPass</a>, or even India’s <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/explainers/how-to-link-aadhaar-card-to-bank-accoun/94468/1">Aadhaar</a> system, Thailand’s digital identity initiative is still in its early stages. But it’s catching up. The country’s focus on mobile-based identity verification, a key element of digital identity, is supported by its extensive 5G mobile broadband network—among the first deployed in Southeast Asia. The initiative also benefits from a tech-savvy citizenry. Fifty percent of the population is expected to have a mobile broadband subscription by 2025, while overall Internet penetration exceeds 88%.</p>
<p>Rather than developing a government-run digital identity system, however, Thai officials have opted to forge public-private partnerships within a digital identity ecosystem linking service and identity providers (IDPs). So far, some of the most prominent forms of digital identity include the following:</p>
 
 ThaID<br>
Launched by the Department of Provincial Administration (DOPA) in 2023, the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/thailand-launches-digital-id-verification-service-with-thaid-app">ThaID</a> mobile app simplifies access to services requiring identity confirmation in both the public and private sectors. For example, ThaiID facilitates access to government services such as public health care, vehicle registration, and online tax payment without requiring additional data entry. 
 NDID: The National Digital Identity Platform<br>
This <a href="https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issues/tax-administration/thailand-national-digital-identity-platform.pdf">blockchain-based</a> infrastructure is designed primarily to address digital Know Your Customer (KYC) mandates within banking and financial services. It’s intended to “enhance digital security to facilitate online transactions and enable wider access to banking and lending” via the user’s preferred mobile banking app. 
 MNID: Mobile Network ID<br>
Operated by participating telcos, the MNID system serves its mobile customers to facilitate identity verification and authentication. 
 
<p>These and other biometrics-based applications are designed to secure online transactions and prevent fraud. And they’re buoyed by regional collaborations like the ASEAN <a href="https://asean.org/asean-defa-study-projects-digital-economy-leap-to-us2tn-by-2030/">Digital Economy Framework</a>, which seeks to standardize cross-border digital identity recognition. But there are hurdles. Unlike digital identity initiatives in Singapore and <a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/estonian-e-identity/id-card/#:~:text=e%2DIdentity,of%20the%20country's%20e%2Dstate.">Estonia</a>, where privacy concerns have been addressed through robust governance frameworks, Thailand’s initiative faces public trust issues and the fear of data misuse. Enhanced regulation and a surprising financial incentive may change that.</p>
 Tang Rat: Stimulus and a Step Toward Self-Sovereign Identity 
<p>One of the critical benefits of Thailand’s digital identity initiatives is convenience. Once registered, citizens don’t need to enter additional information when accessing services or manage multiple usernames and passwords—and biometric authentication adds an extra layer of security.</p>
<p>But a series of public sector data breaches, like the one that compromised the personal identity information of more than 55 million Thais earlier this year, threatens to erode trust in e-government initiatives like Thailand 4.0. Downloads of ThaiID and a new digital wallet within a super app called Tang Rat—which require submission of sensitive personal information such as the back of the national ID card and a unique set of codes for making digital transactions—have been tepid. Only 1 in 5 Internet users in Thailand have downloaded either of these apps. There’s no telling how many have uninstalled them.</p>
<p>Stepped-up <a href="https://www.legalbusinessonline.com/features/thailand-new-data-new-rules">regulatory mandates</a> on data breaches and cross-border data sharing, and steep fines for non-compliance, are meant to stem concerns and incentivize stronger protections. Moreover, a significant benefit of digital wallets and their blockchain-based architectures is the use of globally unique identifiers that give users a cryptographically verifiable, decentralized digital identity. This approach sets the stage for self-sovereign identity (SSI), where authenticating users no longer requires personal data to be stored centrally on bank, government, or retail servers where it can be hacked. Instead, users can control what personal information they share, how it’s used, and for how long.</p>
<p>Then there’s that longer-term objective of Thailand 4.0. To accelerate adoption and help juice the economy, the Thai government is spending US$14 billion to preload digital wallets with US$300 in spending money for each person who downloads one.</p>
 What Should Come Next 
<p>This kind of incentive aside, I applaud Thailand’s digital identity initiative and the country’s embrace of digital wallets. In my view, digital identity’s success is predicated on distributed technologies and the architectural advantages they offer. This is especially crucial given the country’s ecosystem approach to digital identity. If deployed well, these technologies augur a day when someone applying for a car loan can choose which if any personal information to share, instead of opening their entire financial lives to a lender or dealer financing department.</p>
<p>It also means they could one day share third-party trust scores that allow them to demonstrate creditworthiness without revealing any personal information at all. Also promising: Thailand’s adoption of liveness tests during authentication of certain services.</p>
<p>But I do have one rather urgent piece of advice. To be most effective, the Thai government and its ecosystem partners would be wise to implement<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/"> NIST-</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2-</a>, and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/79520.html">ISO-</a>type biometrics-based standards for its digital identity infrastructure and any associated liveness tests. Only then will they be able to defeat virtually any attempt at identity spoofing. And yes, if they were to seek my advice about the ideal setting for testing these technologies, my immediate response would be Phuket.</p>

 Our Senior Architect, Sebastian Elfors recently participated in a panel discussion on the challenges of balancing privacy with usability when developing the EUDI Wallet. Here he shares his thoughts and concerns. 



<p>As the co-author of the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119400_119499/119476/01.02.01_60/tr_119476v010201p.pdf">ETSI TR 119 476</a> ‘Analysis of selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs applied to Electronic Attestation of Attributes,’ I was recently invited to attend the ‘How far should privacy go? Privacy versus Usability’ panel discussion during October’s <a href="https://www.globaltrustfoundation.org/walletsforum">EU Digital Identity Wallets Forum</a> in Spielfeld’s Digital Hub in the heart of Berlin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the panel I was joined by panelists Steffen Schwalm, Principal Consultant at MSG, Mirko Mollik, Identity Architect at SPRIN-D, and Philippe Rixhon, Chair of the Management Board at Valunode OU; the hour-long panel was moderated by Michal Tabor, partner at Obserwatorium.biz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout the lively and robust discussion, the panel debated and exchanged opinions on various matters, but there was one topic that panelists were in complete consensus early on: that user privacy would be essential when EUDI Wallets are rolled out across Europe in the coming years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel also agreed that the eIDAS 2.0 regulation contains the relevant articles and recitals that cater for mandatory selective disclosure and unlinkability when the EUDI Wallets are used to present electronic attributes. Simply put, the concept of selective disclosure allows a user to present a minimum of personal information to a verifier. The classic example is to prove that you are of legal drinking age when entering a bar, without revealing any more personal information than just your age. The principle of verifier unlinkability means that one or more verifiers cannot collude to determine if the selectively disclosed attributes describe the same identity subject.&nbsp;</p>



 Assessing what has come before. 



<p>Earlier this year, I was appointed to co-author the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) report <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119400_119499/119476/01.02.01_60/tr_119476v010201p.pdf">ETSI TR 119 476</a>, which provided a comprehensive overview of existing cryptographic schemes for selective disclosure, unlinkability and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP). It also gives recommendations of data formats and protocols that are suitable for selective disclosure with the EUDI Wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Similarly, the Architecture Reference and Framework (<a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/arf.md">ARF</a>) specifies the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO mobile driving license</a> (mDL) MSO and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VC</a> as credential formats for selective disclosure, which are the same formats as proposed in the ETSI report. The ISO mDL MSO is a selective disclosure standard based on ‘salted hashes’ of attributes, which are CBOR encoded and signed by the issuer. Likewise, the SD-JWT also contains salted hashes of attributes, which are JSON encoded and signed by the issuer. As such, I believe the ETSI report and ARF are aligned with respect to credential formats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the ISO mDL MSO and SD-JWT are digitally signed with cryptographic algorithms approved by <a href="https://www.sogis.eu/">SOG-IS</a> (Senior Officials Group Information Systems Security), they can therefore be used by the EU public sector. The drawback is that ISO mDL MSOs and SD-JWTs must be issued batchwise to the EUDI Wallets to cater for verifier unlinkability, which adds an operational cost for the Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs) and the PID Providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is, however, also an eIDAS 2.0 article that allows EU Member States to implement more innovative ZKPs on a voluntary basis. By using a ZKP scheme, the user can prove that a given statement is true, while not providing any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The more advanced ZKP schemes, such as BBS+ (named after its creators Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham) and zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge), have the advantages of providing full unlinkability and dynamic predicates, without the additional cost of issuing batches of credentials. There are academic research projects, such as the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7546505">Cinderella project</a>, which have implemented zk-SNARKs to “pick out” certain elements of a classic X.509 certificate or an ICAO eMRTD (electronic Machine Readable Travel Document according to the International Civil Aviation Organization standard, such as electronic passports), and shared those attributes with a verifier. This approach is also getting some interest from ISO/IEC, which may apply it on a standard for selective disclosure of the ISO mDL attributes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Certainly, these ZKP schemes need to be standardized before being considered for the EUDI Wallet. The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) CFRG (Crypto Forum Research Group) and ISO/IEC (PWI 24843 and CD 27565) are in the process of standardizing BBS+, which may result in BBS+ being referenced by a future version of the ARF.</p>



<p></p>



 The challenges of building an EUDI Wallet ecosystem.&nbsp; 



<p>Privacy is clearly a complex topic when it comes to the ZKP protocols and related standards that need to be considered for the EUDI Wallet. When it comes to building a complete EUDI Wallet ecosystem, there are even further complexities:&nbsp;</p>



  The eIDAS2 Relying Parties will be registered for specific use cases.&nbsp;  



  The QTSPs can issue Qualified Electronic Attestations of Attributes (Q)EAAs) with embedded disclosure policies, which restricts the use of how the EUDI Wallets can share the (Q)EAAs with Relying Parties.&nbsp;  



  The EUDI Wallets will implement access control rights, according to a new CEN TC224 draft standard.&nbsp;  



  Last but not least, the users must give their consent to share the (Q)EAAs or PIDs with Relying Parties.&nbsp;  



<p>All of this creates a significant user experience challenge for the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, which will require it to be designed and tested thoroughly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, an important topic when it comes to the EUDI Wallet is transactions. The panelists exchanged ideas on how QTSPs will be able to invoice the Relying Parties for (Q)EAA transactions, in case the QTSP is not notified about how the EUDI Wallet is sharing the (Q)EAAs. In other words, how can a QTSP invoice the Relying Parties without knowing who they are?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a few potential solutions to this problem. The first is to count and share each EUDI Wallet Provider’s aggregated and anonymized statistics with the QTSPs. A second option could be to insert payment terms in the (Q)EAAs with embedded disclosure policies, which the Relying Parties must accept before processing the (Q)EAAs. A third option could be to extend the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html">OID4VP</a>) with parameters to check for agreements between the QTSPs and Relying Parties. The OID4VP protocol will be used by the EUDI Wallets for presenting PIDs and (Q)EAAs to the Relying Parties, so it could make sense to extend this protocol to make an a-priori “check” with the Relying Party that there is an agreement in place, prior to sharing the (Q)EAAs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the complexity of the EUDI Wallet ZKP protocols, the challenges in creating an ecosystem of QTSPs and Relying Parties that is also a viable business model, we agreed that discussions need to be ongoing. These topics should preferably be considered by the policy makers in the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en">EU Commission DG-CNCT</a>. The EUDI Large Scale Pilots, which are currently underway, should also be encouraged to test the complex scenarios described above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Considering how important the EUDI Wallet will be to identity management in Europe, it is fundamental for the entire eIDAS 2.0 community to resolve these issues prior to the EUDI Wallets being rolled out at scale in Europe the coming years.</p>

				  Indicio’s market-changing solution gives people control over their biometric data, removes the need for centralized storage, and solves the challenge of generative-AI identity fraud, all while delivering the simplicity, privacy, and security that everyone needs to feel confident in biometric authentication. No need to abandon biometric systems, BYOB-VC can be added as a layer for rapid digital transformation.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Today, Indicio announces the launch of its groundbreaking solution to the risks and challenges of biometric authentication, <a href="https://indicio.tech/biometric-authentication/">BYOB-VC solution: Bring Your Own Biometrics using Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p>
<p>BYOB-VC is a simple, easy-to-implement way for enterprises or governments to authenticate portable biometric data without having to store it.</p>
<p>Simply give people their biometrics in a Verifiable Credential (as part of an identity assurance process) and require them to present the biometric template in the VC (held in a digital wallet on their mobile device) when they do a liveness check. Verification software compares the live biometric with the authenticated biometric in the credential.</p>
<p>This radically simplifies biometric authentication —&nbsp;and provides a simple, intuitive, and powerful way to bypass the risk of AI-generated deepfakes.</p>
<p>BYOB-VC was developed by Indicio for pre-authorized travel and seamless border crossing and is in use in Digital Travel Credential solutions. Now, it is available in an easy-to-implement form for any organization reliant on biometrics for authentication and access management.</p>
<p>Global surveys show public are alarmed over biometric security and privacy</p>
<p>BYOB-VC addresses deep public concerns over biometric authentication. The recent International Air Transport Association (IATA) Global Passenger Survey 2024 found that a majority of airline passengers are worried about biometric data breaches and how their biometric data is being used.</p>
<p>A global consumer survey by mobile payment platform Jumio found that 72 percent of respondents are concerned on a daily basis that they may lose money or sensitive data to a deepfake.</p>
<p>And a 2024 survey by GetApp found that only 5 percent of consumers believed that their biometric data was secure.</p>
<p>Giving people control of their biometric data and the ability to consent to share that data, as BYOB-VC does, is a critical step to reassuring the public and governments over the safety of biometric processes. It meets the demands of the&nbsp; European Union’s Data Protection Board, which stipulates that “individuals should have maximum control over their own biometric data.”</p>
<p>By combining a liveness check with the cryptographic, tamper-proof verifiability of Verifiable Credential technology, BYOB-VC is the most powerful multi factor authentication available for biometrics — and it can be enhanced to meet the most critical security requirements by easily combining other Verifiable Credentials —&nbsp;such as a government-issued ID — to the authentication process.</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<p>Portable trust</p>
<p>You can prove the source of the Verifiable Credential and that the biometric data in the credential hasn’t been altered or faked. You can prove that the credential is bound to the person presenting it.</p>
<p>Bypasses generative AI deepfakes</p>
<p>Biometric authentication is a quick, two-step process: the person presenting themselves for a biometric scan also presents their authenticated biometric template in a Verifiable Credential from their digital wallet. Verification software compares the two and they have to match. There are multiple layers of biometrics, cryptography, and other security binding the credential to the wallet and the wallet to the device and the device to the person.</p>
<p>Faster, flexible, and simpler biometric management</p>
<p>No centralized biometric storage.&nbsp;BYOB-VC removes the complexity around biometric systems. There’s no need to worry about them going offline or protecting against data breaches — because&nbsp;there’s no data to access! Verification software is simple and mobile, allowing you to take advantage of portable, trustable biometric authentication.</p>
<p>Makes data privacy compliance much easier&nbsp;</p>
<p>By enabling people to store their own biometric data you’ve not only solved the security risk of centralized storage, you’ve solved the compliance challenge of centralized storage and data minimization.</p>
<p>Addresses critical public concerns over biometric data<br>With generative AI being used in ever more elaborate scams, BYOB-VC provides robust reassurance, not only that their data can’t be stolen but that it can’t be used in ways they aren’t aware or approve of. The IATA Global Passenger Survey found that 39 percent of people would reconsider using biometrics if they were reassured about their privacy.</p>
<p>Why the future of biometric authentication needs to be decentralized</p>
<p>Biometrics have emerged as a powerful, frictionless way to authenticate identity. They are better than username and password-based authentication because they can’t be forgotten, don’t need to be reset, and —&nbsp;in the case of an iris — are unique to an individual.</p>
<p>But as biometrics have proliferated as a method to access systems, the upside of their uniqueness has revealed a precipitous downside. Biometrics need to be stored in a database so that the verifying party can compare the scan of a person presenting themselves for a biometric scan with a stored copy of their biometrics. If they match, the person is authenticated.</p>
<p>This centralized storage means they are at risk of being stolen in a data breach, and when this happens, people cannot reset their fingerprints, faces, or irises.</p>
<p>And if this wasn’t a big enough existential problem, the rapid rise of generative AI has made it astonishingly easy to convincingly fake biometric data.</p>
<p>Entrust Cybersecurity <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/identity-fraud-report-2024">reported</a> a 3000% increase in deepfake attempts between 2022 and 2023, while Deloitte’s Center for Financial Services is <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/financial-services-industry-predictions/2024/deepfake-banking-fraud-risk-on-the-rise.html">predicting</a> AI-generated “fraud losses to reach US$40 billion in the United States by 2027, from US$12.3 billion in 2023, a compound annual growth rate of 32%.”</p>
<p>So far, typical responses&nbsp; range from “be more vigilant about security” to “don’t post detailed pictures of yourself online,” to “we need an AI solution to detect AI fakes.”</p>
<p>So simple, so fast, so cost effective</p>
<p>BYOB-VC is a simple way around both wishful thinking and an AI arms race, as it leverages the revolution in decentralized digital identity. Here’s how it works.</p>
<p>When a person has their biometric data first scanned as part of identity assurance, the data is digitally signed and issued to them in a Verifiable Credential that they hold on their mobile device.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials have three powerful features:</p>
<p>1 The source of the credential can be proved using cryptography.</p>
 
 If someone tries to manipulate the data in a credential, they break the credential. 
 The credential is cryptographically bound to the person and their device. 
 
<p>By rendering the biometric template taken during identity assurance in the form of a Verifiable Credential, any organization can authenticate it using simple verifier software. The source of the credential is authenticated, the integrity of the template data is authenticated, and finally, the template data is compared with the live biometric scan, all in one seamless process.</p>
<p>BYOB-VC also bypasses the problem of deepfakes. Rather than just rely on a still or moving image, or a voice, you also ask for cryptographic proof of that same data created by a trusted issuer. And if you need further proof, ask them to add other Verifiable Credentials to their presentation, multiplying the layers of cryptographic proof and credential binding.</p>
<p>In use by Indicio customers and now widely available</p>
<p>BYOB-VC was pioneered by Indicio for use in travel, where a passport’s biometric data is compared with a liveness check and then issued as a Verifiable Credential following the International Civil Aviation Organization’s standards for Digital Travel Credentials. This enables travelers to use a Verifiable Credential for pre-authorized travel and seamless border crossing. Acuity Market Research’s The Prism Project described our biometric solution as “<a href="https://www.the-prism-project.com/th-prism-download">masterful</a>.”</p>
<p>Now, Indicio’s masterful approach and technology is available to any company, organization,&nbsp; industry or sector that wants a simple, powerful solution to managing biometric authentication.</p>

 It’s official: IDnow Trust Services AB is now certified as a Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP) in the EU. We sat down with the Chief Executive Officer of IDnow Trust Services AB, Johannes Leser and Registration Officer of IDnow Trust Services AB, Uwe Pfizenmaier to learn more. 



<p>In early 2024, IDnow began a joint venture with system integrator and technology provider, <a href="https://esysco.pl/en/about/">ESYSCO</a> to establish the newly formed QTSP, <a href="https://www.trust-services.io/">IDnow Trust Services AB</a>. In October it was officially approved by <a href="https://pts.se/en">PTS,</a> the Swedish supervisory body<a href="https://pts.se/en">,</a> and is now listed as a QTSP on the <a href="https://eidas.ec.europa.eu/efda/tl-browser/#/screen/tl/SE/4">eIDAS Dashboard by the European Commission</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-trust-services-ab-certified-qtsp-eu/">significant milestone</a> allows IDnow to offer a wide range of eIDAS-compliant digital signing solutions and ultimately offer trust services to our customers. For more information, check out our interview with Uwe and Johannes below.&nbsp;</p>



 For those who may not be familiar with the term, what exactly is a QTSP?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Johannes: A Qualified Trust Service Provider, or QTSP for short, is an entity that can create one or more trust services, such as electronic signatures, electronic time stamps, electronic seals or certificates in a qualified manner. What differentiates a QTSP from a Trust Service Provider is that it operates under stricter measurements and requirements as defined by the Electronic Identification and Trust Services (eIDAS), is independently assessed in regular audits by a conformity assessment body (CAB) and is required to have insurance due to reversed burden of proof in case of any disputes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uwe: By using a QTSP, businesses benefit from an extra layer of security knowing that the products they choose are officially certified and audited by a higher authority. Although qualified trust services may or may not be required depending on the type of security an organization needs and the requirements of the country in which it operates, by choosing to do business with a QTSP, a higher level of confidence in security is achieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What services will IDnow Trust Services AB offer?&nbsp; 



<p>Johannes: As a QTSP, IDnow Trust Services AB can provide the following for now:&nbsp;</p>



  Issue, validate and manage qualified electronic certificates for signatures and seals.&nbsp;  



  Deliver additional services such as qualified time stamps.&nbsp;  



  Persist identification evidence data.&nbsp;  



  Execute certificate revocation.  



 Why will QTSPs be so important in the future of the digital signature market?&nbsp; 



<p>Uwe: <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/europe-digital-signature-market-107411">72% of organizations in Europe still use a mix of paper and electronic documents</a>. Despite this, the trend toward a fully digital signing process is just around the corner. In fact, the European digital signature market is predicted to be <a href="https://trustservices.swisscom.com/en/esignature-hub/trust-blog/growth-market-electronic-signatures-how-digital-businesses-can-profit">7x times larger by 2030</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As QTSPs are verified services under strict eIDAS regulations and requirements, they guarantee their customers a significant level of trust and security to adopt new solutions like digital signatures. Before becoming a QTSP, the entity is required to undergo rigorous and independent assessment as well as regular audits to ensure they remain compliant. As such, QTSPs offer greater legal certainty and higher security for electronic transactions and meet the same level of trust as paper documents.&nbsp;</p>

 What did the process of becoming a QTSP entail, specifically in relation to regulatory requirements?&nbsp; 



<p>Johannes: To become a QTSP, a full understanding of the eIDAS regulation is crucial. eIDAS offers a uniform framework of guidelines to allow completely digital and legally secure cross-border contracts within the EU. It also defines the process and technology behind different types of services such as signatures, seals, time stamps, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uwe: In order to qualify as a QTSP, the entity must ensure all legal and regulatory obligations are met, such as data protection and privacy requirements. Once established, the eIDAS assessment process is initiated with a CAB and an audit is carried out. After successfully passing the audit, a QTSP application is submitted with a supervisory body. Upon acceptance, the QTSP is published on the EU Trust List.&nbsp;</p>



 What sets IDnow Trust Services AB apart from other QTSPs?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Johannes: IDnow Trust Services AB is the first QTSP to offer SMS-free signing for digital contract signing. During the average digital signing process, users receive a One-Time Password (OTP) code that must be entered to authenticate the transaction. This step usually causes friction for users and companies, leading to <a href="https://help.uxcam.com/hc/en-us/articles/12496502531609-Use-Case-OTP-Validation-Removing-Friction">22% of drop offs coming from the OTP identification.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>SMS-free signing dramatically simplifies the signing process, eliminating the heavy-friction requirement of OTP codes and driving higher conversion rates. Plus, by eliminating the SMS step, fraud and operational risk is significantly reduced.&nbsp;</p>



 What advantages does the creation of IDnow Trust Services AB offer to IDnow customers?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Uwe: The combination of IDnow’s leading identity verification expertise and IDnow Trust Services AB’s advanced trust services&nbsp;will deliver unmatched value and secure, yet agile, solutions, including Qualified Electronic Signatures to future-proof businesses in a rapidly changing regulatory landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key benefits include being able to easily navigate complex regulations like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/aml-compliance-2024-amld6/">AMLD 6</a> and eIDAS. As electronic certificates are legally binding and dispute-protected, it can also help to reduce the risks of digital transactions in the EU. Plus, due to the Europe-wide validity of trust services, customers can now leverage IDnow’s pan-European approach to provide seamless, consistent services for cross-border growth. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Johannes: By combining identity verification services with secure trust services, IDnow not only creates optimized processes, but offers unparalleled reliability and boosts confidence and trust in every transaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As customers can perform identity verification and trust services from a single, unified and simplified process, they can benefit from streamlined procurement and contractual simplicity.&nbsp;</p>



 What does the future look like for IDnow Trust Services AB?&nbsp; 



<p>Uwe: As an eIDAS-certified QTSP, the outlook is very bright. The sky is the limit, especially regarding innovation. In the future, we hope to expand our product offerings and features as well as certifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Johannes: In 2025, our plan is to equip more products with our QTSP features and explore new business use cases. Additionally, we plan on achieving another certification based on an audit that will support the forthcoming EUDI Wallet. Lastly, we plan to offer future-proof services such as QEAA (Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes) and advanced preservation solutions, all without sacrificing regulatory compliance. We are looking forward to the upcoming year and the many innovations we plan for our customers!&nbsp;</p>

 IDnow Trust Services AB certified as a Qualified Trust Service Provider in the European Union 



<p>Munich, November 5, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, announces its partnership with newly founded IDnow Trust Services AB, a <a href="https://eidas.ec.europa.eu/efda/tl-browser/#/screen/tl/SE/4">certified Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP) under EU Regulation 910/2014 (eIDAS)</a>.<a>[1]</a> Founded as a joint venture in Stockholm in early 2024 between IDnow and <a href="https://esysco.pl/en/">ESYSCO</a>, a system integrator and technology provider, the company offers qualified trust services, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">electronic signatures</a>, time stamps, and seals, that combine security, compliance, and user convenience.</p>



 Innovation and leadership in the digital signature market 



<p>As a recognized QTSP in the EU by the Swedish supervisory body Post-och telestyrelsen (<a href="https://pts.se/">PTS</a>), IDnow Trust Services AB will issue, validate, and manage electronic certificates and time stamps; capture additional information, such as qualified time; hold identification evidence data, and perform certificate revocation, while complying as a Certificate Authority (CA). The QTSP provides assurance of the existence of specific electronic data at a specific time, such as proof that documents have been submitted for processing.</p>



<p>One of the features that IDnow Trust Services AB will immediately enable for IDnow’s customers is SMS-free signing. This certified capability simplifies the signing process, eliminating the requirement of One-Time Password (OTP) codes and driving higher conversion rates. IDnow Trust Services AB is the first QTSP that will allow this new user authentication process, which is already acknowledged by different CEN and ETSI standards and which will revolutionize the user experience in the digital signature market. &nbsp;</p>



 New joint venture secures trust and simplifies compliance 



<p>“We are incredibly pleased that our joint venture, IDnow Trust Services AB, is already bearing the fruits of our labor. At IDnow, we have long made it our mission to actively shape and lead the Know Your Customer and digital identity industry; we are now once again showing this leadership role by doubling down on trust services, as they are an essential part of the transformation of the digital identity market heralded by eIDAS 2.0”, says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>



<p>He continues: “In the coming years, our customers will benefit from the synergy of identity verification and qualified trust services, ensuring a compliant and efficient experience for all business-critical operations across the EU. This collaboration sets a new standard for trust and operational efficiency, positioning businesses for long-term success in the fast-evolving digital landscape”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Johannes Leser, CEO of IDnow Trust Services AB, adds: “Trust and liability is the backbone of all business, and it will be the driving force behind the global digital economy. IDnow Trust Services AB is committed to delivering innovative and highly dependable solutions to IDnow, its customers, and partners. With trust as our mutual foundation, we’re poised to revolutionize the European digital signature market, which is expected to be seven times larger by 2030 than it is today.”</p>



 



 



<p><a>[1]</a> The electronic Identification and Signature (eIDAS) regulation defines a QTSP as a natural or a legal person who provides one or more qualified trust services.</p>

<p><a href="https://volla.online/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Volla</a> has shipped their new Quintus smartphone with a Holochain-based app pre-installed.</p><p>I repeat, TL;DR: you can have a phone with a native Holochain app on it today.</p><p>That’s it. That’s the key takeaway of this article. Details below.</p> Volla Quintus <p>The Volla Quintus, a privacy-first smartphone, just began shipping and customers will be receiving their devices in the coming days. This phone runs both custom Android and Ubuntu Touch software, for a “Google-free” experience. Designed as an alternative to the surveillance-focused tech giants, Volla’s phones provide a realistic option for opt-out.</p><p>The Quintus is Volla’s most recent model, but they have been producing user-centered phones <a href="https://volla.online/en/about/?ref=blog.holochain.org">since 2020</a>. They are dedicated to a distraction-free user experience, with interface tools like their Springboard which is a search-first launcher that allows you to interact with your applications without the overwhelming attention traps of the applications, notifications, and socials pushed on other platforms.</p> The App(s) <p>The Holochain-based Volla Messages is shipping with the Quintus in a beta version. While the front end of the app is relatively unremarkable (it’s a chat app where you can message your contacts one-on-one or create groups), the back end is something totally new.&nbsp;</p><p>Volla Messages uses Holochain for its networking and data storage, bypassing the need for central servers. The smartphones are networked together into their own cloud, with your data encrypted and held amongst your peers.&nbsp;</p><p>Volla Messages also uses Holochain’s membrane proof feature, limiting spam by requiring you to consent to join a particular chat that you’ve been added to. Web3 doesn’t need to mean a free-for-all; it can mean privacy, security, and agency. You should only be in the chats you want to be in.</p><p>In the coming month, Volla will be releasing a second Holochain-based app. Volla Recovery is a personal cloud app that allows you to backup the data from your phone without relying on a company’s servers, and without subjecting you to anyone’s data policies. Instead you can encrypt and backup your data among your peers, providing a seamless user experience alongside the privacy and security that your data deserves.&nbsp;</p> Why did Volla Choose Holochain? <p>Volla built on Holochain because we provide scalable cloud-style apps without central servers. They are thinking about user privacy through the complete stack, from hardware, to software, to cloud services and edge computing. Holochain is a critical piece for this.</p><p>Here is what they have to say about it:</p><blockquote>The big picture of Volla is a secure and independent communication infrastructure. A smartphone is an elementary component. The cloud is another important element. The only way to prevent external influence is distributed, highly encrypted edge computing.<br><br>—Dr. Jörg Wurzer, founder of Volla Phone</blockquote> How to Access <p>Volla Messages isn’t exclusive to Volla devices. While the download links aren’t live yet, any Android user can download and use this software. After an upcoming revamp of the Volla website you should be able to download the beta Volla Messages app for your Android device. Eventually they’ll push the stable version of the app out to the major app stores so everyone can access this truly peer-to-peer tech.</p> Buy the Phone Now <p>Want a privacy-first phone?

 Industry experts gathered to discuss the past, present and future of digital signatures and their ever-increasing role in financial services.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>From Sumerian tablets to digital documents, signatures have been used for thousands of years as symbols of trust, proof of identity and indicators of agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nowadays, digital signatures do all the above and offer enhanced security and efficiency. Little wonder then that the European digital signature market is predicted to be <a href="https://trustservices.swisscom.com/en/esignature-hub/trust-blog/growth-market-electronic-signatures-how-digital-businesses-can-profit">7x times larger by 2030</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To explore how <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/advantages-of-digital-signatures/">digital signature solutions are changing the way we do business</a>, we organized the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/sign-of-the-times-the-digital-signature-revolution/">‘Sign of the times: The digital signature revolution’ webinar</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderated by Ellie Burns, Head of Product &amp; Customer Marketing at IDnow, participants included Uwe Pfizenmaier, Director Product Management VideoIdent/eSign at IDnow, Magali Biron, VP Business Development eSign at Nitro and Julian Groetzbach, NPL &amp; Business Development Manager at TF Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now available on-demand, the hour-long webinar covers a variety of topics, from the legal and regulatory landscape of digital signatures to how they can be used to boost conversions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Missed the webinar? Here’s our five key takeaways!&nbsp;</p>



 1. Fraud is propelling the adoption of digital signatures.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>There are three different types of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">digital signatures</a>: Simple Electronic Signatures (SES), Advanced Electronic Signatures (AES) and Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES). As the least regulated, SES is mostly used for internal purposes, while AES and QES are regulated by the European-wide eIDAS standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Almost <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/europe-digital-signature-market-107411">three quarters of European organizations</a> still use a mixture of paper and electronic documents but increasing numbers of companies are making the digital switch. Up until last year, TF Bank was still using wet signatures to conclude contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recent increases in the adoption of digital signatures have been largely driven by the need to onboard more customers, increase conversions and reduce fraud. However, Uwe warned that:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The benefits of digital signatures, including enhanced trust, speed and security, alongside cost savings and a more sustainable method of concluding contracts, are only made possible through a robust identity verification process.</p>Uwe Pfizenmaier, Director Product Management VideoIdent/eSign at IDnow </blockquote>



<p>Despite the obvious benefits, some customers are still hesitant to use digital signatures, which is why it’s important for businesses to reassure users that they’re safe and secure and offer improved convenience. IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/instantsign/">InstantSign</a>, for example, only requires users to onboard once.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Acceptance of new products and technologies can also depend on the maturity of the market, with countries including Germany still hesitant about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gwvideoidentv-german-financial-sector/">adopting certain technology</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 2. The role of regulation in driving adoption.&nbsp; 



<p>Regulations can act as a major accelerator for digital signature adoption. Despite different national laws dictating specific requirements, which can make it difficult to scale and expand, regulations like Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS) can serve to simplify the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, although compliance requirements may vary across countries, along with accepted types of identification documents, being able to offer as consistent a user experience is vital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrary to popular belief, the goals of regulators, compliance bodies and businesses are more aligned than people may think. As such, it’s important to embrace solutions that address the needs and challenges of both sides. Integrating a digital signature QES solution can be a great example of this as it not only complies with regulations but also leads to better conversions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 3. Importance of trust in the digital economy.&nbsp; 



<p>In the ‘offline’ world, customs like shaking hands and looking one another in the eye go some way to establishing trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In financial services, trust is essential, regardless of whether online or off. If a financial institution loses the trust of its customers, it will have a knock-on effect on its reputation and bottom line. Companies must also trust their solution providers so they, in turn, can trust their customers and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Trust is built by being open and offering a good user experience and accessibility, so people want to adopt the solution. That is the foundation of a successful trust process.</p> Uwe Pfizenmaier, Director Product Management VideoIdent/eSign at IDnow </blockquote>



<p>As digital signatures deal with the exchange of personal data between businesses and users, companies need to treat the data with utmost care, while providing customers with the support they need.&nbsp;</p>

 4. Impact of eIDAS 2.0 regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0</a> will address weaknesses in the first iteration of eIDAS, offering better data protection and a more harmonized proof of identity. It will also likely usher in a new era of safer and more secure digital signatures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more forward-thinking financial services players should see new regulations, technology (e.g. artificial intelligence) and solutions (digital wallets) as opportunities to future-proof processes and ultimately increase conversions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 5. Future of digital signatures.&nbsp; 



<p>To thrive in an ever-changing market, businesses must be quick to adapt to new developments and integrate new technologies to optimize products and processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Implementing technologies like biometrics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics will improve trust and bolster security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In markets such as Germany,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">eID</a> will play a major role in the future of identification and digital signing, which will assist in the advancement of digital fingerprints. A huge shift is expected for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/digital-identity-what-is-it/">digital identity</a> as more countries prepare for the delivery of a digital ID. Therefore, it is important for companies to partner with solution providers like IDnow to onboard users and facilitate the conclusion of contracts in a user-friendly way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as always, as companies experiment with technology and launch new processes like biometric checks and AI, they need to be mindful of new and even more inventive fraud attacks.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In this episode, Matthias and Alexei explore the urgent need for organizations to prepare for the coming age of quantum computing and the potential risks it poses to current cryptographic standards. As quantum technology advances, traditional encryption methods may become vulnerable, putting critical data, transactions, and security at risk.</p>
<p>Alexei discusses the concept of crypto agility—the ability to quickly adapt cryptographic infrastructure in response to new threats.&nbsp;He shares practical advice on how to assess and update legacy systems, encryption methods, and workflows, including:</p>
 
 Where organizations should begin if they rely heavily on cryptography for critical data and transactions 
 How to evaluate and improve cryptographic infrastructure across digital systems, cloud environments, and hardware 
 The essential role of vendor collaboration and supply chain security in building quantum-safe systems 
 How to prioritize threats like ransomware and crypto-related risks based on industry needs 
 
<p>Alexei also underscores the importance of workforce training, advising that while employees don’t need deep cryptography knowledge, they must understand secure practices and tools approved by their organization’s security policy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/surviving-the-cryptocalypse"></a>

 Keren Weitzberg &amp; Aaron&nbsp;Martin <p>AI is on everyone’s lips. So perhaps it’s not surprising that <a href="https://www.biometricsinstitute.org/event/biometrics-institute-congress-and-side-events-2024/">this year’s Biometrics Institute Congress</a> was filled with much hand-wringing about AI. A self-described “non-profit,” the Biometrics Institute is probably best understood as part industry lobbying group, part think tank, part research institute. Each year, it holds a conference in London, which brings together policymakers, vendors, regulators, privacy rights groups, and the occasional not-so-undercover academic (like ourselves).</p><p>Here are some of our key insights from this year’s congress:</p> Biometric vendors are currently debating how to define themselves vis-a-vis AI and how to engage with the current AI hype&nbsp;cycle <p>“AI” is a notoriously slippery term, so much so that scholars, civil society groups, and policymakers continue to argue over its <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2022/10/one-of-the-biggest-problems-in-regulating-ai-is-agreeing-on-a-definition?lang=en">very definition</a>. Such debates are not purely semantic; rather, they shape how an industry is regulated, how it approaches funders and clients, how it is publicly understood, and how it understands itself. In their annual ‘<a href="https://www.biometricsinstitute.org/state-of-biometrics-report-2024/">state of the industry’ report</a>, the Biometric Institute tackles this question, asking <a href="https://x.com/BiometricsInst/status/1852365480574730340">“To AI or not to AI”</a>? (We would attempt to summarize the key points for blog readers but alas it is proprietary knowledge that is only available to paid members…) At the Congress, panelists and keynote speakers raised what seemed almost existential and ontological questions. One session, for example, was entitled “What is the relationship between AI and biometrics?”</p><p>From one perspective, the relationship between AI and biometrics may seem obvious: AI is expected to enhance the functionality of identity checks. Thanks to machine learning and artificial neural networks, biometric systems have become <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/artificial-intelligence-biometrics-irreversible-couple-veridas-yfhtf/">far more accurate and precise </a>in recent years, improving their technical performance and increasing their spread and market share. More recently, generative AI is posing new risks and vulnerabilities for the sector, including sophisticated forms of synthetic identity fraud, such as <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5362102/">face morphing</a>, which has the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202409/fraunhofer-develops-a-system-to-address-face-morphing-attacks-in-border-control">potential</a> to disrupt the security of the travel sector. OpenAI’s release of its real-time voice API, for example, has renewed alarms about fraudsters <a href="https://x.com/BiometricUpdate/status/1851739442547224825">circumventing voice recognition software</a>.</p><p>But AI is also part of a powerful tech and regulatory imaginary. At the Congress, AI seemed less a technology (or set of technologies) to be adopted than a loaded, polyvalent term to be contended with. Generating a kind of “hyperreality,” AI seems to be everything and nothing at once, invoking both dystopian and utopian futures, producing vociferous proponents, equally vocal detractors, and a growing (if sometimes quieter and more measured) group of skeptics.</p><p>The biometrics industry has long been anxious with its public reputation, particularly in the wake of a string of controversies over <a href="https://amnesty.ca/features/racial-bias-in-facial-recognition-algorithms/#:~:text=Facial%20recognition%20is%20less%20accurate,positive%20matches%20in%20image%20databases.">encoded racism</a> within facial recognition algorithms and in light of mounting resistance to the use of biometric systems for policing, migration control, and <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/4528/biometrics-collection-under-pretext-counter-terrorism">state repression</a>. A <a href="https://www.biometricsinstitute.org/congress-to-tackle-risks-of-ai-and-facial-recognition/">recent industry survey</a> by the Biometrics Institute revealed concerns that public mistrust with AI would spill over into the sector, further inflaming public opinion: “A significant 80% of respondents believe public opinion on AI will directly impact their views on biometrics. This highlights the need to address public concerns about AI to build trust in biometric applications.” This is one of many reasons why vendors and clients may seek to distance themselves from the AI moniker, or at least carefully navigate how they relate to the capacious and ambiguous term.</p> Regulators and industry are not necessarily at odds with one&nbsp;another <p>The Biometrics Institute is a space of engagement — one where regulators and industry can speak productively and where regulators can make a case for compliance. This is in contrast to common understandings about the relationship between regulation and business, whereby the regulators are thought to be adversarial and mistrusting of industry operators.</p><p>Several representatives of governmental regulatory bodies were in attendance at this year’s Congress, including the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Other key public stakeholders in attendance were the EU’s DG CNECT, which oversees the EU’s AI Act, and the Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties at the US Department of Justice. The tone struck in their presentations was one of cooperation and assistance. As John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, told the audience, “we are on the same side.” Emphasizing that the UK is a space where biometric technologies can flourish, he argued that regulators can help industry: “We want you to be able to use biometric data that add value to society and protect people’s privacy.”</p><p>This is not necessarily a story of regulatory capture, but it does speak to the way that industry and regulatory bodies are actively shaping one another. It certainly reflects an increasingly accepted mode of regulation that emphasizes cooperation and highlights the benefits of technological innovation, potentially at the expense of fundamental rights protection.</p> Rather than restrict biometric use cases, AI regulations may, in the long run, facilitate (and legitimate) their&nbsp;spread <p>Rather than necessarily inhibiting the biometrics industry, AI regulation can help the sector identify and manage risk, benefiting corporate players. Take, for example, the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a>, which has recently begun to come into force. Several presentations at the Congress were devoted to the new Act and its implications for industry. Irina Orssich, Head of Sector AI Policy at DG CNECT, explained that the Act takes a risk-based approach to biometrics. It divides use cases into a taxonomy of risk — from unacceptable to high-risk to limited to low/minimal risk. Compliance with the EU AI Act and adoption of this taxonomy can be seen as a form of risk mitigation — a means for companies to limit their liability and exposure in ways that will keep regulators at bay. Importantly, however, it also legitimates those applications that are deemed to be less risky according to the&nbsp;rules.</p><p>“Besides minimising risks,”<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17579961.2021.1898300"> notes legal scholar Nathalie Smuha</a>, “regulation could facilitate AI’s uptake, boost legal certainty, and hence also contribute to advancing countries’ position in the…‘race to AI.’” The same could be said about biometrics and how emerging regulations will facilitate their further adoption and acceptance in different contexts, including consumer applications and more security-oriented spaces like borders. It is therefore incumbent upon critical voices to assess how regulators, and the rules they are mandated to enforce, further entrench biometrics in our everyday lives (whether or not they are ultimately understood to be AI) and the implications of this legitimization for our societies and polities.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/to-ai-or-not-to-ai-insights-from-the-biometrics-institute-congress-2024-0e2668418bd3">To AI or Not to AI?

 This Month in Digital Identity — November&nbsp;Edition <p>Welcome to the November edition of our monthly digital identity series! This month, we’re diving into essential advancements shaping digital identity and the future of secure verification. Discover key updates on the European Digital Identity Wallet, the latest approaches to mobile driver’s license verification, and how deepfake detection is evolving to tackle growing threats. Plus, we’ll explore Jumio’s innovative biometric liveness detection and its role in combating identity&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at what you’ll find in this month’s insights:</p> The EUDI&nbsp;Wallet <p>The European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet is a transformative initiative designed to provide EU citizens with a secure, self-sovereign digital identity solution. This wallet enables individuals to manage their identity information independently, ensuring privacy and security in online interactions. By facilitating access to essential services such as banking, healthcare, and governmental applications, the EUDI Wallet promises to streamline daily life and foster a more inclusive digital&nbsp;economy.</p><p>However, its implementation faces several significant challenges. Firstly, robust cybersecurity measures are crucial to prevent identity theft and data breaches, which could undermine user trust. Secondly, achieving regulatory harmonization across diverse EU member states is essential, as different countries have unique legal frameworks and privacy regulations. Without a unified approach, the wallet’s effectiveness could be compromised, leading to confusion among users and service providers alike.</p><p>Collaboration among various stakeholders—including government agencies, technology providers, and civil society—will be pivotal in overcoming these hurdles. By establishing clear standards for security, interoperability, and user experience, the EUDI Wallet can become a reliable tool that empowers citizens while safeguarding their data. Ultimately, its success will hinge on building public trust and ensuring that the system is user-friendly, accessible, and compliant with the highest privacy standards.</p> mDL Verification <p>The emergence of mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) signifies a significant shift in identity verification, presenting both opportunities and challenges for users and authorities. mDLs offer a modern alternative to traditional physical licenses, allowing users to carry their identification securely on their smartphones. This technological advancement aims to streamline the verification process for a wide range of services, from travel to online transactions.</p><p>However, the implementation of mDLs is fraught with challenges. One primary concern is the need for secure and intuitive verification processes that maintain user confidence while preventing identity fraud. Additionally, the lack of uniformity in regulations across different states poses a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Each state has its own legal standards and technical requirements, complicating interoperability and making it difficult for users to rely on their mDLs outside their home jurisdictions.</p><p>Privacy is another critical issue, as users must be assured that their personal information will remain secure and confidential. Striking a balance between robust security measures and a seamless user experience is essential for gaining public acceptance.</p><p>To facilitate the successful rollout of mDLs, continuous collaboration among stakeholders — including government agencies, technology developers, and consumers — is vital. By establishing best practices and regulatory frameworks, stakeholders can ensure that mDLs become a trusted and widely accepted form of identification, paving the way for a more secure and efficient digital identity landscape.</p> Deepfake Detection <p>The rise of deepfake technology presents significant challenges to the authenticity of digital content, raising concerns about misinformation and trust in media. Deepfakes utilize advanced artificial intelligence to create highly realistic but fabricated videos and audio, making it increasingly difficult for viewers to discern truth from deception. As this technology becomes more sophisticated, the need for effective detection methods becomes paramount.</p><p>Various techniques are being developed to identify deepfakes, focusing on detecting subtle inconsistencies that can indicate manipulation. These methods include analyzing facial movements, lighting discrepancies, and unnatural expressions, which may signal that a video has been altered. As detection technologies evolve, they must continuously adapt to keep pace with advances in deepfake creation.</p><p>A multi-pronged approach is essential to mitigate the risks associated with deepfakes. This involves not only developing robust technological solutions but also enhancing public awareness about the existence and implications of deepfakes. Educating consumers on how to recognize manipulated content is critical in fostering a more discerning audience that can critically evaluate the media they&nbsp;consume.</p><p>Regulatory measures also play a crucial role in addressing the challenges posed by deepfakes. Policymakers must consider ethical guidelines and legal frameworks that govern the creation and dissemination of synthetic media. By promoting transparency and accountability in digital content creation, society can better safeguard against the potential harms of deepfakes while preserving the integrity of visual communication.</p> Jumio’s Biometric Liveness Detection <p>Jumio’s development of in-house biometric liveness detection technology represents a significant leap forward in identity verification. As identity fraud becomes more prevalent, this innovative solution uses sophisticated artificial intelligence to accurately differentiate between genuine biometric data—such as facial recognition—and spoofing attempts, including photographs or masks. This capability is crucial for enhancing security in online transactions and customer onboarding processes.</p><p>The liveness detection technology analyzes various data points in real time, assessing factors such as facial movements and eye interactions to determine whether the biometric input is from a live person. By integrating this technology into their identity verification offerings, Jumio aims to provide organizations with a more reliable means of preventing identity theft and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Moreover, as the digital landscape evolves, the demand for effective biometric verification solutions is increasing. Organizations must navigate the dual challenge of enhancing security while ensuring a smooth user experience. Jumio’s biometric liveness detection addresses this need, positioning the company as a leader in the identity verification market.</p><p>In an environment where digital interactions are ubiquitous, establishing trust in online transactions is paramount. By offering advanced biometric solutions, Jumio is helping to build confidence among consumers and organizations alike, making it easier to engage in secure digital commerce.

				  Trust Alliance New Zealand’s Digital Farm Wallet, co-developed by Indicio and Anonyme Labs, wins “Digital Safety, Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity” award. This is the second time Indicio’s Verifiable Credential technology has won a SuperNova Award. 
<p><a href="https://trustalliance.co.nz/">Trust Alliance New Zealand</a> (TANZ), a non-profit industry consortium representing farmers and other agriculture-chain stakeholders, has won one of the most prestigious awards in technology, a <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/events/supernova/2024">Constellation SuperNova Award</a>. The awards recognize business transformation, and TANZ won in the category of Digital Safety, Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity.</p>
<p>TANZ’s Digital Farm Wallet uses Verifiable Credentials to create a data-sharing ecosystem for producers, growers, exporters, retailers &amp; consumers. This allows farmers to hold data around emissions, land, water usage, and be able to share it directly and securely with reliant parties, removing the need for large databases or the need to manually keep sending the same information over and over again.</p>
<p>This project and technology is transformational for anyone working in agriculture. The ability to directly share authenticated information between farmers and distributors in a secure, privacy-preserving way realized significant cost benefits in the trial. Farmers spent less time on form-filling and data management and more time farming. In the future, it represents a more streamlined, transparent supply chain, one where farmers have the ability to not only promise organic or green growing practices, but where the consumers can verify the claims for themselves using credentials at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about the project and see the technology in action you can watch an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzd99h3lmNU">in-depth video here.</a></p>
<p>This is the second time an Indicio customer has won a SuperNova Award. The <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-wins-the-supernova-award-from-constellation-research-for-disruptive-technology-leadership-in-digital-safety-governance-and-privacy/">first</a> was in 2022 for technology that went on to support the launch of <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/">Digital Travel Credentials.</a></p>
<p>“Digital Agriculture is ripe for revolution using decentralized identity. We’ve shown that the Digital Farm Wallet delivers real, tangible economic benefits to farmers, and with our technology and the depth of its capabilities and features, we see Verifiable Credentials as being a game-changer in the global agricultural value chain,”</p>
<p>said Indicio CEO Heather Dahl. “Land, sea, air, public sector and private sector —&nbsp;there is nowhere our solutions aren’t driving digital transformation, and that’s because our technology makes sharing information smoother, faster, and more secure,”</p>

<p><br>
[30 October 2024, Bangkok]</p>
<p>Northern Block, in collaboration with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and key industry partners, has demonstrated that the future of air travel is digital. In a groundbreaking proof-of-concept (PoC), two passengers completed a fully digital, round-trip journey between Hong Kong and Tokyo on October 21 and 22, using digital wallets and travel credentials to navigate airport processes seamlessly.</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve achieved something unprecedented here, extending beyond technical trust to build an ecosystem that is secure, reliable, and user-friendly at every stage,” said Mathieu Glaude, CEO of Northern Block.</p></blockquote>
<p>This PoC demonstrated an unparalleled level of interoperability, bringing together over five technology solution providers and supporting more than five distinct types of digital credentials. Two different digital wallets offered an excellent user experience, while the inclusion of a trust registry provided assurance that each credential came from an authorized issuer, reinforcing trust across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>
</p>  <p></p>
 Highlighting Northern Block’s Role in Credential Verification and Trust Registries 
<p>Northern Block played a pivotal role by providing Cathay Pacific with its Orbit Enterprise Credentialing API for credential verification, along with an Orbit Trust Registry instance that allowed verifiers to confirm issuer authority, ensuring credential legitimacy throughout the passenger journey. Trust registries are foundational in communicating credential issuer conformance against an ecosystem governance framework, enhancing the integrity of each interaction. By verifying that every credential originates from an authorized issuer, the trust registry establishes a layer of trust that goes beyond technical requirements, embedding governance principles at every step.</p>
<p></p>
 Standards-Based Interoperability: Key to a Seamless Experience 
<p>This PoC demonstrated technical standards critical to enabling credential exchange and trust registry functionality. By aligning with IATA’s Technical Interoperability Profile, Northern Block and other vendors adhered to credential exchange protocols like OpenID for Verifiable Credentials, credential formats such as SD-JWT VC, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) such as did:web, and more. This alignment ensured that diverse solutions could operate seamlessly in a live, international airport setting.</p>
<p>For the trust registry, the Trust over IP’s Trust Registry Query Protocol (TRQP) allowed verifiers to confirm issuer statuses quickly and reliably, supporting real-time decision-making and building confidence across the open ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
 Highlights of the Proof-of-Concept<p></p>
<p></p> 
 
  Digital Identity and Biometrics: A Fully Digital Travel Experience<br>
Biometric verification paired with digital credentials allowed travelers to navigate airport processes, including check-in and boarding, without presenting physical documents. 
 
 
  Credential Verification and Interoperability<br>
Northern Block’s Credential Exchange API enabled Cathay Pacific to verify credentials, and industry-standard VCs, such as boarding passes and visa credentials, were integrated seamlessly using multiple vendor solutions. 
 
 
  Trusted Issuer Verification with Trust Registry<br>
The trust registry verified each credential’s issuer authority, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of credentials from multiple issuers. By leveraging standards, this PoC demonstrates that digital credentials can be trusted and accepted across jurisdictions. 
 
 
  IATA’s Open API Hub: A Gateway for Digital Travel<br>
Now accessible in IATA’s <a href="https://api.developer.iata.org/collection/digital-identity">Open API Hub</a>, Northern Block’s Credential Exchange API offers air travel stakeholders the infrastructure to support digital credentials and enhance the travel experience.<p></p>
<p></p> 
 
 Moving Forward 
<p>As we see more adoption of digital credentials, trust registries are becoming a foundational trust establishment infrastructure. They will help to enhance the travel journey, and enable value creation in retailing, service delivery, and across the whole partner value chain. We invite you to join us in future projects as we continue to push towards digital transformation of the airline industry together.</p>

<p>Whenever I explore technology that's new to me, whether it be learning how decentralized apps work or what an open source tool does, it's seeing the technology in action that helps me understand whether or not it can impact me and my every day life. This is why every month at TBD, what better way to learn about our technology in action than from innovators using TBD's technologies today.</p>

<p>As our open source projects continue to develop, our community members contribute to the global effort of decentralizing the web with their independent projects. Here are the latest contributions from them.</p>

 
  
  
  Ariton

  <p>Have you ever watched a creator’s video and thought, "Where did she get that top?" or "I need that protein powder"? You scroll through the comments, only to see the infamous "link in my bio" comment. You rush to click the link, and you're hit with-page not found 😒. I remember once being so desperate that I took a screenshot of the item and reverse-searched it on Google Images. I found something similar but not what I wanted. SO frustrating. Eventually, I gave up and kept on scrolling.</p>

<p>Now, imagine how many potential sales that creator lost because a third-party platform’s server was down. Their metrics won't even reflect those missed opportunities, making it harder to secure brand deals. Who actually has time for that? That’s when I realized I could use <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> to create my own decentralized link hub utilizing service endpoints. With this setup, all my links and contact info are stored in one place—owned and controlled by me. Even if a service that houses all my links goes down, my links will always be accessible because they’re not reliant on any external platforms to display them. I’m sharing this in hopes that fellow creators won’t miss out on potential brand deals, and I won't have to cry over a top I never got to buy.</p>

<p>Before I show you exactly how you can create your own decentralized link hub, lets answer some of the questions you're probably asking yourself. </p>

 
  
  
  What are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)?
 

<p>So, what exactly is a Decentralized Identifier, or DID? Think of it as your username—the one source of truth for everything you do online—except this one is owned and controlled entirely by you. It’s a unique "address", thats verifiable and doesn’t rely on any central authority like Facebook, Google, or any other service. Instead, DIDs give you the freedom to manage your own identity online, without needing to trust a single platform to store or validate your information.</p>

<p>In the context of a decentralized link hub, your DID becomes the hub for all your important links. It’s not tied to any third-party service, which means you never have to worry about followers scrolling simply because your link page isn't working. When you update your links, you only need to do it once, as they're tied to your DID—so they stay consistent across all your social platforms, giving you full control. When you update your links, they stay up-to-date across the web because again they’re tied to your DID—giving you full control.</p>

 
  
  
  How are Service Endpoints going to help me?
 

<p>Now, let’s cover what service endpoints are. These might sound technical, but they’re actually pretty simple—think of them like your digital address/phone book. Remember those huge yellow books you used to sit on at the hair salon? They were filled with phone numbers and addresses, making it easy to find and contact people. Well, service endpoints are kind of like that, except they’re the digital "addresses" for different parts of your online identity. These could be links to your Instagram profile, website, direct messages, or even your affiliate links.</p>

<p>These endpoints live in your <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/did_documents#what-is-a-did-document">DID document</a>. So instead of relying on centralized services like Linktree, your DID acts as the home for all your important links. So when someone <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-resolve-a-did">resolves your DID</a>, they can access the service endpoints that you’ve decided to share.</p>

<p>You can also easily update and delete these links anytime you need to again without relying on any third-party platform to keep those connections working.</p>

 
  
  
  The fix: let's create a decentralized Link Hub
 

<p>If you’re more of a visual learner, check out my <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/knYteCFYuno">YouTube short</a> where I show you exactly how. For this example we're going to create a DID with two service endpoints. One pointing to my LinkedIn and the other pointing to my X profile. </p>

<p>Step 1: Import <code>web5/dids</code> package<br>
</p>

 
 <code>import {DidDht} from '@web5/dids'
</code> 

 



<p>Step 2: Create DID with service endpoints<br>
</p>

 
 <code>const myBearerDid = await DidDht.create({
    options:{
        publish: true,
        services: [
            {
                id: 'LinkedIn',
                type: 'professional',
                serviceEndpoint: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebonylouis'
            },
            {
                id: 'X',
                type: 'personal',
                serviceEndpoint: 'https://x.com/EbonyJLouis'
            }
        ]
    }
});
</code> 

 



<p>Now that we've created your DID with service endpoints leading to your LinkedIn and X profiles.</p>

<p>Step 3: Lets print our entire DID also know as a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/glossary/#bearer-did">BearerDid</a> to see our DID document where these service endpoints can be found:<br>
</p>

 
 <code>console.log(myBearerDid)
</code> 

 



<blockquote>
<p>It is important to never share your full BearerDID, it contains private keys that only you should have access to. The holder of these keys can perform private key operations, like signing data. Check out this <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/key-management">Key Management Guide</a> to learn how to properly manage your DID keys. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Output:<br>
</p>

 
 <code>my bearerDid BearerDid {
  uri: 'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey',
  document: {
    id: 'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey',
    verificationMethod: [ [Object] ],
    authentication: [
      'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey#0'
    ],
    assertionMethod: [
      'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey#0'
    ],
    capabilityDelegation: [
      'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey#0'
    ],
    capabilityInvocation: [
      'did:dht:auontpd44i6rrzrmwry7hsbq8p5seqo7xyz8tnr7fdygsmhykoey#0'
    ],
    service: [ [Object], [Object] ]
  },
  metadata: { published: true, versionId: '1729705713' },
  keyManager: LocalKeyManager {
    _algorithmInstances: Map(1) {
      [class EdDsaAlgorithm extends CryptoAlgorithm] =&gt; EdDsaAlgorithm {}
    },
    _keyStore: MemoryStore { store: [Map] }
  }
}
</code> 

 



<p>This output contains your DID string(uri) thats your "username" along with the services array and some authentication and verification methods. To learn more refer to this <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/did_documents">DID Document</a> Guide. </p>

<p>Step 4: Now lets look closely at just our <code>serviceEndpoint</code> array:<br>
</p>

 
 <code>console.log("personal link hub", myBearerDid.document.service || "No Services Found");
</code> 

 



<p>Output:<br>
</p>

 
 <code>decentralized link hub [
  {
    id: 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y#LinkedIn',
    type: 'professional',
    serviceEndpoint: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebonylouis'
  },
  {
    id: 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y#X',
    type: 'personal',
    serviceEndpoint: 'https://x.com/EbonyJLouis'
  }
]
</code> 

 



 
  
  
  How do I share these links?
 

<p>Now that your DID is in your bio, how do your followers access your links? It's simple- they just need to <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-resolve-a-did">resolve your DID</a> to see a full list of your shared links: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The resolving of your DID will differ depending on the <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/glossary#did-method">DID method</a> used to create the DID. In this example we are using the <code>DHT</code> DID method:<br>
</p>
</blockquote>

 
 <code>// DID in your bio
const didDhtUri = 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y'

// resolve the DID
const resolvedDhtDid = await DidDht.resolve(didDhtUri);

// access the DID Document's service links
const dhtDidDocument = resolvedDhtDid.didDocument.service;

console.log(dhtDidDocument)
</code> 

 



<p>Output:<br>
</p>

 
 <code>[
  {
    id: 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y#LinkedIn#LinkedIn',
    type: 'professional',
    serviceEndpoint: [ 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebonylouis' ]
  },
  {
    id: 'did:dht:xihb478dd7w9cyj33b6g5cjriuw6drwaxrx9ppf3bwn839pmhi6y#LinkedIn#X',
    type: 'personal',
    serviceEndpoint: [ 'https://x.com/EbonyJLouis' ]
  }
]
</code> 

 



<p>As you can see, we’ve succesfully set up our service endpoints to point to both my LinkedIn and X accounts. Now it’s your turn to secure the bag, create your own decentralized Link hub! And if you tweet about it, don’t forget to tag me.</p>

<p>In the evolving digital landscape, the interplay between artificial intelligence (AI) and identity &amp; access management (IAM) will become increasingly critical. As AI continues to shape the future of technology, its role in identity management will expand beyond enhancing security and user experience; conversely, robust identity systems will be essential to the success of AI itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generative AI brings with it amazing opportunities for innovation, automation, and improvements to operational efficiency. However, the security risks inherent in its use are significant if the AI is not appropriately authenticated, authorized, and governed. Authentication and authorization of human users will not be enough going forward – we must also ensure that AI agents are correctly authenticated and authorized. These agents will need to interact with and assist their human counterparts, all within a framework that guarantees lawful, transparent, and efficient operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ping Identity’s vision embraces this dual responsibility: not only harnessing AI to advance identity solutions but also evolving identity frameworks to securely manage the identities and operations of AI agents.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/lp/ac/pinghelix.html">PingHelix</a> is Ping Identity’s new strategic initiative that seeks to embed AI at the core of the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform.html">Ping Identity Platform</a> in a secure and responsible way, paving the way for a future where AI and IAM are inseparable and work together to create a more secure, efficient, and dynamic digital environment.</p>
