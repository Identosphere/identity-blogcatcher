<p>There’s quite a bit of topical variety in this week’s roundup of FindBiometrics’ most popular stories, though it’s fair to say that future-gazing is a subtle theme.</p>



<p>For example, readers showed a lot of interest in a report on the future of the iPhone, as is often the case when it comes to Apple speculation. In a recent newsletter, trusted Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman asserted that this year’s iPhone 13 won’t feature an in-display version of Touch ID as many had anticipated, but did say that Apple has been working on the technology for a future device:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iphone-13-wont-feature-in-display-biometrics-despite-apple-rd-report-79072021/">iPhone 13 Won’t Feature In-display Biometrics, Despite Apple R&amp;D: Report</a> 



<p>Zwipe, meanwhile, has its eye on the future of payments. The company delivered the latest sign of momentum for the nascent biometric payment cards concept this week with its announcement that a Tier-1 bank based in Europe was preparing to carry out a pilot using Zwipe’s technology:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-prepares-biometric-card-pilot-with-tier-1-bank-090701/">Zwipe Prepares for Biometric Card Pilot With Tier 1 Bank</a> 



<p>Also popular was some futuristic space news. Virgin Galactic is working with the Italian Air Force and the National Research Council on planning a commercial space flight in which researchers onboard the vessel will be outfitted with spacesuits featuring biometric sensors to measure the effects of microgravity:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/virgin-galactic-researchers-wear-biometric-suits-study-microgravity-effects-090804/">Virgin Galactic Researchers to Wear Biometric Suits in Study of Microgravity Effects</a> 



<p>Looking to the future of surveillance in the UK, the country’s Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner is planning to revise the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice, and has reached out for public comment. Facial recognition specialist has some advice:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/anyvision-ethical-recommendations-uk-surveillance-commissioner-709081/">AnyVision Calls For ‘Empty Database’ in Ethical Recommendations for UK Surveillance Commissioner</a> 



<p>Meanwhile, in the present, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank has launched a selfie-based onboarding system for mobile app users, with a twist. Whereas most selfie onboarding solutions use facial recognition to match the end user to their official ID, ADIB has partnered with the United Arab Emirates’ Ministry of Interior to match customers directly against the latter’s face database:</p>

<p><a href="https://zwipe.com/">Zwipe</a> has received a follow-up order for its biometric payment card solution from an existing customer, signaling growing market interest in the technology.</p>



<p>The company first announced its <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-gets-new-biometric-cards-partner-in-mea-region-805094/">partnership with Inkript</a> in 2019. The latter is a Beirut-based subsidiary of Resource Group, and is certified by Visa and Mastercard. Inkript serves the EMEA region, and ships tens of millions of cards annually.</p>



<p>Following initial pilots, Inkript placed what Zwipe now describes as “a small-scale order” of its Zwipe Pay ONE solution in 2020. Zwipe’s solution is a biometric solution enabling card makers to integrate fingerprint-based authentication into their payment cards, allowing for biometric authorization of transactions.</p>



<p>Now, Inkript has placed a larger order valued at $318,000, with the companies indicating in a statement that they are both “experiencing strong interest from issuers aiming for pilots this year and planning for commercial rollouts in 2022.”</p>



<p>“There is a growing need for sustainable, secure and user-friendly payment solutions in the MEA region, addressing the concerns of both customers and financial institutions,” explained Inkript Managing Director Riad Itani.</p>



<p>For Zwipe, the order offers the latest indication that its focus on the nascent biometric cards market will reap rewards, arriving on the heels of the company’s announcement that an unnamed <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-prepares-biometric-card-pilot-with-tier-1-bank-090701/">Tier-1 bank based in Europe</a> has committed to a biometric payment card pilot using Zwipe’s solution.</p>



<p>“It is encouraging that the early interest shown in Zwipe Pay ONE in the Middle East has now been converted into our first, sizeable order for our product from Inkript,” said Zwipe CEO André Løvestam. “Their willingness to be one of the first smart card manufacturers to bring Zwipe Pay ONE powered biometric cards to issuers and card personalization bureaus in the MEA region demonstrates their leadership in this area.”</p>



<p>Løvestam indicated that Zwipe Pay ONE has passed the major development milestones and obstacles in a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-pay-one-passed-major-milestones-risks-en-route-commercialization-ceo-77202103/">letter to shareholders</a> earlier this summer, suggesting the solution was on track for piloting, certification, and, ultimately, commercialization.</p>

 “The biometric technology will enable convenient user authentication while wearing a smart glasses or headset product, while the eye tracking will help to facilitate interaction with Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality interfaces.” 



  



<p>Amid growing excitement about the Metaverse, iris recognition specialist <a href="https://www.iritech.com/">IriTech</a> is looking to get ahead of the game via a partnership with Patron Co. that will see the two collaborate on a biometric module aimed primarily at smart glasses applications.</p>



<p>The companies’ planned module will feature infrared LEDs, and support both iris recognition and eye tracking capabilities. The biometric technology will enable convenient user authentication while wearing a smart glasses or headset product, while the eye tracking will help to facilitate interaction with Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality interfaces.</p>



<p>Korea-based Patron Co. will handle the manufacturing, having established itself as a specialist in phone antenna and camera module making. IriTech, meanwhile, is well known for its biometric technology, which has been <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iritech-irivault-408301/">used in consumer products</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iritech-provides-iris-scanners-sri-lankan-id-program-after-gaining-mosip-approval-090108/">national ID programs</a>, among other applications; and in a statement announcing the collaboration, the company explained that gaze tracking is a “byproduct” of its biometric tech.</p>



<p>In their announcement, the companies pointed to escalating activity in the emerging Metaverse space, in which major tech companies like “Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia, Fortnite’s owner Epic Games, and even Apple are investing billions of dollars”. </p>



<p>Facebook unveiled its first attempt at <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-unveils-its-first-smart-glasses-2021-09-09/">smart glasses</a> this week. The product of a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/facebook-gearing-up-release-first-set-smart-glasses-080202/">collaboration with Ray-Ban</a>, the smart glasses support music streaming, phone calls, and photo and video capture. The smart glasses don’t yet support the kind of AR/VR capabilities found in Facebook’s Oculus headset, but are generally seen as a step in that direction with respect to everyday wearables.</p>



<p>For IriTech, the trend appears promising, given the applications offered by its biometric technology.</p>



<p>“IriTech has possessed key software components needed for a successful AR/VR/MR device: fast eye-gaze tracking and accurate user identification including Deep Learning technology,” asserted IriTech founder and CEO Dr. Daehoon Kim. “With Patron’s expertise in camera sensor and optics design, we will be able to offer them in a compact and complete hardware and software package for optimal performance and cost.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.proxy.com/">Proxy</a> has forged another high-profile alliance. The San Francisco start-up is best known for its mobile and wearable authentication solutions, and it has entered into a strategic partnership with <a href="https://www.tdk.com/en/index.html">TDK Corporation</a> in an effort to accelerate the development of its identity platform.</p>



  



<p>To that end, TDK Corporation is based in Tokyo, and operates as a top manufacturer of components for electronic devices. Its portfolio includes sensors and ion-lithium batteries, both of which can help improve the performance of wearable and mobile devices. TDK will also be making a financial investment in Proxy, though the two companies did not disclose the size of that monetary contribution.</p>



<p>The sum will supplement the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/proxy-expand-identity-signal-solutions-following-42-million-series-b-funding-032602/">$42 million in Series B funding</a> that Proxy received back in March of 2020. The company has now brought in more than $90 million in total funding, with backing from prominent organizations like Kleiner Perkins, Scale Venture Partners, and Y Combinator.</p>



<p>For its part, TDK indicated that it wants to support start-ups that are working to promote digital and energy transformation. Proxy covers both of those bases, insofar as the company is trying to eliminate the need for plastic cards and replace them with more sustainable mobile ID solutions. In that regard, the company’s app allows people to store an encrypted digital credential on a mobile phone, and it is already working with an original equipment manufacturer to bring that mobile access technology to the enterprise.</p>



<p>“The era of plastic cards is coming to a close” said Proxy Co-Founder and CEO Denis Mars. “Proxy is ushering in a new era that will better protect personal data through self-sovereign identity.”</p>



<p>“We know digital transformation can only continue if people get better control and ownership over their digital identity,” added TDK Corporate Marketing and Incubation GM Michael Pocsatko. “Proxy’s privacy-centric identity platform addresses the challenges and opportunities we have to build a seamless transition between our physical and digital experiences.</p>



<p>According to TDK, its materials, its biometric MEMS sensors, and its wireless offerings will be particularly beneficial to Proxy as the company looks to advance its identity platform. Proxy, meanwhile, strengthened its position in the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/proxy-announces-acquisition-biometric-smart-ring-maker-motiv-042801/">wearables market with its acquisition</a> of the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fitness-tracking-ring-biometric-upgrade-910262/">smart ring maker Motiv</a> in April of 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://vsblty.net/">VSBLTY</a> is one of five companies getting in on the ground floor of Austin GIS. The new start-up will go after large scale Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) projects, and is being launched with $6 million in seed funding from its five founding partners.</p>



  



<p>VSBTLY is one of those five partners, and will be contributing $1 million in Series A Preferred Stock during the initial round. In exchange, VSBLTY will receive a 10 percent stake in Austin GIS, along with preferential rights for dividends, liquidation, and other business doings in the future.</p>



<p>The other founding partners include HCL Technologies and <a href="https://www.techmahindra.com/en-in/">Tech Mahindra</a>, both of which are putting about $1.25 million into the project. That translates to a 13.9 percent share for HCL and a 13.8 percent share for Tech Mahindra. The group is yet to disclose the identities of the final two partners, but revealed that one is a Fortune 500 company and that both will be revealed at a later date.</p>



<p>Austin GIS itself will utilize machine learning and computer vision technologies to try to capture a portion of the emerging IoT and 5G RAN markets. As a founding partner, VSBLTY will serve as the company’s exclusive provider of computer vision tech, and will place a particular emphasis on device and retail and smart city analytic services.</p>



<p>“VSBLTY is excited to be joining other leading global tech companies as partners in this strategic ground floor joint venture,” said VSBLTY Co-founder and CEO Jay Hutton.</p>



<p>Tech Mahindra is already collaborating with VSBLTY to build a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-modelo-move-forward-with-smart-retail-network-latin-america-031501/">massive smart retail network</a> in Latin America. VSBLTY signed an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-looking-solidify-presence-mexico-push-further-into-latin-america-after-signing-a-letter-of-intent-retailigent-media-grupo-modelo-120203/">initial letter of intent</a> with Grupo Modelo, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech-mahindra-signs-on-vsblty-smart-retail-project-latin-america-061006/">Tech Mahindra signed on in June</a> to provide infrastructure and ongoing support services. VSBLTY, meanwhile, recently got <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-joins-otcqb-venture-market-081701/">listed on the OTCQB Venture Market</a> for mid-tier start-ups that are still growing as entrepreneurial entities.</p>

<p>Identity verification specialist Jumio is celebrating its recognition as one of the global leaders in the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning-based applications for the financial services sector via its inclusion in the 2021 AIFintech100 List.</p>



  



<p>The AIFinTech100 list was selected by a panel of industry experts and analysts after a review of over 1,000 fintech companies by research firm FinTech Global, with its purpose being to identify the 100 most innovative companies developing AI applications in financial services.</p>



<p>“The AIFinTech100 is an essential source of information for senior management enabling them to identify the most innovative Artificial Intelligence companies in areas such as Insurance, Banking, Investment &amp; Trading, Lending, Customer Experience, Compliance and Fraud Prevention,” said&nbsp;Richard Sachar, a director of FinTech Global.</p>



<p>Jumio’s inclusion in the list can likely be attributed to its use of a hybrid approach involving AI, machine learning, and biometrics to help organizations combat fraud, while also speeding up the customer onboarding experience and simplifying compliance with regulations.</p>



<p>“AI is built into the core of what we do,” said Labhesh Patel, Jumio CTO and chief scientist. “Being included in the AIFinTech100 list validates our efforts to provide secure, AI-powered solutions for financial services providers to safely onboard customers, confirm user identity and stop fraud in its tracks.”</p>



<p>This announcement caps off what has been a busy and successful summer for Jumio, which included its participation in the first ever <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/interview-jumios-new-cpo-bala-kumar-706218/">FindBiometrics Identity Summit</a> in June, followed by a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-sales-up-150-percent-in-remote-first-q2-economy-707202/">healthy sales performance</a> report, and the appointment of a CMO in late July.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bio-key.com/">BIO-key</a> has picked up another PortalGuard customer in the academic sector. The company has announced that it will be providing identity services for the University of Denver in Colorado.</p>



  



<p>The University of Denver is a private research university with a student population of roughly 12,000 people at the graduate and undergraduate levels. PortalGuard will make it easier for all those students to gain access to the school’s web portal, and to log into other applications and campus resources. In that regard, PortalGuard offers secure Single Sign-on (SSO) capabilities that allow students to gain access to multiple apps from a centralized location.</p>



<p>According to BIO-key, that SSO utility will help support the University’s eventual campus portal migration and deliver a more consistent academic experience for students. The University, meanwhile, indicated that it chose PortalGuard because it is flexible, scalable, and easier to use than other cybersecurity platforms currently on the market.</p>



<p>“We are proud to add the University of Denver, the oldest private research university in the Rocky Mountain Region, to our customer community,” said BIO-key PortalGuard President Mark Cochran. “Our education customers require flexible and cost-effective enterprise-grade access security for critical operations and remote access, as well as to address cybersecurity insurance compliance requirements.”</p>



<p>PortalGuard provides users with multiple authentication options, including several biometric authentication options following the release of the new <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-upgrades-portalguard-with-new-palm-authentication-feature-051003/">PalmPositive palm authentication feature</a> in May. BIO-key has also unveiled a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-extends-portalguard-coverage-with-new-sso-concierge-062306/">new SSO Concierge</a> solution to improve organizational security when using thick client applications.</p>



<p>In the meantime, PortalGuard has proven to be extremely popular with academic institutions. BIO-key has now delivered the solution to schools all over the country, with California’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-deploys-portalguard-rio-hondo-college-060309/">Rio Hondo College</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/mendocino-college-embraces-portalguard-security-041501/">Mendocino Community College</a> and Illinois’ <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-provides-portalguard-southeastern-illinois-college-012705/">Southeastern Illinois College</a> standing as some of the more recent additions to the list. The <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/orange-county-elections-office-supplements-bio-key-fingerprint-scanners-with-portalguard-iam-solution-082706/">Orange County Elections Office in Florida</a> has also supplemented its BIO-key fingerprint scanners with PortalGuard access management for election workers.</p>

<p>Mobile apps are packed with our highly sensitive&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>. But new&nbsp;<a href="https://researchspace.ukzn.ac.za/xmlui/handle/10413/19431">research</a>&nbsp;by South African law lecturer and High Court advocate&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-privacy-by-design-approach-for-mobile-apps-why-its-not-enough-164090">Dusty-Lee Donnelly</a>&nbsp;says privacy by design and other standard privacy protections for mobile app data (the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/08/can-consent-ever-play-a-valuable-role-in-consumer-privacy/">consent model</a>&nbsp;and regulations and compliance) just aren’t enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donnelly takes aim at&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy by design</a>,&nbsp;arguing the interdisciplinary, systems engineering approach based on seven key principles by&nbsp;<a href="https://gpsbydesign.org/who-we-are/">Ann Cavoukian</a>&nbsp;isn’t enough to protect personal data in mobile apps because the “design decisions made by app developers are constrained by existing technologies and platform rules designed by others.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, Donnelly endorses “<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/06-22-2012-privacy-by-redesign-a-practical-framework-for-implementation/">privacy by (re)design</a>, where all roleplayers in the ecosystem take privacy seriously and redesign existing platforms and technologies. But enforcing that approach will require tighter legal regulation of third party data sharing.”</p>



<p><a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/06-22-2012-privacy-by-redesign-a-practical-framework-for-implementation/">Privacy by (re)design</a>&nbsp;is another brainchild of&nbsp;Ann Cavoukian, described as a transformative process that gives organizations a standards-based framework for managing privacy projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where privacy by design puts the onus on app developers to be proactive about data privacy, privacy by (re)design redesigns the&nbsp;“app ecosystem to address data sharing”, spreading the burden. Donnelly gives the example of how most apps transmit data directly to third parties, like Google and Facebook, but that privacy laws don’t adequately address this third party sharing which can leave app developers exposed to liability and users unprotected. Donnelly wants to “close the privacy loop” by making the parties who design the technologies and platforms on which mobile apps are built and marketed legally accountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We agree that, as an app developer, your responsibility for “privacy by design” extends to what you create AND what you consume from an app ecosystem (analytics, advertising, etc). We see privacy by (re)design as a re-definition of where the boundary of responsibility for privacy design ends.&nbsp;As the app publisher, you are ultimately responsible for the data you process, and “ignorance is no excuse.” In a perfect world, services with the potential for introducing privacy risk would be better regulated or regulations would make it easier for an app developer to make good privacy choices, but data is the new oil and perfect worlds rarely materialize.</p>



<p>The existence and success of our consumer app&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;is proof that privacy by design is not widespread enough to provide broad spectrum protection, and that privacy by (re)design is an indirect description of another gap for which MySudo helps a person take back some control.</p>

 An international platform for shared&nbsp;missions <p>This piece was led by a member of the Dark Matter Labs team based in the UK as part of the #BeyondtheRules project, and as such is written in British English and has particular references to contexts in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>This blog was written in August 2021 and reflects our learning at that&nbsp;time.</p> Our Context <p>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs works to accelerate societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and interconnectedness. We focus on the dark matter — the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the world around us, from policy and regulation to finance and data, governance and democratic participation, organisational culture and identity.</p><p>We are a discovery*-based organisation — we enter most of our work not knowing the outcome — and sitting with uncertainty, complexity, and emergence is in every part of our fabric. Indeed, our own ‘dark matter’ and the organisational infrastructures that we build to shape how we show up together is also emergent. These infrastructures have had to rapidly evolve over the last two years while we have grown from 18 people to 55 and spread geographically, with operating vehicles now in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada, South Korea and&nbsp;Sweden.</p><p>We do not seek growth in and of itself but we know that a deeply enhanced scope and range of capabilities is needed to fulfil our missions, even though many of us instinctively have felt apprehensive about this at a time when so much of our internal systems have not felt ‘ready’ for scale. Indeed, we are increasingly accustomed to knowing that much of the work we do we may never feel fully ‘ready’&nbsp;for.</p><p>Through an ongoing pandemic, and the last 20 months has been quite the ride. It has impacted, in different ways, everyone across our team. It sped up the need to find alternative ways to share stories, thoughts, reflections, deep strategies and vulnerabilities in virtual spaces that before didn’t seem possible through a 2D online video square. It required a commitment to learning and intentionally putting the time into our shared relationships and social contract throughout the&nbsp;way.</p><p>It is much of this that defines our context as an organisation and from which the learning that we share here is anchored. In sum, we&nbsp;are:</p>  Mission-led  Focused on discovery* and&nbsp;learning  International with a planetary view  Primarily remote  Evolving constantly  <p>In this 4 part blog series, we’ll share how we’ve been building the organisational infrastructure for this work and what we’re learning:</p>  This blog (1) sets the context of our work and how we’re working towards a platform for DM that is mission-led, planetary in mindset, international in nature, primarily remote and legally compliant.  Blog 2 looks at what’s needed for people to navigate complex, emergent work. In particular, at how we try to compound learning and construct legibility in our&nbsp;systems.  Blog 3 looks at how we are working towards a distributed system of governance through self-management, legal stewardship and other means. It looks at the platform of deep care, security and safety required for&nbsp;this.  Blog 4 looks at how we organise as a team to build organisational infrastructure and the impact that our way of organising has on our ability to do our&nbsp;work.  <p>*We use the term ‘discovery’ tentatively, while trying to find a better term for it, recognising its colonial connotations and&nbsp;history.</p> Led by Planetary Missions <p>Exploring the ‘dark matter’ of our socio-economic systems is complex, interconnected and long-term work. Traditional top-down hierarchical structures of organising and planning are clearly not appropriate for this work. In setting up DML’s structures for organising, we took inspiration from Mariana Mazzucato and IIPP’s Mission Economy work and instigated a way for us to organise around Missions. It guides us to identify core outcomes that we consider critical, which we collaborate on building over the long-term, less swayed by the cycles of funding or projects.</p><p>By example, one of our missions is ‘Nature-Based Solutions’. It aims to provide the infrastructure components for radical collective action to regenerate, enhance and scale natural or modified ecosystems for thriving human and non-human wellbeing. This mission is made up of multiple strands of work which span from micro-actions like <a href="https://magicalmeadows.city/Story">Magical Meadows</a>, a citizens toolbox to facilitate citizens participation in urban greening, all the way to <a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/">Trees As Infrastructure</a>.</p><p>Trees As Infrastructure is a platform to value and invest in nature beyond carbon, which establishes nature as a critical part of urban infrastructure, alongside bridges, roads and rail, enabling investment, profitability and sustainability. An early-stage conceptual model for TreesAI was developed in 2019 with support from EIT Climate-KIC, resulting in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-1dd94e1cfedf">this report</a>. In 2020, the ideas behind these were developed within our Healthy Clean Cities and ReCode work and, alongside, we began working with NatureScot on enabling Nature-based Solutions at scale and building the systemic capacity for establishing regenerative Natural Asset Markets in Scotland, more details can be found in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OdtF45v59Zh7TDDrNRifnp4e6Cl4OIK0/view">published report</a>. In 2021, our work with NatureScot continued and the ideas evolved to include a pilot implementation in Leuven and replication in Madrid &amp; Krakow as part of the LIFE Climate Change Adaptation. As a recent recipient of the Google Impact Challenge on Climate and part of the inaugural Morgan Stanley Sustainable Solutions Collaborative Cohort, we will now be able to start building the technical platform to make the ideas possible in pilot location of Glasgow, more details can be found in our <a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/assets/01.07.21_TreesAI%20in%20Glasgow%20Synopsis.pdf">project synopsis</a>.</p><p>Through these varied projects, we gradually collaborate towards a broader&nbsp;mission.</p><p>We have been working on a framework that visualises these missions in an iterative way which we look forward to sharing in full when in&nbsp;use.</p>Our current framework in progress to visualise DM missions and their sub-projects<p>We recently published a DM Note on what we are learning in organising around missions, which can be read&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-5-50e46540dd05">here</a>.</p> An international platform for&nbsp;missions <p>Dark Matter Labs was born out of <a href="https://www.project00.cc/">Project 00</a> and originated with a (hugely enabling) base in London. With much of the dark matter we explore being transnational, with partners emerging in locations around the world, with missions not being geographically bounded, it was clear that our work couldn’t remain centred in London. It required an international legal platform and multi-skilled people with perspectives from across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The team began to grow internationally before the pandemic and we discussed the need to organise as a team that would be geographically decentralised by default. We didn’t know we would be as strongly incentivised to do so so fast in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>We now — at the start of Sep 2021 — have team members working from 15 countries ranging from India, Canada, Korea, Hong Kong, Hungary, Germany, Scotland, Sweden and more, although still with the largest mass in UK and&nbsp;Europe.</p><p>We currently work on strategic place-based innovation in 12 countries (some at a national level but others at a regional, city or neighbourhood level).</p><p>We knew that moving from being single-location to multi-geography would require us not to create geographical siloes. We would need to work according to the nature of the ‘dark matter’ being explored (with both local and planetary-scale questions entangled within them), enabling a cross-geographical focus whilst embedded in local contexts. Creating a system that allows for free-flowing connection and co-creation across geographies, however, swims upriver against most of the rules that we need to navigate (whilst we welcome some of the intended accountability — and at times, structure — of these&nbsp;rules).</p><p>When it comes to financial decisions, for example, we intend to take most of our decisions from an aggregated whole organisational perspective. This means that whilst we capture information on the financial performance of each legal entity/country in which we operate and we ensure it meets good standards, the information that guides our business model is our shared financial picture. This stops us from focusing on who or where is more sustainable/profitable but rather on ‘is the system thriving?’</p><p>This sits alongside national accounting requirements, for which we use national bookkeeping systems and aggregate the information into a shared picture; meanwhile, our cash flow information and monitoring is captured and shared primarily at an org-wide&nbsp;level.</p><p>Meanwhile, international tax regulations demand that any services delivered by an entity in one country on behalf of an entity in another must charge profits on the service (at internationally agreed thresholds), thus directly creating a client-provider relationship rather than a collaboration partnership across legal entities. We have Transfer Pricing Agreements between all entities to ensure that we comply with tax regulations and are accountable in our different jurisdictions, whilst also not letting the charges between our legal entities dictate the decision-making of how people spend their&nbsp;time.</p><p>In our governance, we have local legal stewards who are embedded in the local place, mixed with actors who take a whole-org perspective and are legal stewards in all DML entities. The finance team, which calculates the transfer pricing figures, have no legal stewardship in any operating companies to avoid conflict of interest.</p><p>Enabling this shift from London-centric to international is also about mental models, cultures, perspectives and contexts. Our team now benefits from an incredible range of cultures, languages, religions, ethnicities, traditions and more. On the organisational/operational level, reflecting this diversity within how we come together — and building towards inclusion and equity across the organisation — is a continuous and evolving&nbsp;process.</p><p>The art of organisational space-holding in general sets much of the cultures of how we come together, of which we will share more practical details in Blog 2 in this series. Our system of self-management (and distributed agency) is also a notable enabler to this work, which will be exploring more in Blog 3 to this&nbsp;series.</p><p>Timezones and language are two everyday areas that are challenging to navigate in this context. Finding a time for all team or cross-geography meetings is challenging when we now have team members in locations from Canada to Europe, India and South Korea, meaning that we span a huge range of timezones.</p>Cross geography timezones for a 9am&nbsp;meeting<p>When we come together - for meetings, shared decisions, connection, retreats - this becomes increasingly challenging to manage logistically.</p><p>Currently, some of our approaches are to hold team sessions with at least 2 timezone options and at times in circulating timezones so that they do not bias the geographical location of the organiser. Small tools - like people having the international clock embedded into their calendar with the different team members timezones showing - also help us to make the shift in habits in considering timezones whenever meetings are arranged.</p>Embedded timezone widget into calendars<p>Our recent hybrid gathering worked around timezones by scheduling a mixture of time all together virtually at the beginning and end of days (respective to geography), alongside time spent locally in-person that groups could self-design according to their&nbsp;flow.</p>Draft schedule of the August 2021 hybrid gathering<p>Language, meanwhile, codes our mental models and biases our framing of a scenario. For those working in their 2nd, 3rd (or more) language or within their first language but outside of cultural tongues, the additional effort and energy required is considerable.</p><p>English is our shared organisational language, which is perhaps to be expected as an international team with origins in London. Yet we know how important the rich diversity of language across the organisation is, including in each of our company locations. Notably, most of our team (more than 70%) speak English as their second, third or fourth language.</p><p>We continue to build ways to enable local languages to be the dominant language where possible, from holding local entity operations meetings in the local language; naming all companies in both English and the local language; translating key work relevant to local contexts into the local language; experimenting with translation headphones and other technology to allow local language led meetings that non-speakers can still understand.</p>DM articles and images in Swedish, Italian, French and&nbsp;Korean<p>As an organisation still with a strong UK, Europe and ‘Global North’ bias (around 85% of our team is resident in Europe) there are embedded biases and defaults towards these geographies, and we know that these will inevitably hinder rather than unleash us. We need to nurture both our capability to do the work that we do and for that work to be responsible to a plurality of perspectives. We intend to further geographically variegate over the coming years and to build on our practices towards equity as we do&nbsp;this.</p> Transnational Payroll and Contracting Areas of external regulation that we recognise we need to comply by and innovate&nbsp;around<p>In building this planetary ecosystem, team contracting and payroll are some of the knottier areas to navigate and a place where the current national-focused rules of the system particularly work in counter-current to our&nbsp;set-up.</p><p>With social security systems largely structured on a national (and federal) basis, having team members distributed around the world and working with mobility is a particularly challenging dance. As we have developed work within other operating countries, and our teams have grown and our contracting with partners become more numerous, we have found it necessary to set up legal entities to enable the payroll platforms and the contractual requirements of partners. Logistically, each investment into a new entity set up is significant (in time, cost, complexity, risk and&nbsp;more).</p><p>Alongside local payroll systems, it requires us to work with international payroll providers to set up payroll systems from these legal entities to other countries where our team is based to ensure that we are meeting the full tax contribution requirements of our network. The investment required into the intermediary providers is higher than the (important) tax contributions themselves and balancing this potential investment against others we wish to prioritise is challenging. For now, we have collectively agreed to invest into particular geographies and gradually grow these, actively setting up infrastructure for partners, companies, contracts, payroll systems and other structures there. Meanwhile, when team members need to join from other geographies (requiring new payrolls and administrative structures to be put in place when they are based outside of those countries) we will invest in that to be possible, but we expect this to be less frequently the&nbsp;case.</p><p>In contracting, the planetary system requires us to ensure that each contract complies with the shared principles of how we work, the national legislation of the contracting local entity and also the national legislation of the person’s country of residence. One of the unfortunate casualties of this complexity is that our ambition to redesign our contracting with one another to a way that deeply reflects how we want to show up together has been put on the backburner as we have had to invest time navigating compliance first. We hope to pick up the more visionary parts to our contracting towards the end of 2021/early 2022 and are grateful to have examples of contracts built by others — such as our valued friends at Civic Square — from which to draw inspiration.</p> Pay as a foundation <p>How we organise pay and how we contract with our team is a critical part of how we build a distributed international ecosystem. We have intentionally designed our pay and contracting systems to date in a way that is set up to avoid pay functioning as an incentive or a reward for work done or for rank, and instead tries to build it as a liberating structure to take financial worries off the&nbsp;table.</p>Our current pay formula (GBP&nbsp;version)<p>The proxy of experience (years of all experience as an adult) is intended as an (admittedly imperfect and only loosely correlated, with outliers) proxy for life costs, or a form of minimum basic income. This means that no matter where you are based geographically, and whatever role you play in the organisation and how that changes, we all share the same pay&nbsp;formula.</p><p>One of the projects we have had the benefit of taking part in — <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-e3ab44f0dc3">Beyond the Rules</a> — undertook an exploration into Reimagining Pay, researching examples and hosting 50+ people in March 2021, from which the recording is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UxESJiYrt42Ei-Ds7vCoCC2Z3dq6x33y/view?usp=sharing">available here</a>. Its <a href="https://www.notion.so/darkmatterlabs/Framing-Provocation-Reimagining-the-Wage-1d2140e1fb1d42efa55a00cd3bbd2f57#7916748318e84236845ee8e0568ee960">framing provocation</a> shares more about why we might need to reimagine how we structure pay and for what&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>In exploring these pay options it is interesting to see that whilst the law protects against demographic discrimination of various types in pay (such as in the Equality Act 2010 in the UK), it does not protect against the inherent discrimination structurally baked into our current economic system. Traditional pay structures bias types of experience (e.g. expensive higher education), types of social capital (e.g. networks that open doors to opportunities) and other factors that are intrinsically linked to systemic privilege.</p><p>For Dark Matter Labs, ‘<a href="https://www.notion.so/darkmatterlabs/Framing-Provocation-Reimagining-the-Wage-1d2140e1fb1d42efa55a00cd3bbd2f57#7916748318e84236845ee8e0568ee960">Reimagining Pay</a>’ brought up various questions such&nbsp;as:</p>  Whilst the pay formula provides a proxy for living costs, which on the macro level is fairly correlative, for some it really isn’t, and when it isn’t, it can be problematic to the point of very talented people not being able to thrive with&nbsp;us.  It doesn’t allow for any consideration of the historical systems that we are part of, who has been structurally divested from and thus what historic equality and justice looks like in pay. For example, it doesn’t take into account differences in intergenerational wealth and how that makes flat pay inherently problematic (the brilliant Farzana Khan eloquently speaks on&nbsp;this).  <p>Following the learning from Reimagining Pay, we recently discussed an alternative structure for pay, which tries to find the unique sweet spot for pay for each individual that is regenerative for both the system and for the&nbsp;self.</p><p>This approach might involve a facilitated self-reflective process to help people to (anonymously) establish an outline of where that sweet spot is for&nbsp;them.</p><p>The process invites each of us to reflect in private on the intersectional systems of privilege and injustice that we are each part of; our historical investment into the work of societal transition; how we show up in our setting; and our personal financial needs (chosen and unchosen).</p><p>The process would happen confidentially, however data would be aggregated and disaggregated by certain factors allowing the group to discuss and review pay ratios and fairness across the system and assess total needs against budget, in&nbsp;rounds.</p><p>At DM we recently discussed this approach, prior to which we collectively reviewed how we want to reinvest earnings into the system, including how much we intend to reinvest back into pay in the coming&nbsp;year.</p>Miro screenshot from our shard session on how we organise around finances at the August DM gathering<p>We are currently exploring how this iteration of pay might manifest, yet we’re aware this is the start of a journey of self-reflection and will take time. Some of what’s outlined above can be naturally uncomfortable to question in our own lives, and for some is not a reflection they are used to. We are working together on a pathway from our current system towards the principles that are embedded in this model, and we will be happy to share in due course how it&nbsp;goes.</p><p>If you would like to receive updates (every few weeks/months) about the #BeyondtheRules project you can do so via <a href="https://dark-matter-labs.typeform.com/to/jpm8rdp1?typeform-source=provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">this short form</a>.

Maarten Stultjens, VP Corporate Development at OneWelcome is to partake in a panel discussion entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4600/1" title="Identity, Privacy, Security - The European Perspective"> Identity, Privacy, Security - The European Perspective</a> on Monday, September 13 starting at 15:50 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Maarten some questions about what he will bring to the panel.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are differences in Digital Identity between US and Europe. What is the bigger picture?</p>
<p>
Yeah, well, I think as the first step we have to look at some global initiatives that are taking place in business. And if I have to mention two main things that are happening, one is the gig economy where the relationship between employees and the employer is changing. That employees are much more flexible and that a lot of the work is being outsourced and outsourcing can be done anywhere. And the second thing that is happening is that we are working towards anything as a service. We're used to software as a service, especially here in the IT industry, but we're also very familiar at the moment with car as a service. </p>
<p>And, one of our customers is also thinking of moving to ship as a service. So rather than buying a ship, you just pay for operating hours of such a ship. Well, these changes lead to changes in IT, it increases the dependency on IT. It leads to dominance of certain platforms in IT. Think of Amazon, Google, Microsoft - it leads to globalization. And of course, as a result, it also requires a higher interoperability. So, these things strongly influence the changes in digital Identity.   </p>

<p><br></p>
<p> What are challenges between the different aspects of Digital Identity?  </p>
<p>
With these changes with the gig economy and anything as a service - or I already mentioned that there is a bigger dependency on IT, and on the big tech providers. And there are some concerns, and these concerns result in the behavior of these organizations, not only in how they treat our privacy, but also in taxation or in copyright protection. And also, think of the data sovereignty that we want to have here in Europe, where we have seen that the US has implemented the Cloud Act in 2018. We are very aware here in this geography of privacy and we have developed the GDPR and adopted the GDPR and beyond GDPR, there will be other rules and regulations like privacy.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are in a very fragmented landscape here where interoperability is not so easy. So, if you look for example, at data residency, then, in the past we had the Safe Harbor agreement back in 2015, it was invalidated. And as a follow up of the Safe Harbor agreement, there was the privacy shield agreement that again was invalidated last year, known as the Schrems II outcome. And currently, in the EU, we are working towards a data sovereignty - we've seen that in Russia and China - and we are implementing now our own internet, Gaia-X. We are implementing other measures to transfer data from the EU to the US contractual clauses. The UK has their own guidelines and is building their own guidelines.  </p>
<p>And we see all kinds of interpretations in different countries, for example, in France, where they allow EU SaaS built on AWS provided that sufficient safeguards have been implemented. In the privacy area, we see that, although GDPR has been implemented, it is still only implemented in a pretty basic fashion. So going forward, I expect that, for example, consent management will get a lot more adoption, rather than the legitimate interest that we initially thought would be a ground for processing of data. And, at the same time, we see that in different industries, there are, per country, different regulations. Think of healthcare, think of insurance or banking. And last but not least, there is this interoperability question - we would like to inter-operate, we want to inter-operate across these verticals, which have their specific regulations - and also per country.  </p>
<p>But at this moment, we see, for example, identity providers like Speed in Italy, France Connect. We see Verimi in Germany, and we see Itsme in Belgium, DigiD and eHerkenning in the Netherlands. We are working - or the EU is working towards standardization with eIDAS. But this is still a bit of a free option for the different countries because their own identities have to be notified in the eIDAS. So, a new law is currently being developed by the EU for EU wide digital identity based on the wallet. So, there are a lot of developments in this area that try to solve the challenges of digital identity in and across Europe.  </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>How does that impact the platforms that customers need for their digital identities?</p>
<p>
I think first of all – the question of data residency – that is a clear question. So, the platforms that customers need, need to ensure that data is kept in Europe, because our customers don't want to be opposed to these constantly changing regulations that are constantly declared invalid, and on contractual agreements. That is a clear thing, other things, with the fragmented landscape, with the fragmented identity providers across Europe, we also see a need for a lot of flexibility in building a customer journey and for the onboarding of users at every point in the customer journey, you need to be able to make a step out. And the step out in Italy will be different from France and so forth. There is, of course, also the multi-language in Europe, we speak different languages. </p>
<p>And, for example, I'm from the Netherlands. If I drive two hours to the south, I need to speak French, and only French. If I drive to the east, I need to speak German, and very often only German. And to the west there is the UK. And these language barriers do not only give requirements for the end user, the consumer, but also if you work business to business and you work in a delegated fashion, then your business customers, or your partners – and I think again of that “anything as a service or to gig economy” - also, you need to address these type of business users within their own language. So, language support, not only for the consumer, but in the whole chain, B2B to B2C needs to be supported. And, of course with our consciousness on privacy, it is very important that we give full control in the platforms to the consumer on the usage of their data.  </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>What would your key take-away for the panel be?  </p>
<p>
Well, of course, for the customers, when they are looking for a platform, they need a platform that fulfils the requirements that were just mentioned here, the flexibility, the language, but it's not only that. There is a lot of dynamics in this world. The Gig economy and the SaaS and Anything as a Service are constantly evolving. That means that, if you have a vendor far away, most likely that vendor doesn't completely understand, or doesn't adopt these types of dynamics quickly enough. So, I'm advocating, being a European vendor, also to work with European vendors because they are on top of all these developments. And there is for the next years no such thing as a standard for customer Identity. I think that this place, especially in the regulated industries - Telco, energy, finance, and maybe to a lesser extent to retail and consumer goods - because things are less privacy sensitive. </p>

 Everything You Need To Know About Ontology EVM Contract Development — Part 1: Network&nbsp;Details <p>Today, Ontology, the high speed, low cost public blockchain bringing decentralized identity and data solutions to Web 3.0, announced the official deployment of a TestNet supporting EVM and opened the EVM compatible public beta to developers around the world. At the same time, the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">Ontology Security Vulnerability and Threat Intelligence Bounty Programme</a>” was officially launched in cooperation with SlowMist, a well-known code auditing agency. The top reward for reporting a vulnerability is $12,000 in&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>Through the integration of the Ethereum virtual machine, Ontology has achieved full compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. At present, the Ontology TestNet already supports EVM contracts and the node call method of the Ethereum chain. Developers can directly use EVM development tools such as Truffle, Remix and Web3.js on the Ontology TestNet for dApp deployment.</p><p>In order to encourage community developers to quickly and easily familiarize themselves with the Ontology EVM development environment, we specially prepared a “Handbook for Dummies”, which explains the essentials of Ontology EVM contract development.</p> 1. Network&nbsp;Details <p>Before using the Ontology EVM, let’s first look at its configuration information including ChainID, RPC URL, and blockchain explorer address. Based on this information, you can configure your MetaMask wallet to connect to the Ontology&nbsp;network.</p><p>Due to the difference between the ONG precision (9 bits) in the Ontology EVM and the precision supported by Metamask (18 bits), the display in Metamask may experience errors. We recommended using the <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/transfer">Ontology Bridge</a> to check the ONG balance or make a transfer.</p><p>1.1 Node&nbsp;Network</p>  MainNet Information  <p>2) TestNet Information</p><p>Note: When using MetaMask to connect to the Ontology network, please select “Custom RPC” in the MetaMask network settings, and then enter and save the configuration information according to the network&nbsp;type.</p><p>1.2 EVM assets on the Ontology&nbsp;chain</p><p>TestNet</p><p>1.3 Gas&nbsp;Fee</p><p>The deployment of the EVM contract on the Ontology chain requires ONG as a handling fee. You can click <a href="https://developer.ont.io/">here</a> to receive the ONG test&nbsp;coin.</p><p>1.4 Ontology&nbsp;Bridge</p><p>Ontology Network has achieved compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem through the Ontology EVM virtual machine. Therefore, in addition to native contracts, the contract types supported by Ontology now include NeoVM contracts, Wasm contracts, and EVM contracts. This also means that NeoVM-based OEP-4 Tokens and EVM-based ORC-20 Tokens can exist on the Ontology blockchain. Since the address format and signature method supported by EVM are different from those supported by NeoVM/WasmVM, ORC-20 assets (EVM contract implementation, similar to ERC-20 assets), the Ontology system must be stored in the Ethereum private key corresponding address (beginning with 0x), OEP-4 assets (implemented by NeoVM contract) must be stored in the address corresponding to the Ontology private key (beginning with A). As the transaction fee of the Ontology network ONG is an exception, ONG can also exist in the Ethereum account address and Ontology account&nbsp;address.</p><p>In order to facilitate the mutual circulation of ORC-20 assets and OEP-4 assets within Ontology network between Ethereum accounts and Ontology accounts, Ontology provides the <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/">Ontology Bridge</a> service, which is used in Ontology network deploys a Bridge contract (implemented by Wasm contract) to realize the mutual exchange of ORC-20 assets and OEP-4 assets between two different types of accounts. For ONG, users can use Ontology Bridge to transfer money between different types of addresses.</p><p>Ontology Bridge contract implementation logic</p>  Exchange OEP-4 for&nbsp;ORC-20  The user calls the oep4ToErc20 method of the Bridge contract through the Ontology private key signature. This method transfers the user’s OEP-4 assets to the Bridge contract address, and then transfers the corresponding amount of ERC-20 assets in the Bridge contract address to the user’s Ethereum private key generated address.  Exchange ORC-20 for&nbsp;OEP-4  The user needs to first use the Ethereum private key to call the approve method of the ORC-20 assets to authorize the address corresponding to the user’s Ontology private key to be able to transfer the ORC-20&nbsp;assets.  The user uses the authorized Ontology private key to call the ERC-20 to OEP-4 method of the Bridge contract. This method will transfer the asset in the user’s Ethereum address to the Bridge contract address, and then transfer the corresponding amount of OEP-4 assets to the user’s Ontology&nbsp;address.  <p>Note that in either of the aforementioned two asset exchange processes, the user always uses the Ontology private key to interact with the Bridge contract in order to transfer the asset in the user’s Ethereum address (the user is required to use the Ethereum private key for authorization operations). During the redemption process, remember that ORC-20 assets always have the address corresponding to the Ethereum private key, and OEP-4 assets always have the address corresponding to the Ontology private&nbsp;key.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Gas Tank on Polygon 
<p>We are making blockchain gas fees transparent for our users through the implementation of a “Gas Tank” service.</p>

		 
	 
                               <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in September 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			 
 
 
<p>This month we take a look at how Tokeny is making blockchain fees transparent for its users through the implementation of a “Gas Tank” service.</p>
<p>We are, on an optional basis, providing investors with a built-in custodial wallet1&nbsp;associated to their ONCHAINID digital identity. This allows users to hold assets and/or instruct transactions on the blockchain without having to safekeep their private key themselves. These wallets are available both on Ethereum and on Polygon.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/5-reasons-why-we-partnered-with-polygon/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kydTMPIHYtv-ax-ol2J2U9HJ10W4zO1hmWnq3GNOg4GISunHJzobV5s_5y3tjN5vcXmJW">network fees on the Polygon network are substantially lower</a>&nbsp;– roughly by a factor of 1/10’000 – than on Ethereum, they nevertheless still exist and need to be covered for transactions to be executed. This obviously means wallet holders need to make sure to have enough MATICs – the cryptocurrency used to pay the gas fees on Polygon – in their wallet to ensure their transaction(s) from not being processed. This might cause an unnecessary burden on those investors who are not familiar enough with the blockchain to monitor the MATICs they have on their wallet(s), to buy new ones when needed and to transfer them on their wallet.</p>
<p>To avoid such confusion and make the process of holding and transacting in security tokens deployed on Polygon as seamless as possible, we have developed a “Gas Tank” solution ensuring that, at any time, there is enough MATICs available on all built-in wallets to cover the transaction costs of the wallet holders.</p>
<p>In essence, the Gas Tank:</p>
 
 continuously monitors the level of MATICs available on the Wallets; 
 detects the wallets which are running short and; 
 tops-up the MATIC provision on those specific wallets. 
 
<p>The process is fully automated, provided at no additional cost to the wallet holders and … live!</p>
<p>The main benefits users can expect from the “Gas Tank” are:</p>
 
 a more seamless user experience; 
 simpler operations: no need to monitor their wallet and top it up; 
 reduced risk of transactions not being processed; 
 reduced costs: no transaction fees for them to pay. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>We trust that the implementation of this new “Gas Tank” functionality will be a significant step for us to simplify the access and the administration of security tokens on the Polygon network.</p>
<p>1&nbsp;The built-in custodial wallets are provided in partnership with Tangany GmbH</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facetec.com/">FaceTec</a> has established a new partnership allowing the company to establish a footprint in the United Arab Emirates. IT solutions specialist Data International (or “gDi”) will work with the facial recognition specialist in collaboration with Digital Dubai, a government entity mandated with leading the city’s digital transformation.</p>



<p>Specific details about what the organizations will be working on have not yet been disclosed, but Digital Dubai has a strong focus on building the city’s digital economy, and on cybersecurity efforts.</p>



<p>“Collaborating with FaceTec to bring their solution to this region will finally allow biometric authentication to flourish as it should, ensuring the market will be using the best technologies available to maintain its high-security standards while greatly enhancing the user experience,” explained gDi CCO Omar Atta in a statement announcing the partnership, adding later, “FaceTec’s solution will enable some of the great use cases that have been designed to come to life throughout the region, as organizations will finally have the confidence needed in their authentication provider.”</p>



<p>Dubai has proven to be something of a hotbed for the adoption of biometric technologies in recent years. Last year, for example, the Emirates airline launched a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/emirates-airline-launches-contactless-biometric-passenger-processing-system-dubai-102308/">biometric passenger screening system</a> at Dubai International Airport; and police in Dubai have been using <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/dubai-police-force-expands-use-of-bio-key-biometric-tech-903235/">biometric authentication</a> for personnel. </p>



<p>For FaceTec, the partnership reflects ongoing momentum after the company announced a 293 percent year-over-year increase in revenues in its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-q2-revenues-jump-293-year-over-year-080503/">second quarter update</a> earlier this summer. For his part, CEO Kevin Alan Tussy singled out FaceTec’s private sector partner for praise in offering his own commentary on the development.</p>



<p>“We are so happy to be working with gDi, such a highly-regarded organization in the MENA region,” he said. “Digital Dubai requires their solutions to consistently demonstrate exceptional performance and value, and we are honored to have been chosen over dozens of other vendors from around the world to be one of their technology partners for the important, forward-thinking undertaking they have planned for the city.”</p>

<p><a href="https://enacomm.netlify.app/">ENACOMM</a> is looking to boost its growth through the appointment of Joseph Brown as its new Chief Revenue Officer.</p>



<p>In announcing the appointment, ENACOMM emphasized Brown’s track record in holding executive management positions at various firms and startups, calling him “a seasoned technology leader with global experience”. Brown was most recently the Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales for digital commerce specialist Avangate, a position he held from 2011 to 2015. Before that, he was VP and EMEA General Manager for RightNow Technologies, and he also served as CEO for Seance Software and Edify Corporation.</p>



<p>ENACOMM, meanwhile, is best known for its Financial Suite, a platform of software tools aimed at the financial services sector. The Suite includes tools like voice-based AI assistant technology featuring voice recognition; and support for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/enacomm-offers-idmissions-biometric-onboarding-tech-financial-institutions-053108/">face biometrics-based selfie onboarding</a>, thanks to a partnership established with IDmission earlier this year.</p>



<p>The financial services sector, meanwhile, has been showing a strong appetite for biometric and other FinTech solutions in recent years, a trend on which Brown will seek to capitalize.</p>



<p>“ENACOMM is amidst a strong upward climb in the FinTech space, which presents a unique opportunity for me to play a pivotal role in helping to shape the future of the company,” he said. “I look forward to powering ENACOMM to the next level of success and reaching more banks, credit unions and card companies with personalized customer experience solutions that reduce costs and frustration.”</p>



<p>Brown’s appointment arrives after another high-level hire for ENACOMM earlier this year in John Sullivan, who was named the company’s <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/enacomm-targets-western-us-with-new-regional-vp-financial-services-030902/">Regional Vice President of Financial Services</a> in March. Sullivan was tasked with marketing the ENACOMM Financial Suite to institutions in the Western United States; now, in its latest announcement, ENACOMM explained that Brown will be “taking charge of all of ENACOMM’s revenue-generation processes, directing company-wide strategy around sales, customer support, pricing and revenue management.”</p>

<p><a href="https://rankone.io/">Rank One Computing</a> (ROC) is asking the facial recognition industry to take the lead with regards to the ethical use of the technology. To that end, the company will be spearheading an industry campaign to come up with a code of ethics for facial recognition developers.</p>



  



<p>The campaign will be carried out in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.securityindustry.org/">Security Industry Association</a> (SIA). ROC is a member of the organization, and helped craft the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/sia-publishes-new-privacy-code-conduct-062501/">SIA’s own core principles</a> for the responsible use of facial recognition.</p>



<p>So what does an actual industry code of ethics look like? For its part, ROC suggested that facial recognition developers should avoid overreach with their applications, which is to say that developers should not push the technology into fields that could be controversial. However, it did not offer any details as to what qualifies as controversial, and even seemed to defend some uses (such as law enforcement) that have received considerable pushback from the public.</p>



<p>ROC claimed that those dissenting voices are a minority, and that there is in fact strong public support for government and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/rank-one-brings-automated-surveillance-plugin-xprotect-vms-012003/">security-based applications</a> of facial recognition tech. It also dismissed concerns about a dystopian surveillance future, although it did not explain why those worries are misplaced.</p>



<p>Having said that, ROC did argue that user privacy should be at the forefront of any ethical code of conduct, and should focus on policy, use cases, and data management rather than the technology. In doing so, it acknowledged that facial recognition can be used for harmful ends, especially in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/false-arrest-highlights-issues-racial-bias-facial-recognition-062507/">cases in which bias is present</a>, though it countered that the technology itself is agnostic, and that policy and best practice can help steer it in a more constructive direction.</p>



<p>ROC also noted that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/rank-ones-biometric-rd-pays-off-recent-frvt-testing-082803/">facial recognition has improved</a> in recent years, and that a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/uks-ico-determines-onfidos-anti-bias-biometric-research-public-interest-111101/">properly trained and representative algorithm</a> will not have any of the biases that have been <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-nist-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-algorithms-122401/">observed in lesser systems</a> over the years. Meanwhile, an industry-led initiative could help create more clarity for developers given the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/momentum-builds-facial-recognition-laws-united-states-052801/">lack of federal guidance</a> and the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/minneapolis-city-council-considers-public-facial-recognition-ban-012601/">mishmash of local</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-maine-law-curtails-police-use-of-facial-recognition-7070502/">state laws</a>.</p>



<p>“Our industry has an obligation to meet the public’s valid concerns about privacy,” said ROC COO David Ray.&nbsp;“At Rank One, we are committed to ensuring that FR deployments respect civil liberties, and we encourage our industry partners to join us in that commitment.”</p>



<p>The new ROC campaign will officially kick off at the upcoming Connect-ID conference scheduled for October 5-6 in Washington, DC.&nbsp;In the meantime, the company has received a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/rank-one-250000-through-colorado-ai-accelerator-grant-program-705252/">$250,000 grant</a> from the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade.</p>

<p>For our 7th Close-up Magic meetup, we welcomed <a href="https://twitter.com/srmullen">Sean Mullen</a> and <a href="https://8-b.site/">Mattias Inokuchi</a> to talk&nbsp;about:</p>  How Svelte Kit differentiates itself from other frameworks like React and&nbsp;Angular.  The developer experience Svelte offers developers.  The gaps Svelte needs to fill before it can rank as the #1 UI framework.  <p>Here are a few of our favorite takeaways.</p> Key Takeaways  Svelte uses a smarter programming model than React&nbsp;🧠 <p>Like React, Svelte is a UI framework that makes it easier to write components. But instead of using a virtual DOM to track state changes and to re-render pages, Svelte pretty much avoids it. This is because React’s virtual DOM introduces unnecessary work for developers that, if done incorrectly, results in a slow performing app.</p><blockquote>“The danger of defaulting to doing unnecessary work, even if that work is trivial, is that your app will eventually succumb to ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with no clear bottleneck to aim at once it’s time to optimise.” (<a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead">src</a>)</blockquote><p>React’s diffing algorithm cannot identify which element in the DOM is a state that is actually prone to changes, and its JSX syntax makes it easier for developers to write components that slows the app&nbsp;down.</p><p>Instead of using a virtual DOM and delegating the diffing work to the browser, Svelte puts on the smart compiler hat, figures out which states could change in your app at build time, and turns your code into tiny Vanilla JavaScript code. Pretty neat,&nbsp;huh?</p> New coders will fall in love with Svelte&nbsp;👏 <p>Sean, Mattias, and I agreed on a bunch of things during our talk. My favorite was the fact that Svelte is super beginner friendly for new programmers. This is because Svelte is made up of the OG tools of web development — HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. If you write any valid HTML/CSS/JS code, it will also be valid in a Svelte&nbsp;app.</p><blockquote>“As a beginner, it’s easy to recognize HTML and CSS compared to React.” — Mattias&nbsp;Inokuchi</blockquote><p>Since coders are saved from studying DOM manipulation, how to write in JSX, React Hooks, and more, there’s less barrier to entry and more time to get something working&nbsp;faster.</p> Svelte is the fastest growing frontend JS framework ⚡️ <p>One of the questions I asked Sean and Mattias is, “Will Svelte be able to capture the market share it needs to grow?” Although there weren’t any definitive answers, we discussed the positive indicators of Svelte’s continued growth.</p><p>Sean expressed that Svelte is a framework that he’s recommending to his friends. And it appears this type of word-of-mouth marketing in tech communities like Tech Twitter, Reddit and Discord is working because Svelte was found to be the fastest growing framework in August, 2021 based on NPM weekly downloads (<a href="https://twitter.com/zoltanszogyenyi/status/1431599979404087297">src</a>).</p><blockquote>“I’ve never been in a position where I can’t find a library to do what I want. Anything that you can do in another framework, it’s either already part of svelte or there’s a library to do it. Or it’s just much easier to accomplish in Svelte in the first place.” — Sean&nbsp;Mullen</blockquote><p>Sure, our key takeaways explain why developers love Svelte. But there’s more reason to love it. The blogs Rich Harris writes are always insightful and delightful, and the community behind Svelte is also super&nbsp;helpful.</p><p>💡 Ready to give Svelte a try? Follow the Guide Sean Mullen created&nbsp;<a href="https://magic.link/posts/magic-svelte">here</a>.</p> Q&amp;A Session <p>At the end of the talk, we received a great question from one of our listeners.</p><blockquote>Q: What do you think about integrating Svelte with Docker, Kubernetes, and working with environment variables?</blockquote><p>Curious to know the answer? Make sure to watch the recording of the fireside chat&nbsp;below.</p> Interested in Close-up&nbsp;Magic? <p>If you ever want to be a special guest for Close-up Magic and talk about a tech you’re passionate about, schedule a chat with Maricris&nbsp;<a href="https://calendly.com/magic-maricris/15min-1">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/how-svelte-cybernetically-enhances-web-development-ae5eb45d464b">How Svelte Cybernetically Enhances Web Development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A New Way&nbsp;Forward: <blockquote>By Sanja Bojanic, Biljana Cvetanovska Gugoska, Lazar Pop Ivanov and Narine Sahakyan, UNDP North Macedonia; Mihai Chereji, Meggan Collins, Indy Johar, Linnéa Rönnquist and Zehra Zaidi, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs</blockquote><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a wake-up call for governments on the vulnerability of our economic and social systems, and the ability of the machinery of government to be able to process rapidly changing, cascading impacts into policy, programmes, financing decisions and continuous feedback and review. We know that other threats such as climate change and automation loom large on the horizon, with an ever-shortened window to be able to mitigate their impact. So how do democratic nations build the capabilities to deal with the long-term and cascading global challenges of the next twenty&nbsp;years?</p> Introduction <p>As explored in <a href="https://awayforward.undp.org/">‘A Way Forward’: Governing in an Age of Emergence’</a>, a previous collaboration between UNDP and Dark Matter Labs, over the next 20 years, governments around the world will be facing critical choices on climate, digital and democratic transition for their economy and society — or what we term “human, machine and ecological transition”. We are living in a global age of long, interlinked emergencies. <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/">Climate change</a> (1), <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/">biodiversity loss</a> (2), <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-10-2020-impact-of-covid-19-on-people's-livelihoods-their-health-and-our-food-systems#:~:text=The%20economic%20and%20social%20disruption,the%20end%20of%20the%20year.">pandemics</a> (3), <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance">antibiotic resistance</a> (4), <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/wmr_2020.pdf">migration</a> (5) and <a href="http://report.hdr.undp.org/">human development</a> (6) are just some of the challenges, whose impact falls most heavily on the world’s most vulnerable people&nbsp;(7).</p><p>How do democratic nations build the capabilities to deal with long term and cascading global challenges of the next twenty years? Each one of these challenges can have devastating economic and social consequences — as has been laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also evident that no government would be able to tackle all of these challenges on its own by top-down solutions, but would rather need to enable and incentivise other actors in society to embrace the policy mandate and play their part in affecting change. Fundamentally, this requires not only new innovative policy but a transformation of the machinery of government in how to formulate, disseminate and implement policy and the types of tools and methods that it uses. It requires new institutions, new ways of financing, an acceleration towards digital and analytical capability to ensure real-time evaluation against cascading risks, and the building of new capabilities not only across government but also society, and in a way that disseminates learning across&nbsp;society.</p><p>Finally, the question we are posing in this blog is how do we create a framework for a National Development Strategy that builds the nation’s capabilities for adaptation and resilience so that the whole of society is able to meet the future and the scale of adaptation required, and not with fear, but with renewed optimism to truly “build back&nbsp;better”?</p> Five Strategic Shifts For A New Way&nbsp;Forward <p>Human, machine and ecological transition requires us to develop strategic and critical responses that orient structural transformation towards long-termism and consideration for future generations. How we decide to use our land and resources today has long-term implications, yet our current systems are struggling to make sense of decisions that impact across multiple time horizons (from political cycles to fiscal budgets). We must ‘break the tragedy of the horizon’ (8), as Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of England, so eloquently stated in a much-cited speech at Lloyd’s of London in&nbsp;2015.</p><p>The transition calls for a revision of our relationships with: (A) The economy, challenging the way we assign value to certain contributions over time (9); (B) The environment, addressing the increasing uninhabitability of our environment; and (C) Society, challenging ageing populations and demographic slowdown (10). The transition also demands a new pathway for countries and importantly a new lens through which to see the nation-state. There is an inherent limitation in seeing the nation-state purely as a bounded territory. A border defines the geographic territory of a country over which its government can enact legislation, but it is redundant when dealing with the constant flows in and out of a country that impact everything from the economy to the environment, or when dealing with the prevention or mitigation of any one of the interconnected global challenges set out&nbsp;above.</p><p>In conceptualising a framework for a National Development Strategy in North Macedonia, we have embraced five strategic shifts for a new way&nbsp;forward:</p><p>1. Re-imagine statecraft for an age in which we see the nation as a system. We are moving from seeing the nation as a bounded territory to seeing the nation as a knotted system of flows impacted by transnational behaviours. The level of uncertainty inherent in the nation system means we cannot accurately predict or plan for the long-term future; nor can we silo and compartmentalise interventions because when you change something in any one space, you will be creating cascading impacts throughout the whole system (See Figure 1). We can no longer have a one-to-one, “action-reaction” response to deal with strategic risks, but rather it requires a network approach consisting of a number of parallel processes involving multiple&nbsp;actors.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic can be understood as a warning sign, a probe into the structural weaknesses of our existing systems (11). It shows how futile it is to address 21st-century challenges with the institutions and methods of 20th-century governance. It will not be enough to simply respond to crises, we need to scaffold the transition to a new human contract with the world around&nbsp;us.</p><p>2. Build a more inclusive democracy and one in which we act as custodians for future generations. Governments are waking up to the urgent need to build the capacity of the whole of society to care about, and take decisions on, the impact that we have on our planet and future generations.</p><p>In this age of complexity, top down government is neither sustainable given the scope and scale of interventions required, nor effective given the range of actors involved in our interconnected nation system. Moreover, the increased risks faced by the nation system need bold interventions that require building legitimacy across society for such actions. One way to build legitimacy is by fostering more inclusive, transparent and accountable policy making and programmes implementation (12). We also need to reinforce the multi-party democratic system. Not only is parliamentary debate and scrutiny essential, but it becomes imperative to take a cross-party collaborative approach and to be mindful of those who would try to game the system of democracy. Issues such as climate change need to go beyond party politics and a political system that continuously rewards one party for another’s failure.</p><p>The unprecedented future that countries are facing requires a level of citizen participation that can drive collaborative rather than centralised innovation. Future imagining and collective but distributed decision making will be central to this development (13). Our current mechanisms for democratic participation struggle to incorporate meaningful deliberation. We need to design deliberative processes, planning systems, policy and regulatory frameworks, better markets, and the ability to “contract” for the future (14). Simultaneously, nations need to prioritise investment in the rebuilding of societal trust so that different non-governmental actors are ready to listen, engage with and support the policy making and programmes implementation function of government.</p><p>3. Build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile">antifragility</a> (15) for nation states to adjust, learn and deeply grow (16) in an age of long emergencies (as illustrated by the currents of uncertainty in the Deployment Framework Diagram in Figure 2 below). Antifragile systems are more than simply resilient and adaptable. They do not merely bounce back from shocks, or respond effectively in the wake of shocks, but thrive and improve because of such shocks. We need to build the capabilities for a nation to thrive in uncertain environments so that we are not always planning for the next crisis, whilst repairing the damage from the last one (17). Our collective strategy of renewal to “build back better” ought to be premised on a systemic response built on emergent, discursive, contingent processes of perpetual learning and self-renewal.</p><p>4. Transition as fast as possible to a “safe zone of operation” by using <a href="https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/">the Doughnut Framework by Kate Raworth</a> (18) as the “guard rail” in our transition journey, whilst recognising the divergent development cycles of different nations.</p><p>The Doughnut is a visual “safe and just space” framework that sets the goal of operating within safe planetary boundaries and social boundaries, acting as a compass for human progress. In terms of transition strategy, it can be used to identify interconnected risks and potentials over a time horizon and is therefore an evaluation tool or framework from which human, machine and ecological development can&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>The Doughnut Framework is not a set of policies and institutions, but rather principles for humanity to thrive in the 21st century. It is to be noted that one of these principles is moving from the goal of endless GDP growth to thriving in the doughnut where everyone’s needs are met. For middle income and low income countries that still need to develop and grow their economy, but want to adopt aspects of the Doughnut Framework, we have pursued the idea of deep&nbsp;growth.</p><p>5. Embrace a new thesis of human-machine-ecological deep growth, recognising a new human economy from care to creativity, unleashed by a new machine economy revolution of automation, AI, and structured on a new foundation of ecological regeneration, repair and biomaterial circularity.</p><p>Whilst many countries are seeking growth strategies alongside an improvement in quality of life. UNDP’s <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi">Human Development Index</a> (19) scores, and the adjusted <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/planetary-pressures%E2%80%93adjusted-human-development-index-phdi#:~:text=Planetary%20pressures%E2%80%93adjusted%20Human%20Development%20Index%20(PHDI),-About%20Planetary%20Pressures&amp;text=The%20PHDI%20is%20the%20level,as%20an%20incentive%20for%20transformation.">Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index</a> (20) present another type of growth measure, beyond GDP. Any meaningful National Development Strategy needs to adopt a new theory of growth that fundamentally integrates the new human-machine-ecological economy as a virtuous system of both maintaining and expanding economic potentialities, and not see technological advancement as a threat or ecological preservation as a constraint.</p><p>Human-machine-ecological deep growth&nbsp;is:</p> National Development Strategy for a 21st Statecraft <p>Designing for the 21st Century <br>How does the nature of the transition inform how a National Development Strategy is&nbsp;created?</p><p>A National Development Strategy is a comprehensive umbrella policy for a country that sets a medium to long term vision not only for economic development but also considers economic, social, political and environmental dimensions in combination. It ensures synergy among various policies and programmes that contribute towards stated national priorities, with a view to achieving defined objectives within a given timeframe, and thus becomes a tool to measure ‘progress and success’.</p><p>However, the uncertainty and complexity inherent in transition presents a challenge for development strategies that aim to set defined objectives within set timeframes. Another challenge is how to move towards genuine long-termism in such strategies where, in terms of transition, a responsibility is borne to future generations?</p><p>A strategy needs to be designed in a way that enables it to stay relevant and a distributed driver for change over the time period that it is meant to guide. It cannot become outdated in 4 to 5 years’ time when there has been a change of government with new priorities, in 10 years’ time when long term trends such as migration or rural displacement have changed the social and economic fabric of regions in a country, or in 20 years’ time when the average temperature rise of the planet has created both predictable and additional, unknowable consequences.</p><p>Strategic Principles<br>What are the strategic principles that can guide the long term planning needed for transition?</p><p>We have identified a set of principles that are crucial to enable a twenty-year transition:</p><p>1. Long-Termism (22). A development strategy needs to be embedded in long-termism and build the social covenant necessary to scaffold large scale change. A development strategy needs to build cross-societal agreement about structural transition, as well as civic resilience against the inevitable disruptions in an age of long emergencies, such as loss of jobs as a result of large scale degenerative business models or automation.</p><p>2. Systems Approach (23). The transition required is systemic. We know climate change is fundamentally a symptom of a structural problem in how we govern and how our relationships in the world are governed. In terms of transition policy, we need to be mindful of our relationship with the future, our relationship with the natural and material world, and our relationship with each&nbsp;other.</p><p>3. Embedding Adaptability (24). It is impossible to accurately predict every required policy response to all future challenges. Flexibility needs to be at the heart of any National Development Strategy. We have proposed that a development strategy needs to be a living document (as opposed to a static document) that is able to adjust to real-time data, feedback and evaluation. It needs to be parametric in scope and engineered with contingent capabilities for an unknown&nbsp;world.</p><p>4. Capability Building (25). We are living in a global age of long, interlinked emergencies, with interconnected challenges faced by all actors in society (government, academia, industry and civil society). The dynamic and linked nature of these emergencies will require governments to become enablers for society to work together, building horizontal strategies and collaborative capabilities.</p><p>Any development plan needs to be focused not only on one-to-one, action-reaction responses to strategic risks but build the capabilities of a nation (See Figure 3). Some design questions include:</p>  How do we build a shared language and contextual framework of the future, i.e. a whole of society approach?  How do we bring more sections of society into political decision-making in an age of long emergencies (from how we decide to use our land and resources today to acting in a crisis tomorrow)?  How do we build capacity for an agile, democratic state when all our institutions are designed for linear, waterfall orchestration (26)?  How do we create and regulate markets for infinite games (for the purpose of maintaining) as opposed to finite games (for the purpose of gaining/winning)?  How do we build the imagination, invention and innovation capacity of the whole of&nbsp;society?  How do we build the distributed and decentralised sense making capacity of the whole of&nbsp;society?  How do we build new public accounting capacity for long-termism, which uses methods and practices informing such liabilities, and thereby invite appropriate investment theses?  <p>5. Funding.Traditional public finance frameworks rely heavily on ex-ante cost-benefit analysis (27), leaving little room for dynamic spillover analysis (i.e. a policy intervention can have ripple effects throughout the system, beyond what any direct cost-benefit analysis could estimate). Equally, these frameworks are stuck in annual budget cycles, struggling to unlock long-term patterns of behaviour and fundamental shortfalls in capital provision for the challenges ahead. Critical sectors such as education and health deliver outcomes with significant spillover effects, and these require sustained financing.</p><p>Key considerations for any National Development Strategy geared for transition are:</p>  Building the fundamental financial innovation capacity to address the scale of challenge that we face such as enabling investment in and accounting for intangible asset creation;  Addressing the bias towards short-termism in financing. As ecological degradation and technological risks become a reality, we no longer have the luxury of time to treat the future as a distant outpost. How can we create new instruments, mechanisms and vehicles that can invest over longer time frames, maintain the flexibility to adapt to new information, invest in the institutional deep code experimentation necessary, invest vertically in portfolios spanning deep culture change to new institutional infrastructures to accelerate the transition?  Building the capacity for the decentralised capital formation necessary to address society’s complex nature of needs. We also need to simultaneously tackle the disbursement of central government funding to municipal authorities, an the issue that most nations demonstrate an over-reliance on;  Building the institutional capacity to code and recode — a 21st century form of capital for operating with uncertainty, inclusion and sustainability;  Building new capacities and protocols of decision&nbsp;making;  Enabling investment in and accounting for intangible asset creation (such as trust, mental health and social cohesion). The transition requires us to build new capabilities for resilience, adaptability, creativity, self-learning, self-development and self-renewal. Outcomes-based funding still struggles to capture the intangible benefits of programmes, and the conditions attached to funding needs to create the space for&nbsp;this.  Building new mechanisms of inclusive governance and transparency attached to funding to ensure integrity and accountability;  Building the transition pathways to gradually shift donor funding to more sustainable and longitude means of financing.   Background and Further Information <p>The Government of North Macedonia started the preparations for the development of 2021–2041 National Development Strategy in early 2021, supported by a project implemented by the UNDP in coordination with RCO North Macedonia. UK GGF funding was secured for this process. Within this project, UNDP North Macedonia has been working with Dark Matter Labs to develop a new statecraft for the development of national strategy to deal with transition, in line with the 2030 Agenda and national development and strategic priorities.

Remington Tonar and Ellis Talton (2020) “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellistalton/2020/05/02/city-leaders-must-focus-on-building-urban-antifragility-in-the-post-pandemic-world/">Cities Must Focus On Fostering Antifragility In The Post-Pandemic World</a>”, Leadership strategy, Forbes, 2020–05–02  The Doughnut Economics framework helps us understand the safe and just space for humanity. It describes our planetary boundaries, first identified by Johan Rockström, and our social boundaries and where we are or risking overshooting. Kate Raworth (2018), “<a href="http://coronavirustechhandbook.com/home">Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist</a>”, Cornerstone Book Publishers 2018–02–22  Thirty years ago, UNDP introduced a new approach for advancing human flourishing and measuring progress. Instead of relying on GDP as the sole indicator of development, countries were ranked by the more holistic Human Development Index (HDI) that accounts for a country’s achievements across a number of social and economic dimensions, including health, education and standard of living. UNDP (2020), “Human Development Reports”, UNDP retrieved 2021–06–03 <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/planetary-pressures%E2%80%93adjusted-human-development-index-phdi#:~:text=Planetary%20pressures%E2%80%93adjusted%20Human%20Development%20Index%20(PHDI),-About%20Planetary%20Pressures&amp;text=The%20PHDI%20is%20the%20level,as%20an%20incentive%20for%20transformation">Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI) | Human Development Reports</a>.  Today, UNDP’s 2020 Human Development Report calls for a just transformation that expands human freedoms while easing planetary pressures by proposing the new and experimental Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI). This even more comprehensive index adjusts the standard HDI by a country’s level of carbon dioxide emissions and material footprint on a per capita basis, reminding us of the oft-ignored fact that all growth comes at a cost. UNDP (2020), “Human Development Reports”, UNDP retrieved 2021–06–03 <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/planetary-pressures%E2%80%93adjusted-human-development-index-phdi#:~:text=Planetary%20pressures%E2%80%93adjusted%20Human%20Development%20Index%20(PHDI),-About%20Planetary%20Pressures&amp;text=The%20PHDI%20is%20the%20level,as%20an%20incentive%20for%20transformation">Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI) | Human Development Reports</a>.  “There are at least two kinds of games: finite and infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play. Finite games are those instrumental activities — from sports to politics to wars — in which the participants obey rules, recognize boundaries and announce winners and losers. The infinite game — there is only one — includes any authentic interaction, from touching to culture, that changes rules, plays with boundaries and exists solely for the purpose of continuing the game. A finite player seeks power; the infinite one displays self-sufficient strength. Finite games are theatrical, necessitating an audience; infinite ones are dramatic, involving participants…” James P. Carse (1986), “<a href="https://archive.org/details/finiteinfinitega00carsrich">Finite and Infinite Games</a>”, Ballatine Books, New&nbsp;York  Throughout the past decades, we have been slicing time to finer and ever-shorter periods. As investor Esther Dyson once said, “In politics the dominant time frame is a term of office, in fashion and culture it’s a season. For corporations it’s a quarter, on the internet it’s minutes, and on the financial markets mere milliseconds”. To address the multiple crises we face today, we need to extend our temporal frame of reference and develop strategic and critical responses that orient deep structural transformations in Long-termism transformation. What we do today has an impact on future generations. Chloe Treger (2020), “<a href="https://medium.com/futures-in-long-termism/futures-in-long-termism-95f64710f9b2">Futures in Long-termism</a>”, Dark Matter Labs, Medium 2020–02–21  A system is evolving continuously through nodes, interlinkages and feedback loops. Their emerging nature requires dynamic, learning and entangled responses. Donella H. Meadows (2008), “<a href="https://books.google.se/books/about/Thinking_in_Systems_A_Primer.html?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Thinking in Systems</a>”, Chelsea Green Publishing, Vermont&nbsp;2008  Being adaptable refers in this case to the ability to ‘humbly govern’. Demos Helsinki describes this as starting with an acknowledgment of the prevailing uncertainty and is thus built as a continuously iterative process, in which actors are willing to (and allowed to) change their mind as new information arises. Mikko Annala, Juha Leppänen, Silva Mertsola, Charles F. Sabel (2021) “<a href="https://demoshelsinki.fi/julkaisut/the-more-complex-and-uncertain-a-policy-issue-is-the-more-useful-it-is-to-approach-it-through-humility/">Humble Government: How to realise ambitious reforms prudently</a>”, Demos Helsinki, Government Analysis, Assessment and Research Activities, Finland&nbsp;2021  Capability Building is the enabling of individuals, groups and organisations, institutions and countries to develop, enhance and organise their systems, resources and knowledge; all reflected in their abilities, individually and collectively, to perform functions, solve problems and achieve objectives. OECD (2006) “<a href="https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=7230#:~:text=Definition%3A,solve%20problems%20and%20achieve%20objectives.">DAC Guidelines and Reference Series Applying Strategic Environmental Assessment: Good Practice Guidance for Development Co-operation</a>”, OECD, Paris&nbsp;2006  Waterfall is a project management typology in which everything flows linearly, in clearly defined steps without reflexiv capacity. It begins with setting up the aims, followed by the design of what you plan to do. Once this is determined you do that, which means it is done. In some cases you may test it. Project Manager (2021), “The ultimate guide…Waterfall Model”, Projectmanager.com, retrieved 2021–06–10 <a href="https://www.projectmanager.com/waterfall-methodology">https://www.projectmanager.com/waterfall-methodology</a>  Cost-benefit analysis looks upfront at overall costs of a project and tries to estimate its’ benefits in simple monetary terms. “Influenced by the market-failure framework, modern appraisal and evaluation approaches are usually based upon a static form of ex-ante cost-benefit analysis (CBA) with costs and benefits measured using existing market prices. CBA-type analyses are concerned with allocative or distributive efficiency, which involves making the best use of (fixed) resources at a fixed point in time.

*Check out the Holdersland x Urbit collection: [holders.land/urbit](https://holders.land/urbit)*

We sat down recently with Haleek Maul to discuss the current state of NFTs and the future of Urbit IDs and digital communities.

Are Urbit IDs NFTs? Sure, they're ERC-721 non-fungible tokens which you can buy on OpenSea—but to be clear, we made them way back before the word "NFT" had entered mainstream consciousness. An Urbit ID is a number that is used to generate both a phonetic name and an avatar (what we call [sigils](https://urbit.org/blog/creating-sigils)), but it is so much more than your average NFT—it is a key to an entire digital world.

We built Urbit IDs for digital communities and the people they’re made of. An Urbit ID is a decentralized and pseudonymous identity perfect for your collective, commune, squad, team, or DAO. Unlike most addresses or social identities, you own your Urbit ID like you own your crypto. Your Discord handle might be free for now, but as the saying goes, if it’s free then you’re the product. On Urbit your ID is actually yours and you pay for it up front. You can log into third party apps or software without ever relinquishing control of your data. What is yours stays with you. IDs themselves can be owned collectively—there are already DAOs on Urbit who jointly own stars and galaxies.

Urbit IDs are evolving and generative. They’re generative because some IDs spawn additional NFTs which themselves can be bought and sold. For instance, each star can spawn 65,535 planets, and each galaxy can spawn 255 stars. The network itself is evolving, meaning that the network can be upgraded via a majority vote by galaxy holders. Urbit IDs and the Ubit network itself are inherently dynamic.

At Urbit, we support communities of all kinds. We recently granted Holdersland ten Urbit IDs: four stars and six planets to be auctioned off. Haleek Maul (his Urbit ID is `~fosmex-hocmel`) will be creating custom artwork for each of the sigils. The proceeds of the auction will help support Holdersland in bringing blockchain technologies to the Caribbean. The auction will go live on September 16th, 2021 on [holders.land/urbit](https://holders.land/urbit).

Without further ado, here’s Haleek Maul.

---

**Tell us a little bit about yourself and Holdersland.**

Sure. My name is Haleek Maul and I’m a multi-disciplinary artist. I was born in America and came to Barbados when I was three years old. I’ve been making music since 2007. I put out my first debut project in 2012 and since then it has been a process of creating art from the stuff flowing through my mind.

Holdersland is a digital extension of my artistic project—a way of creating change in the world around me. When I was younger, there weren’t many artists like me coming from Barbados. I was into a lot of niche electronic and club music and felt alienated from the larger conversation. Holdersland is a way to help creative people in the Caribbean connect with like-minded people around the world, especially using new technologies like blockchain. So I founded Holdersland in 2020 when I left my record label after four years. I felt like music institutions was archaic and didn’t feed into my other artistic practices. I wanted to create an institution that captured the full creative practice—all the way from creating to selling. Most importantly, I wanted to get artists from Barbados and the Caribbean involved in global conversations around art and technology.

**What exactly is Holdersland?**

It’s a company centered around Caribbean intellectual property. We’re trying to help people get connected with new web3 technologies, especially artists. Holdersland is an aggregator that helps connects those who are interested in new technology with those those who actually develop it.

For example, there is a lot of math that underlies music. Part of our project is to extract these mathematical principles and see how they can help generate new forms of art that can be widely distributed. So we’re working to build our own projects and work with users to adopt some of these new technologies. It’s a community of people centered around these values. We plan to implement voting, governance, and incentive structures into the community soon.

**What do you think is the link between your two main interests: music and technology?**

I’ve always been interested in technology. Anyone who has made music in the last twenty years has had to get involved with tech. Especially if you’re a producer. There are many young kids who are downloading music software and messing around with it, and in the process becoming knowledgeable about music production and design. Science and math live right beside art.

I was also into web development when I was a teenager and was very interested in how the internet worked. This led into the work I’m doing with Holdersland. Technology, more often than not, is concerned with collaboration and communication. But in order to develop new technologies we often need to talk about nitty-gritty details. This requires detailed knowledge of particular technologies.

**What is the great hope or promise with new decentralized technologies like blockchain or Urbit?**

They lower the barrier to communication and trade. Especially for countries like Barbados, we don’t have access to the world market. But now with these networks, and assets like NFTs, we can engage in commerce without borders. It allows new entrants to join the market.

It also allows new financial relationships and funding structures to emerge. Rather than have a few people contribute $20k, you can have hundreds of people contribute $100. Once again, this lowers the entry for people to invest is early-stage projects. This changes the way that companies build and ship products.

Brain drain is when skilled workers move abroad for more profitable employment. These new technologies allow native Carribeans to stay where they are while earning money. Using these new technologies, the Carribean can prosper while not losing its unique character and cultural identity. Crypto is permanently going to change the distribution of wealth and culture around the world.

Discord is a fine community solution, but it’s not ideal. There’s an endless array of plugins and dependencies that makes Discord unstable. However, it is a good mixture of an office, a storefront, and a club: I can do my work, sell assets, and just have fun. Communities are important. People naturally want to be in communities, we just need a better solution than Discord. Especially one that’s crypto-native and allows for commerce. Urbit is a one-stop shop that could fill that gap.

**What is the collaboration between Holdersland and Urbit that’s happening this week?**

I’m producing some custom sigil artwork for a set of stars and planets. Both the Urbit assets and artwork will be auctioned off together. The proceeds from the event will go towards creating a community music studio here in Barbados and technology education around the island.

A lot of people here in Barbados don’t even understand what crypto is. A lot of the work being done around this project is to raise awareness about the potentials of this new technology. I want this to be a general springboard for the Caribbean to gain greater technological literacy. That literacy is an important step for lower-income people to drastically change their situation.

**What are you looking forward to talking about on the New World Energy panel at Assembly 2021?**

I want to talk about how to migrate communities onto Urbit. How to use Urbit as a new platform for niche cultures found around the current internet. Also the great strength and power provided by Urbit’s digital identities.

NFTs can be very powerful—there are a lot of possible applications of a unique digital asset. It’s already dissolved geographical boundaries which will help countries to export their intellectual products freely. Countries need first to gain knowledge around these technologies and their economies will follow.

**Thanks for chatting!**

See you at Assembly 2021!

Finance is about trust, ultimately.”</blockquote><blockquote>Gensler expressed disappointment with the industry’s response to his suggestion that trading platforms register with the SEC on the grounds that a sufficient number of cryptocurrencies qualify as securities.</blockquote><blockquote>“Talk to us, come in,” he said. “There are a lot of platforms that are in operation today that would do better engaging and instead there is a bit of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. begging for forgiveness rather than asking for permission.”</blockquote><p>Now, there’s nothing actually wrong with that statement — aside from hints of a potential threat. For crypto to grow up and truly be relevant and useful, it does indeed need to work symbiotically within a public policy framework. Part of the issue here is that, rather than presenting a clear framework, the SEC has so far regulated via enforcement.</p><p>For Gensler and the SEC, it’s a bit of a pickle. If you’ve ever played chess, you’d know that a classic rookie error is to overcommit your pawns too early. Better to let the game play out so you can better assess your structure. The thing with pawns is that, once you move them forward, you can never move them back. Overcommitted pawns create weaknesses in your set up that your opponent can then&nbsp;target.</p><p>That’s why even answering basic questions such as — Is Ethereum a security? — proves challenging to impossible at the moment. It’s one pawn move too far at this stage of the game. Leaving those questions unanswered leaves more leeway for the SEC’s future enforcement actions.</p><p>Now, it’s easy to put all the blame here on Gensler’s SEC. The reality is that the sort of clarity required will eventually have to come from Congress.</p><p>The crypto space operated for years with little oversight. It’s too big for that&nbsp;now.</p><p>Speaking of enforcement, the SEC is now going after DeFi in the form of Uniswap, one of the largest DeFi exchanges.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-investigate-crypto-exchange-developer-uniswap-labs-11630666800?mod=djem10point">the&nbsp;WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the startup behind one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, as regulators probe further into parts of the digital-asset market that have resisted oversight, according to people familiar with the&nbsp;matter.</blockquote><blockquote>Regulators are examining Uniswap Labs, the main developer of the world’s largest decentralized exchange, called Uniswap, the people said. Enforcement attorneys are seeking information about how investors use Uniswap and how it is marketed, the people&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Gensler had spoken about DeFi at Aspen earlier in August. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401?mod=article_inline">The WSJ&nbsp;again</a>:</p><blockquote>But Mr. Gensler, who took over in April, said projects that reward participants with valuable digital tokens or similar incentives could cross a line into activity that should be regulated, no matter how “decentralized” they say they&nbsp;are.</blockquote><blockquote>“There’s still a core group of folks that are not only writing the software, like the open source software, but they often have governance and fees,” Mr. Gensler said. “There’s some incentive structure for those promoters and sponsors in the middle of&nbsp;this.”</blockquote><p>With how DeFi currently works, with users holding and trading assets through a non-custodial wallet, exchanges such as Uniswap don’t have proper AML/KYC procedures in&nbsp;place.</p><p>During this next period of evolution for the DeFi space, various initiatives will start looking toward digital identity solutions in order to comply with existing regulatory frameworks. For the crypto space, where the value of ownership, control, and privacy are put at a premium, expect self-sovereign identity to take a more commanding role going&nbsp;forward.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://blockworks.co/secs-gensler-crypto-needs-regulation-to-survive/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">SEC’s Gensler: Crypto Needs Regulation to Survive — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609">Crypto platforms need regulation to survive, says SEC&nbsp;boss</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-firms-want-fed-payment-systems-accessand-banks-are-resisting-11630143002">Crypto Firms Want Fed Payment Systems Access — and Banks Are Resisting</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-investigate-crypto-exchange-developer-uniswap-labs-11630666800?mod=djem10point">WSJ News Exclusive | Regulators Investigate Crypto-Exchange Developer Uniswap&nbsp;Labs</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/03/sec-investigating-uniswap-labs-report/">SEC Investigating Uniswap Labs:&nbsp;Report</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/03/china-has-completed-rectification-of-crypto-transactions-pboc/">China Has Completed ‘Rectification’ of Crypto Transactions: PBOC</a>  <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/bis-to-test-international-settlements-for-digital-currencies-with-central-banks-66413744">BIS to test international settlements for digital currencies with central&nbsp;banks</a>   2.

The <a href="http://ont.id">ONT.ID</a> website is now live. This product matrix supports comprehensive DID solutions with easy-to-integrate products, friendly to both dApps and traditional web applications.  Ontology partnered with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-4everland-to-accelerate-web-3-0-adoption-dfc658e8ea21">4EVERLAND</a> to accelerate Web 3.0 adoption. Ontology’s primary website, <a href="https://ont.io/">ont.io</a>, has become fully decentralized using 4EVERLAND’s DWeb hosting services. Decentralization of <a href="https://ont.io/">ont.io</a> will facilitate greater security, transparency, and traceability, whilst further improving data processing.    Ontology published its <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1429747737285730304">#WEB3 101</a> Series on domestic and overseas platforms. The thread introduced the decentralized identity solution: ONT ID, OScore, and SAGA, the decentralized data protocol powered by the Ontology blockchain. Ontology provides trust for users with technology, promoting the advent of the Web 3.0&nbsp;era.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>The Machine — <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/08/25/how-to-rebuild-trust-in-web-3-0/">How to (re)build trust in Web&nbsp;3.0</a></p><blockquote>As Web 2.0 mined our interests, activity, and online footprints, a focus on growth over trust opened the door to cybercrime, online harassment, and unconscious bias built into the programming. There is a cyber-attack every 39 seconds, more than 40% of U.S. internet users have reported online harassment, and AI recognizes white-skinned men 34% better than dark-skinned women. So, we simply lose our trust in the web where our data is being breached, our safety is threatened, and the technology discriminates against human&nbsp;beings.</blockquote><p>Ontology’s mission is to return control of data and digital identities to the user. In this way, only the user can decide who can access his or her data. This promotes privacy and autonomy, which are severely lacking in the current Web 2.0 era. Ontology’s solution to the Web 2.0 identity problem is ONT ID and OScore. ONT ID is Ontology’s decentralized identity framework that enables users to control their data and decide whether a third-party can access a particular piece of information about them. It protects user privacy and ensures data security, enabling trusted collaboration.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

Vadim Lander, Symantec Identity Management Security Chief Architect and CTO, Broadcom is to give a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4604/1" title="The Dawn of Digital IAM"> The Dawn of Digital IAM</a> on Monday, September 13 starting at 17:40 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Vadim some questions about his presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How would you describe the state of identity today? </p>
<p>
I think in the identity management space today, we're seeing a number of challenges. Identity is often called the last perimeter or sometimes the only perimeter and now identity has become a highly critical component of the enterprise architecture. And as enterprises continue to figure out how they need to grow, how they need to compete, how they need to pick up the right kind of IT infrastructure. They're also looking at how to modernize their investment in identity and access management, how to modernize the IM architecture itself, to be able to implement the kinds of experiences that businesses need to deliver to their customers. So that is creating what I would say, a revolution for identity and access management, requiring IAM to be revolutionized, modernized, and then rethought in terms of how does it behave? How it's supposed to integrate, and then how is it helping organizations to create great customer experiences?   </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>How should or could identity evolve?   </p>
<p>
I think identity, for the most part, typically looking at it from three perspectives. One perspective is, how does it help a business create the right user experiences? We, as consumers, as employees, as business partners always want to see 360 of the enterprise, of the organization, and then the organization needs to see 360 of us, of our identities and sometimes we call that omni-channel. So, one dimension that identity has to evolve in is in terms of being able to provide us with capabilities across different channels while maintaining security, while maintaining great user experience, while maintaining the right level of privileges. To ensure that identities get what they need and then enterprises handle this security the right way.  </p>
<p>The second point is about being able to bridge the question of entitlements. We've always, as an industry, struggled with what is an entitlement then? How do you properly align the use of the entitlement with the management of entitlement? And so this is the “I” in the IAM as Identity, and the "A” in the IAM is access and being able to fuse the identity aspect of who can do what, and then the access aspect of what are they supposed to be able to do, is really the question. And, we're seeing now steps you need - IAM architecture - to be able to fuse these into fewer data models, simpler data models, and easier to administer, and easier to manage this kind of relationship.  </p>
<p>And third is, I would say, it's the architecture itself, how do we practice identity management? How do we run identity management? Where does it run? So being able to create an environment where identity management itself as an IT architecture can take advantage of modern compute infrastructure, of modern cloud or hybrid cloud environments, and being able to connect the dots across the extended IT fabric of the organization. So the “I” in itself as an architecture is now undergoing changes to be able to take advantage of the latest advances in compute fabrics.   </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>What should be done to make digital IAM a reality?  </p>
<p>
I think it starts with the understanding of what are the goals? What are the business drivers here? Are we looking at expanding or making the user experience great across Omni channel? So, we need to help with the modern way to authenticate identities. The passwordless starts to come into the picture, but not just the passwordless, but also the right level of risk management. Every IAM decision that has to be done with some form of risk being measured and acted upon - and this is exactly, for example - where zero trust principles, zero trust computing comes into the picture. So you have to understand exactly “where are the business needs”?  </p>
<p>How do we help users have much better user experiences? Where do we need to invest to create a more secure and while making it more agile environment? And how are we able to delegate these capabilities to the line of business, to the application teams that have to be able to ramp up their application environments, get the new business apps out the door. So, the line of business teams, the application teams, the IAM program teams and the IT infrastructure have to work together to make this a reality now. </p>

<p><br></p>
<p> Is Identity Fabrics the key to digital transformation and the future of IAM?  </p>
<p>
I think so. I think what we mean when we say identity fabrics is, we mean availability of capabilities. We mean on demand availability of identity, dial tone, which doesn't necessarily mean identity as a service, in terms of SaaS infrastructure. But what it does mean is being able to incorporate identity and security capabilities into the fabric of your applications, no matter where those applications may be now that we don't have a perimeter anymore. Identity is the perimeter. And we need to make sure that the decisions we make regarding identity, regarding who you are, what you're able to do, what are your privileges? Those decisions can be incorporated into the fabric of your applications and that requires use of standards, that require use of APIs. So, I would say now the identity has to be a hundred percent API driven, so they can be incorporated into the fabric of your environment. And that's really where the notion of fabric comes into the picture, meaning that you can put together these scenarios and then have the right level of identity and security products as the fabric of your apps. </p>


<p><br></p>
<p>  Could you give us a sneak peek into your presentation: “The Dawn of Digital IAM”?  </p>
<p>
Yes. So, I'll just mention a couple of things. One is I'll be talking about identity and access management in terms of how it's being modernized. So, how do I think it used to be modernized? What are we, as an organization, doing to help our customers modernize their identity and access management infrastructure? How does this relate to zero trust principles? Because zero trust - being able to incorporate risk into everything we do and making sure that the identity management itself can be seen as an omni-channel, continuous fabric of identity capabilities - really part of this new architecture that IAM used to deliver on. We are working on that. We are working on helping our customers modernize the environments. And, I do believe that the fabrics concept, and the notion of identity services really become key in this modern world. </p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Margus Pala, Founder and CEO at eID Easy, and Johan Nyman, Project Coordinator at Åbo Akademi University. 
<p>In our 50th episode, Margus and Johan discuss eSignatures. Coming from Estonia and Finland, they explore the use (and potential future use) of simple, advanced and qualified eSignatures in two of the world’s most digitally advanced countries. They also delve into how we can standardise the use of eSignatures in Europe, and advice for business owners on what to ask from an eSignature provider.</p>
 <p>Margus Pala</p> 
<p>Margus is from the world’s most digitally advanced country, Estonia, and has seen the future many years ahead of most other countries. He started his professional career as a programming teacher before being part of multiple start-ups, including one unicorn – Playtech. He is also an officer in the Estonian army’s National Guard Cyber Unit and has a master’s degree in Cyber&nbsp;Security. For the last 5 years he has been running <a href="https://eideasy.com/">eID Easy</a>, whose mission is to help everyone benefit from the future of digital identity and electronic signatures – not by breeding faster horses, but going to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Find Margus on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/MargusPala">@MargusPala</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/e_id_easy">@e_id_easy</a> and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smartman/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
 <p>Johan Nyman</p> 
<p>Johan’s interest in digital identity, and specifically electronic signatures, is manifested in two areas: 1) the citizens’ perspective; how citizens can take advantage of national PKI (public key infrastructure) available on their ID cards to produce and use qualified electronic signatures, and 2) the public sector; how organisations working within the public realm, e.g. universities, can use national PKI for issuing e-signed documents, and also how they can raise their awareness and knowledge to handle qualified e-signatures in incoming correspondence from persons using e-signatures. He works as a project manager in university administration at Åbo Akademi, in Turku/Åbo, Finland.</p>

  <p>When it comes to code quality and code security, <a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> is your teammate! This analysis tool is pretty straightforward to use, especially with some help from Docker.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll show you how to run a Docker container with SonarQube to analyze the code of a simple ASP.NET Core 3.0 application. Code analysis is a critical component of app development because it can identify security issues and other tricky bugs that might be overlooked until unexpected behavior impacts end-users. Let’s take a look.</p>

 What Is SonarQube? 

<p>In addition to evaluating the overall health of an application, SonarQube can highlight issues and bugs in the code. With a Quality Gate in place, you can Clean As You Code and improve code quality systematically. Even more, this tool facilitates planning and allocating tasks for a group of programmers.</p>

<p>SonarQube can help measure progress easily and validate the importance of technical work that’s difficult to view or demonstrate, especially with non-technical customers. Let’s explore some of the benefits of SonarQube and how you can implement it in your workflow.</p>

 Key Features of SonarQube 

<p>Before we get started on the tutorial, here are some of the capabilities of SonarQube that make it useful for automating code review in .NET Core:</p>
 
   Quality Gate lets you set an acceptable quality standard for merging branches and releasing applications to production. 
   Code analysis is presented graphically and transparently. Programmers and non-programmers alike gain visibility into coding progress. 
   You gain the insights needed to analyze bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code duplication. 
   Quickly prioritize code changes and improvements. 
   SonarQube doesn’t just pinpoint predefined code quality issues. If you wish, you can create custom rules to monitor specific issues. 
   Support for more than 27 programming languages. SonarQube continues to offer a free and open source Community Edition, along with several Editions for commercial use. 
 

 Prepare the SonarQube Environment 

 Install Java and Docker 

<p>To use SonarQube, first prepare your environment.  The requirements are pretty simple, a Java SDK for starters. We also recommend using Docker; a popular approach nowadays. If it’s your first experience with Docker and you have doubts or questions,  there are many excellent online learning resources including <a>A Developer’s Guide to Docker</a> on this blog.</p>

 
   
    <p>Since SonarScanner uses Java, you’ll need to add a Java SDK (Java 11 or later) to <code>PATH</code>, and you’ll add <code>JAVA_HOME</code> to your system variables.
Download <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">the right version of the Java SDK</a> for your system. During the process, you should accept the default settings. This way all required elements are added to the system variables.</p>
   
   
    <p>Docker provides a popular way to run many solutions without huge effort. You can <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/">download Docker</a> and install it by following the instructions included in the link. The install process is straightforward and you should not anticipate any difficulties.</p>
   
 

 Set Up a Sample Application 

<p>You can use any application you like, but a <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/dotnet-sonarqube-example">sample app</a> comes along with this post. If you choose to work with your own project, simply skip this step.</p>

<p>Next, we need an application to analyze with SonarQube. You can use any application you choose, or you can run the example app I built for this tutorial:</p>

<p>Run</p>

   <code>$ git clone https://github.com/oktadev/dotnet-sonarqube-example
</code>   
<p>And now we’re ready to see what SonarQube can do.</p>

 Analyze Your Project with SonarQube 

 Run SonarQube on Docker 
<p>Start the SonarQube server with the following command:</p>

   <code>docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 -p 9092:9092 sonarqube
</code>   
<p>After you log in the first time (initial credentials are login: “admin” with password “admin”), you’ll be prompted to change the password.</p>

 Install SonarScanner for .NET Core 

 
   Download <a href="https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-msbuild/releases/download/4.7.1.2311/sonar-scanner-msbuild-4.7.1.2311-netcoreapp2.0.zip">SonarScanner</a> from GitHub.
You don’t have to run analyses with user credentials, you can generate tokens instead. For  quick setup in this tutorial, we won’t cover the token approach, but you can learn more about <a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/user-token">user tokens</a> in the SonarQube documentation. 
   Add the path of the extracted SonarScanner folder to your <code>PATH</code> environment variable. 
   Run the command: 
 

   <code>  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-sonarscanner
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE:You can <a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-msbuild/">read more about this setup process</a> in SonarQube documentation.</p>
</blockquote>

 Analyze the Code 

<p>To run SonarScanner, run the following commands:</p>

   <code>dotnet sonarscanner begin /k:"project-key" /d:sonar.login=admin /d:sonar.password=admin
dotnet build &lt;path_to_solution.sln&gt;
dotnet sonarscanner end /d:sonar.login=admin /d:sonar.password=admin
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: Remember to replace “path_to_solution” and “password” with correct ones for your example.</p>
</blockquote>

 Analysis Results in SonarQube 

<p>Take a look at the main view of SonarQube by going to <code>http://localhost:9000</code>. The configured Docker container is exposed on that port. This view presents general information, such as counters for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells or number of code duplications. It’s the simplest view - no-frills metrics.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll find more detailed reports in the Measures section.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For example, it’s possible to determine how many bugs each project file contains and preview the problematic lines of code.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Issues section lets you go deeper into analysis of the source code. SonarQube reports on all possible problems: from minor issues to critical bugs. You can explore every issue in the code that you should take into consideration, along with an explanation of the issue and an estimated time for solving it.</p>

<p></p>

 Additional Configuration and SonarQube Customization 

<p>SonarQube will run on almost any stack. For this reason, you may notice some unwanted notifications. Pre-set rules may not work correctly in all frameworks, and may not know how to handle all file extensions.</p>

<p>Adding custom rules and configuration is a straightforward process, similar to excluding files or paths in GitHub. You can apply custom rules globally for your system or locally for a single project. To be precise, you can:</p>

 
   Completely ignore some files or directories 
   Exclude files/directories from Issues detection (via specific rules or all of them),  but analyze all other aspects 
   Exclude files/directories from Duplications detection but analyze all other aspects 
   Exclude files/directories from Coverage calculations but analyze all other aspects 
 

<p>In order to make adjustments, go to
Administration &gt; General Settings &gt; Analysis Scope (global settings) or
Project Settings &gt; General Settings &gt; Analysis Scope (local configuration).</p>

<p>You can learn more about <a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/project-administration/narrowing-the-focus/">project administration</a> in the SonarQube documentation.</p>

 Code Analysis Matters 

<p>We just explored how to set up SonarQube quickly and without too much effort. The solution we stepped through in this tutorial was based on .NET, however, you can easily apply it to over 20 other popular programming languages.</p>

<p>As a developer, it’s important to stay focused on code quality, especially with tools like SonarQube that make it easier than ever to analyze code and learn best practices for code security and resilience. In the workplace, it’s also essential for developers to produce code that integrates gracefully with the work of others—and with SonarQube as a teammate, coding can become even more of a collaborative team sport.  😉</p>

 Over 1.5 Million Users Now Managing Their Digital Identity Using ONT ID, Ontology’s Decentralized Identity Application  To date, ONT ID has been integrated into a number of leading products through partnerships with Mercedes Benz manufacturer Daimler Mobility, Microworkers, ROCKI and many&nbsp;more. <p>Reflecting a major endorsement for decentralized identity, <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the project bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web 3.0 through decentralized identity and data solutions, announced today that <a href="http://ont.id/">ONT ID</a>, its decentralized digital identity application, has surpassed 1.5 million&nbsp;users.</p><p>ONT ID uses blockchain and cryptographic technology to connect people, data, and services in a decentralized way. It allows users to take charge of their digital identity by giving them control of how and when their information is shared, and with whom. Centralized systems have repeatedly failed to safeguard user data, with more data breaches and hacks announced every day. As such, users are embracing blockchain solutions to protect their digital identities.</p><p>Reflecting that trends in the wider crypto ecosystem drive uptake in different areas of the blockchain sector, ONT ID experienced a spike in sign-ups during the crypto bull run in mid June of this year. The application’s user base is predominantly based in Asia (50%), reflecting a strong appetite for decentralized digital identity applications there, followed by the United States&nbsp;(7%).</p><p>Companies across the globe have embraced ONT ID. Ontology has <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/welcome-home-is-now-approved-f8aada08a1bc">partnered</a> with Mercedes Benz-manufacturer Daimler Mobility to develop ‘Welcome Home’, an in-car personalization and management solution that uses ONT ID to store drivers’ in-car preferences. Pushing social good through a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/microworkers-integrates-ontologys-onto-wallet-to-facilitate-additional-payment-options-for-workers-1163291af76c">partnership</a> with global freelancing marketplace leader <a href="https://www.microworkers.com/">MicroWorkers</a>, ONT ID is also being used to assist workers to receive rewards and gain greater access to capital. More recently, Ontology <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ontology+rocki&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enIE945IE945&amp;oq=ontology+rocki&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61l2.2769j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">partnered</a> with <a href="https://rocki.app/">ROCKI</a>, a next-generation music streaming service and NFT platform built on <a href="https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain">Binance Smart Chain</a> (BSC), to use its decentralized identity solutions to prevent bad actors from impersonating artists and help buyers avoid purchasing inauthentic NFTs.</p><p>Ontology’s interoperable tools and multi-virtual machine support give developers the tools they need to build upon ONT ID. Businesses don’t need to discard their existing systems — Ontology’s decentralized identity and data protocol is a complementary layer that integrates seamlessly with existing systems and ONT ID’s software development kits (SDK) can be integrated in&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>Commenting on the milestone Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, said:</p><blockquote>The fact that over 1.5 million users have embraced decentralized identity through ONT ID reflects the significant appetite for blockchain solutions that safeguard user privacy in the midst of ongoing scamming, identity fraud, data leaks and ransomware attacks. Our upgraded product will make it easier for developers to utilize ONT ID and develop novel use cases that feed into the wider decentralized identity ecosystem.</blockquote><p>To facilitate its ever expanding user base, ONT ID has undergone an upgrade that will improve the user experience, whilst also making it easier for developers to build sophisticated applications and real world use cases through ONT ID. The Ontology products now integrated with ONT ID&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>, a new feature that makes trustless universal authentication for websites and applications possible, allowing users to log into multiple platforms without having to remember passwords.  <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a>, Ontology’s new decentralized solution for online identity verification, which helps applications access users’ verifiable credentials, such as KYC verification, whilst also allowing users to protect their privacy by authorizing information independently.  <a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a>, a DeFi credit score, used to measure creditworthiness, which is calculated using different types of on-chain transaction data.  <p>Humpty Calderon, Head of Community at Ontology, added:</p><blockquote>It is incredible to see that over 1.5 million users are now registered with ONT ID. To put this into context, that’s over a fifth of the population of Singapore! As more and more people seek to protect their identities using our solutions, we will work hard to incubate a community that supports their needs and takes into account their feedback and views on our products as we progress.</blockquote><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Digital Identity for Development — and protection Afghan election commission workers transfer data from biometric devices to the main server in Kabul, October 2019. Photograph: Mohammad Ismail/Reuters — from the Guardian’s version of this&nbsp;story<p>On August 27th, the Taliban<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/27/taliban-kill-squad-hunting-afghans-with-americas-biometric-data/"> boasted of using US digital identity technology to hunt down Afghans who had worked with the international coalition</a>. This poses a huge threat to all Afghans who are recorded in these identification systems, and should be a wake-up call to all those working on digital identity and digital public infrastructure for development.</p><p>The Taliban’s claim was made just days before the formal departure of the coalition forces and the Taliban takeover of the Afghan government. In addition to the US military’s<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-taliban-may-have-access-to-the-biometric-data-of-civilians-who-helped-the-u-s-military-166475"> Handheld Interagency Identity Detection Equipment (HIIDE, biometrics devices)&nbsp;,</a> the Taliban takeover means they also have access to and control over the digital identification systems and technologies that had been built through international aid support&nbsp;. These include the<a href="https://asan.gov.af/Eng/"> e-Tazkira</a>, a biometric identity card used by Afghanistan’s National Statistics and Information Authority, which includes fingerprints, iris scans, and photographs, as well as<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-election-technology-idUSKBN1WD0DM"> voter registration databases</a> and the<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/30/1033941/afghanistan-biometric-databases-us-military-40-data-points/"> Afghan Personnel and Pay System (APPS), used by both the Afghan Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defense to pay the national army and police</a>. As a result, many Afghans are<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-tech-conflict/afghans-scramble-to-delete-digital-history-evade-biometrics-idUSL8N2PO1FH"> “frantically going through phones to delete messages they have sent, music they’ve listened to &amp; pictures they’ve taken,” BBC reporter Sana Safi wrote on Twitter on August 15.</a> For those in official databases, particularly the APPS, user deletion is not an&nbsp;option.</p><p>What does this situation mean for Afghanistan, for Afghans, and for the wider international community working on digital identification for development?</p><p>For Afghanistan and Afghans, it means that the Taliban have sensitive personally identifiable information that they have said they will use to target those they deem enemies or threats. Of course, these databases are not the only way they might be identified — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/26/us-officials-provided-taliban-with-names-of-americans-afghan-allies-to-evacuate-506957">US officials gave the Taliban names and details of American and Afghan allies to assist in evacuation efforts</a>, while<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-staff-left-documents-afghans-working-them-british-embassy-kabul-the-times-2021-08-26/"> the UK had to rescue families of Afghan embassy staff whose names had been left behind at the embassy</a>. Quite apart from anything else, the evacuation has shown how badly information security has been handled by the coalition — another reason for an expanded immigration offer to all&nbsp;Afghans.</p><p>For those working on digital identification for development and more broadly, what are the lessons? For a start, it is a wake-up call to remind us that that development benefits of identification systems, enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goal 16.9 — Right to Legal Identity — should not come at the expense of individual safety. To date, the international development community’s efforts have focused on adoption and inclusion — the fastest and cheapest ways to make everyone visible to the state in order to manage access to rights and entitlements.</p><p>The benefits of inclusion in digital identification systems are well known. Identification is<a href="https://statelessnessandcitizenshipreview.com/index.php/journal/article/view/187"> key to obtaining legal status, recognition, and associated rights and entitlements</a>. The World Bank notes that<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2019/08/14/inclusive-and-trusted-digital-id-can-unlock-opportunities-for-the-worlds-most-vulnerable"> without some form of legal identity people are unable to access critical healthcare and social services, enroll in school, open a bank account, obtain a mobile phone, get a job, vote in an election, or register a business in the formal sector — along with other basic services, rights, and opportunities that would empower them to improve their live</a>s. The World Bank also notes that <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2019/08/14/inclusive-and-trusted-digital-id-can-unlock-opportunities-for-the-worlds-most-vulnerable">women are disproportionately less likely to have official proof of identity; women, refugees, stateless persons, people with disabilities, and people living in rural and remote areas often face the greatest hurdles to obtaining official&nbsp;IDs.</a></p><p>Digital Identity and&nbsp;Risk</p><p>Despite growing calls from a number of organisations for a greater focus on the risks of new digital technologies, the issue of digital identity and protection has not received the same level of attention and access and inclusion, in part because<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517211006744"> debate is polarised between advocates and critics,</a>. For example, Privacy International have long<a href="https://privacyinternational.org/campaigns/demanding-identity-systems-our-terms"> advocated for greater attention to security</a>&nbsp;,including on<a href="https://privacyinternational.org/report/4529/biometrics-and-counter-terrorism-case-study-iraq-and-afghanistan"> Afghanistan’s biometrics programmes</a>, and Access Now’s campaign on rationales for digital identity have pushed particular security and privacy concerns. At a higher level, initiatives such as the World Bank–hosted<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/principles"> Principles on Identification for Sustainable Development</a> and the<a href="http://good-id.org/"> Omidyar Network–supported Good ID initiative</a> (which Caribou Digital helped initiate) assert a normative approach founded on the belief that digital ID can ‘be good for all.’ However, as analyses of the risks and dangers of digital identitifcation emerge — <a href="https://blogs.prio.org/2021/08/contingency-planning-in-the-digital-age-biometric-data-of-afghans-must-be-reconsidered/">such as Jacobsen and Steinacker’s in-depth perspective on humanitarian and military biometrics in Afghanistan</a> — concerns about the downsides of these technologies are only going to grow as the contexts in which digital identification systems are deployed increasingly<a href="https://www.kerenweitzberg.com/post/the-future-of-biometrics-not-fintech-rationing-universal-basic-income-border-enforcement"> face the threats of climate change, inequality, and conflict</a>, leading to political instability.</p><p>Digital identity systems are like all technologies — they are<a href="https://www.kerenweitzberg.com/post/the-future-of-biometrics-not-fintech-rationing-universal-basic-income-border-enforcement"> neither good nor bad, but never neutral,</a> and they<a href="https://www.kentarotoyama.org/papers/Toyama%202011%20iConference%20-%20Technology%20as%20Amplifier.pdf"> amplify the power of those that control them</a>. No technology is going to change the intent of actors such as the Taliban to target those they wish to find. In the face of these inevitable political risks, the deployment of digital identification systems needs to get smarter about understanding the political interests and risks that shape the contexts in which identification systems are used — our<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/kenyas-identification-ecosystem-7cbc2ee27"> ID Ecosystem Mapping tool</a> supports risk assessment arising from the deployment of digital identification systems.</p><p>Strategies for Protection</p><p>But even where political risks are identified, identification systems are still going to be rolled out, so we must start paying more attention to emerging approaches to data management and technologies that might mitigate the misuse of these technologies by bad&nbsp;actors.</p><p>For example, we need to instil a greater focus on the ‘data minimisation principle,’ as outlined in the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/data-minimization-principle/"> the idea that one should only collect and retain that personal data which is necessary</a>, and not collect more information than is needed. This approach contrasts with the<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-tech-rights-idUSKBN29C2UL"> South African proposal from earlier this year to collect all sorts of biometric and other data</a>, including from&nbsp;babies.</p><p>We also need to move away from centralised data collection approaches, and instead focus on decentralised approaches that place greater control over data in the hands of individuals. For example, there could be a greater emphasis on decentrasiling the storage of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) through the use of<a href="https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2019/10/18/innovation-protection-icrc-biometrics-policy/"> smart cards that store data, rather than dumb cards with centralised data storage — an approach advocated for by the International Committe of the Red Cross</a>.&nbsp;.</p><p>We can also learn from efforts to decentralise data storage and control — what some call federated or self-sovereign identification systems. Countries such as<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/suche/germany-and-spain-and-join-forces-on-the-development-of-a-cross-border-decentralised-digital-identity-ecosystem-1947302"> Germany, Spain</a>, and the<a href="https://www.blockchain-lab.org/trust/"> Netherlands</a> are developing digital wallet–based identification systems to hold verified credentials, while the EU’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en">COVID-19 vaccine passport</a> employs a similar&nbsp;model.</p><p>Established technologies such as<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/zero-knowledge-proofs/"> Zero Knowledge Proofs</a> and emerging innovations such as encrypted hashes of sensitive information can support greater protection over personal data. For example,<a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2020/signed-sealed-encrypted-this-digital-id-is-all-yours/"> Mastercard and TrustStamp’s</a> encrypted hash of biometric data makes it almost impossible to identify individuals without Mastercard’s proprietary algorithm&nbsp;; humanitarian organisations are developing similar technologies.</p><p>But while there are scattered, isolated examples of efforts to develop better approaches and innovations to better protect people and their data, there is no established, independent body of knowledge and expertise addressing these issues. There is a need for independent, critical research and advisory services on this critically important topic. There is a wealth of expertise, dispersed around the world in various governments, companies and associations, in niche newsletter groups, and online publications that could usefully contribute to thinking and policy positions, particularly for development donors, to support decision-making and investment that can help advance the benefits of digital identification whilst ensuring that their risks are mitigated.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identity-for-development-and-protection-d92716f24bb6">Digital Identity for Development — and protection</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Kay some questions about Kantara’s planned workshop.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Which audience do you hope to attract to the Kantara workshop? </p>
<p>
We really hope that a diverse audience will be attracted to the Kantara workshop. The reason I say that is - we're very focused, obviously in the work we do around identity, around assurance programs, around really developing what we recommend the part of standards that are used internationally. And then also taking that the next step and making sure that those standards are implemented in the identity products that are available in the field. So I hope that we will attract people with a variety of interests who want to learn about - what are some of the cutting edge issues, especially around identity standards that we are trying to tackle - much of which there is – it's all new work that's happening.</p>
<p> So I hope that people will be interested for that reason. And I also hope that people who are interested in implementing good protocols, procedures, products that balance privacy and security, and are really held to a very high standard, will also be interested to find out what we're doing, to help those in the field, to really be able to manage that, because it's a tricky balance. We have a program with a lot of integrity that I hope people will be interested to learn more about.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>What are Kantara's goals? </p>
<p>
The mission of Kantara is to grow and fulfill the market for trustworthy use of identity and personal data. And that's a very broad mission. But to do that, some of the things you see in our mission are words like trust, grow, fulfilling what the market needs. So, those are kind of areas that we focus on. We do this in a couple of ways. One, we have what I would describe as a stellar, really a remarkable assurance program, which provides companies and governments with the ability to trust services that are held to a set of service criteria. So that's really important. The other goal is that we have been a trust framework provider since about 2010. So we have accredited assessors. We have approved service providers, it's all based on agreed service assessment criteria.   </p>
<p>So, it's a very structured program and in some ways it's very tough. But that said, it really is a program with so much integrity and it really provides the ability for a third-party assessment to help those who want to provide services. As I mentioned, that really balanced that privacy and security in an efficient and effective manner, and yet is able to support that trust that is really needed in the system. So those are pretty broad goals, but we also, in many ways - and I think I hope this is clear to people - we're a neutral body, so we're not supporting specific ways to solve for any of these. What we're saying is, let's all be held to this high standard so that the products that people come up with, that they have developed really meet the needs of the users and of government agencies and of those in the field.  So, those are, I think, our big sort of high-level goals.  </p>


<p><br></p>
<p>What would you like the key takeaways of the workshop to be? </p>
<p>
Going back to some of the things that I said about the goals, I really hope that they will take away a couple of things. One, Kantara as a neutral body, as a nonprofit is a place where people can engage and they can be a part of these discussions so that they are learning and building their own professional knowledge and skills. And at the same time, they're contributing to these emerging areas where the standards are not well-developed yet, but we need the voice of the people in the community. So it is a wonderful opportunity for people to get involved and I would encourage them to consider that. And it's also an area where we need more diversity. We need more people to be engaged. Kantara is very much a global organization.   </p>
<p>And so we really open our doors to folks who work in this industry from all different parts of the world. And I think coming together to understand and build systems that are standards based, and assess to a specific set of criteria is very important. And I hope that people will walk away feeling like they understand the work that we're doing, but also that they see an opportunity for themselves to get engaged. And we hope they will.  </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Has the pandemic affected Kantara's plans? </p>
<p>
The pandemic really hasn't affected our plans in terms of our mission and vision remained the same. If anything, I think it is emphasized and made that mission even more critical. So it's become more important to have programs, to have identity products, to provide services that, as I said, assure that privacy and still maintain security, and that are interoperable, that work collaboratively with the private sector and with government entities.   </p>
<p>I see Kantara as the organization that can help make that a reality. And so, in that sense, the way that it has affected us has made our mission even more critical than it was before. So, in many ways, it's a leap forward. It is not a step back and we're very committed to that. We're very committed to maintaining an assurance program that's dedicated to the highest level of ethics and confidentiality standards - really support service providers. We're very dedicated to that. And the pandemic has just made that even more of a priority. So in some ways it's a blessing in disguise. It has turned out, I think, that has just heightened the level of interest and focus on the work we do.   </p>


<p><br></p>
<p>Are there new areas of focus for you in Kantara? </p>
<p>
There are some new areas, and there's probably more than I'm going to be able to list today. So hopefully people will come to the workshop because I think you'll get a chance to hear a lot more about many of the new areas. I'll just highlight a couple things. One, a new area of focus is on mobile driver's licenses. That is really something that is taking off - that is a growing area. And there's a real need for standards and criteria in that specific area, because it's relatively new. But again, in many ways, the pandemic has made the focus on that more critical than it might've been. So a lot of things has sort of jumped to lightspeed because of the pandemic, because now we are so reliant on being able to do all of these different things virtually and identity proofing has become more important than ever.   </p>
<p>And there's a lot of issues with the pandemic that need to be addressed. So that's one - another area that I hope we will work on – and this is as a new executive director – I am hoping for more diverse participation. I would love to encourage others who might have seen the Kantara organization as a little bit more narrowly focused to encourage you, that we support diversity in our membership and in all of the activities and the work that we do. And that's very important. And so I hope that that will be an area of focus that we will encourage that broader participation. So, I hope that folks coming to the workshop will be interested to learn again, how they can get involved. And I think help us, because the more diverse that we are, the better work products we're going to have, right? We're going to be establishing new input on standards, the more diverse the participation, the better that's going to be, and that permeates everything that we do. So we're very excited to open up our doors to many folks to get involved. So I hope the conference participants will really consider taking a few moments to comment here about the new goals and the new products and the new areas that we're working in. </p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/hill">Richard Hill</a></p>A trend compelling IGA modernization is the need for an Identity driven security model; due to identity silos created by rapid cloud adoption. As organizations rethink their IAM/IGA systems, they may also need to utilize their existing systems while re-architecting their security environment to support new requirements. Keeping what it already has and having the ability to gradually migrate from these legacy systems to what it wants in the future using modern software architecture is pivotal. An Identity Fabric provides the agility and the integration support for what organizations already have while allowing organizations to move ahead at their own speed.

<p>I’ve now used versions of this post in various presentations, including a UN/CEFACT Forum Webinar, the Blockchain Technology Symposium 2021 (BTS’ 21) and others. </p>
<p>I feel like it’s a good primer on Self-Sovereign Identity, that takes us away from the technology, allowing us to focus more on the why. </p>
<p>I’d like to thank John Jordan, Executive Director for the BC Digital Trust Services for explaining the concept of Digital Trust to me so elegantly, which in turn allowed me to better frame it for folks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Digital Trust? 
<p>We tend to focus too much about the tech behind Self-Sovereign Identity. This leads us down rabbit holes to do with standards, protocols, blockchains, cryptography and more. But what’s the purpose of SSI? It’s about enabling Digital Trust (which is quickly becoming an integral part of digital transformation for organizations).</p>
<p>First, we’re talking about Digital Trust and Trust in general. That’s a very high-level idea, so let’s break that down a little bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we talk about Trust, generally speaking, we focus on a relationship between two parties.&nbsp;For example, perhaps between me and another individual like you the reader; or between me and a business that I’m going to do something with; or a relationship between a business to a business.</p>
<p>My full-time job is with Northern Block, and there’s a trust model between Northern Block and its employees. In this case, I’m talking about a relationship between two parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The determination of trust is a combination of things;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Do I have some type of method of conveying trust between those two parties in the context of a transaction; and&nbsp; 
 Do I have an understanding of why I would trust that other party? 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Interactions and Relationships in the Physical World 
<p>In the case of a business to a business transaction, we tend to develop relationships through human interaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We find each other’s business, we’re going to become a supplier or a customer, and then we tend to have a mechanism by which we formalize that relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We call this a contract, and contracts are everywhere. Contracts are one of the key mechanisms we have in society for establishing a formal relationship, and defining the boundaries of that relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If somebody goes outside of those boundaries, it’s governed by the contract.</p>
<p>Now, shifting the topic bit..</p>
<p>Personal identity is given to you by the Government in a lot of ways; that is, in an administrative sense, and not your philosophical sense of being, and who you are.&nbsp; Rather, the fact that I can say that my name is Mathieu Glaude, and my age is x and so forth. Those attributes or characteristics of one are attested to by the Government, based on an administrative process of registration and their authority to manage that.</p>
<p>In the same way for businesses, we have business registries, and they have a process for creating legal entities. It is these sources of truth, or these administrative authorities, which allow us to enter into contracts.</p>
<p>Back before these things we call computers were around, it was difficult to create or recreate these documents, because printing presses were big and expensive, and there were techniques that could be deployed by them to prevent fraudulent copies of these things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And importantly, because everything was on the physical edge (credentials, interactions), and because things happened at paper speed, the risks were relatively low in terms of the wide-scale ability to defraud.</p>
 Interactions and Relationships in the Digital World 
<p>In turn, the web has introduced a new actor, that we don’t have an equivalent for in the physical world.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the web, we have this idea of ‘login’; there’s an intermediary between me and another person, or between me and the business I’m trying to do something with, and so forth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This intermediary has no defined role in any of our legal structures. For example, there’s no such thing as ‘the login service’ in the Business Corporations Act of Ontario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, because we have this login service, there’s a sort of ‘middle person’ in between our relationships, which has some very significant consequences.</p>
<p>One of the consequences is that it means that none of my relationships online are confidential: meaning that they’re not only known between me and the party I’m trying to interact with. </p>
<p>If I go to the gym, or I go to rent a car, or I go to the doctor or the lawyer or whatever, that interaction that happens is private. It’s not known, generally speaking, by any other entity, including the Government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all of my relationships were known, then I would be very unhappy — we call that surveillance, and that would be a severe privacy erosion.</p>
<p>As a result, we don’t even have the conditions on the web for privacy.&nbsp;By the very architectural structure of it, there must be a login service in order for me to connect to another party.&nbsp;By definition, that means it’s not confidential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, the information or data that I exchange with that other party is subject to loss; that other party I’m talking to gathers a lot of information about me, and if they don’t protect it well, it can be stolen.</p>
<p>There’s this Trust Model that applies to the physical world in transactions, and we’re creating the equivalent digitally now.</p>
 The Verifiable Credential Trust Triangle 
<p>When we talk about the Trust Triangle, we use this jargon called “Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers,” and that exactly maps to the world that we have today.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We often play those roles at different times and in various interactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To give an example: let’s use the onboarding a corporate customer to a financial institution (opening up a business account), just because we’ve been covering lots of these types of use cases at <a href="https://northernblock.io/about/">Northern Block</a>.</p>
<p>Originally, we would say that the Bank is going to be a Verifier. It’s going to take on the Verifier role; you’re going to show up at the Bank’s door, and you’re going to say, “I’d like to open up an account.”</p>
<p>The Bank would say, “Great, tell me some things about yourself, so that I can understand who I’m doing business or working with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you’d provide your Personal ID from a reliable source, such a a driver’s licence, articles of incorporation, etc. The Bank needs to verify you, the company and ensure delegated authority to act on behalf of the company. They’re verifying this information. They have a business process to approve it, and when they approve it, they become an Issuer.</p>
<p>They will issue you credentials to a bank account. All the while, you as the individual, and you as the individual representing the corporation, are what’s called the Holder.</p>
<p> You’ll note in this model that there’s no mention of login or intermediary </p>
<p>Your interaction with the bank is a Direct and Private one.</p>
<p>Just as your relationship with whoever issued you your credentials that you’re presenting to the Bank (e.g., Government) are private to you as well.</p>
<p>At no time does the other party know of the other relationship.</p>
 Digital Verifiable Data 
<p>This new digital mechanism I’m discussing, ensures that the authenticity and origin of the digital credential being presented to the bank can be verified, without a third party.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can have a direct relationship with the entity you’re interacting with.</p>
<p><a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/features/">And this process is now doable digitally</a>, through Verifiable Credentials, Wallet Technology and Blockchain.</p>
<p>Entities can trust the credentials being presented to them through with a blockchain acting as a root of trust. Verifiers can query the blockchain to find out if what is being presented to them is valid, who it’s been issued from and whether or not its been tampered with.</p>
<p>The other piece not being displayed here is the governance piece. And we’re working within the <a href="https://northernblock.io/toip-101/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> to build the Governance models across the stack, to manage business legal, technology and social governance frameworks.</p>

 ONT Login, the decentralized identity universal login component based on ONT ID and ONT TAG, the batch verification solution have been officially released, forming a complete Ontology DID product matrix together with the on-chain credit score&nbsp;OScore. <p>The world is becoming increasingly digitized, with Web 3.0 right around the corner. With more and more of our lives being spent online, it is essential to develop a reliable and trustless way to verify who we are. Blockchain has equipped us with the technology needed to not only authenticate identities on-chain, but to do so in a way that protects user privacy. ONT ID is Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, designed to be both trustless and private, empowering users. This article outlines ONT ID’s key features, along with its complementary services, ONT Login and ONT&nbsp;TAG.</p><p>ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework that complies with W3C’s recommended standards for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. Based on blockchain and cryptography, ONT ID can quickly identify and connect people, data and services. Decentralization, self-management, privacy protection, and ease of use are the key features of ONT ID that ensure users fully control their data and identity.</p><p>As a blockchain project focusing on bringing secure, trusted, and privacy-respecting decentralized identity and data solutions to Web 3.0, Ontology focuses on building a Web 3.0 trust infrastructure, allowing individuals and businesses to apply decentralized identity solutions whilst fully respecting user privacy. After over three years of development, Ontology released its on-chain credit system, OScore, designed for programmable reputation based on ONT ID. OScore is integrated with Wing Finance, Ontology’s decentralized digital asset transfer protocol, a real application for decentralized credit. On this basis, the newly released centralized identity universal login component <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a> and the batch verification solution ONT TAG have further enriched the Ontology DID product matrix, bringing better product experiences for application parties and individual users.</p> ONT Login <p>Traditional servers use the “username + password” method for authentication and login. Due to the security risks of this authentication method and the tendency of users to reuse the same password on different platforms, this brings a lot of cost, security, and user experience problems. At the same time, many services require users to bind information such as mailboxes, phone numbers, and social media accounts. Users need to prove the authenticity of this information through OAuth or verification codes. This way of information authorization increases the user’s&nbsp;costs.</p><p><a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a> is a Decentralized Universal Authentication login component designed to solve these problems. By helping developers shield the details of authentication implementation, ONT Login can bring enterprises into the Web 3.0 era with secure login experience. ONT Login standardizes the centralized authentication protocol and provides front-end and back-end SDKs for rapid integration between suppliers and users. At the same time, it provides a communication interface with a decentralized identity management wallet to facilitate rapid integration of identity management applications.</p><p>As a product for all Web 3.0 and traditional Internet application developers, ONT Login has the following advantages:</p>  No need for third-party trust: Achieve safe and effective verification of user identities and data in a decentralized manner; adopt a challenge-response authentication model and use digital signature technology to ensure the security of the authentication process.  Password-free login: Users do not need to memorize complex passwords; avoids risks such as server collision with the database; improves user information security; in the decentralized identity wallet, users can verify their email, phone number, etc., and obtain relevant credentials; when logging into different service parties, you can directly show the relevant credentials, eliminating the need for multiple verifications.  Independent management of information authorization: Using decentralized identification and verifiable credential technology, users can log in quickly while selectively authorizing necessary information to the server, protecting their&nbsp;privacy.  Rapid deployment: Provide front-end JavaScript SDK, and provide back-end Golang/Java SDK suppliers to quickly integrate in&nbsp;minutes.  <p>ONT Login not only supports traditional internet platforms to achieve Web 3.0 login methods, but also supports various blockchain systems including public chain alliance chains, multiple DID methods, and multiple digital signature mechanisms. In short, ONT Login can be configured to support specific business&nbsp;needs.</p> ONT TAG <p>Due to increasingly expensive gas fees on Ethereum, it is not cost efficient to perform individual transactions to authenticate user identities. <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a> solves this problem by enabling applications to authorize user authentication results.</p><p>In short, ONT TAG is a complete DID-based batch verification solution. By using ONT TAG, an application can quickly obtain the user’s verifiable credentials with the user’s authorization. The authorization process is also performed whilst protecting user privacy. If and when to authorize access to user data is determined solely by the&nbsp;user.</p><p>The advantages of <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a> are not limited to these. This set of solutions fully takes into account the verification requirements of users and applications for specific information sources. Integrating Ontology’s own resource advantages, it can provide KYC verification by multiple international authoritative identity authentication service providers including CFCA, IdentityMind, Shufti Pro, etc., as well as social account platforms including Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>When any decentralized application (dApp) or Web 2.0 application applies for a credential through ONT TAG, ONT TAG immediately retrieves the information provided by each integrated trust anchor and generates a credential. When the application initiates a request to obtain the credential from the ONT TAG, it can be automatically sent to the user through the application, and the user decides how to display the credential to the application. The entire process only takes a few minutes, is cheap, and prevents the application from collecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>As people have become more aware of their digital identities and data privacy, more and more countries have established laws and regulations to protect user data. These include the European Data Protection Act (GDPR), California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and China’s “Personal Information Protection Act”. ONT ID is a complete decentralized identity framework featuring a user credit evaluation function, universal login system, and batch verification mechanism for authentication of user data. Based on ONT ID’s previous integrations with world-renowned automobile manufacturer Daimler Mobility, decentralized music streaming and NFT platform ROCKI, Ontology is already providing solutions in a variety of technical industries.</p><p>Log into <a href="http://ont.id">ONT.ID</a> now to access the development documents and SDK for OScore, ONT Login and ONT&nbsp;TAG.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Joni some questions about her planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In what ways has the pandemic impacted digital identity ecosystems?</p>
<p>
The pandemic has absolutely impacted digital ID ecosystems. It's done so in a number of ways, it's driven demand for people to start working from home, who hadn't before in the past, it's driven more need for convenient use of services that have more higher risk profiles, such as banking or needing to transact with governments. And absolutely from an enterprise perspective, when we have people's patterns changing, we have workforces that are now working from home. It's driven the need for more and more security while maintaining that quality workforce being engaged in the ecosystem. Of course, if we look at the pandemic and the terms of proving particular attributes, like have you received a vaccine or not, or is your COVID 19 tests negative or not?  If we think about those concepts, what's really important, important about them is that they are in fact bound to a digital identity, a COVID test or a, or a vaccine proof doesn't necessarily matter, unless we know that you are the person that is attached to that particular attribute.</p>
<p>So COVID-19 pandemic has driven all of these demands forward with a more urgent and a much higher level to where in the past, when we talked about digital ID, sometimes we talked about it as more of a convenience so that we could transact easily from anywhere now it's about life needs, ensuring that food can stay on the table, that people can stay employed, that the economy can keep moving forward, while not leaving anyone behind. So ensuring that we have social inclusion and its social equity in these systems as we move forward in the pandemic. </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>When it comes to digital ID, there is always a tradeoff between security and usability. What should vendors, or anyone building identity platforms, focus on? </p>
<p>
So when we talk around digital ID, we often hear that there are trade offs between security and usability or between security and privacy, for example,I really think we should challenge vendors to try to look at the ecosystem more as a positive sum approach. And so how can we build security and usability? How can we build in security and privacy? I think there's a challenge first of all, to really look at this ecosystem as additive, versus, you know, having to have one or the other, in terms of usability, we have to have usability. These systems have to be easy for people to use and in a lot of cases, we're just not there yet. And so we may find that the most easy to use solution will win the day, but it will be very low or much lower in terms of security or privacy and personal data protection.   </p>
<p>So the identity and access management, industry practitioners and vendors and ecosystem at large, is really challenged to try to bring each of these forward and security and privacy security and usability, and that takes commitment and investment user testing. We certainly are making it further down in terms of progress to get to systems that are, have all of these features. So I think we should try to ensure that we have the easiest system that we can use, a lot of education around these systems, while not lowering or degrading the privacy protection the personal data control and the security protection. That is the foundation of the challenges that we're trying to solve with digital identity.   </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Could you deep dive on the biggest security challenges when it comes to digital ID? </p>
<p>
Some of the biggest security challenges regarding digital ID. I would say really do rely on the fact that the system that we are working with has flaws from a digital ID perspective that are built into it. And so we know that the internet was not built with an identity layer. And so some of the challenges in this space are,  shall we build a new internet that now has an identity layer, or shall we build an identity layer, that can hook into the existing systems? And I would say we really whenever we see the idea of, should we do one thing or another thing we should challenge ourselves to try to do both of those things and try to bridge those things together. And so we don't have an identity layer in the current internet. There is work being done to build that those capabilities and those solutions, and they do exist in different solutions and in different ecosystems today.</p>
<p>There are other communities who are trying to, if you will rebuild the internet from the ground up. And so both of these piles should be encouraged. And the challenges sometimes are brought about by fracture in terms of marketplace fracture, in terms of developers and vendors, as well as relying parties and clients trying to determine which direction they should invest in. And so I would really encourage and, and, and, and try to push our communities that when we see this kind of fracture happening for one approach or another approach, we should really challenge ourselves to build bridges between these approaches. We should really focus on globally interoperable standards that are being built in often in associations of industry practitioners, who have the experience and the know-how, and are trying to build things such as, for example, a common data model, like the W3C work for a common data model for verifiable credentials would be one example. Where we see, I think fracture is one of the largest challenges, particularly for investors for the, for the, the marketplace. And we as a community should be working to address that fracture while promoting choice of solution and approach. And, and one of the ways you do that is by working with industry standards that are global, and are, and are built by industry expert practitioners.  </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Could you give us a sneak peek into your keynote at EIC? </p>
<p>
I'd love to give you a sneak peek into my keynote for this year's European Identity and Cloud Conference. As the president of the digital ID and authentication council of Canada, I will be discussing some of the main work that we do, which is the Pan-Canadian trust framework, a technology agnostic framework of rules and tools so that different solutions can exist in one ecosystem, with a baseline of requirements, providing people and clients with a choice about how and which systems they'd like to use. We've done some year over year research regarding digital identity. And so we see where perspectives have changed and where they've stayed the same, with regard to personal data sharing convenience versus security, usability versus security, what are, what are people really demanding, when it comes to digital identity and how in fact COVID, and the different realities of living in COVID in a world of social distancing and less travel and working from home,  which populations have been most affected, and where are they from which actors and from which stakeholders are they looking for their solutions to come from?</p>
<p>
And who are they trusting, for management and access to personal data? So it's great demographic research that intersects, some of the realities around market awareness and understanding, or on digital identity itself, and how the COVID-19 pandemic and everything that comes with it has intersected if people's perspectives and their demand. And the short story is, COVID-19 has driven,  more demand for digital identity and we'll get into some of the details, and the demographics, and around what people are thinking. </p>

 Self Sovereign Identity/Decentralised Identity and Financial Services Webinar — A&nbsp;Synopsis <p>September 2nd, 2021 was a big day for all of us in the Global Developer Ecosystem (GDE) team of Affinidi as we geared to host our first <a href="https://youtu.be/kR0IGOqmEwI">webinar on Self Sovereign Identity/Decentralised Identity and Financial Services</a> with Varsha Jagdale (General Manager of Financial Services at Affinidi) and Joseph Thompson (CEO of AID:Tech) as the speakers.</p><p>Sandeep, our Community Manager at Affinidi, was the host, and he started by giving a brief introduction on <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> and Affinidi’s work in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>This was followed by Varsha Jagdale who spoke about what Affinidi is doing in the financial services industry.</p> Varsha Jagdale — Impact of SSI on Financial Services <p>Varsha used real-life scenarios to describe the huge changes that the financial industry has gone through in the last few years and also the challenges that come with these&nbsp;changes.</p><p>For example, she talked about the pushcart owners in Indonesia who represent one of the lowest socioeconomic segments of the&nbsp;society.</p>Street Food vendors — Indonesia<p>These vendors borrow money in the morning to buy the supplies, make food, and sell it to customers through their pushcarts. At the end of the day, they return the money borrowed with interest, Typically, the interest rate is around 10 to 15% for this microloan, thereby leaving them with very little money in their&nbsp;pockets.</p><p>Another scenario that Varsha talked about is tech company deals that typically take around 12 to 18 months to complete.</p>Closing a Business Deal — 12 to 18&nbsp;months<p>This long cycle is mostly due to the long time that banks take to go through their processes before approving/financing the&nbsp;deal.</p><p>Another player in the financial spectrum is the SMEs that are involved in the export and import of goods. Most times, these companies are too small to get loans from banks and don’t have the documents and processes required for the Know-Your-Business (KYB) process of&nbsp;banks.</p><p>She explained that a common theme across all these scenarios is a lack of trust, where one entity doesn’t know or understand who the other entity claims to be. This is where Affinidi comes in, as it uses <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> to empower businesses to operate in a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trusted environment</a>.</p><p>Varsha went on to talk about <a href="https://www.goodworker.in/">Goodworker</a>, one of the sister companies of Affinidi, and how it empowers blue-collar workers to find the next job, gain financial security, get access to insurance and loans, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Similarly, she explained how Affinidi is trying to empower SMEs by creating <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b">a sense of trust</a> about their business and operations, thereby enabling them to address their challenges and become more productive and profitable.</p><p>Finally, she talked about the Affinidi ecosystem and the benefits it offers for both issuers and verifiers.</p> Joseph Thompson — Impact of SSI in the Social&nbsp;Sector <p>Taking on from where Varsha left, Joseph Thompson, the CEO, and Co-Founder of AID:Tech, talked about how digital identities have empowered some of the poorest and marginalized sections of the society such as displaced Filipinos and Save the Children NGO by giving them financial aid directly through their digital identities. He opined that the transparency of this process is what really makes it unique and effective.</p><p>With this introduction, he jumped on to two use-cases. Both these are built on Affinidi’s <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">verifiable credentials</a> because it is simple to understand and use, thereby saving time and helps to get the product to the market quicker. <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-partners-with-aid-tech-exploring-new-horizons-in-digital-identity-and-verifiable-661c9e61f7e8">Click here</a> to learn more about AID:Tech and Affinidi’s partnership.</p><p>Joseph’s first <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use case</a> was the Save the Children project that required the creation of a verified decentralized Digital Identity that was owned and controlled by the user and could be used across multiple services such as health, education, welfare, etc. These IDs also “acted as gateways for accessing financial services.”</p><p>This was a pilot project that got a big response, so <a href="https://www.aid.technology/">AID:Tech</a> is building on it based on feedback about user experience.</p><p>Next, Joseph talked about a project with the Women’s World Banking that involved the distribution of microinsurance to women in Uganda and Nigeria. This is likely to extend to women in the Philippines next year. This project will essentially allow women to get access to healthcare through their digital identities built on verifiable credentials.</p><p>He concluded by saying that his company is building these identities using Affinidi’s verifiable credentials <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk/tree/master/sdk/core">tech&nbsp;stack</a>.</p><p>Joseph’s presentation was followed by an enthusiastic Q&amp;A session where participants sent their questions through Affinidi’s Discord channel and Zoom. While the business-level questions were answered by the guest speakers, the technical questions were handled by Affinidi’s engineers.</p><p>Some of the interesting questions were:</p>  Which revenue streams are ‘encouraged’ for the app/ solution developers? I mean, Is Affinidi’s solution designed to generate revenues for the issuer/ holder or the verifier? Thanks.  Thanks for the informative webinar. How do individuals manage their data across the use cases&nbsp;shared?  Why would large organisations (e.g. banks) be incentivised to come on board as issuers? Has this got to be regulations driven?  <p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/806805256314028082/882352117564715068">Join our Discord</a> channel to view the answers and for more questions.</p><p>Thus, Affinidi’s first webinar came to an end, and it created an indelible learning experience in the minds of all participants.</p><p>We thank everyone who joined us on this milestone and we look forward to having you in our subsequent webinars as&nbsp;well.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing list</a> and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.

<p>The metaverse is a limited view of the future. Let’s not let our material conditions degrade in the physical world in the pursuit of experiences and riches in the virtual. Let’s build systems of value that traverse&nbsp;both.</p><p>On the <a href="https://interdependence.fm/episodes/primacism-david-rudnick-on-the-struggle-for-primacy-type-and-poetrys-unique-value-in-an-age-of-digital-and-physical-conflict-and-percy-shelleys-mont-blanc">Interdependence podcast</a>, graphic designer David Rudnick set forth his theory of primacism in the context of the upward trend of popularity and valuation of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. He described two modes of&nbsp;primacy.</p><p>There is the longstanding mode of physical prime, in which physical goods, artifacts, and experiences are valued and held in high regard. In the past thirty years, however, we have seen a huge shift towards digital prime thinking with the advent of the internet, gaming, and cryptocurrencies challenging the traditional conventions of how we value and experience phenomena.</p><p>This divide is not only generational but also ideological. Where we land on digital versus physical primacy affects where we allocate our energy and resources in building new techno-social systems.</p><p>Mattereum, while operating largely in a physical prime mindset, believes in a hybrid future where property and value transcends the usual constraints of either the digital or the physical.</p><p>An early tool for experimenting with this new form of “omniversal property rights” is the Real-World Asset NFT, a method of bringing physical goods into the rapidly growing (largely speculative) crypto economy. Building this bridge would not only greatly increase the value and utility of crypto but also allow for a more decentralized and secure approach to physical commerce which is under constant threat of monopolization and systemic vulnerability.</p> The Metaverse Is A Critically Narrow View of the&nbsp;Future <p>In recent months, the “metaverse” meme has gone viral with everyone from Mark Zuckerberg to VC firms to Fortnite creator Epic Games to anon crypto traders citing it as the new frontier of commerce and entertainment. Everything of value subsumed into virtual&nbsp;worlds.</p><p>However, it is important to acknowledge the origins of the term “metaverse” and the critical blindspot it presents.</p><p>One of the most influential works of literature in the tech industry is Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson. This post-modern, cyberpunk classic featured the first publication of the term “metaverse,” describing a shared virtual reality that the characters of the novel frequent throughout.</p><p>The protagonist of the novel, Hiro, is a gig-worker who lives in a modified storage container with a broke, alcoholic roommate in the backdrop of an anarcho-capitalist corporate dystopia where late pizza deliveries are literally punishable by&nbsp;death.</p><p>The material conditions of the bottom-rung of society are horrific, but thankfully they have a shared illusion to escape to and action&nbsp;aplenty.</p><p>Why invoke Snow Crash? Well, many of the individuals and institutions building virtual worlds and virtual property cite it as a primary influence on their work. This metaverse is a north star for centralized corporations with monopolistic tendencies and globally-distributed, decentralized techno-social movements alike. People are actively working to build this&nbsp;future.</p><p>Let’s look at crypto: the total market cap for the industry exceeds $2 trillion, over $80 billion is locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and people are buying pixel avatars for millions of dollars. All of this value while providing little to none in the way of actual social&nbsp;impact.</p><p>If we’re not careful, we will find ourselves completely entranced by the world of bits (dominated either by corporations or crypto protocols) while living in the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation">desert of the&nbsp;real</a>.”</p><p>Let’s ground ourselves a bit, and use these incredible tools to improve our material conditions.</p> Real-World Asset NFTs Expand the Scope and Utility of&nbsp;Crypto <p>The Real-World Asset NFT (rNFT), or physical NFT, is a method of using legal and software engineering to tokenize physical property such that it can be traded, collateralized, governed, and owned using the same global medium of value transfer that powers the multi-trillion dollar crypto&nbsp;economy.</p><p>These tokens expand on the functionality of the NFTs gaining popularity in the creative industries by granting the bearer the right to take physical custody of an underlying object. The idea is simple, but the opportunities are&nbsp;vast.</p><p>How exactly do we build this, and what are the implications for crypto and&nbsp;beyond?</p> Real-World Asset NFTs are Built Upon Mattereum Asset Passports <p>Mattereum’s approach to asset tokenization is to clearly identify an object and define the property rights using the <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/composable-commerce-with-mattereum-asset-passports-4e102f85139a">Mattereum Asset Passport</a> (MAP), a powerful and composable legal-tech framework which bundles warranties around goods and services. One of these warranties can include digital asset issuance via an NFT, as shown&nbsp;below:</p>For a more detailed breakdown of generating physical NFTs, we recommend referring to the <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/">Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>.<p>The key modular element of the MAP is the warranty. Each warranty covers various terms of a contract ranging from identity, authentication procedure, vault status, tokenization, carbon offsets, and eventually even anti-slavery certification.</p><p>The MAP is a dynamic, living document that follows an object’s lifecycle, binding warranties together around an object over time to secure value, create clear lines of accountability, and maximize&nbsp;utility.</p><p>This tool opens up a vast design space that we have only just begun to&nbsp;explore.</p> Real-World Asset NFTs Can Bridge the Virtual Economy and the Physical&nbsp;World <p>The current crypto economy is largely (mostly) speculative: multi-billion dollar networks without mainstream application, DeFi “money legos” powering financial protocols used primarily to expand existing fortunes, and NFTs being traded for vast sums with no clear valuation model.</p><p>In the early days of an internet of programmable value, this is inevitable.</p><p>With smart contracts, anyone can build all manner of familiar and exotic financial instruments, so this kind of runway experimentation is to be expected. In a summer 1996 talk, ex-cypherpunk Perry Metzger quipped that in time financial cryptography will be able to produce any form of digital value one can imagine e.g. “<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/">gold-denominated Burmese opium futures</a>.”</p><p>This is startlingly true, twenty-five years&nbsp;later.</p><p>To reduce speculation in, bring stability to, and expand utility of the crypto economy, it is necessary to re-balance digital prime thinking with physical prime, onboarding the hundreds of trillions of physical assets throughout the world that colossally dwarf the market cap of crypto by an incredible magnitude onto the blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/">All of the World's Money and Markets in One Visualization - 2020 Edition</a></p><p>So far, Mattereum has passported and tokenized a wide range of objects, from <a href="https://opensea.io/NTFA">gold-backed NFTs</a>, to <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/third-millennia-collection-1">pop culture memorabilia</a>, to <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">historical/cultural artifacts</a>, with many more in the pipeline.</p><p>The potential boon for crypto is limitless. DeFi protocols could use less-volatile forms of collateral. DAOs could govern the maintenance and use of physical properties. NFTs could facilitate the transfer of clearly defined property rights. This can be done&nbsp;today.</p><p>The benefits flow the other way as well. The combination of blockchain and NFTs can bring the programmability of smart contracts and the provenance of immutable transaction ledgers to goods and services in the physical world: eliminating fraud, securing trust, and allocating social, financial, and intellectual capital to the governance and maintenance of shared resources.</p> Commerce Beyond Metaverse: A Look to the&nbsp;Future <p>We currently have the ability to build bidirectional links between physical objects and their digital asset counterparts using MAPs and NFTs, vastly opening up the design space of digital commerce.</p><p>This technology blurs the distinction between digital and physical value, between objects in the metaverse and objects in the material world. Imagine a primarily digital construct that has been passported, with all design blueprints stored on IPFS, all physical instantiations of the object paired with an NFT, and a cryptographic evidence chain securing all transactions and attestations throughout the object’s lifecycle (Bruce Sterling’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spime">spimes</a>”.) The tools to create this form of hybrid asset are live this very&nbsp;moment.</p><p>Blockchain NFTs in conjunction with legal engineering can create and enforce property rights across the metaverse and the real world simultaneously. We don’t have to direct all of our resources to the development of one at the expense or neglect of the&nbsp;other.</p><p>We can do&nbsp;both.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/breaking-open-the-metaverse-with-real-world-asset-nfts-dccb00251fdf">Breaking Open the Metaverse with Real-World Asset NFTs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Sadrick some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What do we miss when talking about identity management?</p>
<p>
When we talk about identity management, it is mainly about digital identities, for example, a user logging in to an e-commerce shop. But there are different qualities of users – we at cidaas like to call these qualities - Trust Levels. To make this more clear – a user with a newsletter might be a weak Identity, but a user who performed a digital identity verification, for example with a bank account, is a strong identity. A user can move easily between trust levels, especially when using features like progressive profiling with which the user can enrich the user data successively and contextually. As an example a user who is interested in a product and signs up to a newsletter is initially a weak identity – but then becomes a stronger identity when purchasing the product. </p>
<p>What we also completely lose sight of is the real-world identity. Let’s take a theme park; a user registers in the online shop and buys a ticket. We consider this the digital identity. The real-world identity comes into play when the user visits the park. The user authenticates with the personalized ticket at the entrance or might get a discount in the park, during breakfast, so then he [the user] becomes a real-world identity. Considering membership cards or personalized tickets, these are authentication options in the real world. Basically, we need to achieve a linking of the digital and the real-world identity in the future. </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Why is Identity Management important for businesses in Europe?</p>
<p>
In general, the topic of sovereignty is a big issue in Europe, especially solutions from Europe are very important, considering identity management or other features, or other solutions, which are key to digitalization in the future. The General Data Protection Regulation has changed the game in the last years. It is not only about the legal implications, but also about transparency and trust towards users. Businesses need a so-called Real-GDPR to establish a trustful relationship. In this context the question of make vs. buy arises. Basically, the question must be: "What competitive advantage do I have if I, as a company, develop an Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution myself?</p>
<p>The next question is then: What advantage do I have if I run the IAM solution in-house? The answer is simple, I do not create any benefit by developing or hosting an identity management solution myself. Especially with the solutions available today, such as cidaas and others, which are available as a cloud service, the decision is clearly with ‘buy’. </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>What changes Identity Management?</p>
<p>
Many factors have an impact on Identity Management, first and foremost the user convenience drives the development in the identity management sector. Thereby, in particular new authentication methods arose in the last years, making the user experience not only more convenient but also more secure. In addition, many new touchpoints arose, both on digital channels and in the real world, such as access points in a theme park, a stadium, or smart factories. With all these changes, we must not lose sight of security – in particular since the challenges in the context of security have evolved in the same way. One can say - Identity Management is more than the sum of its parts.  
</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Could you comment on the evolution of Identity?</p>
<p>
A key development in the evolution of identity management was the cloud. With modern cloud solutions such as cidaas, the topic of identity management has arrived in all companies, regardless of size, industry or sector. Thus, in the age of the cloud, high costs for software licenses and the operation [of solutions] are a thing of the past. So, considering the way companies are interacting with customers changed. Digital Channels and Services play an important role in the acquisition of prospects and engagement with customers. Thereby identity management became a crucial part to offer those services, provide new benefits, create unique selling points, having new touchpoints in place and recognizing user potential.   
</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Could you give us a sneak peek into your Keynote: “Give Me 10 Minutes, I'll Give You the Truth About Identity”?</p>
<p>
In my Keynote “Give me 10 Minutes, I’ll give you the truth about identity” we will see what can be achieved within 10 minutes in the context of Identity &amp; Access Management. We’ll jointly rethink the identity management and why user convenience has become so incredible and so important for both employees as well as partners and customers, be it in B2C or B2B and what the changing factors in the near future will be.</p>

Dave Mason, Supply Chain Compliance and Serialization Lead at Novartis is to contribute to the panel  entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4658/2" title="Futureproofing Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Security"> Futureproofing Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Security </a>on Tuesday, September 14 starting at 6:00 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Dave some questions about this panel.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How can digital identity secure the pharmaceutical supply chain in the future?</p>
<p>
So what is going on in United States is there's a rule called drug supply security act. It is one of the only serialization acts in the world that requires change of ownership. It's not a dispense model like in the EU where you just, you scan it at the pharmacy and verify the serial number. In the US, you have to exchange data between your supply chain partners and also they can make requests, asking for the validity of the serial number or batch number or expiration date. So what we're looking at here is we need some kind of electronic or digital system to verify the players in the DSC systems. They are who they say they are their authorized training partner. And then in the US and authorized trading partner, somebody with a valid state license or FCI, that's FDA, facility establishment ID. And that's mainly for manufacturers.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>How is Novartis meeting regulatory requirements to secure the supply chain? </p>
<p>
What Novartis is doing to meet and secure the supply chain and comply with DSE ESA. There are several attributes. We are putting a serial number on cases and sellable units and aggregating. We are implementing a VRS system through SAP, which is a wholesale sellable returns where the wholesaler can request if the serial number, the expiration date, the batch number of G10 or authentic, that is going to be expanded to other entities in the supply chain towards 2023. And especially to partners that are indirect. And what we need here is to do this is credentialing digital ID because what's happening here is I'm getting a request from somebody for a verification, or I'm sending product out and it's called cash to order. And I have to verify that who I'm sending that product out to has a valid state license. So what we're doing to use this, digital ID is we're putting it in, embedding it in our systems with the cooperation of SAP and other supply chain partners. So, we can secure the network because it's a distributed network. It's not a centralized database, it's a distributed network. So we need to know, as we communicate with 70,000 supply chain partners, who you are, are you saying who you are and are you an authorized trading partner? So that's how we're building out to secure the supply chain, not just to meet the doc USA requirements, but to assure that Novartis is sending product to, to the correct individuals and that they're not bad actors.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>You will be participating in a panel together with other pharmaceutical supply chain actors. Can you give us a sneak peek on the context of the panel?</p>
<p>
Yeah. So what we will do is we will discuss how we built out digital ID for VRS and with SAP at other supply chain partners with other service providers in that work in the United States, we will talk about what we currently are doing in piloting, and we're now going to our production model. And also we have four service providers who had cooperated through OCI to build an inoperable credit digital ID system and where it also can be expanded in the future, like order to cash and maybe other opportunities for 2023 and at what the importance of this is, and also why we did it. We'll find out is that we were using and other methods to identify partners. And that was not sufficient. We were finding that there was no registrations that, uh, people who are using them were not the people who said they were using them. So we will go through all that in this panel and show the importance of digital identity.</p>

Today, the Bridge unlocks the ability to transfer ERC assets from the Ethereum blockchain to the Shyft Network by leveraging a relayer to run software that monitors the Ethereum network and signs transactions to execute the transfer of data between blockchains.</p><p>The Shyft Bridge will enable holders of SHFT and any ERC token to safely and efficiently transfer their assets onto the Shyft Network mainnet and use the tokens as gas in the Shyft Ecosystem, and products being developed by the Shyft Core team, the Federation and our partners, like a token staking mechanism and a DAO for community development. As the technical ecosystem around the Shyft Network continues to grow, developers will be able to use the Shyft Bridge to bring SHFT and other crypto assets on Ethereum into new DeFi products and tools built on the Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p><p>The Node Federation is composed of 21 nodes working under a Proof-of-Authority mechanism modelled after Blockstream’s Strong Federation. The role of the Federation is to ensure the security, stability and advancement of the Shyft Network’s blockchain.

<p>On a daily basis, payroll providers solve many of the pain points faced by HR teams. For example, payroll solutions save employers time and resources and deliver valuable services that enhance the employee experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, by leveraging their valuable data in new ways, payroll providers have the ability to deliver income and employment verification solutions that even better meet the needs of HR teams. Payroll providers can benefit from their data by connecting with an open banking platform—a consumer-permissioned means of accessing financial data via APIs. By leveraging data to enable empowering and innovative services open banking benefits both the service provider and the consumer.</p>
<p>Ultimately, payroll providers also hone their competitive edge and bolster their security when they connect to open banking platforms. Once connected to the platforms via API, payroll providers empower employers and consumers to benefit from their payroll data on request. The API connection is a partnership between a payroll provider and an open banking platform. A mutually-beneficial partnership that’s dedicated to delivering the best, most secure experience to businesses and their employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Providers can use the open banking connections to add new services and apps to their offerings. Additionally, the data doesn’t have to be sent in batches to be stored in a database to be used by third parties. These real-time data connections benefit consumers, payroll companies, and employees by minimizing when and how data is used and providing it more securely and transparently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at how these partnership-driven connections help payroll providers unlock new opportunities.</p>
 How Does Connecting to Payroll Data Work? 
<p>Payroll data can streamline the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mvs-simplicity-flexibility/">verification of income and employment</a> for various use cases, such as:<br>
</p>
 
 Mortgage lending 
 Auto lending 
 Personal lending 
 Tenant screening 
 Background checks 
 Government verification 
 Personal financial management<br>
 
 
<p>Payroll providers can connect to open banking platforms and data aggregators in a variety of ways. Many aggregators offer only credentialed access to payroll data, which means that the data access provider uses a consumer’s credentials to access a payroll platform and get the necessary data. While this method may deliver the data necessary for employment and income verifications, credentialed access is less secure for payroll providers and a less consumer-friendly experience since employees may not know their payroll provider or login credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/payroll-data-open-banking/">connecting consumers to their valuable payroll data happens via direct API connections</a>. API connections are far more secure than credentialed access and don’t require employees to know their payroll portal credentials to access the content. The user doesn’t even have to know their provider. An open banking platform, or data access provider, is a better method to connect employees to their data with a direct API connection. It provides the highest standard of control and transparency over who is accessing their data and how it is being used to benefit them.</p>
<p>Payroll data clearly helps consumers benefit from their financial data to access important financial services. But what’s in it for payroll providers? Why should they connect to open banking platforms?</p>
 How Payroll Providers Benefit from Connecting to Open Banking Platforms 
<p>Payroll providers can leverage open banking platforms to enable better experiences for their customers, effectively improving their competitive position and ensuring secure data sharing. A competitive advantage of payroll providers would then be the security and privacy standards baked into the API direct connection. In the end, everyone benefits, from payroll providers, to data access providers, to verifiers, to employers and employees.</p>
 How Connecting to Open Banking Platforms Makes Payroll Providers More Competitive 
<p>Connecting to an open banking platform empowers payroll providers to better serve their core target: HR executives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do HR executives need? They need a reliable payroll solution, one that may also deliver other ancillary services, such as benefits, expense reporting, applicant tracking. Like almost any other executive, HR executives need more time and resources for their team, which means that time-consuming, manual employment and income verifications can become a burden.</p>
<p>Many HR executives are already choosing to outsource their payroll and ancillary HR services in order to cut costs and save time. But to whom they outsource matters. The payroll and HR experience is an important element of a positive employee experience with a company. Payroll providers who already offer successful payroll and HR experiences have the opportunity to further enhance those experiences with an additional service: streamlined, simple, and empowering income and employment verification.</p>
<p>By connecting to an open banking platform, payroll providers enable employees to self-permission their employment and income data when trying to access a financial service or engage with the other use cases described above. In this way, the employee benefits from their financial data by delivering a more reliable, comprehensive view of their financial story for greater access to financial services. In turn, verifiers get more accurate, real-time data for better decisioning. Both get a streamlined, faster experience that saves everyone time and resources. And employers (HR executives specifically) never had to waste the resources performing the verifications.</p>
<p>A ready connection for third parties through an open banking connection also makes it easier to add or provide services through third parties like fintechs. These connections can provide financial guidance, simplify complex purchases like insurance or mortgages, or just provide a clearer view for tax preparation.</p>
<p>All of those benefits come from the payroll provider who, through partnership with an open banking platform, offers a better experience and empowers both employer and employee. That payroll provider distinguishes itself among its competitors and better positions itself to onboard more clients and scale.</p>
 How Connecting to Open Banking Platforms Maintains Payroll Providers’ Security 
<p><a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/payroll-data-plaid-fintech">In contrast to the model described above</a>, payroll providers and employers open themselves up to risk when they send data used for verifications in batches and are stored with a third party. These methods leave them open to breaches because they house the data. This method potentially compromises employees’ private information by duplicating data and storing it in multiple places. However, connecting to an open banking platform through an API removes the necessity of sending data in batches. Instead, verifiers only need to access the data at the moment of verification. Thanks to real-time connections to accurate, data,no parties have to pass through the protection of an employer’s or payroll provider’s firewall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when those APIs use secure authentication, such as OAuth, employees keep their credentials secret and secure. By partnering with an open banking platform, payroll providers protect themselves, employers, and consumers. Offering a secure experience also empowers employers and employees, and further sharpens the competitive edge already honed by connecting to an open banking platform.</p>
<p>Connecting to open banking platforms enables payroll providers to scale by delivering secure, streamlined, empowering experiences for HR teams and employees.&nbsp;</p>

Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, took part in an exclusive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA9sdpDatEM">video interview</a> with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA9sdpDatEM">CryptoCoinShow</a> to introduce the recent development of Ontology’s EVM and how Ontology’s decentralized identity and data management technology can play a central role in the Web 3.0 era by fostering interoperability within the blockchain ecosystem.  <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/blogs/14-security-blog/post/95839-vaccine-passports-must-leverage-decentralized-identity-solutions">“Vaccine passports must leverage decentralized identity solutions</a>” was published in Security Magazine by Li Jun, Founder of Ontology. The article explored how decentralized identity can address data and privacy issues in the medical&nbsp;domain.  Ontology’s Americas Ecosystem Lead, Erick Pinos, was invited to participate in <a href="https://twitter.com/REIMAGINE_2021/status/1427077674653126664?s=20">Reimagine</a>’s “Tenth Anniversary Edition” event hosted by MouseBelt, an ecosystem building the future of blockchain innovation and education, he introduced Ontology’s decentralized identity solutions in detail, and said that this can be a good way for fresh graduates to start their careers in the blockchain industry.  Ontology published two Medium articles (<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/can-web-3-awaken-the-internets-true-potential-dffcce766220?source=collection_detail----5e10d5c26b55-----6-----------------------">Part 1</a> &amp; <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/can-web-3-0-awaken-the-internets-true-potential-part-two-48562cbd5bfb?source=collection_detail----5e10d5c26b55-----2-----------------------">Part 2</a>) about Web 3.0 that explored what defines Web 3.0 and Ontology’s relationship to the coming Web 3.0 era. At the same time, Ontology was listed on the Web 3.0 landscape map by the decentralized platform <a href="https://twitter.com/NEAR_daily/status/1422813546061058050">NEAR</a> and the decentralized protocol <a href="https://twitter.com/SHGroup101/status/1422197838377742339">Uniswap</a>, respectively. Ontology has effectively promoted the construction of Web 3.0 infrastructure, and its contribution to decentralized digital identity is being recognized. Ontology also published its <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1429747737285730304">#WEB3 101</a> Series on domestic and overseas platforms. The thread introduces Web 3.0 and how it will improve upon Web 1.0 and 2.0 infrastructure, allowing more developers and users to participate in the development of Web 3.0 infrastructure.

  <p>At a very high level, the SCIM (System for Cross-Identity Management) protocol exists to provision and sync users and groups across various, independent systems. There is some room for nuance in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644">SCIM spec</a>. In this post we will take a look at some basic SCIM operations. We’ll peek under the hood at the flow between Okta and a SCIM server built in Flask using PostgreSQL as our app database. Even if you’re not a Python dev, hopefully you can take away some of the concepts in this guide for your own SCIM implementation.</p>

 What You’ll Need 

 
   <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">virtualenv</a> 
   <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> 
   <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> 
 

 Setting Up the Flask Server and Postgres DB 
<p></p>

 
   Clone the repo found <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-scim-flask-example">here</a>, open terminal and <code>cd</code> into the project root. 
   Create a new virtualenv in the root folder with <code>virtualenv env</code>. 
   Run the virtual environment with <code>source env/bin/activate</code>. 
   Install necessary Python packages with <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>. 
   Install <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/">Postgres</a>. 
   Create a new Postgres database named <code>scim</code>. Enter the <code>psql</code> shell by opening a new terminal tab and typing <code>psql postgres</code>. Create the DB with <code>CREATE DATABASE scim;</code> (Run <code>\list</code> to double-check the database has been created). 
   Go back to the terminal tab that is in the flask app root. Run the following commands to create migrations and tables in the <code>scim</code> database:
     
       <code>python manage.py db init</code> 
       <code>python manage.py db migrate</code> 
       <code>python manage.py db upgrade</code> 
     

    <blockquote>
      <p>Feel free to hop back to your Postgres tab and run <code>\c scim</code> to navigate into the scim db, then <code>\dt</code> to see your new tables: <code>groups</code>, <code>users</code>, <code>link</code>. (<code>link</code> is a table facilitating the many-to-many relationship between users and groups.)</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   Everything should be set up now to run the server locally. Finally, run <code>python app.py</code> to do so. You should now have your SCIM server running on <code>http://localhost:5000</code>. 
 

 Set Up Ngrok to Route Requests From Okta to Localhost 

<p>Once you have ngrok installed, run <code>./ngrok http 5000</code> to create a tunnel from ngrok to your <code>http://localhost:5000</code>. Copy the <code>https</code> Forwarding URL created by ngrok as you will need it later.</p>

<p></p>

 Creating and Configuring Your Okta Application 

<p>Now it’s time to create a new SCIM integration in Okta. If your SCIM app(s) are already set up on the Okta side, feel free to skip ahead to <a>Test the SCIM Server</a>. There are two options that will work with this server, and I will ALWAYS recommend the first, which is to use an Okta SCIM template application.</p>

 Option 1: SCIM Template App 

 
   In your Okta dashboard, go to Applications -&gt; Applications, then click the Browse App Catalogue button. Search for SCIM 2.0 Test App (Header Auth) and click the Add button once you have it pulled up. 
   In the General Settings tab, click Next. 
   We will set this up as a SWA application, so in the Sign-On Options tab, click Secure Web Authentication. 
   Click Done. 
   Tab over to Provisioning and click Configure API Integration. 
   Check Enable API integration. 
   In the Base URL field, paste in the ngrok url you generated above with /scim/v2 appended to the end. In the API Token field, type Bearer 123456789. (Later on we will go over how to customize this auth header, but out-of-the-box, the SCIM server expects this value.) 
   
    <p>Click Test API Credentials and you should get a success message like the below:</p>

    <p></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You can check the ngrok logs by navigating to <code>http://localhost:4040</code> to see the request from Okta as well as the response from the SCIM server.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Click Save. Now your Provisoning tab will look a bit different.</p>
   
   Click Edit next to Provisioning to App and check off:
     
       Create Users 
       Update User Attributes 
       Deactivate Users 
     
   
 

<p>And Save.</p>

<p></p>

 Option 2: Enable SCIM Provisioning for Existing App Integration Wizard (AIW) App 

<blockquote>
  <p>Feel free to skip over this section to Test the SCIM Server if you set up your SCIM integration above.</p>
</blockquote>

 
   In your Okta dashboard, go to Applications -&gt; Applications, then click the Create App Integration button. For this setup we will select SWA - Secure Web Authentication. Click Next. 
   You can put whatever you’d like for the App Name and App Login Page URL, as we will just be loking at the SCIM functionality and not the SWA aspect of this app. Click Finish. 
   In the General tab of the app, click Edit and toggle Provisioning from None to SCIM. Click Save. 
   
    <p>Your app should now have a Provisioning tab. Tab over to it and fill out the integration settings to match those in the image below. Make the Authorization header 123456789. You can change this later in the SCIM flask app.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Click Test Connector Configuration and you should see the following success confirmation:</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>You can now click Save.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You can navigate to <code>http://localhost:4040</code> to see the request from Okta on this request, as well as the response from the SCIM server.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p></p>
   
   Now your Provisoning tab will look a bit different. Click Edit next to Provisioning to App and check off:
     
       Create Users 
       Update User Attributes 
       Deactivate Users 
     
   
 

<p>And Save.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should now be set on the Okta side to start testing the SCIM server.</p>

<p></p>

 What Did We Just Do? 

<p>Before we go ahead and test our SCIM server, let’s talk a bit about what we did in the setup steps above. Essentially we set up the following 3 components:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this setup, Okta is the source of truth for user data. The SCIM server opens up four endpoints locally, which Okta is able to access thanks to the routing capabilities of ngrok. These endpoints are:</p>

 
   <code>https://localhost:5000/scim/v2/Users</code> 
   <code>https://localhost:5000/scim/v2/Users/{user_id}</code> 
   <code>https://localhost:5000/scim/v2/Groups</code> 
   <code>https://localhost:5000/scim/v2/Groups/{group_id}</code> 
 

<p>These endpoints trigger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD operations</a> based off the requests from Okta. Some examples of these calls:</p>

 CREATE 

<p>Okta Examples:</p>

 
   When a user is assigned to the Okta app, Okta will make a <code>POST</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Users</code> 
   When a group is assigned to the Okta app, Okta will make iterative <code>POST</code>s to <code>/scim/v2/Users</code> with each member of the group 
   When using Push Groups to add a new group to the Okta app, Okta sends a <code>POST</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Groups</code> 
 

 READ 

<p>Okta Examples:</p>

 
   When importing users &amp; groups from the external app Okta sends a <code>GET</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Users</code> and/or <code>GET</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Groups</code> 
   When getting all (or filtered) users from the external app, Okta sends a <code>GET</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Users</code> 
   When getting a sole user from the external app, Okta sends a <code>GET</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Users/{user_id}</code> 
   When getting all (or filtered) groups from the external app, Okta sends a<code>GET</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Groups</code> 
   When getting a sole group from the external app, Okta sends a<code>GET</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Groups/{group_id}</code> 
 

<blockquote>
  <p>With the exception of import, these actions are initiated by Okta prior to a CREATE, UPDATE or DELETE action. You can think of these calls as a sync verification step.</p>
</blockquote>

 UPDATE 

<p>Okta Examples:</p>

 
   When updating user attributes in Okta, Okta sends a <code>PUT</code> or <code>PATCH</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Users/{user_id}</code> 
   When assigning or unassigning a user that already exists in external app DB, Okta sends a <code>PUT</code> or <code>PATCH</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Users/{user_id}</code> 
   When changing membership of a pushed Okta group, Okta sends a <code>PUT</code> or <code>PATCH</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Groups/{group_id}</code> 
 

 DELETE 

<p>Okta Examples:</p>

 
   When selecting “Delete the group in target app” after selecting “Unlink pushed group” in the Push Groups tab, okta sends a <code>DELETE</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Groups/{group_id}</code> 
 

<p>Let’s move on to testing the SCIM server to see some of these calls in action!</p>

<p><a></a></p>
 Test the SCIM Server 
<blockquote>
  <p>Note: I am using the SCIM template integration in the steps below. If you are using the AIW version, there may be subtle differences in some of the calls. More info <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/scim/scim-20/">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

 
   
    <p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:4040</code> to see all the requests and responses taking place between Okta and the SCIM server. I will be truncating mine a bit in the examples below for brevity.</p>
   
   
    <p>From the section above, you saw that we set up our SCIM integration with Bearer 123456789 in the authorization header. You can change this header to whatever you’d like in the app.py file at the following line of function auth_required:</p>
   
 

<p><code>if request.headers['Authorization'].split('Bearer ')[1] == '123456789':</code></p>

<p>Replace 123456789 with whatever unique value you’d like and make sure to update this in the provisioning tab of your Okta integrations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This is just for convenience in testing - NEVER store sensitive credentials in source code. More info <a href="https://developer.okta.com/books/api-security/api-keys/keep-keys-private/#api-keys-keep-keys-private">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Authentication exists to protect your endpoints from unwanted requests. In this guide we set up header authorization, but you can also use basic auth or OAuth. This tutorial doesn’t delve too deeply into this aspect of SCIM.</p>

 Assign a User 
<p>Under the Assignments tab, click Assign -&gt; Assign to People. I assigned user obi-wan.kenobi@iamciam.dev. Here is a look at the requests and responses from Okta to my SCIM server:</p>

 
   Okta Request: 
 

   <code>GET /scim/v2/Users?filter=userName%20eq%20%22obi-wan.kenobi%40iamciam.dev%22&amp;startIndex=1&amp;count=100
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Okta will first run a GET with a userName filter query parameter to see if the user already exists in the external app, since no external ID for the user yet exists to link them to the Okta user.</p>
</blockquote>

 
   SCIM Server Response: 
 

   <code>200 OK
</code>   

   <code>{
    "Resources": [],
    "itemsPerPage": 0,
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"
    ],
    "startIndex": 1,
    "totalResults": 0
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>This response tells Okta that the user does not currently exist in the database and thus informs the next call - a <code>POST</code> to create the user.</p>
</blockquote>

 
   Okta Request: 
 

   <code>POST /scim/v2/Users
</code>   

   <code>{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"

    "externalId": "00use6vjvehodmsQb4x6",
    "groups": [],
    "password": "gl^m&amp;qWZ",
    "active": true
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The above password value is randomly generated by Okta as many external apps require this value on user creation. As the app is federated, this password cannot be used to login.</p>

   SCIM Server Response: 
 

   <code>201 CREATED
</code>   

   <code>{
    "active": true,
    "displayName": "Obi-Wan Kenobi",

}
</code>   

 
   Now If you navigate to your local scim database and run <code>select * from users;</code>, you should see the assigned user in the database. 
 

<p></p>

 Unassign a User 

<p>Let’s go ahead and unassign the user we just assigned in Okta. Under Assignments, click the X next to the user we just assigned:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The request/response should look like this:</p>
 
   Okta Request: 
 

   <code>PATCH /scim/v2/Users/289383d9-ff3a-48bb-99ea-3048762267c7
</code>   

   <code>{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"
    ],
    "Operations": [
        {
            "op": "replace",
            "value": {
                "active": false
            }
        }
    ]
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Okta does not delete an unassigned user but rather updates their <code>active</code> value to <code>false</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

 
   SCIM Server Response: 
 

   <code>204 NO CONTENT
</code>   

 
   And sure enough, if you run that same <code>select * from users;</code> in the scim db, you will see the user is now <code>active: false</code>: 
 

<p></p>

 Assign a Group 
<p>Under the Assignments tab, click Assign -&gt; Assign to Groups. I assigned group Droids. Note that this behavior is similar to the way individual users were assigned above. Okta will iterate through the group membership and create the users in the external SCIM server - but the Group itself won’t be made. That is done in Push Groups, which we will handle later. Here is a look at the requests and responses from Okta to the SCIM server:</p>

 
   Okta Request: 
 

   <code>GET /scim/v2/Users?filter=userName%20eq%20%22c-3po%40iamciam.dev%22&amp;startIndex=1&amp;count=100
</code>   

 
   SCIM Server Response: 
 

   <code>200 OK
</code>   

   <code>{
    "Resources": [],
    "itemsPerPage": 0,
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"
    ],
    "startIndex": 1,
    "totalResults": 0
}
</code>   

 
   Okta Request: 
 

   <code>POST /scim/v2/Users
</code>   

   <code>{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
    ],

    "name": {
        "givenName": "C",

   SCIM Server Response: 
 

   <code>201 CREATED
</code>   

   <code>{
    "active": true,

}
</code>   

 
   There are 3 members in my Droids group: C-3P0, R2-D2, and BB-8. The above req/resp chain repeats for the other 2 users. Now when I run <code>select * from users;</code> in the scim database I can see the assigned users: 
 

<p></p>

 Push Groups 

<p>As mentioned above, assigning a group in Okta only adds the users to my SCIM server, not the Group itself. Push Groups is an Okta-specific functionality. It gives you the granularity to assign Okta group members to a SCIM application without automatically adding that group to the external app. More info can be found <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-about-group-push.htm">here</a> In order to add a Group to our external app, tab over to Push Groups in your Okta app integration. Click Push Groups -&gt; Find groups by name and select the group you assigned above. Make sure Push group memberships immediately is checked and click Save. Two calls should be made by Okta - one creating the group itself and another updating the group membership. Here are the requests and responses for my Droids group push:</p>

 
   Okta Request: 
 

   <code>POST /scim/v2/Groups
</code>   

   <code>{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group"
    ],
    "displayName": "Droids",

<p>And you can view the link table, which displays the many-to-many relationship between the users and groups. You can see this with <code>select * from link;</code>:</p>

 In Conclusion 

<p>This covers the basic functionality of SCIM integration from Okta. Other use cases haven’t been tested extensively and may need tweaking over time, but hopefully, this guide helps developers to better understand Okta’s SCIM functionality.

Many of you who follow Holochain come from the cryptocurrency world, so naturally, you’re probably interested in Holochain as a platform for building new cryptocurrencies. But you probably also know that they won’t work like traditional cryptocurrencies. So how will they work? Using a technique called countersigning. Because every participant in a hApp has their own source chain, every transaction is a bit like a cross-chain atomic swap (not exactly, but close&nbsp;enough).</p><p>Paul has put together an incredible explanation on how countersigning will work on Holochain in the latest version update for Holochain.</p><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/countersigning-in-holochain-v0-0-103/">Read more on Countersigning in Holochain v0.0.103</a></p> Regular Holo Dev Updates on&nbsp;Twitter <p>If you are curious about the — hot from the press dev updates — those can be found on Holo&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_">Twitter.</a></p> Holochain is the Ideal Network for&nbsp;NFTs <p>Are non-fungible tokens the biggest thing in crypto ever?

<p>For our 6th Close-up Magic meetup, we welcomed <a href="https://twitter.com/chris__lu">Chris Lu</a>, Co-founder of <a href="https://www.copy.ai/">CopyAI</a> to talk&nbsp;about:</p>  How No Code disrupts the tech&nbsp;industry  What CopyAI is and how it helps copywriting  Insights on being an&nbsp;investor  <p>Here are three of our favorite takeaways.</p> Key Takeaways  No code helps you move quickly, not creatively 💭 <p>In order to move quickly, the initial prototype of CopyAI was built with the No Code philosophy in mind. To Chris, No Code meant being able to use existing tools to create things that can be delivered to users as quickly as possible. The no code or low code tools CopyAI used were Webflow, Firebase, and&nbsp;Magic.</p><blockquote>“Magic is a no code piece of auth. Just one line of code and instantly you have complete authentication built&nbsp;in.”</blockquote><p>Although Webflow and Firebase helped the team build the initial prototype of CopyAI, they couldn’t provide them with the custom features they needed. This includes web sockets, real-time notification, and collaboration features. This is where some No Code or Low Code tools lacked; they weren’t advanced enough to give developers the freedom to be more creative.</p><p>Now the team is rebuilding CopyAI to move away from Webflow and Firebase, and towards React and their own database. This will allow them to improve the UX, the site’s performance, and even how the team works together.</p> CopyAI will help build a more creative world&nbsp;🎨 <p>CopyAI is an AI powered copywriting assistant. But the vision for CopyAI is much grander than&nbsp;this.</p><blockquote>“CopyAI’s vision is to help people run and grow their businesses not just in a marketing copy sense, but in all&nbsp;senses.”</blockquote><p>If you have a product in mind, CopyAI will make it easier for you to bring it to life in the most creative way possible. Pretty cool,&nbsp;huh?</p> When investing, keep an eye on Net Revenue Retention 📈 <p>I also got a chance to talk to Chris about his 4+ years of angel investing experience. Angel investing is when you invest your own money in the best companies, as early as possible. You’re pretty much betting on the company’s future&nbsp;success.</p><p>Chris’s favorite part about investing is being able to see how the inner functions of a company works to deliver value efficiently to their customers, and whether or not that value grows over time. He’s also fascinated by the different business models and how they each make a massive company or a small business.</p><blockquote>“Net Revenue Retention: If you don’t get any new customers, will you continue to grow, or will you&nbsp;shrink?”</blockquote><p>His advice on investing in successful companies is to watch out for a metric called Net Revenue Retention. This reflects the success of a company’s customer retention. You know your product is incredibly valuable when you continue to grow by some percentage, even if you don’t get any new customers.</p> Q&amp;A Session <p>At the end of the talk, we received a few great questions from our listeners, including this&nbsp;one:</p><blockquote>“Where do you see CopyAI going? Product Roadmap?”</blockquote><p>Curious to know Chris’ answer? Make sure to watch the recording of the fireside chat&nbsp;below.</p> Interested in Close-up&nbsp;Magic? <p>If you ever want to be a special guest for Close-up Magic and talk about a tech you’re passionate about, schedule a chat with Maricris&nbsp;<a href="https://calendly.com/magic-maricris/15min-1">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/recap-copyais-no-code-journey-4dc798b767fe">CopyAI’s No Code Journey</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 GiD Report#175 — Everyone wants an&nbsp;NFT <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-174-facebook-is-a-monopoly-again-ec2a4477d020">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p> This week:   The month of the&nbsp;NFT  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. NFT sales reach almost $1 billion in&nbsp;August Degen Ape NFTs on&nbsp;Solana<p>At this point, most people have heard of a non-fungible token (NFT), but for the still uninitiated, here’s a quick&nbsp;primer.</p><p>Your typical cryptocurrency, much like currencies in general, are fungible. All that means is that you’re happy to accept a like-for-like replacement if you own one. I’m happy to have any U.S. dollar — it’s all the same to&nbsp;me.</p><p>That’s not the case for non-fungible tokens, which represent unique assets. Your plane ticket — that’s technically an NFT. Trade your ticket with someone else and it means you’re sitting somewhere else on the&nbsp;plane.</p><p>That makes an NFT very suitable for digital art, content, and collectibles. And beyond that, these tokens have potentially countless use cases. Maybe it’s a collectible. Maybe it’s a ticket to an event. Maybe it’s a membership pass, functioning as gated access for a private community. Maybe it’s a way for creators to assign attribution to their&nbsp;work.</p><p>After a brief lull after the crypto correction in May, the market is once again exploding.</p><p>Visa just <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/23/why-did-visa-buy-a-150k-nft-why-does-anyone/">bought a cryptopunk for $150,000</a>.</p><p>Ripple is <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/evolving-ripplenet-for-a-tokenized-future/">leaning into tokenization</a>.</p><p>Facebook is talking about<a href="https://blockworks.co/facebooks-novi-digital-wallet-could-support-nfts-in-future-exec-says/"> including NFT support for its Novi wallet</a> later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>European soccer teams have <a href="https://protos.com/fan-tokens-socios-european-football-clubs-200m-selling-crypto/">sold over $200 million worth of tokens</a> to its&nbsp;fans.</p><p>Justin Sun <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2021/08/23/justin-sun-buys-nft-rock-half-million-dollars">bought a digital rock</a> for half a million dollars. Yes — digital rocks are now status symbols in the crypto community. Don’t&nbsp;ask.</p><p>And the success of NFT projects such as degen apes (again, don’t ask) on Solana has helped <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/solana-summer">skyrocket the speedy, scalable crypto token</a> to over $100. (Hard Yaka is an early investor in&nbsp;Solana.)</p><p>All told, August has already seen <a href="https://blockworks.co/nft-craze-rages-on-as-august-sales-near-900m/">NFT sales over $900&nbsp;million</a>.</p><p>Let’s not get it twisted — this bubble will likely burst at some point and a lot of people will get left holding the bag. But some will also likely hold lasting value. (Good luck picking the right&nbsp;ones.)</p><p>Speculation aside, the concept, the technology — that’s real. That’s sticking around. And we’re only just experimenting with the tip of the iceberg here. We haven’t yet grasped its full potential. But it will forever change the way we interact with digital things and each other on the internet.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://blockworks.co/facebooks-novi-digital-wallet-could-support-nfts-in-future-exec-says/">Facebook’s Novi Digital Wallet Could Support NFTs in Future, Exec Says — Blockworks</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/m">/m </a>— <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-24/facebook-fb-explores-nfts-as-part-of-novi-digital-wallet">Facebook Considers Building NFT Features Alongside Digital&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/23/why-did-visa-buy-a-150k-nft-why-does-anyone/">Visa Gives NFTs Their El Salvador Moment | David Z.

 At Anonyome Labs we value well-written code that has good tests. This is a guide on how we go about producing useful and meaningful tests for our Android code. 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



 Testing approach: SDK or app? 



<p></p>



<p>Testing code isn’t a “one approach fits all” affair. The nature of the code you want to test will dictate the strategy you should employ. For example:</p>



  Building an SDK?&nbsp;<br>Unit tests that use a mock environment will give good coverage of hard-to-reach error paths, plus integration tests that run on Android device or emulator will exercise real world behaviour.  Creating an app?&nbsp;<br>Unit tests that use a mock environment plus Espresso visual tests that exercise all the visual elements and the screen-to-screen navigation will give you confidence all is well.  



<p>Your desire to test your code well will often mean you will structure your code in a way that makes it easier to test. It might make it a little more complicated than you had originally intended, by causing you to make parts of it replaceable when under test, but don’t be shy of this. Good tests will give you confidence in your code and give the next person who has to maintain it confidence they have not broken anything.</p>



 Unit tests that use a mock environment 



<p></p>



<p>Writing tests that run your code under the control of&nbsp;<a href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://robolectric.org/">Robolectric</a>&nbsp;with a mocking library, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mockito/mockito-kotlin">Mockito</a>, will allow you to replace the code you didn’t write with mock or spy versions. When the tests run your code, they can check it made all the right calls. You can use these mocks to cause exceptions to be thrown from all the different places where an error can occur and check your code handles them correctly. In many cases, trying to test the error paths without using mocks and spies can be very difficult.</p>



<p>Imagine you have created a nice new API and you want to test it. Here is a very simple example:</p>







<p>At point&nbsp;A&nbsp;in&nbsp;MyApi&nbsp;you can see that the&nbsp;Worker, which simulates some other system your API needs to use, is provided to the API in the constructor which will allow you to override it in tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a test you might write to exercise the API and check the API does what you intend under normal operation and that the error conditions are handled correctly under abnormal conditions:</p>











<p>At&nbsp;B&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>MyApiTest,</code>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<code>mockWorker</code>&nbsp;is created that replaces the real&nbsp;<code>Worker</code>&nbsp;at&nbsp;C. This allows you to control the behaviour of the&nbsp;<code>Worker</code>&nbsp;and get it to misbehave when you need it to in the tests that check handling of error conditions.</p>



<p>At&nbsp;D&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>MyApiTest,</code>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<code>fini</code>&nbsp;method is annotated so that it is run after (<code>@After</code>) each test (<code>@Test</code>). It checks that the test that has just been run has correctly verified that every interaction by your API with the mock has been accounted for with a&nbsp;<code>verify</code>&nbsp;call. This will trap any unexpected interactions by your API with the&nbsp;<code>Worker</code>.</p>



<p>At&nbsp;E&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>MyApiTest,</code>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<code>mockWorker</code>&nbsp;is changed for just that test to throw an exception instead of returning a result. This allows you to check that all the error conditions that can occur are dealt with by your API.</p>



<p>Other interesting aspects to note about this test are:</p>



  The test methods have unusual names. They provide a description of what the test is doing and the expected outcome. They often have the form&nbsp;<code>`&lt;method name&gt; should &lt;do|not do&gt; &lt;something&gt;`.</code>  There are many powerful testing libraries that can make your test easier to read and maintain. The&nbsp;<code>shouldThrow</code>&nbsp;method is used to check that the&nbsp;<code>doWork</code>&nbsp;method throws an exception and that it is the the correct exception.  The comments&nbsp;<code>given</code>,&nbsp;<code>when</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>then</code>&nbsp;are encouraged because they make the tests easier to read and make it clear which part of the code is setup, invocation and checking for expected results.  



 Spy versus mock 



<p></p>



<p>There are situations where using a spy instead of a mock object may be beneficial. A mock is appropriate when you want to replace all the methods of an object. A spy can be used to replace a small number of methods on a real object. This is particularly useful on objects with many methods.</p>



<p>Imagine you have an API that uses&nbsp;<code>android.content.Context</code>&nbsp;which is a very common class with many methods.</p>







<p>And of course you want to test it well but mocking out the&nbsp;Context&nbsp;class would be tiresome — after all, your API only uses one method. This is where a spy is useful.</p>











 Testing on an Android device or emulator 



<p></p>



<p>Testing with mocks under the control of&nbsp;<code>JUnit</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>Robolectric</code>&nbsp;is a great way to really exercise your code, but it’s not the real world. Writing a test that runs on Android and makes use of the real environment will give you an extra level of confidence that you are using the right APIs on the platform and that you are using the environment correctly and have all the necessary permissions. This is very valuable when you are dealing with connections over a network, local databases or any other type of specialised API.&nbsp;</p>







<p>This test focuses on checking that the API operates correctly under normal conditions when run on an Android device or emulator. Interesting aspects of this test are:</p>



  The method names have to be proper Java identifiers to be run on Android.&nbsp;  A different runtime environment is required for on device tests (<code>@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class)</code>).  No mocks are being used.  



<p>It is possible that setting up an integration test that can authenticate with your servers to run the tests may be difficult. This will depend on the nature of your API and authentication mechanisms. Don’t immediately throw this in the ‘too hard basket.’ At Anonyome we design our systems so that we always have a test authentication mechanism that can be used instead of the production authentication system by developers during development and by automated tests. Naturally this must be done very carefully to avoid introducing a security hole, but if you can achieve this you will have a well-tested system in which you will have confidence.</p>



 Testing an app screen 



<p></p>



<p>When building an app, it is good practice to structure your code so that each screen can be tested thoroughly in isolation. Generally at Anonyome we use the VIPER design pattern for each of our screens. This pattern leads us to naturally break up the parts of each screen into pieces that can be easily separated. Each piece is supplied with the APIs it needs, usually at construction, making it easy to mock these pieces and then use the&nbsp;<code>verify</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>verifyNoMoreInteractions</code>&nbsp;methods to check we have accounted for all the places our screen interacts with other parts of the app.</p>



<p>Here is a simplified example of a screen implemented as a VIPER module:</p>







<p>Because the classes of the screen communicate to each other through interfaces, it is easy to test each part of the screen in isolation. Here is an example of how the presenter test might look:</p>







 Visual testing with Espresso 



<p></p>



<p>While it’s good practice to test all your screens in isolation with unit tests and mocks, this can’t give you confidence that your app actually hangs together. Unit tests can’t check that the flow of screens in your app is correct and that the right screen is shown in the right order. This is where visual testing with Espresso comes in.</p>



<p>Espresso tests invoke an&nbsp;<code>Activity</code>&nbsp;within your app and then simulate clicking on views, entering text, scrolling and all the other actions a real user would perform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso">articles</a>&nbsp;on how to write Espresso tests available on the Android Developers site and elsewhere, so I won’t repeat that material here.</p>



<p>When you start developing an Espresso test for the first time using the Espresso APIs you very quickly end up with a test with hundreds of lines of calls of the Espresso methods. This usually results in a long test that can be very difficult to understand for developers who have to maintain the code after you.</p>



<p>To combat this there is a pattern for developing Espresso tests that we have adopted at Anonyome. We use a robot pattern for our tests. Each screen of your app has an associated robot that knows about the controls of that screen and sometimes how to navigate to it from when the app is launched.</p>







<p>Using the robot the test becomes much simpler and easier to maintain:</p>







 Recipes 



<p></p>



 @VisibleForTesting 



<p>There may be parts of your app that you need to expose to test code so that it can check for correct operation. This can be done by making those parts more widely visible and annotating them with&nbsp;<code>@VisibleForTesting</code>which tells the IDE that only tests can exploit the wider visibility of this item.</p>







 Capturing arguments from calls to mocks 



<p></p>



<p>When using a mock there may be times that at the end of the test you want to check that not only was the method of the mock called but it was called with the correct arguments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you only want to check a few of the arguments of the call there is the&nbsp;<code>argThat</code>&nbsp;matcher that can help. In this example we want to verify that our code invoked an&nbsp;<code>Activity</code>&nbsp;with the correct action.</p>







<p>If you have more complicated checks that you wish to perform on the method arguments, you can capture the value(s) with an&nbsp;argumentCaptor&nbsp;and perform all sorts of checks. In this example we want to verify that our code invoked an&nbsp;Activity&nbsp;with the correct information inside the&nbsp;Intent.</p>







 Conclusion 



<p></p>



<p>If you are building an app, use a combination of unit tests and Espresso tests to give you excellent coverage and confidence your app is working properly. If it’s an SDK, then the combination of unit tests and integration tests will do the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To take advantage of the full power of mocks and spies in unit tests, you may have to structure your code so that is exposes the interfaces your code uses to communicate with other parts of the app or operating system. This will allow you to thoroughly check all the paths through your code.</p>



<p>Use the robot pattern to make your Espresso tests concise, readable and maintainable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How regulatory risk and growth go hand in hand</p>
<p>The fintech revolution has led to significant disruption in the financial services and banking sector. Through lower cost, fast development, use of better technology, and superior <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ekyc-europe-regulation-customer-experience/">customer experiences</a>, fintechs operating in every banking area have impacted the way banks innovate and customers bank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As fintechs consider their growth plans, there are many factors to consider, such as international expansion, what type of additional licenses to obtain to expand their product suite and how to utilise the most innovative technologies. These considerations and subsequent decisions lead to increasingly complex regulatory requirements and more regulatory risk, specifically in the area of KYC and AML. fintechs must essentially balance between sustainable growth plans and taking on the right amount of regulatory risk. Without considering regulatory risks due to new licenses and international expansion, fintechs run the risk of a material impact on the business.&nbsp;</p>
 Regulatory risks every fintech should consider 
<p>The European eKYC mix varies by country, with different options, norms, and standards. Similar national identity systems in Scandinavia, such as BankID, make for a relatively easy international expansion for a fintech based in Denmark to expand into Sweden or Norway. However, most countries experience differences not just in national KYC regulations but also in how the majority of customers approach data privacy and views on using fully digital financial services. For example, a UK fintech looking to expand in Germany will need to consider different KYC regulations stipulated by the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">BaFin (German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority)</a> and a higher proportion of customers who value digital privacy and may not have experience in undertaking digital KYC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second risk involves acquiring new licenses to operate. In general, fintechs either hold an e-money institution, a banking license, or passport off the license held by a Banks as a Service (BaaS) provider.&nbsp; Fintechs tend to start with either an e-money license (EMI)&nbsp; or using a BaaS provider, as the time, resources, and capital requirements for a banking license are arduous. However, as fintech “grow up,” they acquire the coveted banking license, either by application or by acquiring an existing bank. When a fintech company becomes a licensed bank, there is greater regulatory scrutiny and requirements. Although the door is opened to offer a broader range of products and services such as loans and investments, new products are inherently subjected to greater risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A third risk applicable to fintechs is how to implement and potentially experiment with new technologies which could be subject to regulation. Fintechs pride themselves on their “digital-first” mentality. Specifically, fintechs operating in the cryptocurrency space, or using AI and Machine Learning for robo-advice or lending products, face a high risk of medium to long term regulation in how these technologies can be used in a financial services context, regardless of the type of license they hold.<br>
</p>
<p>Although fintechs face a range of regulatory risks as they scale, maintaining and re-assesing&nbsp;an effective risk management strategy and implementing future-proof KYC solutions are key.&nbsp;</p>
 Finding a future-proof solution to mitigate regulatory risk 
<p>An eKYC solution, such as AI-driven ID verification is one way fintechs can ensure they are mitigating regulatory risks at almost any stage of their growth plans. These solutions are highly customizable, ensuring that fintechs are adhering to the necessary KYC requirements based on their license, technology uses, and geographies they operate in, and provide a seamless customer experience, a critical factor as fintech disruption has been the result of putting a good UX front and center. Solutions that can also similarly <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML screening and monitoring</a> with KYC can create a quicker, user friendly and memorable <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/customer-onboarding-banking-balance-security-ux/">onboarding experience</a>, ensuring fintechs keep ahead in the battle for user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For fintechs from various areas, such as Buy-Now-Pay-Later companies, early and late stage cryptocurrency companies and fintechs with an EMI looking to broaden their product offering with a full-banking license, regulatory risk should be top of mind. In particular, mitigating risks through a future-proof KYC strategy are critical in ensuring the technological, product, legal and cultural growth of any fintech are aligned to the future vision and plans for growth. Looking to a customizable, future-proof eKYC solution, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AI-driven ID verification</a>, can ensure that your fintech can seamlessly launch in new markets, mitigate significant changes in maintaining compliance with the addition of new licenses, and mitigate risks when using new and unchartered technologies.</p>

<p>Dit artikel van Gert Vasse is gepubliceerd <a href="https://www.ockto.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/p42-43-Gert-Vasse.pdf">VVP 4-2021</a>.</p>



<p>Innovaties moeten altijd even landen. Vaak duurt het even voordat het massaal omarmt wordt. Maar soms wordt het ook snel omarmd en gebruikt, en komt later meer oog voor detail.</p>



<p>De Inkomensbepaling Loondienst rekentool (IBL) is een voorbeeld van de laatste categorie. De tool is de afgelopen jaren in rap tempo door adviseurs omarmd. Het is de perfecte manier om vroeg in het adviesproces de consument al duidelijkheid te geven over het inkomen uit loondienst en daarmee de leencapaciteit. Met die zekerheid onder de arm kan de consument met een gerust hart gaan bieden op een woning.</p>



<p>De rekentool werd in februari dit jaar tijdelijk offline gehaald, tot afgelopen maand. Adviseurs en consumenten hebben dus 5 maanden lang extra inspanningen moeten doen om in deze verhitte woningmarkt snel de zekerheid te krijgen of het inkomen voldoende was voor die ene schaarse woning. En het was niet enkel de woningmarkt die verhit was.</p>



 Als de angst regeert 



<p>Velen van jullie hebben net als ik de kredietcrisis in alle hevigheid meegemaakt. “Dit mag ons nooit meer gebeuren, laten we zaken beter reguleren om herhaling te voorkomen!”. Met dat in het achterhoofd zijn vervolgens alle hypotheekprocessen en innovaties kritisch gewogen. Dat gebeurt, begrijpelijk, nog iedere dag. Maar soms schieten we met z’n allen in de stress en lijkt de angst te regeren.</p>



<p>Achteraf hoor ik van de grote meerderheid dat het een storm in een glas water was; zowel van hypotheekverstrekkend- als adviserend &amp; bemiddelend Nederland. En ook dat de angst voor overkreditering gelukkig niet is uitgekomen. Ondertussen zijn wel heel veel mensen druk geweest met audits, reviews van dossiers, etc. Het heeft vele verhitte discussies tussen de ketenpartners opgeleverd. Er zijn veel lessen geleerd, hoop ik…</p>



 Extra stempel in het rijbewijs 



<p>Goed, over tot de orde van de dag. We werken met z’n allen als professionals in de financiële sector. We mogen dus van onszelf verwachten dat we altijd zelf ook blijven nadenken over de wereld achter de innovaties. En accepteren dat er altijd bepaalde restrisico’s zijn die zich kunnen voordoen.</p>



<p>De adviseur is over het algemeen de enige persoon in het hypotheekproces die ook daadwerkelijk de consument spreekt. Dit specialistische paar ogen is zeer waardevol voor de consument, maar zeker ook voor de hypotheekverstrekker. De consument ken je pas als je ‘m hebt ontmoet, en de dialoog bent aangegaan over de woon- en hypotheekwensen. Innovaties voegen daar stapsgewijs waarde aan toe: de Inkomensbepaling Loondienst zorgt dat je met de klant aan tafel direct een groen vinkje krijgt voor het loondienstinkomen. Waarmee je als adviseur dus feitelijk een stukje werk van de hypotheekverstrekker mag overnemen, een bevoegdheid om heel zuinig op te zijn! Zie het maar als een extra stempel op het rijbewijs.</p>



<p>Het is dus niet zomaar een trial &amp; error tool: het is een stuk gereedschap dat enkel door pro’s gebruikt mag worden die donders goed weten wat ze doen. Deze pro’s kennen het klantdossier als geen ander én hebben als enige personen in het proces de klant gesproken over de bestendigheid van het inkomen, de woonwensen en de impact van eventuele levensgebeurtenissen.</p>



 Ode aan de Inkomensbepaling Loondienst 



<p>We hebben veel te danken aan de IBL rekentool. Adviserend Nederland kan eindelijk weer in een vroeg stadium een grote groep consumenten zekerheid geven of het inkomen voldoende is voor de woning. Ook hebben we de afgelopen maanden geleerd dat we als mens alert moeten blijven. Hopelijk schieten we niet weer met z’n allen in de stress bij een volgend incident. Want 1 ding is zeker: incidenten zullen er altijd zijn.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the sixth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/alvinTIOx">Alvin</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyPH">Philippines Community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I first heard about Ontology via a website called stakingrewards.com. I liked the idea of decentralized identity (DID) and also the staking reward opportunities.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I own some ONT tokens and wanted to give my full support. I like the Ontology brand and&nbsp;product.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>The key role of a Harbinger is to increase awareness about Ontology, grow the community, educate newcomers about Ontology’s products and earning opportunities, and answer any questions from the community.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Being part of the Ontology community is very important because I interact with other like-minded people and stay up-to-date with Ontology’s latest developments.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities? Is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>The Harbinger program. Other projects don’t have a community-oriented program like this. Ontology has a variety of local language communities to accommodate community members from different parts of the&nbsp;world.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>Twitter, Facebook, and Telegram. I really want to have a YouTube channel as well but I don’t have enough funds to set one up. I don’t have a camera or microphone for live streaming. One day in the future I hope to be able to start a channel to help support Ontology.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>I received Ontology merchandise, including Ontology T-shirts, a bag and stickers. I earned these from my service as a Harbinger. My advice would be to get active in the project, study it and its products and share your knowledge with&nbsp;others.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Growing, active, consistent.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>Doing AMAs is great but I would like to see it in all local communities, not only in the ONTO Wallet Telegram group. For example on Binancei, every time there is a new project, an AMA is held in all of their local communities. Now NFTs and GameFi are trending, it would be great to have an NFT game Ontology network like HyperDragon.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>Three years of growth is a great milestone, already. Many partnerships and EVM integration coming will bring great products to Ontology. The community needs to be consistent in letting the world know how great Ontology is so we can onboard more&nbsp;members.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p><p>Tune in next week for the seventh interview in the Ontology Harbinger Interview Series.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Sterke vereenvoudiging gemeentelijke dienstverlening door eenduidige procesvoering 



<p>BS&amp;F en Ockto breiden hun samenwerking uit. In het introductiejaar zijn al meer dan 20 gemeenten Ockto in combinatie met het platform Gezondverzekerd.nl van BS&amp;F gaan gebruiken om gemeentelijke regelingen op rechtmatigheid te toetsen. Beide partijen kijken terug op een succesvol jaar en intensiveren nu hun samenwerking met de ontwikkeling van één uniforme applicatie voor het gemeentelijke domein.</p>



<p>Met deze applicatie kunnen minima en kwetsbaren eenvoudig inzicht krijgen voor welke regelingen zij in aanmerking komen en deze via één uniform aanvraagproces eenvoudig aanvragen. De nieuwe applicatie biedt gemeenten een volledig geautomatiseerd toetsingsproces ten behoeve van een efficiënte uitvoering van deze regelingen. Met het ontwikkelen van één uniforme applicatie willen BS&amp;F en Ockto de&nbsp;versnippering van processen rondom gemeentelijke regelingen oplossen.</p>



 Eén proces voor alle gemeentelijke regelingen 



<p>Binnen de nieuwe applicatie hoeven gegevens slechts eenmalig, volledig AVG-proof, aangeleverd te worden via de Ockto-app. Daarmee worden de gegevens in één keer correct, volledig en digitaal aangeleverd. Via de Ockto-app haalt een inwoner de benodigde gegevens rechtstreeks op bij overheidsbronnen zoals de Belastingdienst en het UWV. Na toestemming van de aanvrager worden de gegevens verstuurd en direct ingelezen in de Backoffice applicatie van BS&amp;F, waar de gemeente de getoetste aanvragen kan inzien en behandelen.</p>



<p>De applicatie maakt op basis van de aangeleverde data direct inzichtelijk voor welke regelingen de inwoner in aanmerking komt. Zo worden behoefte voor aanvullende regelingen en kwalitatieve toetsing sneller bij elkaar gebracht en processen voor de vele verschillende regelingen gestandaardiseerd.</p>



 Reductie administratieve lasten van wel 60% 



<p>Dit levert een forse besparing op van de administratieve lasten bij gemeenten. Laurens Krol, directeur BS&amp;F: “In een Randstedelijke gemeente waar onder andere de toetsing wordt uitgevoerd van de Gemeentepolis leidt dit al tot een reductie van 60% van de benodigde capaciteit. Het inzetten van de applicatie voor de andere gemeentelijke regelingen biedt kansen voor verdere optimalisatie.”</p>



 Aansluiting met andere initiatieven in het sociale domein om versnippering te voorkomen 



<p>Andere initiatieven in het (gemeentelijke) sociale domein kunnen hun oplossing ook aansluiten op het BS&amp;F platform. Hiertoe wordt&nbsp;<a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgezondverzekerd.nl%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Crob.janssen%40bsenf.nl%7Cea21f065027b4b90082208d948292322%7Cfd0a521d354d4e2db363f5d833376d6f%7C0%7C0%7C637620163791275099%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=ZotG01jZrFxvsCX6pKhzrpe6VxwE%2B1RQZMUmdcRTC30%3D&amp;reserved=0">Gezondverzekerd.nl</a>&nbsp;ook toegankelijk gemaakt voor andere partijen. Zo ontstaat er een brede samenwerking, die alle partijen in de keten van (schuld)hulpverlening ondersteunt om minima financieel, fysiek en mentaal fitter te maken en de uitvoering sterk te vereenvoudigen. Auke Dirkmaat, Head of Sales Ockto: “Hiermee wordt voor alle partijen het oerwoud aan regelingen inzichtelijk gemaakt in een uniforme oplossing voor alle regelingen binnen het sociale domein. Toegankelijk voor iedereen, op basis van betrouwbare gegevens die zorgen voor een enorme efficiëntieslag bij de toetsing op rechtmatigheid”.</p>



 Over BS&amp;F 



<p>BS&amp;F biedt al ruim 20 jaar toegang tot zorg en ondersteuning van kwetsbare inwoners. Via Gezondverzekerd.nl kunnen in meer dan 300 gemeenten inwoners met een laag inkomen een Gemeentepolis afsluiten. Onlangs kondigde BS&amp;F aan samen te gaan met Intermediad. Intermediad is marktleider in stadspassen voor diverse doelgroepen waaronder minima&nbsp;en ontzorgt met Bureau Minimaregelingen gemeenten in de uitvoering hiervan.</p>

<p>The growing digitalization of our lives means that we interact with thousands of apps, hundreds of companies, and possibly millions of users each year, depending on what we do&nbsp;online.</p><p>While these interactions have opened a world of possibilities, it has also greatly increased the risk of data breaches because we don’t know where our data and identities are stored, who accesses them, and where they are used. These concerns of privacy and security have led to the evolution of a framework called the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign identity</a> (SSI), where the owner of a data controls where his/her data resides, chooses where to use it, and determines with whom it can be&nbsp;shared.</p><p>The widespread implementation of SSI or any other framework for that matter requires a set of standards to make the data interoperable and to create an ecosystem that will leverage its power. One such standard implementation is the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) that uses claims or data objects called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p><p>As a user, you might wonder why in the world you should embrace VCs and what’s in it for you. Well, here are some reasons to use&nbsp;them.</p> Follows the Principles of Decentralization <p>Verifiable Credentials put you right at the center of the system, as per the principles of decentralization.</p><p>Contrast this with some of the more prevalent systems such as the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">Federated Identity Management</a> (FIM), where the identity provider is at the center of the system and determines where and how data must be stored and used. Sometimes, these identity providers even decide which apps can be given access to your data, and in the process, creates a centralized and monopolized system.</p><p>But with VCs, the data owners determine the applications that can access their data. In fact, these owners sit in the middle of what’s called a trust triangle, thereby connecting the issuers and verifiers in an ecosystem.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. An individual (holder) has taken COVID vaccination at a healthcare company and the details of this vaccination have to be verified by airport authorities before the holder can board a flight. Here, the healthcare provider is the issuer and the airport authority is the verifier, and these two entities are connected by the holder, thereby making him/her the central point of the transaction.</p><p>Thus, VCs empower decentralization because every piece of data is owned and controlled by the individual holder and not by any single&nbsp;entity.</p> Interoperable across&nbsp;Systems <p>VCs are interoperable across many systems and can be used in almost every possible scenario. Here is a list of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-proof-of-concept-poc-for-verifiable-credentials-edf684b592f2">use-cases</a> where VCs can be used and PoCs developed based on&nbsp;them.</p><p>The biggest advantage of VCs is they are interoperable. Let’s say, you have your date of birth as a VC that’s stored in a digital wallet. Now, you can use this VC by itself to prove that you are above 18 years or you can combine it with other VCs to create a verifiable presentation and share it with the chosen verifier.</p><p>The number of places where you can use these VCs is virtually endless. Going back to the date of birth VC, you can show it as proof of age to buy alcohol or you can combine it with a bunch of other VCs into a verifiable presentation to open a bank&nbsp;account.</p><p>The possibilities and use cases are truly&nbsp;endless.</p> Secure and Authentic <p>VCs are a safe and secure way to ensure that your data is seen only by the intended recipient, which is often the verifier, though it can also be seen by companies to whom you choose to sell your&nbsp;data.</p><p>All VCs are secured by <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">Public Key Cryptography</a> and digital signatures, so they can’t be seen by unauthorized entities. Further, these encryption mechanisms help the verifiers to attest to the authenticity of the data and the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>In this sense, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">VCs</a> are a win-win situation for everyone involved. It creates business opportunities for the issuer, secures the data for the holder, and ensures the authenticity of the data for the verifier.</p> Complete Control over your&nbsp;Data <p>One of the driving principles of SSI is data control and ownership, and VCs help to achieve&nbsp;that.</p><p>Typically, the issuer provides a VC to a holder, which is stored by the latter in a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital wallet</a>. The holder (which is you) has the power to decide what parts of a VC should be combined in a verifiable presentation sent to the verifier.</p><p>For example, if an issuer has given your full name, date of birth, and a government ID as a VC, using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/deciphering-bbs-signatures-e853bbf437bf">BBS+ signatures</a>, you can just take one credential, say your government ID, put it in a presentation, and send it to the verifier.</p><p>That’s the level of granular control you have over who views your information.</p> Protects Privacy <p>One of the biggest issues with the current digital identity systems is a lack of privacy. Besides hackers, your online activities can be monitored by government agencies, your Internet Service providers (ISPs), and&nbsp;others.</p><p>But these issues are non-existent with VCs because every piece of information is digitally signed. The issuer encrypts the data using the holder’s public key, and this credential can only be viewed by the holder, thanks to the public-private key pair in digital encryption.</p><p>Hence, no one besides you and those with whom you want to share your data can encroach into your private&nbsp;life.</p> Meets Compliance <p>As governments understand the need for security and privacy, they are pushing towards a decentralized digital environment with the required legislation. A case in point is the EU’s Digital Wallet announcement and the&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">GDPR</a>.</p><p>As governments move farther on this front, you need a system that will meet these compliance requirements, and as you have guessed, VCs perfectly fit the&nbsp;bill.</p> Easy to Implement <p>VCs are easy to implement from a developers’ standpoint and easy to use from an end-user perspective.</p><p>Affinidi’s tech stack gives all the APIs and SDKs you need to build a VC-based application, and it also offers support to developers throughout the development process.</p><p>As for end-users, accessing and sharing VCs is easy too, as they can hold it in a digital wallet that’s controlled by them, and share it by combining it all in a verifiable presentation. A friendly UX can hide the complexities for the end-user, making it a breeze to securely share credentials with anyone in the&nbsp;world.</p> Power to Monetize your&nbsp;Data <p>VCs give you the option to monetize your data with the company you want. This provides two major benefits straight out of the box. First off, you get to make money out of your data instead of an identity provider raking in profits from your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Secondly, you know who is using your data and how it’s likely to be used. In this sense, you make money on your terms and through a company or way that’s most comfortable for&nbsp;you.</p><p>To conclude, VCs are likely to be a gamechanger and an integral part of the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/innovation-in-digital-identity-and-credentials-in-the-post-covid-world-f182a5743ce8">future</a> given the many benefits they offer to individuals, businesses, and the web ecosystem as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>To learn more about VCs and how you can use them to build applications, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a> or email&nbsp;us.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.

<p>Per velocizzare le procedure di apertura di un conto Widiba, dallo scorso 21 giugno è possibile usare l’identità digitale InfoCert: pochissimi minuti per sbrigare le pratiche. Il direttore IT e Innovazione Daniela Pivato: “Puntiamo a rendere l’interazione col cliente più semplice, intuitiva e di valore”.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Ad oggi, sono più di&nbsp;21 milioni gli italiani in possesso delle credenziali SPID. Lo strumento è nato per rispondere alle esigenze dei cittadini di interfacciarsi in maniera smart ai servizi della Pubblica Amministrazione, ma oggi finalmente si registra un’altra &nbsp;importante svolta verso il settore privato.</p>



<p>Grazie al supporto di InfoCert infatti, Banca Widiba, l’istituto di credito “digital native” – che ha appena vinto il premio innovazione Abi per la digital transformation – aggiunge un nuovo tassello nell’ambito della strategia votata ai servizi innovativi, integrando la soluzione di InfoCert nella sua piattaforma per certificare l’identità dei clienti e i processi di contrattualizzazione.</p>



 Widiba e InfoCert insieme per una migliore customer experience 



<p>Widiba è la prima banca in Italia a sfruttare le potenzialità dello strumento SPID per aprire un nuovo conto bancario. Questa scelta è derivata anche da una lunga collaborazione con InfoCert, che già da anni supporta l’istituto di credito nell’acquisizione di nuovi clienti e nella gestione delle pratiche bancarie.</p>



<blockquote><p>Volevamo cambiare profondamente le normali procedure operative bancarie fatte di montagne di moduli di carta da firmare, controfirmare e inviare per posta o consegnare alla filiale più vicina.</p>Daniela Pivato, Direttrice IT e Innovazione Digitale di Banca Widiba</blockquote>



<p>Il processo di onboarding è completamente paperless, basato sulle soluzioni di Firma Digitale e Posta Elettronica Certificata di InfoCert, che insieme costituiscono la cosiddetta TOP – Trusting Onboarding Platform.</p>



<blockquote><p>Non si è trattato semplicemente di acquistare due prodotti, ma di studiare insieme come integrare efficacemente le due soluzioni nei nostri sistemi, così da garantire semplicità e fluidità all’intera procedura di onboarding. La nostra volontà era quella di traghettare la clientela nell’era digitale nel modo più naturale possibile. Ma anche quella di aumentare la conversion dei conti e il cross selling di nuovi prodotti.</p>Daniela Pivato</blockquote>



<p>L’automazione dei processi ripetitivi, oltre a migliorare la customer experience in chiave digitale, ha anche permesso alla banca di risparmiare grazie all’eliminazione di stampe, invii postali, ricezione e controlli manuali dei documenti.</p>



<blockquote><p>Nella convinzione che i clienti vadano premiati, dagli inizi abbiamo stipulato un accordo ad hoc con InfoCert per cedere loro gratuitamente la casella PEC attivata con l’apertura del conto, così che possano disporne anche per fini personali, al di là degli utilizzi legati alle comunicazioni da e per la banca.</p>Daniela Pivato</blockquote>



<p>L’onboarding con SPID permette di aprire un conto con Banca Widiba in circa 5 minuti, in linea con le esperienze offerte dalle più note neobanche e digital challenger, italiane e non, incontrando il favore dei clienti e dei prospect come metodo di riconoscimento più comodo.</p>



<blockquote><p>A poche settimane dal lancio oltre il 50% degli utenti Self, ossia che operano sul conto in totale autonomia, lo ha infatti scelto come modalità preferita. Insomma, anche la collaborazione con InfoCert ci permette di continuare a proporci come anticipatori dei trend del mercato e protagonisti del cambiamento.</p>Daniela Pivato</blockquote>

 Sneller duidelijkheid over hypotheekaanvraag door online verzamelen documenten 



<p>Vanaf 31 augustus 2021 biedt De Hypotheker de Ockto-app aan al haar klanten aan. Hiermee onderscheidt zij zich in de markt door bronontsluiting als nieuwe standaard te hanteren voor het aanleveren van gegevens. Met de Ockto-app kunnen klanten via verschillende overheidsportalen zelf alle benodigde documenten voor een hypotheekaanvraag ophalen en verzamelen. Doordat al deze data via één digitaal loket worden ontsloten, zijn deze in één keer volledig beschikbaar, waardoor klanten eerder zekerheid krijgen over hun hypotheekaanvraag. Doordat alle digitale gegevens al zijn gevalideerd, kan de geldverstrekker de actuele en correcte documenten bovendien direct accepteren.</p>



<p>Met de introductie van de Ockto-app bood De Hypotheker een deel van haar klanten al sinds 2019 de mogelijkheid om documenten die nodig zijn voor de acceptatie van de hypotheekaanvraag, digitaal te verzamelen. Nu breidt zij deze dienstverlening uit naar al haar klanten, waardoor de Ockto-app de nieuwe standaard is voor het aanleveren van de benodigde hypotheekgegevens. Het enige wat klanten hoeven te doen, is de app downloaden, waarna zij worden gevraagd een QR-code te scannen in de Mijn Hypotheker-omgeving. Vervolgens wordt klanten stap voor stap meegenomen door de app. Per overheidsbron worden zij gevraagd met hun DigiD in te loggen om de documenten te ontsluiten.</p>



<p>Alle benodigde informatie kan op deze manier eenvoudig en veilig worden opgehaald &nbsp;bij verschillende <a href="https://www.ockto.nl/databronnen/">overheidsportalen</a>, zoals MijnOverheid, het UWV, de Belastingdienst en Mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl. De documenten worden vervolgens via Mijn Hypotheker direct in het systeem geplaatst. Daarnaast worden gegevens – zoals personalia, inkomens- en pensioengegevens – zo veel mogelijk automatisch ingevuld. Alle documenten worden opgeslagen in de <a href="https://www.ockto.nl/hypotheekacceptatie/">Ockto Brondata </a><a href="https://www.ockto.nl/hypotheekacceptatie/">Service</a>, een beveiligde database waar geldverstrekkers toegang tot kunnen krijgen voor het accepteren van de hypotheekaanvraag. Hiermee beschikken klanten over de zekerheid dat alle data veilig worden verzameld en gegevens niet worden opgeslagen. Ockto versleutelt alle persoonlijke informatie, waardoor alleen de partij die toestemming heeft de informatie kan inzien.</p>



 Snel duidelijkheid over hypotheekaanvraag bij De Hypotheker 



<p>Door de gevalideerde data kan een hypotheekadviseur in een veel eerder stadium zekerheid bieden over de hypotheekaanvraag. Dankzij een samenwerking met een groeiend aantal geldverstrekkers kunnen de ontsloten brondata na toestemming van de klant ook door deze geldverstrekkers worden opgevraagd. Omdat het door alle partijen gevalideerde brondata betreft, kan een aanvraag bij de samenwerkende geldverstrekker vrijwel direct worden geaccepteerd. “We zijn erg blij dat wij de Ockto-app vanaf nu standaard kunnen aanbieden voor alle hypotheekaanvragen: van de aankoop van een woning, het oversluiten van een hypotheek tot het financieren van een verbouwing”, zegt Jasper Cuijten, directeur Business Development van De Hypotheker. “Doordat zij alle brondata via deze app kunnen ontsluiten, bieden we klanten veel meer gemak tijdens het verzamelen en delen van alle gegevens voor hun hypotheekaanvraag. Samen met hun hypotheekadviseur doorlopen zij vervolgens in een aantal overzichtelijke stappen het financieringsproces, zodat zij snel zekerheid krijgen over hun hypotheekaanvraag.”</p>

<p>Are non-fungible tokens the biggest thing in crypto ever? Apparently, they are bigger than <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=NFTs+%22bigger+than+defi%22&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk020T7TNS77c1oHsAa0VVXY8uxGnHg%3A1627771163791&amp;ei=G9EFYYvUL-iE9PwP3P65WA&amp;oq=NFTs+%22bigger+than+defi%22&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBwgjEK4CECc6BwgAEEcQsAM6BQghEKsCSgQIQRgAUJ2aAVj-nAFgkZ8BaAJwAngAgAGhAYgBiwSSAQMzLjKYAQCgAQHIAQTAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLzfiPsI7yAhVoAp0JHVx_DgsQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5">DeFi</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfZDS9XGl0A">Hip Hop</a>, and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/polygon-studios-blockchain-gaming-nfts">Hollywood</a>. We’ll see. But the prospect of immutably tracking ownership of things without centralized intermediaries certainly has people’s attention. And, in many cases, their money: the first half of 2021 saw <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nft-sales-climb-to-2-47b-in-first-half-2021-report">close to $2.5B in NFT sales</a>, with some tokens <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_non-fungible_tokens">going for millions apiece</a>.</p><p>I won’t try to make this article an NFT explainer, but the basic idea is that NFTs are meant to be unique representations of ownership of an object. Objects can be digital, like a particular tweet or image file, or, in principle, physical, like a house. </p><p>To date, NFTs have been versions of smart contracts, meaning they are programs that execute particular functions using a blockchain-based computing network such as Ethereum’s. For example, an NFT might have not only a means of its ownership being transferred (with that record then stored on the blockchain), but also of a royalty being automatically sent back to the original artist every time that happens (with payment sent automatically by the blockchain network).</p><p>So, it might seem that NFTs rely on blockchain technology. It turns out, though, that NFTs are more straightforward, more versatile, and more efficient to run on Holochain than on blockchain. In this article we look at three ways this is true and why. But first a word on what it means for something to be ‘fungible’.</p> On Fungibility <p>When an item is fungible, it’s interchangeable with other instances of the item:</p>  A can of soup is more-or-less interchangeable with other cans produced from the same batch.  A brand-new tennis racket is more-or-less interchangeable with other brand-new rackets of the same make and model.  Units of a currency are designed to be interchangeable with all other units of that currency.  <p>Items in real-world systems, meanwhile, are rarely fungible:</p>  An acre of land isn’t interchangeable with other acres of land. This is why we have title records that rely on wordy descriptions of property, containing latitudes, longitudes, landmarks, and other surveyor notes.  Your favorite houseplant isn’t interchangeable with similar plants.  Friends are not interchangeable, despite what our Facebook counts might imply.  <p>Actions are also not interchangeable:</p>  When someone says “I love you”, it’s not equivalent to when someone else says it, or even when the same person says it at a different place and time. The meaning and value of the statement is inherently connected to the context in which it was spoken.  When someone dunks a basketball, it’s a unique dunk at a unique moment in time. The two points are equivalent to all the other points scored in the game, but the play has more nuance and more value than just the points scored: it provides momentum, it makes highlight reels, and it might build fan excitement or star power in a particular way that a different dunk in a different moment does not.  <p>And, of course, physical artworks and acts of art are not fungible: paintings, hand-made sculptures, particular performances of a piece of music.</p><p>What about a digital work? This one is a little trickier, because digital works can be easily replicated. But the movement toward NFTs is predicated on an idea that someone can declare a digital work to be scarce– “there will only be one NFT representing this basketball highlight clip” or “I will sell only 50 NFTs representing this painting” – and then the item, or at least its representation(s), are made scarce by that act. The token(s) representing the digital work are non-fungible.</p><p>Alright, with that established, here are three reasons NFTs make a lot of sense on Holochain.</p> I. Holochain NFTs are Efficient <p>Because blockchains are historically designed to manage interchangeable units of currency, there’s no inherent function to make units unique. When Alice spends 10 Bitcoin from her wallet, there’s no way of identifying whether the units she’s spending are ones she got from Bob, Carol, or elsewhere. It’s like water scooped into a bucket: when you scoop some out, you don’t know which inbound scoop of water the molecules you’re getting came from.</p><p>So in order to create a unique representation of something, an additional layer must be created: smart contracts that uniquely identify assets and keep the NFTs distinct from one another as their ownership is transferred. The idea is to make sure that a particular token isn’t just a representation of a certain piece of art; it is the token representation of the piece of art.</p><p>Holochain is different in its principle of provenance: every piece of data, everything ever said or done, is associated with its source. This means that every piece of data, including every token, is inherently unique – the data itself plus its source information – so no additional code is required to keep instances of data distinct from one another. Thus, an NFT on Holochain is an extraordinarily simple application: it’s just a transfer protocol, a means of assigning the token from one person to another.</p><p>Holochain’s built-in uniqueness saves on all kinds of work and costs relative to blockchain-based NFTs – developer work, storage work, and especially computing work, all of which lead to energy consumption and cost. We <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">wrote previously</a> about how blockchain’s need to reach global consensus results in substantial costs (usually called gas fees), transaction delays, ecological impact, and other inefficiency challenges. With NFTs this is even more the case, since blockchain NFTs are <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/true-or-false-a-single-nft-can-power-a-european-household-for-1-5-months">particularly energy-intensive</a> relative to ordinary transacting. Plus, as with all blockchain smart contracts, nodes are required to retain all transaction data forever, so there’s a hefty storage cost in addition to computing cost. And that’s to say nothing of storing the actual digital works that NFTs often represent.</p> II. Holochain NFTs Can Store the Actual Digital Work <p>Blockchain-based NFTs are not the actual file they represent, nor do they contain the actual file they represent. The digital work needs to be stored somewhere else – somewhere public – in order for it to be clear what the token represents. But how meaningful is it, really, to own a token of something that anyone else can access and download for themselves any time?</p><p>It’s no wonder that people question the point of NFTs and debate whether an item that’s not actually scarce can just be declared to be scarce and sold as such. Sure, there’s a case for saying the answer is yes – after all, that’s sort of what money is – but wouldn’t it be better if it were possible to buy and sell the actual unique digital file along with the NFT? Then there’s just no question.</p><p>Holochain makes that possible because files can be stored privately on one’s own personal ledger of events known as a source chain. The record representing the file’s ownership is made visible to the network, along with maybe a thumbnail of the image, but the file itself does not need to be published, even as the two are inextricably linked. This way, an artist can create a digital asset that is truly unique (or limited to a certain number of ‘prints’). When an NFT is signed over to a new owner, the actual file can get sent along with it, without sharing a copy with the world, similar to transferring a physical art piece.</p><p>It’s also easy to create ‘replicas’ of the digital work – versions that can be published widely that differ just a bit, visibly or invisibly, from the original(s). This way, the work can still serve a public purpose and/or become widely known, even as the ‘real’ version, which might be the highest-resolution version, lives safely with its owner… again, just like in the physical art world.</p> III. Holochain NFTs Can Represent Real-World Works and Property <p>How do we know for sure that a blockchain-based NFT represents the work it claims to represent? For digital works the mechanism is reasonably reliable: a unique ‘hash’, or fingerprint, of the digital file is created and stored as part of the token. But for non-digital works, the mechanism breaks down. There’s no way to be sure that the NFT you’re buying is the NFT that corresponds to the piece of land, the boat, or the painting in question. It’s a version of blockchain’s oracle problem: with everyone being anonymous and no central authority, it’s virtually impossible to incorporate real-world events (such as the creation of a painting) into on-chain events (such as designating a token to uniquely represent the painting). For this reason, blockchain-based NFTs have so far focused on digital works only – quite a major limitation.</p><p>Whereas blockchains try to provide anonymity, Holochain is optimized for accountability. Holochain’s provenance means that it’s always evident who created the NFT; its creation is digitally signed by the creator’s private keys. If an NFT supposedly represents The Starry Night, you can check to see if it was created by Vincent Van Gogh, or (more likely) the Museum of Modern Art. Of course you might have some real-world homework to make sure that the MOMA was the rightful owner of the painting at the time of the NFT’s creation, but records already exist for that, and in any case it’s a much smaller problem than one in which anyone can anonymously create an NFT claiming to represent the painting.</p><p>(Yes, you’d also need a reliable way of knowing that the private key account claiming to be the museum is actually the museum, but this is easily accomplished through <a href="https://hackmd.io/Y4QSGqn6T_amCvHv6T9f6A">Holochain’s identity protocols</a>.)</p><p>If someone else is trying to sell you The Starry Night, you can readily see the chain of ownership within the NFT’s published records, all the way back to the MOMA if this is the legitimate NFT. So not only are you sure that this NFT truly represents the painting, but you’re also sure that the person claiming to have the current right to sell it truly does.</p> The Future of Ownership <p>With the ability to represent real-world objects, the implications of Holochain NFTs extend well beyond artworks to all kinds of property – land, homes, and vehicles, for starters – pointing to a future of ownership that is digital, reliable, and independent of centralized government records. </p><p>Right now, every time you buy a house, or even refinance one that’s already yours, you pay thousands of dollars for agents to search a patchwork of municipal records systems, to make sure that the property description (still) accurately describes the property and that the title is free and clear. Title insurers currently collect <a href="https://www.firstresearch.com/industry-research/Title-Insurance-Carriers.html">$16B annually in the U.S alone</a>, mainly to ensure that property owners have the rights to sell the property they’re selling (and insure against the possibility that they don’t).</p><p>None of that is necessary in the Holochain age. Each piece of property can simply be referenced by a digital identifier, which could be called a token, that is created by the property’s originator and passed through immutable transfer protocols when a sale is made. Like all data on Holochain, the NFT data is hosted by the owner of the property. (Or on a peer hosting network such as <a href="http://holo.host">Holo</a> – but still affiliated with the property owner’s private signing keys.) The data is then ‘published’ (shared) to a table that is also held among the members of the network.</p><p>Government clerks could still sign every property transfer; we’re not talking here about eliminating municipal systems necessarily, or at least not eliminating them prematurely. But the government no longer needs to manage and host a whole bunch of offline or online infrastructure, and people retain authoritative copies of their own records.</p><p>Permissions can also be set so that owner information is shared only on a need-to-know basis, which could be useful in particular for vehicles, where we expect more privacy than with property ownership.</p><p>There’s precedent for this kind of scenario already. Estonia has converted its property records to being hosted on immutable hash chains. But Estonia did need to build new infrastructure to pull this off, plus the records are still relatively centralized, with government agencies remaining a <a href="https://medium.com/@joshmzemel/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-31bf1866e193">point of enclosure</a> (concentrated power) as well as still incurring overhead that needs to be paid for one way or another.</p><p>When everyone can just speak for themselves about their right to sell their property, with their speaking instantly verifiable just by looking at the record they’re presenting, the tracking of ownership becomes quite simple. So does shipping and logistics, which isn’t chain-of-ownership but is still chain-of-custody: imagine simplified tracking of who delivered what to whom when, making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources,_Events,_Agents">REA accounting</a> easy (HoloREA is building such tools [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uDrVLt4oN8">short video</a>|<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4xcaYnI9iY">full video</a>|<a href="https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea">Github</a>]) as well as improving supply-chain transparency so you can tell where your food, electronics, and other products came from.</p><p>More broadly, provenance around custody is a version of provenance around information: we <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/is-holochain-a-safe-haven-for-dangerous-extremists-or-a-beacon-of-hope-for-accountability-fcbb8f5d38c6">wrote previously</a> about the idea of a Holochain-powered verified web, in which signal (accurate information) is discernible from noise (potential disinformation) because no one can ever claim something was said that wasn’t, or claim something wasn’t said that was.</p><p>It might seem like a stretch to categorize provenance of all information on Holochain, property-related or otherwise, as a version of ‘NFTs’. But, from a technical standpoint, it’s actually not. Every communication and transaction on Holochain, whether it’s sending money, transferring property rights, or ordering a sandwich, is inherently non-fungible because data is always associated with stamps of time and authorship. This makes every entry of data, effectively, a unique token. Thus, Holochain isn’t just an ideal framework for NFTs; it builds the properties everyone wants from NFTs into everything. From a Holochain vantage point in which all data is already unique, the very idea of making data unique, which is what blockchain NFTs jump through hoops to try to do, may begin to seem like an artifact.</p>

<p>With many places such as restaurants, schools, and gyms now checking for COVID credentials in the U.S., we wanted to remind our users that GlobaliD currently has a quick and easy method for storing your vaccination record card with your digital identity.</p><p>Simply add the COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card self declaration (Identity tab→ [+] → Personal) in your GlobaliD app. You will be asked to take photos of your vaccination record card. Only you have access to the stored imagery, which you can share as necessary to prove that you’ve gotten your vaccination.</p><p>Of course, there are limits to this approach. The main issue is that there isn’t a convenient way to verify the authenticity of the vaccination card, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2021-08-20/global-black-market-for-fake-covid-19-vaccination-cards-flourishing">a growing problem</a> as some companies, schools, as well as the government have implemented vaccination mandates.</p><p>This implementation was always going to be a stop-gap solution.</p><p>And so today, we’re super excited to talk about the future of where the GlobaliD credentials platform is&nbsp;going.</p><p>The new and improved GlobaliD credentials platform</p><p>The existing GlobaliD verifications platform is undergoing a major upgrade — a new self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework, of which the first implementation has already been&nbsp;built.</p><p>The primary benefit of this new system is interoperable, portable, verifiable credentials that groups can issue and that users can carry with them across platforms and borders. This new framework will not only be much more scalable but also industry backed — thanks to the work of the Linux Foundation’s Cardea Project, which is working on global standardization around COVID credentials. (GlobaliD is <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f29803224">a founding member and part of the steering committee</a>.)</p><p>In case you missed <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f298032240">the announcement</a>, this is what the Cardea Project is all&nbsp;about:</p><p>Cardea is a complete ecosystem for the exchange of privacy-preserving digital credentials, open sourced as a project in Linux Foundation Public Health. Launched by Indicio.Tech, Cardea provides an easily verifiable, trustworthy, unalterable proof of health tests or vaccination that can be shared in a privacy-preserving way. Cardea easily integrates with existing health systems to ensure trusted data sources for credentials and uses decentralized identity technology to enable better control of data for individuals.</p><p>With our new platform, we’ll also be releasing a brand new COVID credential. Users will be able to validate the authenticity of their digital vaccine record from around the world and store the proof of the validation as a credential in their GlobaliD app. The user would then be able to present this proof in the interoperable format within the Cardea ecosystem and beyond. However, GlobaliD will not stop there. Because GlobaliD also enables verification of government IDs, verification of ownership of the vaccine digital record will also be possible by comparing personal information from both documents in a privacy preserving way.</p><p>Indicio.Tech, the firm that launched Cardea (and also a GlobaliD partner), is already working on active pilot implementations in <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">Aruba</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/indicio-and-liquid-avatar-technologies-launch-canada-s-first-privacy-preserving-decentralized-technology-for-sharing-health-data-827748977.html">Canada</a>.</p><p>An interoperability hackathon</p><p>On September 9, GlobaliD will be participating in an interoperability hackathon — Cardea’s Interop-athon:</p><blockquote><a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea</a>, the COVID credential project hosted at Linux Foundation Public Health, is going to host an “Interop-athon” on September 9, 8:00 am to 12:00 pm Mountain&nbsp;Time.</blockquote><blockquote>As Cardea is now being commercially deployed to share COVID-19 test results, vaccination, and trusted traveler credentials, it is important to facilitate and showcase the interoperability among these projects. To this end, Cardea will host a four-hour interoperability “hackathon style event”. The maintainers of Cardea will stand up a test environment including an Issuer, Mediator, Government, and Verifier Agents for participants to test against. Participants can also bring their own decentralized network!</blockquote><p>GlobaliD will be demoing an early implementation of our latest version of the COVID credential.

Therefore, this article&nbsp;covers the top five environmentally-friendly PoS-based blockchain projects that are now available on the market and, in particular, Ardor and Nxt. In 2013 Jelurida launched the first pure PoS blockchain platform, Nxt, and in 2018, the first multi-chain network, Ardor. Both rely entirely on a 100%-PoS consensus mechanism with low energy consumption and they easily work on any desktop or mobile device, without compromising on the security of the whole network, high interoperability, and scalability.</p>

 We are METAMUI: The world’s 1st Identity-based Blockchain to solve CBDC implementation and design&nbsp;issues MetaMUI — The world’s first identity-based blockchain<p>Sovereign Wallet Network (SWN) seeks to address the un-federated nature of digital currencies while also solving the scalability trilemma of the blockchain industry. MetaMUI is the 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated, identity-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactions, it can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.</p><p>MetaMUI completely redesigned the blockchain-based on SSID technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p>In SSID, the user’s personal data is stored and controlled by the user. This data never leave the user’s device without prior consent. This is a radical shift from the most centralized and incompatible identity systems that are widely used today. In line with these constraints, MetaMUI has developed its blockchain technology around Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSID).</p><p>MetaMUI Blockchain uses a hybrid system of high-performance digital cash and high-security digital checks. This hybrid architecture allows MetaMUI’s blockchain to be used in global-scale applications, including central banks, digital stock issuance, digital currency exchanges, non-fungible tokens, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>We utilize our indigenous multi-ledger architecture — which means that each digital currency generated on MetaMUI Blockchain will have its own blockchain ledger.

 Interview Credify’s Head of Compliance Bruno Sivanandan 



<p>Vietnam is preparing to implement its new <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=2a984c37-100b-498c-895a-81cdb0412c7e">Decree on Personal Data protection</a> at the end of 2021. Currently, it already has many regulations that govern the collection, receipt, transmission, and use of data, still many cases of infringement persist. In this interview, we had a discussion with Bruno on what Vietnamese businesses can expect and prepare for themselves when the decree comes into practice.</p>



<p>From his early working experience, Bruno soon realized the difficulties of companies to adapt their systems to such regulations. Now being the Chairman of Eurocham Digital Sector Committee, Bruno can bring discerning insights to Vietnamese businesses affected by this new decree. He also shares his case study at Credify on data compliance that can save many businesses in transforming their system architecture and coping with the growing complexity of the digital economy.</p>



<p>*Disclaimer: The comments of this article only reflect the opinion of Bruno Sivanandan and by no means those of the Eurocham or the Digital Sector Committee. Moreover, they are based on the draft decree and will be only relevant provided the actual decree does not change extensively comparatively to the draft.</p>







 What do you think about this new decree on personal data in general? 



<p>The draft Decree on Personal Data Protection is to be analyzed in relation to an array of policies pertaining to data and privacy protection, such as the Cyber Security Laws or the Decree 72 on the management, provision, and use of Internet services and online information. This regulation is absolutely necessary for Vietnam, where the digital share of the economy is growing dramatically. Without clear rules and guidance, it is likely that personal data would be handled inappropriately. This would leave the privacy of the citizens at risk and, on another scale, limit the perspectives of the inclusion of Vietnam in the global economy.</p>



<p>We are currently witnessing forced digitization of the economy, especially in Ho Chi Minh, with the strict regulations related to COVID-19. We always use more services and those are always handling more sensitive data… Even our financial and health data transit through applications nowadays. The framework in which these internet-based services operate has to ensure our safety and privacy. This is the challenge Vietnam is tackling with those regulations.</p>



 What would be the impact on Vietnamese people, to specify, the consumers and data owners? 



<p>The daily experience of the users will not change much. The main difference would be that upon accessing a service, users will have better information about why their data is collected, and to whom it is provided. The idea is that citizens be confident that any digital service they access on Vietnamese soil will respect their privacy and that authorities will actually enforce infringements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, citizens will be entitled to specific rights on their data they can use to force a service provider to erase their records or print out their data for them.</p>



 What does this decree mean for Vietnamese firms? How would it impact their business? 



<p>The private sector is likely to be the most impacted by the decree on Personal Data Protection and related laws mentioned above. Companies that are processing personal data will have to obtain a license to do so. First, this license will require proof that one’s system is secure enough, preventing hackers from getting their hands on the intimacy of the citizens. Secondly, companies need to prove that they are processing the data legitimately, i.e that the user gave his consent with sufficient details about the processing itself. Thirdly, that all the third parties involved in processing the data are themselves compliant.</p>



<p>In practice, such requirements are very costly to set up and enforce. Ideally, it means that all companies processing personal data, and that is a lot of companies, should be audited before having a license to operate, which is absolutely impractical.</p>







<p>However, where to find such resources is a problem that every single country is facing, amid a rise in cyber attacks. Only wealthy corporations are able to pay for such massive transformation projects.&nbsp; But what about the rest of the economic actors, how can we build a trusted network? We need new services on the market that lower the cost of compliance to acceptable levels. That is where Credify enters the dance!</p>



 What does this decree mean for international enterprises located both in Vietnam and overseas? 



<p>This is the million-dollar question. Cross-border data transfer is a Gordian Knot nobody has slashed at the moment. The most formidable example is probably the Privacy Shield breakdown by the Schrems II court decision. This means that European and American companies are not able to legally exchange personal data since the 16th of July 2020… it is obvious is the million-dollar question. Cross-border data transfer is a Gordian Knot nobody has slashed at the moment. The most formidable example is probably the Privacy Shield breakdown by the Schrems II court decision. This means that European and American companies are not able to legally exchange personal data since the 16th of July 2020… it is obvious that we have a problem here. This is one of the main topics we are working on at the Digital Sector Committee, we are working on solutions with the input of relevant governmental bodies.&nbsp;</p>



 What measures from governments can be taken to enhance the practice of this new decree? 



<p>Governments, in general, need to issue guidance that is as clear as possible for businesses to follow. From general legislation that states the spirit in which the law has been written, there is a need for precise “how-to” manuals for each industry. For example, in the e-commerce industry, what are major platforms supposed to do? How are they supposed to make sure their system is secured and that users are sufficiently aware of what is going on with their data?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where we mix the legal field with the IT engineering field, and typically where Best Practices need to be detailed measures by measures. The best way to achieve this is to let experts in each industry gather in working groups and issue “Codes of Conducts” for their peers to follow. Such precise guidelines clarify what exactly needs to be implemented to gather a user’s consent, encrypt a password, protect your system from an array of cyber attacks, and so on.</p>



“Only wealthy corporations are able to pay for such massive transformation projects.&nbsp; But what about the rest of the economic actors, how can we build a trusted network?“



 What advice would you give for Vietnamese businesses to prepare before the decree comes into effect? 



<p>Any business needs to have a digital transformation strategy, the Covid crisis has only accelerated a trend that has been ongoing for a few decades and made it critical to have one! In my opinion, the main elements are to focus on what is your core business and to outsource the rest to companies you trust. One example is the cloud computing services: most companies prefer to outsource this responsibility to trusted companies like AWS, Azure, GCP, it has become too costly and even less secure to buy your own servers, build your data center, cool it, assess the personnel, maintain backups and so on… If it’s not your business, leave it to people who focus on it!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The methodology I advise is first to map your system, document all the business processes, the data each one is handling, under whose supervision, and so on. This is tedious work, but it will serve as the basis of any compliance program for the Vietnamese regulation, the GDPR, an ISO certification, and much more.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The most impacted businesses are obviously those relying on personal data to provide their services. It is especially important for such companies to convey to their users the exact list of sensitive data they are processing, for what purpose, and with the help of which subcontractor(s). At the scale of a company, it is challenging to keep this documentation up to date, as it requires real discipline from the workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A general thought process is to imagine an auditor inspecting the system of your company. The auditor will want to make sure that every data flow is secured with adequate technical measures, relative to the sensitivity of the data. It is up to the company to be able to demonstrate their compliance.</p>



 How is Credify responding &amp; contributing to this new decree on data protection? 



<p>If you were to remember one idea of this article, I would go with that one: Credify is an enabler for the economic actors to take part in the digitization of the economy with minimal effort, leaving the burden of compliance to Credify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Credify has a cutting edge technology to transfer data between two systems with a high level of security while dealing with consent gathering and audibility. The vision of Credify is two-fold: first create a trusted network of companies relying on personal data, enabling them to access personal data sitting in another system while complying with the regulation, the details of how to comply are dealt with by Credify, that is our serviceX product. Secondly, empower the user with their data, that they can use to access different services, that is idX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The level of security required to operate this data bridging service is extremely high, and one needs to add all the constraints mentioned above that come from the regulation. It becomes clear that handling sensitive data is becoming a craft of its own. Companies will need a reliable partner to do it, just like they do with Cloud computing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where Credify displays its value! We are building a network where members can exchange users’ data securely, under the supervision of the users. This enables, with minimal efforts, traditional businesses to make a first step in the digital economy, or for tech-savers businesses to dramatically enhance the exposure of their services in the trusted network of Credify.</p>



 About the Head of Compliance 



<p>As the Chairman of Eurocham Digital Sector Committee, Bruno takes the role of enabling members of the committee to express their opinion about the Vietnamese Digital regulatory Landscape. Their purpose is on one hand to clarify the regulation for the business community, and on the other to give their opinion on key policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He earned his Computer Engineering degree in the National Institute of Applied Sciences of Lyon, a leading engineering university in France. He then had a diverse experience when decided to come to Vietnam, step out of the engineering world and try himself at doing business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bruno is now the Head of Compliance of Credify. Thanks to the knowledge he brings about data protection and privacy regulation, coupled with his insights from being the chairman of the digital Sector committee of the European Chamber of Commerce, and his IT background, Bruno can share a valuable perspective on the products and strategy of Credify.</p>



<p>Credify’s products, idX and serviceX, both have data privacy and cyber security at the core of their design. Therefore, Bruno’s role is to help streamline the production processes of the company to ensure everything we ship is secured, as well as designing the contractual structure with our customers to fit in the regulatory landscape that is being built.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On another hand, he is involved in gathering intelligence about the potential markets Credify can reach through this new industry of “data bridging”. This intelligence is then projected in the way we package our technology for the actors of e-commerce, insurance, finance, healthcare etc.</p>

    Important COVID-19 announcement.
  
  <br><br>
  
    Before we dive into explaining this amazing opportunity, we don’t want to waste your time. So, if you don’t have Australian citizenship or permanent residency, or if you are representing a recruitment agency, remote worker or offshore provider, then this is not for you. This role is based in Adelaide, Australia and requires the successful candidate to also have the necessary work experience and visa status and living in South Australia. Unfortunately, with the current COVID situation in Australia, the changing conditions and closed borders present too much uncertainty to candidates outside of South Australia.
  
 

<br><br>




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is looking for a&nbsp;Senior Multimedia Specialist&nbsp;for&nbsp;our&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;team, where you can contribute to the success of our product team developing our globally awarded personal data platform. The Meeco platform is comprised of suite of products including a decentralised wallet, key management store, exchange for identity, credentials &amp; tokens and secure data enclave (vault).




 




At Meeco we build the tools to enable people and organisation to access, protect and create mutual value from personal data. We are personal data pioneers offering a range of solutions powered by Meeco and decentralised on Hedera Hashgraph.




 




We are passionate about building a new digital economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, for the benefit of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organisations enter a relationship of mutual value and build a new, more meaningful way to personalise digital services. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a> to learn more about our thinking and the vision that drives us.




 




We have built a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia, Belgium and the UK. Collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, and each bring a unique personal data story that advances our mission.

As Meeco’s Multimedia Specialist, you will be responsible for both creating both internal and external communications and all projects involving the creation of digital media. You will be the first point of contact for communications and coordinate external communications with the CEO and Chief Commercial Officer. Your duties will include creating concepts for new designs, providing cost estimates, and ensuring all content meets our guidelines and security requirements.




 




This role will have client contact, therefore excellent communication and presentation skills are critical. You will be required to coordinate with clients at a variety of levels and across functions and oversee client expectations to accurate and timely delivery, including the following responsibilities:




 




• Oversee the production of digital media including videos, website development, online advertising, and email marketing




 




 •  Assisting in analysing, specifying and developing Meeco’s digital and on-line strategy including plans, guidelines and monitoring for quality and alignment to brand




 




 •  Create computer animation, audio, video and graphic image files for multimedia presentations for Meeco’s and client’s digital and web assets




 




 •  Maintain Meeco’s websites and web applications, including web programming, scripting, authoring, content management and file management




 




  •  Manage Meeco’s Digital assets (e.g. LinkedIn, Telegram, YouTube, Wistia, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Hootsuite) including posting, moderating and maintaining branded content




 




 •  Provide multimedia support for Meeco and industry events, including key notes, trade shows and conferences




 




 •  Take briefs from internal stakeholders and external clients and foster long-lasting relationships with them




 




 •  Ensure all stakeholders and clients are updated on the delivery of digital campaigns

 •   Develop Meeco iconography, and visual language in line with Meeco’s brand and style guides




 




 •   Prepare and develop internal learning materials which may include product guides and FAQs

 Information security 




Meeco is an accredited ISO27001 organisation. Information Security sits at the centre of everything we do internally and for our partners. Therefore, and understanding of information security, access management, quality assurance and security communication will be highly regarded. As would experience in the preparation of communication systems for security monitoring and audit.




 




Additionally, you will work closely with Meeco’s engineering team to ensure that security protocols are followed for digital assets and hosting websites, including backup and disaster recovery.




 




This will include designing, developing and coding with other specialised inputs, such as image files, audio files and scripting languages, to securely produce, maintain and support Meeco’s digital assets.




 




We use a variety of industry standard tools including Figma. It is not a requirement that you have experience in using any of these tools, but a willingness to learn and self-directed education is required.




 





 About you 




We are looking for someone who is an experienced multimedia professional with a minimum of 5 years’ demonstrable experience.




 




We build applications for the internet of tomorrow, a place where personal data is placed right at the centre, protected start to finish. This means we often tackle questions that have no established technical or design solutions.




 




Meeco is an environment with more questions than answers. If you are drawn to original problems, which require imaginative solutions, you’ll feel right at home. This does require you to be open for and comfortable learning new things and develop proof-of-concepts on short timelines, identifying the tasks that matter the most. English is our primary language, but as we work with European clients, having the command of other European languages is a huge plus.




 




The following is our wishlist. It is not necessary that you have all this experience, but the more you have or can pick up quickly will increase your chances of success in the role:




 




 • Be able to demonstrate a genuine interest in UX/UI, either through your study or personal projects




 




 • A tertiary qualification in the marketing field and/or a Bachelors degree (or equivalent) in the communications field, ideally a majors in multimedia




 




 • Experienced in using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, Affinity or Adobe design suite and Content Management tools such as Webflow and WordPress (including migration)




 




 •  Solid copywriting skills as well as editing and proofreading




 




 •  Experience working across different time zones, where English maybe the second language for many of your colleagues. An understanding of Dutch or French would be highly desirable




 




 •   A technical understanding of English to assist in the proof-reading and editing of content or experience in English language teaching would be a bonus




 




 •   Demonstrated understanding of what a Design System is along with keeping up to date with the latest marketing, UI/UX design and usability trends and techniques




 




 •  Experience writing and reviewing internal policies, including security and audit documentation




 




 •  Understand and have experience with web development technologies such as Javascript and CSS.




 




Whilst Meeco supports remote work, this role will be based in our Adelaide Office. Given the collaboration aspects of this role, we would like you to be in the office at least three-four days a week.&nbsp;At other times&nbsp;you are free to work where you work best.




 




We have team members in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, London (UK) and spread out in Belgium. An important reality is that this can often mean early mornings or long days.&nbsp;




 




We have flexible hours, so you can design your day around being an early bird or night owl. For six months of the year the time difference with Europe can feel brutal, and then the other six months when Europe is on summertime it is much easier. However, being able to work across time zones and be self-directed is a critical aspect of this role.




 




We value people who can work independently, are able to manage themselves, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed.&nbsp;We love you asking for help!








  What we offer 




We pay a competitive start-up&nbsp;package&nbsp;based on your experience and seniority in line with the existing members in the team. As we are still building our foundation team, additional incentives such as Options are available for the right person.




 





  What we have achieved 




We are&nbsp;early pioneers&nbsp;in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012. You can read more on our achievements and announcements on our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/">blog</a>.&nbsp;




 




Funding; our founder bootstrapped the company for the first two years before raising private equity. We have runway and revenues, so the focus for us now is building awesome products and helping our partners adopt them.




 




Brand &amp; Reputation: We launched our first product into the market in 2014 and have built a strong brand in the personal data community.

If you would like to know more about the exciting stuff we are working and have in store, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CM8tuZW5YU">check out this recent webinar</a>.




 




Awards: We have won&nbsp;nine&nbsp;international awards in Australia, UK, Netherlands and Germany for personal data management, identity, innovation and FinTech services.




 




Market: We recently launched a media platform&nbsp;for kids&nbsp;called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.miks-it.com/">mIKs-it</a>&nbsp;and a decentralised Wallet to support identity and verifiable credentials. These are just two great examples of how enterprises and other start-ups are using our technology to developer better Privacy and Security by Design personal data solutions.




 




Innovation:&nbsp;Over the past year we have grown&nbsp;our engineering team along&nbsp;with some really interesting&nbsp;blockchain/distributed ledger&nbsp;projects&nbsp;which we are currently&nbsp;productising and been launching throughout&nbsp;2021.

<p>Asset passports are more than object identities — they are dynamic tools for designing commerce using legal and software engineering.</p><p>The explosive growth of DeFi (decentralized finance) in the blockchain ecosystem has showcased the incredible power of “money legos” in building out an open, permissionless, and borderless alternative to traditional finance. At the time of writing, the total value locked in these protocols has exceeded $85 BILLION. Yet all of this value is largely speculative, facilitating little in the way of actual commerce or social&nbsp;impact.</p><p>Bringing the programmable and combinatorial nature of these open financial protocols to commerce in the real world could revolutionize how people access and provide goods and services in the years to come. But how do we bridge these two&nbsp;worlds?</p><p>The foundation of the Mattereum Protocol, the Asset Passport provides a powerful and composable legal-tech framework by bundling together warranties around goods and services which can broaden and secure the design space for digital commerce.</p> Warranties: The Legal Lego of Asset Passports <p>The Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP) was<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/introducing-the-mattereum-asset-passport-72f28c9ba6f1"> originally presented</a> as a digital identity for physical things. The idea was to use legal and software engineering to create a persistent digital identity for goods rather than people. Tethering an object with a cryptographic key pair would enable a secure evidence chain of interactions and transactions around an object, securing provenance and value for years to come. The design methodology stems from the<a href="https://iang.org/papers/intersection_ricardian_smart.html"> Ricardian contract framework</a> developed by Ian Grigg, which allows us to secure and execute property rights in virtual and physical space through dual integration of legal contracts and software.</p>The Ricardian “Bowtie”&nbsp;Model<p>In the process of gathering the data, certifying authenticity, cryptographically signing agreements (warranties) on the blockchain, and storing all documentation on IPFS, we realized that this design framework was very modular and customizable, on both the legal and technical side.</p><p>The key modular element of the MAP is the warranty. Each warranty covers various terms of a contract, ranging from identity, terms of service, arbitration, vault condition, tokenization, carbon offsets, and eventually even anti-slavery certification.</p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.100.alpha.001.150768/">https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.100.alpha.001.150768/</a><p>With the Ricardian framework, we can bind warranties together around an object over time, securing value and accountability while maximizing utility.</p><p>Let’s explore these areas in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Asset Passports Give Objects Accurate and Lasting&nbsp;Value <p>Securing the value of property is a core purpose of MAPs. We can look at two distinct but related elements which enable this within the Mattereum Protocol: digital provenance and trust communities.</p><p>Blockchain-Enabled Provenance Creates an Enduring History of&nbsp;Trade</p><p>By using the Ricardian framework of using cryptographic signatures to bind contracts and software, we can bring together all warranties around an object or service in such a way that any transaction or change to the documentation is recorded in a cryptographically secure and verifiable evidence chain of activity.</p><p>And since we use the public and global infrastructure of a blockchain shared ledger in tandem with immutable, distributed file storage via IPFS instead of traditional client-server databases, there is a much higher confidence in the integrity and accessibility of that data for years and decades to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Instead of relying solely on paper certificates of authenticity or siloed ledgers across individuals and organizations, we can immortalize the information of an object’s ownership history on the most secure networks on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>Trust Communities: Distributed Trust Networks Secure Value &amp; Reduce&nbsp;Doubt</p><p>One of the innovations which arises from the MAP is the Trust Community, a peer-produced alternative to centralized certification methods whereby a network of independent certifiers provides digital warranties to facts within the MAP over time. All claims are backed by financial stake, putting skin in the game and adding weight to their assessments. In blockchain parlance, Trust Communities can be seen as mini-DAOs for securing product information.</p><p>Without a durable and incentivized trust framework like Trust Communities, commerce on the Internet suffers from the “doubt discount.” Lack of trust and certainty impairs the value of goods online, costing sellers an average 20% per exchange.</p><p>Mattereum Trust Communities, built upon the composable, legal-tech framework of the Asset Passport, restore value, increase liquidity, and bring peace of mind to digital commerce.</p> Asset Passports Create Accountability in Digital&nbsp;Commerce <p>A clever and powerful aspect of the MAP’s design is how the dual-integrated, legal-transactional framework creates crystal-clear lines of accountability: between buyers, sellers, certifiers, and other third parties (custodians, C02 offset markets). Whenever an entity interacts or transacts with the asset, they show intent to honor a shared agreement by signing the document with a cryptographic key.</p><p>When multiple parties sign a shared agreement in this way, an interwoven evidence chain of signatures is produced which is cryptographically secure and verifiable. Ian Grigg has referred to this process as “entanglement.”</p><p>Now what happens when things go&nbsp;wrong?</p><p>In the event of a commercial or systemic fallout, any party within the MAP can file a claim for breach of a warranty which is then presented to a designated arbitration court to settle. Applicable in 150+ countries under the 1958 New York Convention on Arbitration, this digital dispute resolution framework enables near universal legal enforceability of the contracts that comprise an Asset Passport.</p><p>This arbitration clause is included in the core contract of the MAP, waiting to be invoked if things go&nbsp;south.</p> Asset Passports Give Objects More&nbsp;Utility <p>In a world littered with hundreds of billions in stranded, underutilized goods, passported objects are not only more valuable than their zero-history counterparts but are also more useful. Without a system akin to the Asset Passport, goods drastically lose their value in the secondary market and either gather dust at best or end up in a landfill at&nbsp;worst.</p><p>An object with an MAP is imbued with more potentiality, as we can then program value flows and structure social protocols which unlock its full potential. This can encompass all scales of value: a socket wrench shared by a neighborhood, a treasured art piece secured in a vault, or even a forest that owns&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Using warranties which connect to smart contracts, we can bring blockchain innovations in finance and governance into the real world.

<p>Thus far, we have published two articles (<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/can-web-3-awaken-the-internets-true-potential-dffcce766220?source=collection_detail----5e10d5c26b55-----6-----------------------">Part 1</a> &amp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/can-web-3-0-awaken-the-internets-true-potential-part-two-48562cbd5bfb?source=collection_detail----5e10d5c26b55-----2-----------------------"> Part 2</a>) outlining Web 3.0 and Ontology’s contribution to the evolving Web 3.0 landscape. In this article, we discuss Web 3.0 in relation to the “Shared Global Community” and “Mutual Trust Product Application”.</p> Shared Global Community <p>Web 3.0 will give users increased sovereignty, especially with regards to data and identity management. Ontology believes that the Web 3.0 ecosystem is driven by a decentralized future, with individuals able to build, contribute and own their preferred products and services. Ontology’s users can already fully control their data and decide who can access the data. They can also participate in developing decentralized infrastructure community activities and governance votes that impact the direction of the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Over the past few years, Ontology has managed to build a global <a href="https://ont.io/community%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%8C">community</a> spanning more than 30 languages in dozens of countries across several continents. In order to help further expand the Ontology community, we launched the Ontology <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">Harbinger Program</a>. We also launched the Harbinger <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-dumont-9964984fee4d">Interview Series</a> which gave some of Harbingers a chance to share their history with Ontology.</p><p>Finally, we continue to host regular <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4SrrJy2zHe">Community Calls</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DeIDSummit">DeID Summit</a> events every week to discuss community governance and product development.</p><p>Ontology values every member of our global community. The beauty of Web 3.0 is that it is not controlled by large centralized platforms. Rather, the decentralized Web 3.0 allows every individual to contribute whilst maintaining their autonomy.</p> Mutual Trust Product Application <p>A core issue with the current Web 2.0 landscape is that it is governed primarily by a few large tech companies that continuously accumulate, store, and monetize user data. Centralized storage of private data is vulnerable to attack. There have been many reported cases of data breaches among some of the largest corporations in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>In “<a href="https://forkast.news/why-decentralization-protect-user-data-privacy/">Why decentralization is essential for protecting user data and privacy</a>”, Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, detailed how decentralized solutions help address these vulnerabilities. Ontology’s mission is to return control of data and digital identities to the user. In this way, only the user can decide who can access his or her data. This promotes privacy and autonomy, which are severely lacking in the current Web 2.0&nbsp;era.</p> Identity <p>Ontology’s solution to the Web 2.0 identity problem is <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">ONT ID</a> and <a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a>. ONT ID is Ontology’s decentralized identity framework that enables users to control their data and decide whether a third-party can access a particular piece of information about them. It protects user privacy and ensures data security, enabling trusted collaboration. OScore is Ontology’s decentralized credit score. By participating in the decentralized ecosystem, OScore users can develop a decentralized reputation and reap rewards based on their activity.</p> Data <p><a href="https://protocol.sagamarket.io/">SAGA</a> is Ontology’s decentralized data market. SAGA provides enterprises and individual users with a credible, standardized and cost-effective data transaction platform. In the SAGA ecosystem, users (individuals or companies) use ONT ID to verify data and associate the data stream with its owner. This ensures the data owner’s rights are protected.</p> Digital Assets <p>Ontology uses pure technical means to provide trust guarantees between unfamiliar users, combines the decentralized credit system with traditional finance, creates a credit-based cross-chain decentralized asset management platform, and realizes Web 3.0 peer-to-peer transactions and disintermediation.</p><p>In addition to being supported on the Ontology platform, the above products can also be adopted by traditional industries and centralized internet platforms. Ontology hopes to promote the transition to Web 3.0 through the widespread adoption of decentralized products.</p> Summary <p>Although there are different opinions on the definition of Web 3.0, Ontology is primarily concerned with overcoming the problems inherent to Web 2.0. By taking advantage of blockchain technology, Ontology, among other decentralized technologies, can awaken the internet’s true potential with Web&nbsp;3.0.</p> Follow Us <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology Website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO Website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/4SrrJy2zHe">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/can-web-3-0-awaken-the-internets-true-potential-part-3-f1722638c32d">Can Web 3.0 Awaken the Internet’s True Potential?

 UPDATE: 1 September — KILT’s crowdloan is&nbsp;closed.  We hit our max cap of 220,000 KSM very quickly on 1 September at 3pm CEST, and further voting for KILT is not possible. <p>We were thrilled to see the early excitement from our community, with more than 12k contributions voting for KILT since 27 August, when we launched the voting with the below announcement.</p><p>KILT aims to secure slot #6. The auction continues through Wednesday 8 September at 11:00 GMT which includes the candle&nbsp;phase.</p><p>Earlier post is&nbsp;below.</p><p>If you’ve got your KSM ready, head over there now and vote for&nbsp;KILT!</p><p>To vote in KILT’s auction&nbsp;bid:</p>  KSM holders can lock their KSM for KILT via the <a href="https://fearlesswallet.io/">Fearless wallet</a> or <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/parachains/crowdloan">Polkadot.js</a> — see instructions below.  If you want to support us and your KSM is currently being used for staking, unstake&nbsp;now.  If you don’t own KSM and want to participate, you need to purchase KSM and start voting for KILT&nbsp;then.  The minimum crowdloan contribution for KILT is 0.1&nbsp;KSM.  <p>Kusama crowdloans are run as candle auctions. For this reason, we encourage our community to enter their bids up to September 3rd at 9:00 GMT. Afterwards, you can continue to support KILT with additional bids until the auction ends on September 9 at 9:00&nbsp;GMT.</p> KILT’s crowdloan reserve <p>KILT is bidding for an 8-period parachain slot; when secured this lease will last for 48 weeks total. Participating in a crowdloan means the KSM you lock is unavailable to you during the unlocking, bidding, and parachain lease&nbsp;period.</p><p>Transferring or staking KSM is not possible during this time. We’ve set aside a crowdloan reserve of 4.5 million KILT Coins in order to say “thank you” for your support. This reserve is set aside for distribution by the KILT governance when KILT is decentralised. BOTLabs, the entity behind KILT Protocol, will vote in the parachain auction process but is excluded from this&nbsp;reserve.</p> KSM&nbsp;:&nbsp;KILT <p>The maximum cap for KILT’s crowdloan is 220,000 KSM; when 220,000 KSM is received no further bids will be accepted.</p><p>KILT’s crowdloan reserve is set aside for the governance to divide among the crowdloan supporters (excluding BOTLabs). This means that if governance follows our proposal and the maximum cap is achieved, you can get a minimum of 25 KILT Coins per 1 KSM that you bid in support of KILT’s parachain slot. If the maximum cap is not achieved, you would receive even more. Everyone who voted for the successful KILT bid would receive these coins regardless of when their KSM was&nbsp;placed.</p><p>When the parachain slot expires, or in the event that KILT is not successful in obtaining a slot within the 6–10 auction period, the Kusama crowloan module automatically returns your KSM to your wallet within 8&nbsp;weeks.</p> Step-by-step guide <p>First, you need to buy KSM or use the unlocked KSM you already have. Then decide if you want to participate via Polkadot.js or the Fearless&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Instructions for both are&nbsp;below.</p> Polkadot.js: If you have a KSM&nbsp;account <p>If you have available KSM on Polkadot.js, go to the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/parachains/crowdloan">crowdloans</a> page on Polkadot.js and click “Contribute” in the column on the right next to KILT Spiritnet.</p><p>This will open up a pop-up&nbsp;window.</p>  Select the account you wish to contribute from.  Select the amount of KSM you wish to contribute.  Click “Contribute” (bottom&nbsp;right).  <p>You will then be asked to sign and submit this transaction.</p><p>Congratulations — you’ve now successfully voted for the KILT parachain slot!</p> Polkadot JS: If you don’t have a KSM account&nbsp;yet <p>If you don’t already have a KSM account on Polkadot.js, set one up by following the steps <a href="https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000098878-how-to-create-a-dot-account">outlined here</a> and watch the how-to video. (Ignore the “DOT” header — the process is the same for DOT and&nbsp;KSM).</p><p>When you go to <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer">https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer</a> to begin the process, make sure you switch to the Kusama network before you follow the instructions.</p><p>You can do this by clicking on the network on the top left (see&nbsp;arrow).</p><p>This opens up the network options. Click “Kusama &amp; Parachains”.</p><p>This opens up the Kusama network options. <a href="https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000169778-how-to-switch-network-nodes">Select a network</a> and click “Switch”.</p><p>When the Kusama network loads, click “Network” in the top bar, and “Parachains” in the dropdown.</p><p>Click on the “Crowdloan” tab.</p><p>This opens the list of active crowdloans. Then follow the instructions at the top of this section for contributing to the KILT crowdloan.</p><p>That’s it!</p> Fearless Wallet <p>Set up an account with Fearless Wallet; download links are on their website <a href="https://fearlesswallet.io/">here</a> and you can ask any questions on <a href="https://t.me/fearlesswallet">their Telegram here</a>. You can buy KSM directly via Fearless Wallet as part of the setup&nbsp;process.</p><p>When your account is securely set up, go to the “Crowdloans” tab at the bottom of the&nbsp;screen.</p><p>Select KILT from the list of ACTIVE crowdloans.</p><p>Add the amount of KSM you wish to bid. This view will indicate the network fee, estimated reward, and leasing period. You can also see the crowdloan info specific to KILT, such as the amount raised, time left and a link to the KILT crowdloan page.</p><p>Tap “Continue” to&nbsp;proceed.</p><p>Check that the amount you are adding to the KILT auction bid is&nbsp;correct.</p><p>Tap “Confirm”.</p><p>It’s that simple to add your KSM to the KILT auction bid via the Fearless&nbsp;Wallet.</p> Helpful resources from Kusama and&nbsp;Polkadot <p>If you haven’t participated in a Kusama parachain auction before, it’s very important to DYOR (do your own research!) to become more familiar with the process. We strongly recommend taking a look at these Kusama and Polkadot resources:</p>  Kusama: <a href="https://kusama.network/auctions/">Parachain Auctions overview</a> and video <a href="https://youtu.be/YrTxDufrcQM">How to Participate in Crowdloans on&nbsp;Kusama</a>  Polkadot: <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/mirror-learn-crowdloans">Crowdloans Wiki</a>  Polkadot Decoded: General overview “<a href="https://youtu.be/sxju74QqYuA">Auctions, Crowdloans, and Parachains, Oh&nbsp;My</a>!”  <p>All our crowdloan information is available on the “<a href="https://www.kilt.io/crowdloan/">Crowdloan</a>” section of KILT’s website.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The idea of low-code/no-code (LC/NC) application development seems to be extremely popular nowadays, to the point of it almost becoming a marketing buzzword similar, say, to “Zero Trust”. For decades, creating “proper” application software was a complex and tedious process that required qualified professional developers to produce even the smallest app. Organizations only had two choices: either purchase an existing off-the-shelf product from a software vendor or commission an internal or external development team to design, code, test, and deploy a custom application. Well, that or write an Excel macro…</p>
<p>LC/NC strives to change this dichotomy by offering a third choice: let business people build their own custom apps just by using a graphical design tool, choosing from a library of existing building blocks, or maybe even let artificial intelligence do the heavy lifting. The users, or “citizen developers” as they are now called, would only need to provide their domain knowledge, with no coding skills required.</p>
<p>In theory, the idea is great: every accountant, doctor, business analyst, or HR employee should be able to solve their small daily problems of finding the right information, doing a small calculation, or automating a back-office task without the need to involve software developers. There are so many potential use cases for LC/NC solutions and so many opportunities for software vendors to attract new customers with their citizen development offerings!</p>
 Do not trust the label! 
<p>Unfortunately, the market for these solutions is still in the very early stages of maturity – the diversity of products being sold under the “low-code/no-code” label is astounding. Anything ranging from sophisticated integrated development environments and robotic process automation platforms to glorified scripting tools and even chatbots – anything passes for LC/NC nowadays. This makes finding the right tool for a specific use case very difficult and, of course, only further increases the danger of Shadow IT – having an uncontrolled zoo of low-code tools in an organization is just as dangerous as letting your employees use unsanctioned cloud services.</p>
<p>However, the security and compliance implications of current-generation low-code platforms are much larger than that. First of all, “proper” software developers do not just write code. They are responsible for the full life cycle of their applications, from early design to implementation, operations, monitoring, fixing bugs and vulnerabilities, and, last but not least, protecting apps from attacks and preventing security breaches.</p>
<p>Low-code platforms must be able to implement all these capabilities, but even better than traditional software platforms because the customer simply does not have a team of citizen DevOps engineers and citizen security analysts. Even the largest enterprises that do have such teams at hand usually don’t plan to involve them in their citizen developer projects. After all, the biggest selling point of such projects is that business people can use them directly, without relying on their colleagues from IT.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most solutions currently available on the market seemingly do not focus too much on these challenges, as some of the recently discovered problems indicate. Just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/power-apps">multiple data leaks</a> were reported in Microsoft Power Apps – a popular suite of apps, services, and connectors, as well as a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment for custom business apps.</p>

<p>Although the platform provides a number of tools to enable user authentication, configure access permissions for tables that hold data, and so on, these controls were not enabled by default, leaving many apps created by customers completely exposed to anonymous access via the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/odata/">Open Data Protocol</a> API. Since all customer apps are hosted on subdomains of the same domain and the API endpoint address is fixed, the security researchers were able to quickly discover hundreds of affected companies and over a thousand lists with sensitive data such as passenger contact information, healthcare records, and even Microsoft’s own internal business data.</p>
<p>This particular data breach was quickly contained but who knows how many others are waiting to be discovered? Similar past problems with the likes of Amazon S3 or MongoDB clearly show that if a database or service allows making sensitive data public, it will eventually happen again and again, most commonly through negligence and misconfiguration, but sometimes by the hand of a malicious insider.</p>
<p>And if this can happen to a seasoned IT expert, how can we expect every citizen developer to be able to secure their data properly? Potential privacy implications of letting non-technical (and non-legal) people decide which data should be put into a no-code platform and who should have access to it might be massive, too. After all, citizen developers are just as likely not to understand international privacy regulations like GDPR as they are to have no clue about security principles.</p>
<p>Also, let’s not forget that one of the most popular usage scenarios for a low-code platform is combining and analyzing data from multiple external sources – for visualization, reporting, or automation, for example. If a custom app can be easily breached through such a trivial vulnerability in the underlying LC/NC platform, it will essentially turn into a massive security hole, potentially letting hackers pivot to and breach multiple other IT systems.</p>
 Choosing the right low-code/no-code solution 
<p>What should customers do to avoid such problems? Even before they decide to adopt the citizen development methodology, they have to carefully incorporate the idea into their existing security and compliance policies. They have to consider all the potential challenges and carefully evaluate the risks of “shadow citizen development” as well.</p>
<p>When choosing the best LC/NC solution, one should understand that the market is nowhere near maturity yet, and available capabilities can vary dramatically. There will probably never be a single product that can address all potential use cases, but again – business people alone should not be allowed to decide which tools (and to what extent) to use just based on their needs. All such tools must be carefully vetted by security and privacy experts, and proper constraints and policies must be established for their usage. Needless to say, access to any sensitive systems and data sources through a low-code platform must be controlled, secured, and generally treated as untrusted.</p>
<p>If an LC/NC platform comes with its own data platform, it must be secured to a higher standard than other enterprise databases, not a lower one. All the security and compliance controls for a database used by citizen developers must work at least as efficiently as for other sensitive data sources, but in addition, they must be fully transparent, not user-serviceable, and always on.</p>
<p>And, of course, creating an app in a modern low-code/no-code environment should be at least somewhat more convenient than writing an Excel macro. Otherwise, nobody will bother to use it.</p>

 Filling the information gap. <a href="http://eepurl.com/hGNtSH">Subscribe to the newsletter</a>. This is for you who doesn’t want to read through all the messages on Discord everyday (where all the latest project information can be found.) For you who can’t be bothered with following social media. For you who just generally wants to have a life and still get the occasional updates on Verus and its ecosystem. And everyone else is welcome&nbsp;too. <p>Next to publishing the monthly recap on Medium, I will send the exact same content through a newsletter. <a href="http://eepurl.com/hGNtSH">Subscribe here</a>. I’ll try to keep things short and to the point. So let’s get started with the very first monthly&nbsp;recap.</p> August 2021  Preparing Testnet for Ethereum&nbsp;Bridge <p>The multi-chain testnet has been reset. This in preperation for the bridge to the Rinkeby testnet. It has been said we are very close to this game-changing release.</p> Wallet Updates <p>Highly recommended non-mandatory Verus Desktop and CLI wallet updates have been made available. (Critical for notaries and pools). <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Download v0.7.4&nbsp;here</a></p> Conversations with Mike &amp;&nbsp;Bluesky <p><a href="https://blueskyweb.org/">Bluesky</a> is an initiative from Twitter to create a decentralized social media platform. Verus lead developer Mike Toutonghi had some very interesting posts in their Discord channel explaining the benefits that Verus and VerusID can bring to their project. Everyone in their Discord is still shell-shocked from the bombs that Mike dropped on them. <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505987175062437888/879966215857127454/unknown.png">Read a part of the messages here</a>. Verus has been selected to start a workgroup to integrate with <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a>. The future will tell if it is something worthwhile. One big positive is that more people, and especially developers, will learn about Verus. You can read all the messages back in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/YmrHBhCuFa">Bluesky Discord</a>, and please keep the shilling to yourself. We want to foster professional and productive environments.</p> Giant Website&nbsp;Overhaul <p>We are close to finishing a giant website overhaul. Better, more concise messaging. Easier to understand copywriting. More illustrations. Clearer design. All-in-all easier to digest for all people. I personally can’t wait for it to be online. I believe it to be a great improvement that will definitely get more people more interested in&nbsp;Verus.</p> Mobile Wallet Developments <p>Interesting progress on the mobile development front. Verus Mobile will be able to function as an encrypted local repository for your personal data, creating a central place for you to securely store information about yourself (that only you control.) This data allows you to integrate your wallet with in-app service providers that extend application functionality. Initially, this is how fiat on/off ramp services (<a href="https://www.sendwyre.com/">Wyre</a>) will be connected to the wallet. Later on, VerusID integration gives users the power to prove information about themselves in a decentralized, self-sovereign way. Exciting&nbsp;stuff!</p> New Docs&nbsp;Website <p>In addition to the new website we are working on a documentation website. In here you can find information if you want to take a deeper dive into Verus blockchain technology. It will be online the same time as the new website. Although this one is still a work-in-progress and needs to be updated constantly.</p> Community-Made Videos <p>Community member tango808 made an awesome video showing current and near future capabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwjfB184qfg">Check it out on YouTube</a>. He made even way more and you can find <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18GDpFFP1BngAPXOjvlyVhP_d4DrexZH5">them here</a>. Please share them around if you&nbsp;want!</p> Ecosystem Project&nbsp;Valu <p>Community member Consilience from <a href="https://www.valu.earth/">Valu</a> low-key confirmed that they will launch their project soon after PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) has been brought to mainnet. One of those things are fiat gateways for Verus. It will be a giant boost for the ecosystem I’m&nbsp;sure.</p> Fun Fact <p>At the time of writing the active amount of $VRSC staking is over 33M. Not bad. Still room for improvement. So get staking! Or not (more for&nbsp;me.)</p><p>Thanks for reading. That’s it from me. Until next&nbsp;month!</p> Please <a href="http://eepurl.com/hGNtSH">subscribe to the monthly recap</a> so you’ll get it each month in your&nbsp;mailbox.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/august-2021-verus-monthly-recap-4241c7c80b8a">August 2021— Verus Monthly Recap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Shyft Network and Kylin Network take steps towards building compliant DeFi infrastructure for Financial Institutions. <p>Bridgetown, Barbados — We are delighted to announce our partnership with <a href="https://kylin.network/">Kylin Network</a>, the cross-chain data infrastructure powered by Polkadot, to collaborate and build cross-chain data infrastructure for Decentralized Finance&nbsp;(DeFi).</p><p><a href="https://shyft.network/compliant-defi">Shyft Network’s</a> opt-in compliance infrastructure, such as whitelisted addresses and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) and GDPR compliant systems, will be further strengthened by Kylin Network’s data infrastructure and oracle&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Kylin Network commits to provide required datasets to Shyft Network, allowing it to build a “compliant DeFi” framework, which would allow institutional funds and financial institutions from capital markets to deploy funds into the DeFi ecosystem in a secure and compliant manner.</p><p>Some key parameters of the partnership:</p>  Kylin Network will afford the opportunity to placehold a validator node for Shyft Network. The first validators are vetted by the Kylin Network such that the health of the network in the crucial early days of the ecosystem is robust. We expect heavy demand to be a validator node, and only select partners will be invited to take&nbsp;part.  Kylin will also work with Shyft Network as a parachain to call each other’s functions via XCMP pallet-calling. XCMP pallet-calling is a revolutionary way to call the functions of another parachain or parathread on Polkadot. Kylin has innovated this feature and will work closely with Shyft Network to identify cool ways to implement it in&nbsp;synergy.  With data feeding provided by Shyft Network, and then filtered through Kylin Network’s consensus and arbitration mechanisms, an augmented robustness of data accuracy and trustability becomes possible. Basically, we can add another layer of trust and validation to whatever data that Shyft Network provides.  In turn, Shyft network will expose Kylin Network to its burgeoning community and innovations in the field of compliance-managed data solutions.  <blockquote>Dylan Dewdney, Chief Stratosphere Officer of Kylin Network said, “The coming renaissance in DeData-enabled Web 3 solutions will naturally include emergent data validation layers. Kylin Network and Shyft Network will work in concert and synergy to find ways to validate and render the many nascent use cases of validated web 3 data journeys into incentivized frameworks that undergird more accurate and trustworthy results”</blockquote><p>Shyft Network recently announced the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-based-shyft-network-launches-aims-for-fatf-compliant-defi">launch of its mainnet</a> and, shortly thereafter, the coordinated <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf">deployment of Veriscope</a>, the decentralized solution to the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule. This signals the first steps in the development of a global, decentralized, and opt-in compliance infrastructure.</p><blockquote>Juan Aja Aguinaco, Co-Founder of Shyft Network said “Shyft’s strength comes from its network of partners and participants; as a data validation layer, Shyft Network’s integration with Kylin Network helps build a stronger, more reliable and functional oracle infrastructure. By leveraging Kylin’s consensus and arbitration mechanisms, we get closer to reaching our goal to enable institutional funds from capital markets and financial institutions to participate in compliant DeFi and create a new era for&nbsp;crypto.”</blockquote> About Kylin&nbsp;Network <p>Kylin Network aims to build a cross-chain platform powering the data economy on Polkadot. It will be the data infrastructure for the future DeFi and Web 3.0 powered by Polkadot. Kylin Network hopes to provide valid, reliable, secure, cost-effective, and easily coordinated data sources and data analytics.</p> Contact Kylin&nbsp;Network <blockquote>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/KylinOfficial">https://t.me/KylinOfficial</a></blockquote><blockquote>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Kylin_Network">https://twitter.com/Kylin_Network</a></blockquote><blockquote>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/PwYCssr">https://discord.gg/PwYCssr</a></blockquote><blockquote>Medium: <a href="https://medium.com/kylin-network">https://medium.com/kylin-network</a></blockquote><blockquote>Linkedin: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kylinnetwork">https://www.linkedin.com/company/kylinnetwork</a></blockquote><blockquote>Official website: <a href="https://kylin.network/">https://kylin.network/</a></blockquote> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network is a public protocol designed to aggregate and embed trust, validation, and discoverability into data stored on public and private ecosystems, and facilitate information transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks.

Chris Owen,  Director of Product Management at Savyint is to deliver a presentation on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4614/1" title="Worlds Collide: The Importance of Convergence in IAM"> Worlds Collide: The Importance of Convergence in IAM </a>on Tuesday, September 14 starting at 8:30 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Chris some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When worlds collide is an interesting subject. What does it actually mean and what is colliding?  </p>
<p>
Worlds colliding is essentially looking at the different markets that exist within the identity space. So in particular, if we take privileged access management (PAM) and identity governance and administration (IGA), they've typically existed within silos. So PAM tools were originally designed for on-premise infrastructure, for managing access into a data center and critical assets. IGA tools have really focused on provisioning identity life cycle management. What we're starting to see now is these worlds really coming together. And a lot of that is driven by cloud adoption because now everything has an identity.<br><br>And as people adopt more cloud, privileged controls are really having to change, it's no longer just about access to servers and where the critical data is. It's access to interfaces, consoles, and at the same time everything has an identity. What's becoming important is the fact that you need to govern these identities, have visibilities of where they are, and bring further context into the management of these identities. The concept of worlds colliding is really these two types of technology really becoming closely aligned together, and what we call convergence, where essentially they are becoming the same platform.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Is this specific to IGA and PAM or do you see this happening in other areas?  </p>
<p>
This is definitely something that's happening in other areas. So if we look at the identity market as a whole, we're starting to see a lot of consolidation taking place. A lot of vendors are starting to now combine technologies, not just IGA and PAM, you're starting to see PAM and IDaaS type solutions. You have typical IDaaS vendors, such as Okta that are making moves into the IGA and PAM space as well. So there's a lot of adjacent things happening. There's also other areas within security in the identity space. So new acronyms around cloud infrastructure, entitlements management, cloud security, posture management, kind of coming together and that may get consumed by Pam IGA tools as well.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some customers have already made large investments in identity solutions, why would they move to a converged solution?  </p>
<p>
There are really some key drivers to moving towards a converged solution. Some of those are cost savings, benefits, time, efficiency, and that type of thing, but certainly a lot of organizations have made investments. These may be on-prem, they may be more traditional siloed approaches. So there's definitely a good time to embrace these types of technologies. Digital transformation is a key driver to look at our technology stacks, to make sure it's meeting our requirements, to make sure that it's fit for purpose. And that's a good time to transition towards these type of new converged solutions as they are.    </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do you expect more changes in the future?  </p>
<p>
I think the technology landscape is constantly evolving. I think we will definitely see more. I think we'll see more consolidation within the industry. There'll be more acquisitions. There'll be more, I guess, new bleeding edge type of technologies that come into the fold as well. So cloud security posture management is definitely the big subject of the moment and infrastructure entitlements management. At the moment, that is very much a segregated market. And there's a lot of new vendors coming into that space. But I think we'll definitely see more consolidation take place there, and perhaps, more established markets such as secrets management, really being brought into that fold as well.  </p>

<p>How can we streamline and improve the techno-social protocols around commerce so we can better maintain equilibrium with our planet and ourselves?</p><p>This article is a companion piece to the first episode of The Future of Stuff podcast. Listen to Vinay unpack the idea of smart property in the debut episode&nbsp;🎙</p><p>Humanitarian engineer Buckminster Fuller once described an approach to building economic systems which he referred to as ephemeralization, defining it as our ability to “do more and more with less and less until eventually we can do everything with nothing.”</p><p>Now, such a thing seems impossible with the numerous technological and social constraints that come to mind, but the idea of “doing more with less” as a design principle — if followed responsibly — could eventually lead us to a future where atoms and bits dance in perfect synchrony, benefiting everyone at the expense of no&nbsp;one.</p><p>With that north star, we can start prototyping the systems of tomorrow with the tools of&nbsp;today.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s explore a potential techno-social medium for building this future: smart property.</p> What is Smart Property? <p>In the online age, people are used to summoning entities around the world to meet their everyday needs. A few taps on the scrying mirror of a smartphone can marshal human and autonomous agents to provide all manner of services. Transportation. Goods. Housing. Entertainment. Education. Nearly anything.</p><p>This ability to program value flows and social interactions around goods and services presents an incredibly powerful design space which we can refer to as smart property.</p><p>In practice, smart property is property that can be bought, sold, collateralized, and accessed via software APIs and search engines. While we already have this in a sense with housing (AirBnB), transportation (Uber), distribution (Amazon), and other areas, these systems are often controlled by centralized corporations operating under the illusory banner of “platform,” resulting in ongoing concerns around privacy, security, and labor practices.</p><p>At Mattereum, we believe smart property is an inevitable evolution of commerce, but how this system is implemented and the motivations behind it are paramount. Smart property can be how we achieve equilibrium with the planet and with each other, or it could be co-opted by the incumbent powers-that-be with results that can be read in dystopian science&nbsp;fiction.</p> Smart Property Can Fix Society’s Inventory Problem <p>The world is suffering from a severe misallocation of resources, especially on a long-term time horizon. At the core, this is a system design problem. Between planned obsolescence and trade globalization in the pursuit of corporate profit, the things we produce are not actually built to last and rely on an unimaginably complex, global infrastructure powered by distant (or not so distant) horrific labor practices and environmental costs.</p><p>The IPCW industrial cycle, designed by Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta and a team at the Rocky Mountain Institute, provides an almost mandala-like mapping of industry. As you can see, the four main areas are Investment (of different capital types), Production, Consumption, and&nbsp;Waste.</p><p>One way to explain this odd paradox of gluttony and scarcity in the world today is to map where in this cycle we have innovated over the last half century, and where we have&nbsp;not.</p><p>Investment and Production witnessed a transformative leap in operational efficiency and scale in the post-WWII era, yet similar progress has not been made in optimizing Consumption and managing&nbsp;Waste.</p><p>Tightening these feedback loops will require better policy, technology, and social awareness.</p><p>We don’t know what we don’t know about our stuff and figuring it out is critical to achieving sustainability and improving quality of life for&nbsp;all.</p><p>Smart property as a design framework can help us generate, access, and act upon the necessary product information to build secondhand markets of durable quality goods and facilitate truly efficient p2p commerce. Imagine a digital wallet interface akin to an MMORPG’s character inventory in which the assets are actual objects which can be owned in common, shared, leased, bought, or sold with a few taps on a&nbsp;screen.</p><p>This is possible.</p> Smart Property Streamlines Complexity in&nbsp;Commerce <p>It is important to emphasize that smart property is not about embedding sensor devices in everything under the sun (Internet of Things, smart cities) and more about designing the social protocols around goods and services enabled by a tight integration between law and software to streamline, structure, and secure the numerous interactions and transactions around a good or&nbsp;service.</p><p>Oddly enough, with smart property it is the space and social interaction around an object which is where the magic happens. The ‘ground’ is the key design space rather than the ‘figure’ of an&nbsp;object.</p><p>On the first episode of The Future of Stuff podcast by Mattereum, Vinay illustrated the potential of smart property in multiple examples, including one that would seem random at first glance, but is profound in its implications.</p> The Logistical Nightmare of Wedding&nbsp;Planning <p>If the idea of smart property is to automate and streamline transactions and interactions between various parties around a good or service, reducing complexity and costs to those involved, then wedding planning makes for a surprisingly fitting use&nbsp;case.</p><p>Venue. Catering. Travel. Entertainment. Fashion. So many moving pieces in constant motion. What if there were a system which allowed one to aggregate these pieces via software protocols, creating order in the chaos and vastly reducing mental and transaction costs?</p><p>As Vinay explains, someone in charge of planning the event could use a smart property system to “build a multi-path matrix of possible solutions,” securing various options leading up to the day of the event as a safeguard for any failure or setback in the&nbsp;chain.</p><blockquote>“It’s this ability to take processes where there are tons and tons of dependencies, turn the dependencies into option contracts, group the option contracts together until you have a solution, and then once you have a solution, execute all of the options. Bringing that kind of capability out of heavy engineering and finance into ordinary everyday people’s lives will be completely revolutionary.”</blockquote><p>Of course, the application of smart property in event planning is not limited to weddings. Think of all the events we attend throughout our lives which involve networks of contracted parties which do the work of creating these dynamic social experiences. Concerts. Reward ceremonies. Conferences. Imagine booking and planning these events as easy as using&nbsp;AirBnB.</p> Smart Property is a Critical Use Case of Blockchain <p>It is imperative that a smart property system be decentralized and operated on a peer-to-peer basis. There’s a real risk of smart property systems as envisioned by Mattereum being co-opted by the incumbent Big Tech companies and being absorbed into monopolies and oligopolies, resulting in economic centralization with severe consequences for society (price distortions, resource misallocation, etc).</p><p>We do not want a world in which everybody owns nothing and Big Tech companies lease the majority of material goods to the populace, under contractual agreements which favor them at the expense of the user at every turn. No recourse. No&nbsp;agency.</p><p>If antitrust legislation and governmental efforts to prevent monopolies or keep them in check fail (and such legislation tends to wax and wane across administrations), then people would be at the mercy of market forces (such mercy does not&nbsp;exist).</p><p>Building smart property systems with p2p protocols is critical to ensuring that the already terrible distribution of wealth and power is not made even worse for future generations.</p><p>Blockchains provide cryptographically secure and verifiable transaction networks for the seamless and borderless exchange of value. A global, programmable medium of value transfer open to all is a design space we are still trying to wrap our heads around. And it is currently the most compelling technological solution for smart property.</p><p>Traditional client-server databases are silos which lack the interoperability necessary for coordinating and streamlining complex business transactions across multiple contexts. Having a shared financial infrastructure instead of a patchwork of protocols that struggle to maintain consensus can vastly reduce complexity and cost of&nbsp;trade.</p><p>However, neither blockchain nor any other computer system for that matter can power smart property alone. There needs to be a way of “programming” the material world and the social agreements between&nbsp;people.</p><p>Bringing the programmable value of blockchain into the real world requires a tight integration between legal systems that enforce property rights and the software systems which facilitate commerce.</p><p>Enter Mattereum.</p> Prototyping Smart Property with the Mattereum Protocol <p>Mattereum is building the legal-transactional framework that secures trust in digital commerce. Bridging the programmable value of blockchain-based digital assets with the programmable agreements of contract law with the affordances of both presents a compelling design framework for smart property.</p><p>The Mattereum Protocol leverages an integrated legal and software system consisting of three main components: Mattereum Asset Passports, Real-World Asset NFTs, and Trust Communities. Here’s how the protocol works, in&nbsp;brief:</p><p>(For a more detailed guide of the protocol, we highly recommend referring to the <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/">Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>.)</p>  Asset Passports are a bundle of legal warranties tied to a particular object. Essential warranties include identification, confirmation of the presence and capabilities of verification technologies such as NFC tags, vault status, carbon offsets, anti-slavery certification, and tokenization. The heart of the Mattereum Protocol, Asset Passports are powerful, composable tools for securing property rights in virtual and physical&nbsp;space.  Real-World Asset NFTs are unique digital tokens that denote the right to take physical custody of a particular object. While sharing features with the NFTs now gaining popularity in the cultural mainstream in the creative industries, these tokens are different in that they are backed by an underlying physical asset, complete with warranties, insurance, and legal enforceability to create trust in trade. They are paired with objects via a warranty in the Asset Passport.  Trust Communities are the networks of expert certifiers that accrue around each object (artwork, memorabilia, precious metals) throughout its lifetime. All expert certification of an object is backed by a legal warranty as well as financial stake, adding weight to an expert’s assessment. Built upon the composable, legal-tech framework of the Asset Passport, Trust Communities restore value, increase liquidity, and bring peace of mind to digital commerce.  <p>So far, the Mattereum Protocol has tokenized a wide range of objects, ranging from <a href="https://opensea.io/NTFA">gold-backed NFTs</a>, to <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/third-millennia-collection-1">pop culture memorabilia</a>, to <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">historical/cultural artifacts</a>.</p><p>Currently, these assets and arrangements are only a simple display of smart property. An asset is secured in a vault and can be physically delivered to the NFT bearer upon burning the token, with all the necessary legal warranties attached to the property. A transferable, cryptographic voucher of&nbsp;sorts.</p><p>Mattereum is researching and developing tools and methodologies to build upon this groundwork, streamlining the passporting and tokenization process for a wider range of asset classes and exploring new opportunities in this exciting design&nbsp;space.</p><p>In the future, there will be smart legal templates which create a streamlined user experience around generating the Asset Passport and minting digital assets, automated custodians that reduce the risk and complexity around custody of physical goods (and even provide corporate legal status of certain objects to empower collective ownership, asset governance, amongst other possibilities), advanced search capabilities with robust metadata schemas of all goods and services on the protocol, and APIs that allow others to build and expand on these foundations.</p><p>The idea of smart property is to use technology to create a better relationship between ourselves and the planet. The digitization of commerce is a trend with no stopping point, so we might as well be good at it. Eventually, the technological and social systems which underlie trade will become so coordinated that we will move into an era of property rights so fluid and dynamic that it will be more akin to “streaming property” than owning property. How we build this system is crucial to preventing injustice and inequity in the world, and Mattereum is aiming to build the protocols to enable this future such that everyone can benefit at the expense of no&nbsp;one.</p><p>In the spirit of Buckminster Fuller, let’s build a future of “more with less” where everything simply works in stunning techno-social grace.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/introduction-to-smart-property-ecb446268f23">Introduction to Smart Property</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Ian Grigg is one of the most influential builders in the crypto space, having built digital asset systems since the nineties. We discuss his invention of the Ricardian contract framework, what makes cryptonetworks successful, identity as communal phenomenon, and the importance of building positive-sum systems.</p> EPISODE NOTES <p>In this episode, I had the pleasure of talking to financial cryptographer Ian Grigg (@iang_fc). Ian is an unsung hero in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space, having built crypto-based digital asset systems since the nineties using the Ricardian contract, a design framework for binding software with legal agreements that has been the foundation of many crypto projects over the years, including Mattereum. We discuss the invention of the Ricardian framework, its design philosophy, the importance of community in the formation of one’s identity and the success of entire cryptonetworks, as well as the critical need to shift our focus from building zero-sum games to crafting positive-sum systems that benefit everyone at the expense of no one. I learned a lot from Ian in this conversation, and I hope you find the insight as enriching as I&nbsp;did.</p><p>Track: “Optimist” by Zoe&nbsp;Keating</p><p>Links:</p>  <a href="https://iang.org/">https://iang.org/</a>  <a href="http://www.financialcryptography.com/">http://www.financialcryptography.com/</a>   Episode Outline   The Origins of the Ricardian Contract [00:01:20]  Ian on the Advent of Cryptocurrencies [00:09:27]  Blockchain is Just Another Tool [00:12:47]  Mattereum’s Building on the Ricardian Framework [00:14:46]  The Cost and Necessity of Building Governance [00:16:35]  The Chamapesa Project [00:20:53]  Identity Through Community [00:24:05]  Dissonance Between Identity Frameworks &amp; Societal Expectation [00:26:02]  Reputation &amp; Identity in Cryptosystems [00:28:19]  Zero-Sum vs Positive-Sum Games [00:33:10]  Ian on Encouraging Ricardian Contract Adoption by Devs [00:38:21]  On the Future of Smart Contracts [00:43:04]  Improving Asset Custody in Smart Property Systems [00:47:11]  <p>Welcome to the podcast&nbsp;Ian.</p><p>Ian: Good to be&nbsp;here.</p> The Origins of the Ricardian Contract [00:01:20] <p>Garrison: A lot of people who are kind of familiar with what Mattereum does and how it approaches building things may be familiar with the concept of the Ricardian contract as this kind of hybrid system for integrating contractual agreements with software that executes the agreement. That’s kind of foundational to what we do. It’s also been used in a lot of different projects and inspired a lot of amazing work across smart contracts and formation of entire digital organizations. Could you kind of describe how the Ricardian contract was formulated?</p><p>Ian: It all happened around about 95 to 97. What was happening there was that digital cash was a hot topic, a very hot topic. And it was kind of funny because when the Bitcoin thing started out and that became a hot topic, it was just an echo of the nineties to a lot of us who had already been there, done that and so forth, seeing what would&nbsp;happen.</p><p>While the digital cash people over in Amsterdam — that’s DigiCash, David Chaum’s company — were doing digital cash, I was sitting in finance classes and learning about zero coupon bonds and a zero coupon bond is basically like a dollar note, if you like, or a pound note or something like that. And listening to all this, I realized that actually, if you’re trying to do digital cash and digital cash is a dollar or a pound or a Euro or whatever it was, and a zero coupon bond is the same thing. The zero coupon bond is actually the atomic element of finance in terms of mathematical modeling.</p><p>From that you can build up everything else practically speaking. You can build up derivatives as constructions of zero coupon bonds. And it occurred to me that, well, if we can do digital cash, we can do everything in finance. This light bulb moment got me thinking. And I started out with a mate and I moved to Amsterdam and we started working on digital cash and digital assets. The ones we chose were bonds and to cut a long story short, the thing about bonds, I did a lot of research into this. It took me six months to figure this all out. Bonds are legal contracts. If we could do a legal contract in a digital form, then we could do bonds. And then a bit later on it transpired that bonds themselves are just the simplest form of financial instrument. And most other things are based on the contractual mechanism.</p><p>Most of them. I mean shares are based on government say-so, but even then shares could be based on contracts. So we could do everything if we could do contracts. And I went through a long process of trying to work out how to do contracts. I got stuck on the normal computer science notion: oh gosh, a contract is a bunch of data so we shove it in the database and we get stuck into normalized forms and all this sort of stuff. Which is normally good&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>And the world often reduces to that in computer science terms which is why so many databases are built out there in the world. But the contract just didn’t work. I discovered that bonds, for example they were lots of lots of words which had very strange meaning, especially to a computer scientist. The bonds didn’t have standard words. And every time somebody came out with a new bond, they changed the wording. And it was often just a little bit. So you wondered whether they were responding to new events. There’d been some new crisis or whether it was just the lawyers deciding that they needed to generate fees or something. But either way, didn’t really matter to us. The bonds kept changing, so databases just didn’t&nbsp;work.</p><p>And at that point I had this second light bulb moment. If you like, when I said, “Okay why don’t we flip the problem upside down, give the lawyers what they want, give them a text document. It will make the computer science side work harder than try and pander to the computer programmers. We’ll pander to the&nbsp;lawyers.</p><p>So we constructed, or I constructed a simple text document, which included the text of the contract. And instead of it being, shall we say, all the words that the legal people wanted to wrote, write, and nothing more. It included some parameters in there. And these parameters were very simple line based things, which said something like name equals 2009 bond from the Pacific railway. And the denomination could be in dollars and so forth. Simple tag equals value. And what that meant was that the program could dive into the document with a very simple parser. We’re talking about a line based thing which can be knocked up by any decent programmer. Read down, grab out the tags. And then with that document, the software could then display it to the user. So the software didn’t need to be didn’t need to know what the contract was beforehand. It got all the information it needed out of the contract, such as the denomination, such as the decimalization, the symbol to display. And then when it came to showing the user what was going on, it could simply use those tags without necessarily understanding them.</p><p>Which if you think about it, that’s what you want. If you’re going to be handling many, many bonds, you don’t want to know what the bonds are in advance. You don’t want to modify the software for every bond or every asset or every Bitcoin or every Ethereum or whatever. You want a standardized document that tells you what it&nbsp;is.</p><p>So out of that process, we added rooting to find out where the actual asset was, was managed. And we added digital signatures, such that the issuer would make this claim as a contract. And that was the&nbsp;method.</p><p>The funny thing is we didn’t realize that what I’d come up with was much of an invention, but we found every time we were talking about it we were saying, well the way you issued a bond is you write a contract and it’s the contract form that’s inside Ricardo, the name of our digital cash system. And that got shortened to the Ricardian contract. Hence the name. So eventually after our gosh six or seven years of having these conversations, I realized I had to basically publish a paper on it and did that. So from then of course everybody could just refer to the paper. So that’s the foundation of&nbsp;it.</p><p>But it’s quite interesting because we did discover it was very broad. We could do every sort of financial asset with the Ricardian contract. And not only that other people came along and did other things with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Chris Odom turned it into configuration files. The configuration of his software was a set of Ricardian contracts.</p><p>And the OpenBazaar people turned it into a trading cycle in that their invoices, for example, would be a Ricardian contract. And that would refer back to a previous author to enter into a contract. And then the receipt, for example, would be pointing back to the invoice and the payment would be pointing back to the receipt. So they had these chains of things where they’re basically pointing at each other. And that was very interesting because it created this cycle where everything was available and everything was documented in cryptographic security which allowed a lot of software to work pretty much perfectly. And it removed the problems that are caused by insufficient information. So yeah, it was interesting.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, it’s a really interesting kind of design space. Paper you wrote “The Intersection of Ricardian and Smart Contracts,” you have this kind of X and Y axis of where the Y axis I believe was like semantic richness. So it’s more leaning into the, natural language kind of agreement. What we traditionally think of as a contract document. And then on the X axis you have operational richness, which is basically what’s actually executable by code. And I think that’s a great kind of mapping of how to map things that are working in this kind of legal&nbsp;tech.</p><p>Ian: Yeah.</p><p>Garrison: And it can vary from asset to asset from use case to use case. There’s so many possibilities there.</p> Ian on the Advent of Cryptocurrencies [00:09:27] <p>Garrison: So when Bitcoin and smart contract platforms like Ethereum emerged. With Bitcoin, we had I guess you could say like the first digital cash system that kind of persevered or kind of survived and kept going and withstood regulatory friction and a lot of forces of nature kind of working against it. Then we had Ethereum that emerged six years later, or, handful of years later, and it kind of delivered on this, on this promise of the smart contract, which Nick Sabo proposed in like&nbsp;1994.</p><p>So when these cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms emerged, what was your initial response to them in relation to this digital cash system that you had actually&nbsp;created.</p><p>Ian: Mm. Yeah. Well, I was in the cryptography group when Satoshi published and discussed and eventually published his&nbsp;paper.</p><p>And I read the paper at the time. I didn’t like it. The key thing was, it was a very clever invention obviously and I realized that at the time, but this notion of having a competition for consensus meant immediately to me, people are going to be burning energy on this thing. And that seemed to me to be an unsustainable expense. But actually the author was clearly a lot cleverer than I was and had managed to constrain it, such that it didn’t completely get out of control. It was a stability involved based on the price which we didn’t really see it until prices actually started to move from zero upwards. But then, there was a stability in the system based on the number of people who were trading these things which was very clever. And obviously a massive breakthrough.</p><p>What was the big issue there was because considering that I had come from the client server world, we had all been thinking that client server was the only way to do it. But what we had entirely missed was that the server was always a weakness. And we had been somewhat blinded by our, if you like, our bias towards client server. So whenever one of these systems failed, we hadn’t treated it as a server failure. So for example, I was involved in the e-gold community. built a thing called Digigold. You could consider it to be e-gold version two or something like&nbsp;that.</p><p>Which we got up and going, but it got into trouble through the actions of the people involved. I mean, to put it short in short terms, I and Douglas Jackson, the e-gold founder, got into court battles and so forth and so on. And, because I was the guy who was running Digigold and he was the guy running e-gold, these things didn’t survive because the founders behind these systems got into distracting arguments.</p><p>And it wasn’t clear that the problem there was the architectural problem was that there was a founder, there was an owner, there was a contractor party, there was somebody managing the servers. The inspiration of this, of Satoshi, was — yeah, that’s the problem. The people behind the servers or the people behind the center are the problem, not the solution. So let’s figure out a way to remove that. And that was the big that the huge breakthrough that changed everything.</p> Blockchain is Just Another Tool [00:12:47] <p>Garrison: And was there kind of a moment where there was like Bitcoin or Ethereum that you thought that: finally there’s like the infrastructure that we needed to do the things that you had envisioned or was it just another tool that kind of just&nbsp;emerged?</p><p>Ian: No. I think it’s just another tool that it merged. Obviously did a lot better than what we had done. There was a moment where I decided that actually this thing had passed the test of time and was here to stay. And that was when a fund in America paid me to go and be their dark horse. They’re anti-Bitcoiner. Through that process where I sat in front of 20 or 30 potential investors into their fund and I argued against Bitcoin and so forth. And when I saw what was happening there, I thought, okay, this is interesting. Regardless of what I think technically, we’re now at the point where enough people will believe in this thing such that it will sustain and it’s clearly sustained itself in the past. So, well, I kind of flipped at that and realized, well, this thing here is here to&nbsp;stay.</p><p>Not that I’ve ever got over my, if you like, my distaste of the proof of work consensus, load cost, and so forth. So I actually, I was very happy to join the Block One crowd and work on DPoS, delegated proof of stake, because that is a system that gets rid of the expensive proof of work mechanism. Albeit it brings in its own problems. So if you like the proof of work thing gives you open access and open entry, and therefore it is in a theory, it’s a fair mechanism, whereas delegated proof of stake encourages the problem of cartelization amongst the block producers. Which eventually causes problems unless you’re very careful to keep that down. There’s swings and roundabouts, there’s pluses and minuses with all these systems. So you have to be very careful about what it is you’re trying to do before you choose one of these mechanisms.</p> Mattereum’s Building on the Ricardian Framework [00:14:46] <p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely. So to kind of bring it back to Mattereum, it would be fun to kind of explore initial conversations you had with Vinay when he was like conceptualizing Mattereum and thinking about it. Could you unpack what was part of those conversations? Those initial conversations.</p><p>Ian: To be frank we didn’t have that many conversations on it. Vinay has always been very, very solid about saying that basically he’s just building on the Ricardian contract and the governance techniques that I did in the nineties. There’s a thing called five parties model, which I put together in the nineties. It wasn’t so much an invention as take classical governance techniques and lay them out and just slot them into the digital world. This is what we did at e-gold and Gold Money and the various other players. And it’s what they should be doing with the stablecoin issues for example, and also ICOs and so forth, but they haven’t learned this&nbsp;yet.</p><p>These things were all available to Vinay and I think, yeah, he mostly did his own study on it. He really came back to me and said, what about this? What about that job? He just seemed to drink it up. So it’s unusual to find somebody who can actually drink this stuff up just by reading the documentation.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. I remember like when, he was telling me the kind of origin story, if you will. How he was basically like screaming into the void at the rest of the people in crypto. That we have to get the legals right in order to actually properly integrate the system with the real world. If you want this world changing potential of blockchain, you have to be able to connect these two realms in an effective way. And most people would just completely ignored him. So then eventually he founded a company that was aiming to do just&nbsp;that.</p> The Cost and Necessity of Building Governance [00:16:35] <p>Ian: Yeah. And it’s interesting because I faced the same dilemma. We issued gold in around about 2000, the Digigold thing. And we issued physical gold in 2002 thereabouts. We had a kilogram bar, which was our reserves. The custodian was designated as a person. The mint was designated as a person. Todd Boyle, the accountant, was in fact part of that circle of governance. And we got the whole thing completely right, and issued it and so forth. But it was interesting because some people appreciated that but the vast majority of people didn’t really appreciate what we done. It was a if most people would look to other people for validation. And therefore you had this wide open space for scams. All you had to do is generate the sense of validation in some sense, And everybody would pile in because somebody had validated it to them and they’d been validated by somebody else. And it eventually becomes a circle. But to do it properly is actually a bit of work. It took us a month to set up the governance, just the governance of the gold bar, for example, in terms of agreements and contracts and understanding, getting everybody on board for the parts that they&nbsp;play.</p><p>It’s quite easy to fall into the trap of saying, “Yeah, let’s ignore all that stuff, throw it out there and see what happens.” And of course, people start throwing you money. And what, somebody once said to me, or somebody frequently said when there was, if you like, opposition to his ideas, he kept saying, “People keep sending me money and therefore I know what I’m doing.” And he was right until he wasn’t right. And it all came crashing down and that’s where you need those better mechanisms. So if you’re in it for the long run, yeah, you need to do all this&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>And actually that’s a really good way of figuring out whether something is a fraud or not, or something is going to be undermined and fail. Or not, it doesn’t necessarily have to be a fraud. Do they do the governance? And the governance is fairly simple. It’s all standard. It’s all documented. You just follow these steps. Did they do it, or did they not? But nobody seems to want to get into that because it’s not sexy. It’s not tech. It’s&nbsp;not</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. It’s very&nbsp;human.</p><p>Ian: Yes. It’s not this magical consensus thing. This proof of work and NEMIS keys and all that sort of&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>Garrison: One of the projects that Mattereum is working on currently is launching gold-backed NFTs. Which is kind of like just the recent iteration of the kind of gold digitization that e-gold did and Digigold and. It is true. It’s a lot of work to deal with all the humans or wet code that’s kind of necessarily involved to do the right governance. And when you’re, when you’re dealing with physical objects and stuff like that. If we can do that process well enough and perhaps streamline it over time, it opens many use cases in terms of like what kind of assets can be created or managed. Or opening access to certain&nbsp;assets.</p><p>If we can get the governance right around digital assets or digital assets that are tethered to physical objects, then it would open up a lot of doors for us. Like just as a society in terms of managing commerce and production and consumption. But you know there’s a lot of tough work that you have to do in order to kind of get to that&nbsp;future.</p><p>There’s a lot of things that you’ve worked on that I’ve been very fascinated about. Whether it’s governance. Governance of entire blockchain networks, like with the design of EOS, for example, or integrating crypto with like existing social structures, which I find really fascinating with like Chamapesa. You’ve explored a lot of the different kind of use cases of these technologies, drawing upon like the foundational work and thinking that you did around the Ricardian contract. Like what, what excites you these days? What actually stands out to&nbsp;you?</p> The Chamapesa Project [00:20:53] <p>Ian: The work I do these days is still the old Chamapesa project. It’s working slowly because I’m having to code it up myself. I guess I should say a little bit about that. The notion that you can come together as small groups and you can decide to commit as a group to do savings together is something that can be done completely disconnected from the financial system. So you’ve actually created, if you like, your own answer to financial inclusion because what you’ve done is you’ve excluded the financial system from yourselves. The financial system was already excluding you from their participation. So you have to start&nbsp;again.</p><p>But it only works not as individual system and not as a large community, but as a small group. It only works because what you can do is you can choose the members of the group to start from a very high trust level, even in a totally corrupt environment. Enough people very close by and you can select from them who is trustworthy and bring those together as a very small, tight, trustworthy group.</p><p>And on top of that, you can do all sorts of things because we’re trying to do savings in these groups. That means we’re handling each other’s money and therefore we’re very dependent on each other. And once we get that level of trust, it’s possible to do a lot of things. We can interact with other groups. We can do supply chain. We can do organizations of payments, for example. We don’t need to worry too much about who the other party is as long as we know which group it is. We can rely on the group to look after its members. We can do things like identity. There’s a lot of things that we can&nbsp;do.</p><p>So consequently my work these days is trying to build a platform which works with those groups and allows them to, if you like, utilize their capabilities in better ways, in more powerful ways. As I say, it’s slow work cause I’m doing it all&nbsp;myself.</p><p>Garrison: I love that concept of like focusing on smaller groups and then scaling from there. That’s just natural to how people organize and cooperate with one another. Something that I pay a lot of attention to is projects, both within crypto and outside of crypto that are kind of founded on more like, principles of cooperation and interdependence rather than absolute independence, assuming that everyone is working in their own selfish interests. I don’t really buy into that framework so much. But I really liked that idea of scaling up from existing social structures and trust relationships, because you could apply that to social savings groups in Africa. But also in other parts of the world, cooperatives throughout the world. The context could vary from just the community to art co-ops or studios and stuff like&nbsp;that.</p><p>I really like that kind of approach to things. Cause a lot of people try to have this monolithic solution. We cook up some solution in Silicon Valley and then we try to export it to other parts of the world in different cultures. And it’s like that doesn’t work&nbsp;out.</p> Identity Through Community [00:24:05] <p>Ian: That doesn’t work out at all. Yeah. It’s interesting. You say that it’s natural. It’s actually more than being natural. It’s who we are. Because if you look into it, try and figure out where all this came from, it traces back to basic anthropology and society in the sense that if you start, for example, with the child or the baby that’s born on day zero, they’re basically a tabula rasa, an empty slate, blank slate. And there’s nothing in there except the ability to cry and suckle basically. But if you shift forward 20 years or so, you’ve now got a working functioning adult with all the sophistication that is needed to do complex trades to engage in negotiations, to date with a person and start a family of her&nbsp;own.</p><p>So how did this happen? Well, actually it turns out the answer is very much in groups. It starts out with the mother of course, bringing the baby up, but pretty soon on the father turns up and upsets the very cozy arrangement that the baby had with the mother. So the baby now needs to learn how to deal with the father, which creates a sense of identity. And then they’ve got siblings and uncles and aunts and grandmothers and so forth. So actually the child is brought up in the context of a group. And therefore, when it comes time to leave the nest, when the child is booted out, because she’s now an adult and she’s got to go make her own way, she carries with her, this, this shall we say, groupness, this sense of identity inside a group. So naturally she’s quite happy to form another group or to participate in a group or to find a&nbsp;group.</p> Dissonance Between Identity Frameworks &amp; Societal Expectation [00:26:02] <p>And the reason we don’t really treasure this, we in fact avoid it in, if you like, academic discussion is because of the Western tradition for the last 500 years or so of individualism and capitalism. We treasure the notion of individualism and capitalism and so forth. And you’re going out to fight in the markets and become a millionaire by the time you’re 50 or whatever it is. These things are inculcated as the way we work in the world, but it’s not the way we work in the world. The way we work in the world is inside&nbsp;groups.</p><p>So the whole Western economy, if you like, has this dichotomy where we’ve got this theoretical notion of individualism fighting with our natural sense of community in groups, whereas we go outside the Western world, they don’t have the dichotomy. They’re much more oriented to the notion of, “Yes, we are naturally in our groups. We have groups, we work with groups, we have extended families. We have community groups, we have this, we have that. That’s how we do things.” So they don’t have that, if you like, collision of&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Garrison: It all comes down to people’s framings of identity. Crypto is, in large part although it’s certainly changed over the years, tends to be a little more very capitalist driven, libertarian, rugged individualism. It’s kind of lacking in the kind of interdependence and kind of cooperative principles that you find a little more in other cultures. Or at least it’s more prominent or foundational to other cultures.</p><p>I love your example of how an identity is formed because there’s like a — what was it? I don’t know if I’m saying that right — concept of like “I am, because we&nbsp;are.”</p><p>Ian: Yes,&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>Garrison: Is that what it is or am I misquoting?</p><p>Ian: That’s exactly what it is. Yes, yes. Yes. I am because we are. I am the person that my community defines myself, defines me as. I am the person that everybody around me, who I hold close will say that I am. And my position in the community is my future, if you like. I’m not an individual, I’m a member of a community.</p> Reputation &amp; Identity in Cryptosystems [00:28:19] <p>Garrison: The paradigm for awhile, at least in the blockchain space, has been. Assuming that the networking question has some sort of protocol token, that the more of that said token that you have, the more power you have or that kind of defines your presence within that ecosystem. Whereas there’s other design approach where it’s like, okay, well, identity is more about connections between people and your history. So like how do we, how do we build that? And kind of operationalize that.</p><p>And you’re starting to see people kind of talk about this more often lately and like the past year or two about like on chain reputation, or kind of being able to aggregate your on chain activity in a way to kind of prove that, oh, you’ve contributed to this or contributed to&nbsp;that.</p><p>It’s a little more meritocratic. Rather than kind of this. Identity along the edges that we’re talking about, but you’re starting to kind of see that&nbsp;shift.</p><p>The core principles.</p><p>Ian: Yeah, people have been talking about reputation since the beginning of computer time. It was a topic in the nineties and every year or two, somebody would come up with this new concept of putting reputation onto the internet and it never works. It never works. And the reason is that reputation is a very broad group-wise thing whereby in my head, there’s something about you and in your head, there’s something about me. It’s almost by definition, not quite by definition, but almost by definition, you can’t reduce it to a number. You can’t reduce it to a database entry. I mean, they do these things with credit scores and so forth, but obviously that’s such an approximation that it misses out the richness of what’s going&nbsp;on.</p><p>And so, consequently, I think anybody who’s talking about reputation first hasn’t understood the problem at all, and they will waste a lot of time. It turns out that reputation, if you like, comes from groups, comes from identity, comes from trust and so forth and so on. So you have to talk about those things first. And once you’ve got those things sorted out, reputation not only falls out very simply, it’s not particularly important. What’s important is what you’ve&nbsp;built.</p><p>You can see all this in world of, for example, ICOs and token sales and so forth. People looking at the number, the amount of tokens, and they’re saying, “Well, this is the power. This is the goal. This is why we’re here.” But actually the numbers are just the outcome. And if you go back and you look at the process of say, successful token sales, you’ve got this situation where some of the ICOs are fluff. There’s nothing in them. Then others of the ICOs are actually really good projects and really good people and so forth. But one of the ICOs might make more money than the other, or raise more capital or sell more tokens or whatever it is. And it’s not necessarily correlated to how good the project is in a technical sense. You mean, you could look at two white papers and say this one’s good this one’s bad, but the bad one makes more token sales than the good one. What it’s really correlated to is the strength of the network that the founders bring to the&nbsp;table.</p><p>So if you look at, for example, the EOS thing, which I had a lot to do with. It sold tokens to something like $4.1 billion or whatever the published number was. I don’t know what the real number&nbsp;was.</p><p>Garrison: I believe it was the largest of its kind. To this day, it’s the&nbsp;largest.</p><p>Ian: An order of magnitude. Yes. The only one that came close was the Telegram one, but that had to be wound back because they got in trouble with the SEC. Anyway, the reason that happened was because of the strength of the network and that network was a broad group of people who were already operating the BitShares network and the Steemit network. So there are already thousands of people across the world who were interested in, shall we say, Dan Larimer’s next venture. That whole network moved in to purchase the EOS tokens, making it very large. So yeah, the notion of relationships and networks is more or less ignored by the technical community, but it is the&nbsp;key</p><p>Garrison: And there’s a potential risk there as well. if you have a powerful existing network that carries over, especially if it follows like a particular builder or a founder, you do run the risk of cartelization. Because they’re like, “Oh, well, we can put the stakes down, claim our territory right out the gate and it can cause more centralization, cartelization moving&nbsp;forward.</p> Zero-Sum vs Positive-Sum Games [00:33:10] <p>That idea of the network, the kind of social ecosystem that surrounds the project is kind of what lends to its success. It seems interesting that there’s this tendency to completely ignore this kind of like what we’ve been talking about, this kind of more social&nbsp;,community-driven, interdependent aspect of things, which is natural to us as human beings. But there’s this tendency to think of it as, oh, it’s just a flaw that needs to be fixed with some new some new application. So it can be kind of difficult to kind of like steer the blockchain community to like kind of thinking more along these kind of lines of interdependence rather than just everything is competition over cooperation and stuff like that. And that’s just. Differences in philosophy, I&nbsp;guess.</p><p>Ian: Well, it’s differences in economic models, if you like. Those people who are focused on the pure mechanics of a smart contract and the zero sum game, and the notion that we can do these things without having to trust our counter parties. Missing the fact that actually, even if you do these things, there is going to be a large proportion of people who aren’t trustworthy coming in to game the system. So you’re going to end up with, if you like, a very adversarial community. Which is fine if you get it perfectly right, and your use case just needs that. But the vast majority of use cases do need some form of trust. They need some form of positive engagement such that you can actually do things together.</p><p>For example, just the issue of not being able to hack the smart contract is an issue of community in the sense that the hacker is part of your community. Now, what is incentivizing the hacker to not hack? We know what’s incentivizing the hacker to hack, that’s getting all the value and stealing it, but how would you incentivize that person not to hack and without thinking about that, you’re basically creating, if you like, a very technocratic foundation.</p><p>We’ve been doing software since 1943 or thereabouts. And what we have discovered is that software always has a terrible amount of bugs. A huge number of bugs. So when we go forward and say we’ve got this wonderful machine, the smart contract, that can be written to do a perfect zero sum game such that everybody’s happy. Well, that’s total bullshit. We just don’t know how to write good software either as a discipline or a profession or whatever. It’s just not on the table. So we’re fooling ourselves. We’re representing something that we have never really mastered. There is an exception, and that is the spacecraft software, software to run the space craft, the shuttle, so forth. But even there they’ve had quite a few disasters based on program. So yeah, we just can’t prove this. So we are living in a world where we have a cognitive dissonance where we believe two separate things. That software can create this perfect zero sum game, but we know we can’t do anything perfect with software.</p><p>Garrison: One of the things I kind of hope for is kind of shift from zero sum thinking to positive sum thinking, like creating systems that by design are intended to encourage positive sum games or outcomes. Cause it’s just better. I think it’s better if everyone that’s interacting within a system they all benefit in some way. And it seems like it’s just a design approach. But there’s a lot of core philosophies that kind of drive or influence how people think about things much less actually build them or implement them.</p><p>Your example of the spacecraft. Or even airplanes. That software that has in the event of a failure it’s catastrophic. There’s a sense of lives at risk. There’s a weight to&nbsp;it.</p><p>You don’t really see people thinking of smart contract development, building decentralized finance protocols, thinking necessarily with that same kind of weight. Responsibility with what they’re trying to build. It’s very much kind of experimental. Because ultimately even the so-called mature DeFi protocols that people will think of as established are still experiments that are like three years old at the&nbsp;most.</p><p>I’ve seen you on Twitter emphasize strongly how like the contract, the thinking of the contract behind these digital assets, is still lacking. Do you have any thoughts on like how to like convince people who operate in this kind of like digital prime thinking, where it’s all very technical kind of focused in the digital realm, to adopt kind of more like the physical prime thinking where like, oh actually the kind of agreements between people, actual people, are really important to building these&nbsp;things.</p> Ian on Encouraging Ricardian Contract Adoption by Devs [00:38:21] <p>Ian: I have done some recent thinking on this because it’s pretty obvious that people haven’t gone in that direction other than exceptions like Mattereum and so forth. The, the vast majority of the market, we’re talking 99% or so, has just skipped past that and had lots of fun issuing tokens. NFTs, of course, the recent&nbsp;craze.</p><p>So what’s going on here? It’s relatively easy to convince lawyers because lawyers, of course, their meat and drink is contracts. To almost an exclusionary approach. They can’t even think outside the realm of a contract. So they’re quite happy with the concept, but lawyers don’t program. So they can talk and talk and talk about this. And also lawyers aren’t entrepreneurs. They don’t act, they respond. So their way of thinking is, “Oh, there’s a dispute coming, I need to defend.” Yeah. And even if you ask them to write a contract, they’re writing in the future as if there’s a defense needed, there’s a dispute so they’re already in court in their mental state. They’re responding to an&nbsp;attack.</p><p>Whereas your entrepreneur acts into the void and create something in the void. So the lawyers are particularly helpful in this respect. So the other community, if you’d like, that’s interested in this is the developers and I’ve had a look at the whole the development process and I’ve actually come up with a recent thought and that is: okay, how do we make it easier for the developers to do&nbsp;this?</p><p>Well, one thing is we need the tool to write the contract. Another issue is what’s the tool to share the contract? And if you think about, for example, Google Docs, it’s a great tool for sharing documents, but it’s a lousy tool tool for exporting.</p><p>You can’t actually get access to it easily, except by exporting it as a PDF, for example. And that’s a useless form. You can imagine trying to teach lawyers to use Google Docs, but they look at it blankly and say, well, hold on, where’s Microsoft Word? I can’t see it. So you’ve got this huge difficulty and the same happens with programmers, but there is a tool where programmers do share documents, and that’s&nbsp;Git.</p><p>So what I’ve done is I’ve dived into Git, and specifically GitHub, the commercial company, and started modeling the Ricardian contract in GitHub as a GitHub posted document in Markdown format. Now that’s a document that is accessible and it’s shareable by the developers so they can contribute to it by means of pull requests. And they can come to a consensus over what the right version, and it can be exported from because GitHub posts all these different URLs you can use to get access to the document. So I’m now actually reconfiguring all of my software to do GitHub Markdown as the format. I used to use the old Microsoft INI format from 30 or 40 years ago. And that gave us good&nbsp;service.</p><p>We have, if you like, a non-technical, a co-operative requirement, and I’m experimenting with the notion that if we use GitHub, we can show the software and the contract being built up at the same time and therefore attract more developers to the process. And once we get enough developers doing it, there’s going to be the sense whereby, okay, gosh, there’s these developers over here that are using the Ricardian contract. And then there’s the majority of the market, which just don’t know don’t care don’t want it. But if you could compare them, the amount of information available in the Ricardian contract is orders of magnitude better because it’s tied to the NFT. It is the NFT and it is the contract. And we can hold that person to account and say, this is the contract you issued, right? You sold me an NFT, a photo with these rights. The right to hang it on my wall. Okay. Where’s the picture? When can I hang it on my wall? And you can state that with absolute certainty because it’s written in the contract. And once you get that, what you do is you will cause this, if you like, this bifurcation, this forking in the market, such that there’s the people who are doing it properly, the contracts, and then there’s the&nbsp;rest.</p><p>And then will start to spread. Because once you have this very solid difference, like Mattereum is trying to generate now. The Mattereum gold bar is a gold bar, and it’s on the net and it can be purchased and it can be traded. And that works because it’s based on contracts. Once you get that, enough people know that, you’ll start to, if you like, export the proper way of doing&nbsp;things.</p> On the Future of Smart Contracts [00:43:04] <p>Garrison: The kind of trends that are going on right now, both social trends and technological trends. Where do you see smart contracts 5, 10 years from&nbsp;now?</p><p>Ian: So, I’ve long predicted smart contracts really won’t come into their own until they’re incorporated with the legal documentation. And there are a few people that have gone in that direction. So for example, EOS put in the elements of smart contracts and Mattereum of course is doing it with it’s NFTs and so forth. But just getting that element together, you also need the governance and the governance is a lot of work. It’s a lot of costs. Getting that right, is something where somebody’s basically got to invest in doing it right up front to show that over the long run this thing works because we got the governance up and going in the beginning and that we sustained that governance through the lean years to the point where now it’s starting to generate some return for both the customers and for the investors or owners of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>So I think we’re still in the phase where we’re building enough of the building blocks to the point where we can set up, if you like, a foundation, enough foundation, so we can start building the use cases until we’ve got a smorgasbord of governance techniques to choose from and a smorgasbord of contractual mechanisms and different contracts and a smorgasbord of accounting systems and then a smorgasbord of, shall we say, smart contract coding and so forth. Until we’ve got that all nicely laid out such that we just pick one of each of them, put it together, and we create our foundation, we are going to be stymied in building a lot of complicated apps.</p><p>So it’s still a building phase. And I see that Mattereum for example, but there are others doing this as well, doing the brave work of investing upfront into the uncertain future, because if it can get this right, it will create that cornerstone that couples in with the other cornerstones, which makes the foundation work. Somebody has got to do that. Unfortunately, we hit the HODL problem in that it’s far easier to sit there and rely on other people to do the good work and just basically pretend we’re innovative, but really the only innovation we’ve got is bringing more people into the HODL circle, uh, which locks up so much of the capital. And makes it very hard, for example, to create reality, to create a substance. It’s good that people like Mattereum people like Vinay and yourself are pushing forward on this because that’s where the value is going to come from. And that’s where the real value is going to come from, building these building blocks and getting it up and&nbsp;going.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. That’s very well said. From what I gather it is a very expensive and time intensive process to kind of get these governance issues right. But it’s even just important just to give it due consideration before you just jump into some new&nbsp;venture.</p><p>A lot of budding entrepreneurs in the blockchain space. It’s really easy to kind of get carried away by the hype and the potential and the narrative. The kind of lasting impact will be in kind of just staying the course and thinking very longterm. Instead of short term potential or gains and stuff like that. I think there’s more maturity. more maturing going on in the development space. And people’s imaginations are just broader in terms of use cases. So like you get different types of thinkers and builders involved with the technology. So I think that will be hopefully great for all of us. And building better systems, better financial systems, and new ways of cooperating.</p><p>So we’re coming up on an hour into the session here. We’ve covered some of the work you’re currently doing and thinking you’re doing. Is there anything else you’d like to plug before we round things&nbsp;up?</p> Improving Asset Custody in Smart Property Systems [00:47:11] <p>Ian: So one of the things that I’ve done is I’ve looked at a problem that Mattereum had, which was how to do a solid custodial arrangement for some of these physical things. They have the bare bones but what they needed was something a little bit more, if you like, scalable and professional, and so forth. And I just happened to be working with a company called Hover, which is a specialist in the field of setting up custodial arrangements for physical&nbsp;items.</p><p>And I was able to introduce Hover and Mattereum together. I’m related to both companies, so it was a very easy introduction to make, but of course, I also end up being I’m able to participate in the discussion except to jolly things along a bit, because I’m in a conflict of interest. But that’s&nbsp;fine.</p><p>So Hover is a company that is explicitly setting out to create a good custodial arrangement for these assets. And therefore what it does is it solves one of the problems from Mattereum, which is great. How they do it I’m not gonna mention because at the moment they’re still in there shall we say their first or their seed round. And they need to get some money and build their MVP, which is going to happen. And then we’ll start, we’ll be able to talk about how they’ve actually done this but it’s been good because together we’ve found that missing piece which allows the full Mattereum puzzle to be solved. At least that’s the piece that I’ve been advised was missing. So now it’s not missing so that’s&nbsp;good.</p><p>It’s interesting because if you look at the whole arrangement to do this properly, not only do you need the smart contract, the coding, not only do you do need the legal document, but you also need people to hold assets and you need dispute resolution You need these different components which all get put together as a sort of Lego building. And until you’ve got them all there it’s not going to last in the long run. It’s going to be one of these flash in the pan things that scream up and then get into trouble and spring down&nbsp;again.</p><p>Garrison: It puts a lot of pressure to kind of generate a lot of intellectual and financial capital in the very early days of conceiving of this and having to kind of stay the course to make sure you get it right. Cause if you don’t get it right, then there’s a lot of legal systems and software systems start becoming detached from each other and it can be a messy a mess to clean&nbsp;up.</p><p>Ian: It gets messy, which creates costs, which drags everything down.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely.</p><p>So where can people follow you and your&nbsp;work?</p><p>Ian: These days I tend to use Twitter. But, but that’s just rambling on topics of the day. Iang_fc is the handle. I have a blog called Financial Cryptography that was a long standing blog for over a decade, but I don’t post much on there. In fact, I don’t post anything on there anymore because broken. I haven’t got the wherewithall or the patience to go in and fix&nbsp;it.</p><p>One thing that is happening is that the entire identity cycle has been turned into a book and that book is coming out fairly in the next few months. And that describes, if you the Chamapesa journey and the relationship of social groups to identity and so forth. It’s a long book in terms of an internet read. A 100 or 200 pages. But unfortunately to actually explain why this is so, I had to go very deep and trace through things like the anthropology of the child’s upbringing and so forth. Therefore the description is quite long winded. But without that it’s too many jumps and too many leaps of faith. It took me six years to get it all written down. So consequently, it’s a long read if you like, which is not useful in today’s terms, but anyway, the book will be coming out at some point and hopefully that will be amusing to some&nbsp;people.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, that’s fantastic. I I’ve read a lot of your writing on like identity and not just the Ricardian contract side of things, but also digital identity and your thinking behind that. It’d be great to have it all kind of both compiled and expanded. The connective tissue of that concept. And actually I would love to have you on the podcast again to kind of dig, really dig into the identity thing. We touched upon it in this conversation, which I’m really glad we did. But it’d be great to kind of focus on that. Get a more kind of overarching view and dive deeper into that particular subject.</p><p>Ian: Well, when the book comes out, I guess I’ll be happy to talk if you drifted into the book and actually got some questions out of it. That’d be&nbsp;great.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely. And for listeners, I highly recommend going to — it’s iang.org right that you have some of your papers and&nbsp;—</p><p>Ian: Yeah, it’s just my stuff really. It’s just the stuff site. It’s not pushing any particular concept. I’ve got a section for this, a section for that. I collect everything there so it’s more like a CV or resume than a website, but&nbsp;—</p><p>Garrison: A lot of the topics we covered a lot of the papers that kind of articulated these ideas are in there. I highly recommend if users are interested in like Ricardian contract or thinking about like digital identity and the kind of frameworks for building financial cryptography systems. Definitely check it out. There’s a lot that I think people could get out&nbsp;of.</p><p>Ian: Yes. And the other one is financialcryptography.org. There’s nothing new there, but there are something like 1500 posts over the last decade or&nbsp;so.</p><p>Garrison: Excellent. Thank you very much for coming on the show in Ian. A lot of the work you do is like something that I’ve paid attention to for three, four years now. So it was great to kind of dive in and get your perspective on&nbsp;things.</p><p>Ian: Good to hear. I mean the point of writing it all down is so other people can take from it and maybe learn a bit, but also maybe build on it and do something bigger. It’s encouraging to see Mattereum basically do that. Grab some papers. And race with them. Try and build the&nbsp;future.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/fos-ep-5-ian-grigg-on-crypto-identity-community-and-building-positive-sum-systems-17ef316703b9">FOS Ep. 5: Ian Grigg on Crypto, Identity, Community, and Building Positive-Sum Systems</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Tomorrow’s lending experience runs on consumer-permissioned data. Credit scores and self-submitted details have provided a framework for easy personal lending and even some business loans, but tomorrow’s lending will utilize consumer-permissioned data. This data comes directly from bank accounts, and this process increases accuracy and&nbsp; improves the experience for borrowers when used to augment credit scores and verify self-submitted information.</p>
<p>This transformation into consumer-permissioned data use in credit-decisioning is already happening today thanks to Finicity’s leading open banking data access connections direct to bank accounts. Where’s lending with data headed? How will it benefit lenders and consumers? <a href="http://www.finicity.com/lend-infographic">Download our open banking lending infographic to learn more</a>.</p>
<p>Introducing <a href="http://finicity.com/open-banking">consumer-permissioned financial </a><a href="http://www.finicity.com/open-banking">data</a> from Finicity’s open banking platform to lending makes a difference in a number of ways.</p>
<p>This data allows for simple, personal experiences to capture customers and build trust. It also reduces friction and allows consumers to apply for loans across the devices they use.</p>
<p>One interaction with your borrower can tell a complete financial story using data from different accounts for real-time insights without needing to wait to confirm borrower-submitted details.</p>
<p>Empowering experiences provide direct benefits to the customer by allowing access to their&nbsp; financial data, control over how it’s used, and the ability for them to benefit from its use, such as with obtaining a better loan product or lower interest rate. Additionally, this new innovative service&nbsp; provides lenders a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more secure experience provides clear reasons for consumers to test the waters of new lenders or new products. Knowing your data is safe makes trying new lenders, partners, or products more likely providing a boost to innovative, new products by answering a big question for many people — security.</p>

The FTC is back with its suit against&nbsp;Facebook <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/technology/ftc-facebook-antitrust.html">The NYTimes</a>:</p>Photo: Alessio&nbsp;Jacona<blockquote>“Facebook lacked the business acumen and technical talent to survive the transition to mobile,” Holly Vedova, the acting director of the bureau of competition at the agency, said in a statement. “After failing to compete with new innovators, Facebook illegally bought or buried them when their popularity became an existential threat.”</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook responded: “There was no valid claim that Facebook was a monopolist — and that has not changed. Our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were reviewed and cleared many years ago, and our platform policies were&nbsp;lawful.”</blockquote><p>As the NYTimes report continues, this is one of Lina Khan’s first big tests after he judge dropped the initial case that’s since been resubmitted:</p><blockquote>The F.T.C.’s core argument is that Facebook tried to maintain a monopoly over social networking through its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Slow to develop its app for mobile phones, the company sought to “buy or bury innovators threatening to out-compete Facebook in the new mobile environment,” the agency said in its complaint.</blockquote><blockquote>The lawsuit also says that, beginning in 2010, the company stifled competitors like Circle, a social network, and Vine, a short-video platform, by adding new limits for how outside developers whose products connected to Facebook could work with other social networks.</blockquote><blockquote>“Facebook beat competitors not by improving its own product but instead by imposing anticompetitive restrictions on developers,” according to the&nbsp;lawsuit.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/technology/ftc-facebook-antitrust.html">U.S. Revives Facebook Suit, Adding Details to Back Claim of a&nbsp;Monopoly</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-hit-with-renewed-antitrust-lawsuit-as-ftc-tries-again-11629387483?mod=djem10point">Facebook Hit With New Antitrust Suit From Federal Trade Commission</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/techs-antitrust-nemesis-girds-for-battle">Lina Khan Gets to Work at the&nbsp;FTC</a>   2.

<p>If you have a minute, read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-herrman">John Herrman’s</a>&nbsp;thought-provoking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/31/style/anonymity-pseudonymity-online-identity.html">piece</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;titled “Reconsidering pseudonymity and what it means to be ourselves online.”</p>



<p>We liked the article because it highlights why&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;exists and states a position we’ve always believed in—that there’s a genuine place for anonymity and pseudonymity online.</p>



<p>For years solutions to the growing problem of trolling and abuse have largely centered on ridding the internet of anonymity—forcing people to reveal their real names and identities when they engage online. But unmasking the vile troll&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155923">won’t stop the abuse;</a>&nbsp;instead, it would leave the honest majority of users without protection, freedom and control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often when the legitimate need for anonymity and pseudonymity is discussed, the conversation starts and stops with the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/removing-anonymity-online-would-risk-the-most-vulnerable-users/">most vulnerable groups</a>. While a completely valid use case, this tends to marginalize the general need to a niche, a notion that Anonyome Labs rejects. We started our company in 2014 expressly to provide such services for the general public.</p>



<p>We believe that all people should be able to determine how, when, where, and with whom they share their personal details, and that level of control is best delivered via&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">digital pseudonymized identities</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, the public discourse needs to catch up to the broader need for anonymity and pseudonymity. As John Herrman says in his article: “When represented at all, positive uses of anonymity and pseudonymity are portrayed as narrow and exceptional; it makes sense for dissidents, for instance, but what does everyone else have to hide?”.</p>



<p>That’s why we’re pleased to see the nuances of anonymity and pseudonymity explored in a publication as mainstream as the&nbsp;New York Times. The world needs to have this conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because after all, as Herrman says: “The desire for semi-anonymity shares one concern: control. A troll wants control over who knows what about him; a master-of-the-universe type wants to decide what gets stuck to the family name; a young person needs a space to figure things out; an older person needs a space to change. And yet, the desire to be different to different people is as familiar as family, as common as having friends and living around other people, valuable to the powerful and the weak. Who hasn’t, at some point, yearned for that kind of agency?”</p>



<p>It’s hard to argue that those sentiments aren’t universal, even if you also think Internet trolls are ruining the world.</p>

In the past year, as Urbit has become more reliable and easier to use, we find that we're spending almost all of our time on the network. We've disappeared into the system we've been building, and it's a pleasure to be on Urbit. There's nowhere else we'd rather be.

If you're on the network with us you can see the system being built and getting better in real time. Bug fixes and new features appear on your ship constantly. The community is actively planning the future of the system _using the system itself_. At Tlon, we have the unparalleled pleasure of working on the system, _on the system_. This feels great, but for those of you who aren't on the network, it can look as if we've disappeared.

Right now, Urbit is not for my non-technical friends. But everyone can tell that mainstream apps are getting worse and most feel a desire for change. We want Urbit to be as easy to use as a conventional service. Or, at least as easy to use as Signal. And we're getting pretty close to that.

In this post I'll cover the progress we've made since releasing OS 1 so those who aren't on the network can get a sense of what we've been up to and where we're going. We've built a great communication tool called Landscape, we are improving Urbit's ease of onboarding, and we're launching an entire software distribution system. We have a lot of work on our plate.

Okay, let's talk about where we currently stand and where we're heading.

**Arc**

Let's start at the top: we're working to build a new network and operating system for everyday cloud computing. We think everyone deserves to control and shape the tools they use to communicate and collaborate.

Or, to put it another way: the apps and services we have today are confusing, annoying, and overly complicated. The only way out is to start at the foundation by building a new software stack. Once we have a cloud computing stack that an individual can own and completely control, the old hope that computers can be tools of freedom will return. We haven't forgotten the original vision of software as a fun, free, flexible everyday tool.

This is a hilariously ambitious thing to try to do, we know. This is what makes it fun. So far, we just try to move step-by-step without overhyping what we're doing. Building a new platform for networked computing is both a technical and social problem. The technology has to work exceptionally well and the community has to care for it and move it forward.

Our first step was simply to build a prototype, then to refine it into something that could plausibly work. Then, most recently, take that plausible prototype and build a user experience we liked enough to depend on it from day-to-day.

In the last eighteen months we've done exactly that. We depend on Urbit day-to-day and have shipped a tool that has become a home for numerous cultures and communities who are invested in moving the system forward. We first called that tool OS 1 but now it's known as Landscape.

First, let's talk about the general arc of OS 1 → Landscape, both the successes and challenges. Then we'll talk about our next step, which is to create an independent and community supported software ecosystem.

**OS 1 → Landscape**

The tools we use shape the way we think. So how could we build better tools with old broken ones? We needed to cut our reliance on old tools that couldn't care less about how people actually work and live. The only thing they maximized was distraction and dependence. We needed something that was fundamentally private, durable, and flexible. Above all, we needed something that actually belonged to us.

Building Urbit involves a lot of communication and collaboration. In order to move Urbit forward we knew that we needed a place to converse and connect, and we knew that place had to be on Urbit itself. We didn't need a Slack or a Discord or a Google Drive or a Reddit. We needed all of those things, in one place, that actually belonged to us.

We experimented, built things, threw them away, and then eventually built and [launched OS 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ViyftPkGk).

OS 1, now Landscape, is a simple tool for bringing groups together to communicate and stay connected. When a real physical community goes online they immediately become fragmented between various apps. Perhaps a Slack channel coupled with some Notion notebooks and a Telegram channel works for some people. It's easy to imagine other permutations, and you probably are already in at least two or three. These duct-taped stacks are not only ugly and confusing, but your day to day computing is spread thin and remains in the control of companies—not you.

Urbit is a decentralized network but Landscape is for re-centralizing your communication. Users can form groups which share a set of channels; each channel can be either a chat, a notebook or a collection of links. This means groups can communicate flexibly, exactly how they want. And since Landscape is built on Urbit, each group is private and peer to peer; data is only shared between people in the group; each community on Landscape is completely independent. Communities own their data and last as long as they need to.

This combination of a flexible unified interface on a decentralized platform you can trust feels really good.

When OS 1 was first released, it was slow, buggy, and frustrating—but we loved it and wanted it to be better. We spent the next nine months making sweeping changes to take it from releasable prototype to pretty-nice first version. We rewrote the frontend completely, massively improved the performance of Urbit OS itself, and overhauled the interface. It was an enormous collective effort.

By the end of 2020 we had renamed OS 1 to Landscape and the user experience was far better. We [announced our hosting service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qKe_WZr50) and onboarded close friends to help us test the system. I [wrote a little](&lt;[https://tlon.io/news/landscape-now/](https://tlon.io/news/landscape-now/)&gt;) about using Landscape from day-to-day around that time.

Landscape wasn't just a useful tool for us, but it was something that other communities were starting to use in earnest. It seemed like Landscape could be a great place for people to grow new private communities, so long as we could onboard new users effectively. Hosting is a huge piece of the puzzle, since we need non-technical people to be able to use this wonderful platform as easily as its mainstream competitors.

At this point (early this year), we encountered some pretty serious hurdles.

To use Urbit, you need an Urbit ID. Each one of these is an NFT (something that no one cared about when we first launched Urbit ID). The basic idea is that an ID should cost something so that they aren't used abusively. But, in late 2020 the combination of a crypto bull market and congestion on the Ethereum network caused the transaction fee for buying an Urbit ID to increase from ~$1-2 to ~$100. An Urbit ID should cost _something_, but \&gt;$100 is too much of a barrier for entry. We knew that this could happen and started researching solutions late last year, ultimately deciding to [implement a solution ourselves](https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/).

The tough part about having an identity verified on the blockchain is that you become vulnerable to unpredictable volatility. We saw a period of painfully high prices, followed by a dip, followed by another stretch of extremely high prices. We opted to continue releasing Landscape updates and moving the system forward despite the fact that it became prohibitively expensive to onboard people. Luckily, our solution to this problem should go live this summer, and will reduce the cost of onboarding about 60x. The best part is that it is a permanent solution so we'll never have to face this problem again.

The other challenge to scaling the onboarding process is hosting.

We have a functional hosting structure but we want it to be fully automated and featured. We've been able to onboard friends and enthusiasts which has taught us a lot about how the system should work. But hosting has to be easy for anyone to join and get online quickly. Without an automated invite flow and it's not ready for prime time.

We've made great progress on this front. We are currently testing improvements internally and aim to have a final version ready simultaneously with lower planet fees. Then, at long last, we can comfortably invite friends to get on the network without ever leaving the browser.

It's worth mentioning that hosting is very much a Tlon Corporation project. Urbit is a platform owned, maintained, and developed by the people that use it (along with the nascent Urbit Foundation). Tlon, while also contributing to the Urbit project, ultimately wants to produce applications and services on Urbit. Hosting is one of those projects. Hosting makes Urbit easy, approachable, and usable without the compromises involved in using a conventional service. Since we'll be one of many Urbit-related providers, Tlon won't be the only host. There are already a few others (like [UrbitHost](https://urbithost.com/)) getting off the ground, which is fantastic.

**Landscape → Grid**

As the world has become more physically distributed we rely on our digital tools to keep our communities connected. The rise of DAOs, collectives, squads, and alternative community governance structures underscores the importance of tools like Landscape that communities can actually own and control.

Our first goal was to find out if we could build something really good on top of Urbit. We did that. And we're continuing to lower the barrier to entry. We've also got an Urbit 'messenger' iOS app in the works that's really nice.

Landscape is great, but in the long run Urbit is meant to be a platform for anyone to build on top of. Urbit is a computer, not just a single communications app like Landscape. The whole point of Urbit is to make it easy for an individual to run their own general-purpose computer in the cloud. Your Urbit isn't just meant to run Landscape it's meant to run any sort of application. And that's where we're going next.

Grid is a holistic interface for interacting with your Urbit node. Landscape, as it's known today, will become one of many apps that can be launched. Perhaps most importantly, Grid will have peer-to-peer software distribution over the network. This means you can, as a developer, build something, let a friend sync it over the network, and never have to run a dedicated distribution server. Or, as an everyday user, you can run software on your private Urbit node without the developer ever being involved.

Urbit isn't an OS in the traditional sense—it's an 'overlay' OS. It has to run on top of something else. But Urbit _is_ an OS in the sense that it's general-purpose. And our goal in building interfaces for Urbit is to deliver that feeling of openness and flexibility to the user. Grid is a major step toward that goal.

Not only should a community own their communication tools, they should be able to run and host their own cloud software. They shouldn't need to rely on providers to store their data, run the application, and determine how their digital life will function.

Grid will surely go through the same process that Landscape did. It'll start as a working first version that will inspire us to refine and make it better. But, unlike Landscape, Grid opens up an entirely new frontier for what can be done on Urbit.

We're putting together our first conference on Oct 15-17th to inaugurate Urbit as an integrated platform and distribution system for new applications. [Tickets for Assembly 2021 are already available](https://checkout.eventcreate.com/assembly2021/select-buy). Tlon is going to Austin!

**Closing**

Urbit is a deeply optimistic project. Although the digital world seems more broken than ever, we're confident that something else is possible. We have already created software that people use everyday. We want everyone to have the experience that we do, and we want that experience to continue to get better. Beautiful, reliable infrastructure that communities can build on will have a significant impact on the world. The end game of connected computers doesn't have to be dystopian.

For those of you who aren't directly involved with the project, I hope this gives you a snapshot of where we are. If we were on an Antarctic expedition the postcard would read something like 'Team is well-fed, healthy and motivated. Making great progress.'

With that, I'll get back to work.

 Jolocom bringt im ONCE Projekt hoheitliche Identitäten sowie SSI in eine Wallet. 



<p>Jolocom arbeitet im Project “ONCE – Online einfach anmelden” gemeinsam mit renommierten Partnern daran, die digitalen Identitäten von Bürgern und Bürgerinnen ganzheitlich auf das Smartphone zu bringen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Projekt ist Teil des Innovationswettbewerbs „Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten”, gefördert durch das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi), und eines von insgesamt vier Projekten, die es in die dreijährige Umsetzungsphase geschafft haben. Die Jolocom GmbH wird ihre Expertise in der Entwicklung von Wallet-basierten Digitalen Identitäten auf Basis des Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Ansatzes in insgesamt drei der Umsetzungsprojekte einbringen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nach einjähriger Vorbereitung im Rahmen der ersten Wettbewerbsphase hat die Umsetzungsphase für das Projekt ONCE im Mai 2021 begonnen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In der Anfangsphase liegt der Fokus noch stark auf der Entwicklung, Implementierung und Integration der technischen Komponenten. Bald wird allerdings die Umsetzung von Anwendungsfällen aus den Bereichen Öffentliche Verwaltung, Mobilität und Tourismus in den Vordergrund treten. Die Lösungen des ONCE-Ökosystems werden dann insbesondere in der Region Hessen, sowie in Partnerstädten in Bayern und Nordrhein-Westfalen pilotiert und in Umlauf gebracht. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt werden die praktischen Ergebnisse von ONCE&nbsp; im Alltag durch Anwohner und Bürger der Regionen erprobt.</p>



<p>Das ONCE-Ökosystem besteht aus einer Reihe von aufeinander abgestimmten Komponenten, die langfristig als eine Referenzimplementierung für ein offenes Identitätsökosystem dienen sollen. Aus diesem Grund wird bei den zu entwickelnden Komponenten von “ONCE-konformen” Lösungen gesprochen.</p>



<p>In seiner Funktionalität ist das Ökosystem darauf ausgelegt sowohl hoheitliche Identitäten und Nachweise zu bedienen (eID, mDL, iKfz), als auch Identitätsmerkmale, die nach den Prinzipien der selbstbestimmten Identität (Self-sovereign Identity) herausgegeben und verwendet werden. Das ONCE-Projekt berücksichtigt auch derzeitige Entwicklungen rund um die europäische eIDAS-Verordnung, mit dem klaren Ziel zukunftsfähige Lösungen zum Thema Digitale Identitäten für deutsche und EU-Bürger bereitzustellen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom ist im ONCE-Projekt für die Entwicklung der ONCE-konformen Wallet zuständig, welche auf der Jolocom Smart-Wallet aufbaut und die gemeinsam mit den Projektpartnern in den kommenden zwei Jahren um weitere Module und Funktionen ergänzt werden wird.&nbsp;</p>

 Jolocom puts sovereign identities, as well as SSI into a single wallet as part of the ONCE project. 



<p>Jolocom is currently working on the project “ONCE – Online einfach anmelden” (simply register online – ONCE) alongside a number of prestigious partners, with the aim to bring the digital identity of any citizen onto their smartphone.</p>



<p>The project is part of the competitive innovation programme “Showcase Secure Digital Identities” (SSDI) funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) and one of four projects that qualified for the implementation phase.</p>



<p>Jolocom is a partner in three of the four SDI implementation projects, to which it will lend its expertise in self-sovereign identity and years of experience in developing digital identity wallets.</p>



<p>ONCE is the first of these projects to launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a year’s preparation during the initial competition phase, the implementation phase of the ONCE project started in May 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, the focus is on the development and application of the technical components. Soon, however, a large number of use cases from the public administration, mobility and tourism sectors will be piloted in the Hesse region and in partner cities in Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia. It is at this stage that the ONCE ecosystem will be tested by ordinary citizens.</p>



<p>The ONCE ecosystem consists of a number of inter-dependent and well coordinated components that are intended to serve as a reference point for a long-lasting open identity ecosystem in Germany. As such, components developed in the project have been dubbed ONCE-compliant solutions.</p>



<p>In terms of its functionality, the ecosystem is designed to serve officially issued, so-called sovereign identities and proofs (eID, mDL, iKfz), as well as digital identity credentials issued and used according to the principles of self-sovereign identity. The ONCE project is also taking recent developments in the European eIDAS regulation into consideration, with the aim of providing future-proof solutions for digital identities to German and EU citizens.</p>



<p>Within the ONCE project, Jolocom is responsible for the development of the ONCE-compliant wallet. This will be based on Jolocom’s existing SmartWallet and will, with the aid of the project partners, be supplemented with additional modules and functions over the next two years.</p>



 Publicly funded project partners 



<p>Bundesdruckerei GmbH (Lead coordinatior of the consortium), AKDB, Behle Hochheide GmbH &amp; Co.KG, Deutsche Telekom Security GmbH, ekom21 – KGRZ Hessen, Fraunhofer-Institute für Angewandte und Integrierte Sicherheit (AISEC) und für Arbeitswirtschaft und Organisation (IAO), Giesecke+Devrient Mobile Security GmbH, Governikus KG, HelloGuest Solutions GmbH, Jolocom GmbH, regio iT GmbH, Robert Bosch GmbH, Stadt Fürth, Vodafone GmbH.</p>



<p>A further 24 companies are associated partners of the project, supporting the consortium work without public funding for their expenses.</p>

 ML Ops — a TPM’s guide on how to get&nbsp;started <p>First things first — Why am I writing this&nbsp;article?</p><p>I had my first experience working on deploying a new machine learning model to a live production system two years ago when I joined a high profile project said to be game-changing for our business (no pressure!). We had a tight timeline and high expectations to positively impact key business metrics. As a technical program manager (TPM) I was responsible for driving the successful delivery of the research-ready model to production in the requested time frame and ensuring we realise the expected business impact. Spoiler alert — it didn’t go so smoothly!</p><p>While working on this project I identified numerous gaps in our machine learning development and delivery infrastructure and processes. After highlighting these gaps to our leadership, I was tasked with founding our machine learning operations team. In this article, I will share a framework for founding and growing an ML Ops team within an organisation.</p><p>When starting in the field, I found that it was pretty difficult to find resources on how to start, organise and run an ML Ops function and team in an organisation. There was a lot of information on different tools that take care of parts of the ML pipeline but that was about it. For a newbie to the problem space, I found that I largely had to depend and draw on my skills and prior experience as a TPM and take it from&nbsp;there.</p><p>Here I will reflect on some of my experience working in ML Ops and will discuss the background, fundamentals and how to get started. I hope it will be useful to those just starting their ML Ops&nbsp;journey.</p><p>ML Ops Background</p><p>As the popularity of machine learning models grew, machine learning platforms were required to support the development, delivery and maintenance of many models in a live production system at scale. Particularly, the need for machine learning platforms began to rise several years ago after companies developing and using ML models in their products started to realise that deploying ML models came with added complexities compared to traditional code. Whilst deploying the model itself can be relatively easy, it’s the ongoing operations and maintenance once the model goes to production that was difficult to&nbsp;manage.</p><p>One of the most prominent papers that first highlighted this problem came in 2014 from a group of Google researchers titled “Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt”. In the paper, the authors alluded to a growing and often ignored problem, namely the operational complexities of maintaining a machine learning system in production.</p><p>The paper highlighted that ‘Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning.’ [D. Sculley, Gary Holt,&nbsp;etc]</p><p>The paper also sparked awareness and interest in the problem field of operations and maintenance of machine learning models in production. In response, many companies started investing and forming ML Ops functions to develop and manage their machine learning platforms and the full machine learning lifecycle.</p><p>This brings us to two main questions:</p>  What is ML&nbsp;Ops?  What is the full machine learning lifecycle?  <p>What is ML&nbsp;Ops?</p><p>There are a few definitions of the ML Ops function and team responsibilities but, at its core, the team’s purpose is to ‘help simplify the management, logistics, and deployment of machine learning models between operations and engineering teams and machine learning researchers’. Most commonly, as intuited by the name, ML Ops is compared to DevOps or cloud infrastructure teams but applied to the field of machine learning. The goals of the two functions are very similar. Much like DevOps, the goal of ML Ops is to create a continuous development pipeline for machine learning models. A pipeline that quickly allows data scientists and machine learning engineers to deploy, test and monitor their models, ensuring they continue to act in the way they are expected&nbsp;to.</p><p>In practice, this means that ML Ops must manage a much wider range of responsibilities than would normally be expected from DevOps. Unlike DevOps, ML Ops typically requires additional considerations including data verification, model analysis, metadata management, feature engineering, code and data versioning along with the ML code&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Besides DevOps, ML Ops also works very closely with data/applied scientists and software engineers. The diagram below visualises the scope of the ML Ops team and its function.</p><p>From my personal experience, there are two key benefits of ML Ops in an organisation. The first is to provide tooling and infrastructure by working closely together with DevOps and Engineering. The second is to bring data/applied scientists and software engineers closer together and to foster collaboration and best practices, thereby streamlining the model development, productionisation and maintenance.</p><p>The ML Pipeline and the ML Lifecycle</p><p>Often, the ML Lifecycle is described as having the following stages:</p><p>However, in a modern organisation that builds AI-powered products, the above diagram covers only half of the ML lifecycle. For truly successful ML-powered products, additional stages need to be&nbsp;added.</p><p>Using the extended ML lifecycle model we can look into what a typical ML Pipeline looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>The above pipeline also nicely depicts the scope of work of an ML Ops&nbsp;team.</p><p>Is ML Ops worth&nbsp;it?</p><p>Increasingly, organisations are adopting machine learning to help improve their performance, business decision making, and to reduce costs. When deployed successfully, AI and ML could help drive up to 20% of companies’ earnings (McKinsey 2020).</p><p>To get to a place where your machine learning models are adding real value to your business, you not only have to build the right models but also need to effectively deploy, monitor, update and govern these&nbsp;models.</p><p>The key learning here is that machine learning can provide great value to your bottom line, but only if implemented and maintained correctly. In the context of a growing business, scaling ML can be difficult to achieve without a solid framework. This is where ML Ops comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>How to get&nbsp;started?</p><p>After your organisation agrees that investing in ML Ops is valuable, you need to decide how to start your ML Ops journey. As the ML Ops function is relatively new there is a lot of fluidity and flexibility around what’s in scope for the team and how it’s organised. This can also differ from company to&nbsp;company.</p><p>At my company, we started our journey one and a half years ago with an MVP (minimum viable product) ML Ops team. The newly formed team had three members — a technical program manager (me), a software engineer and a DevOps engineer.</p><p>We started by identifying our stakeholders. This step is often missed but I believe it is crucial to take the time to do this as it helps define the scope of the team. Conventional wisdom tells us that ML Ops’ stakeholders are data and applied scientists. While I agree that these are some of the main stakeholders, I strongly believe that a successful ML Ops team and function has many stakeholders in the organisation whose needs need to be understood and&nbsp;met.</p><p>Our stakeholder list looked like&nbsp;this:</p>  Applied science team. It’s important to recognise that this team has two groups with aligned but different needs and requirements. These two groups are individual contributors and managers.  Product teams utilising the ML models — especially the software engineers working together with applied scientists on deploying models.  Data scientists and product&nbsp;analysts  Security team  Compliance team  Legal team  Senior company leadership  <p>After identifying our stakeholders, we conducted interviews with all of them asking “What is the hardest thing for their function with respect to ML?” and “What do they need in order to go faster and do&nbsp;better?”</p><p>You can get a lot of interesting insights by asking different people the same question. The answers from our applied scientists and software engineers somewhat surprised us with the breadth of issues they discussed.</p><p>Our business stakeholders and engineering managers complained about projects taking too long. Specifically, they complained that getting the first versions of a model to production took surprisingly long (a problem most organisations using ML in their products suffer&nbsp;from).</p><p>Our applied scientists complained about data access, data labelling and overall data management. They struggled with version control of their code, data, models, dependencies and parameters. Additionally, thorough testing was difficult and time-consuming.</p><p>Our software engineers and applied scientists alike complained about collaboration and communication and struggled to work effectively and efficiently together. For example, we saw applied scientists incorporating modern off-the-shelf ML libraries but, unfortunately, we witnessed various issues caused by these libraries when they got included as dependencies in production workflows.</p><p>For our security team, the balance between data security and operational efficiency was a real challenge and one that is difficult to strike and maintain.</p><p>Our legal and compliance teams had increasing requirements with respect to AI governance and model explainability.</p><p>Mapping the pain points from all stakeholders looked a bit like&nbsp;this.</p><p>The tip of the iceberg shows the concerns of our main stakeholders while the hidden part of the iceberg depicts the needs of the secondary stakeholders. The whole iceberg depicts the needs of the ML-powered organisation as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Regarding our main stakeholders: as we expected, we discovered some technical gaps and realised that most of the things that our scientists needed to do were, in theory, technically possible but nothing was easy enough. Common operations were tedious and time-consuming, lacking process support. Standardisation was minimal and we realised we were in a situation which we called ‘The Wild West of&nbsp;models’.</p><p>A ‘‘Wild West of models’ situation is characterised by:</p>  Lack of consistency in working practices and processes.  Basic tooling to supporting some of the stages of the ML lifecycle but lack of extensive pipelines supporting the entire ML lifecycle.  High compute costs which are difficult to explain and&nbsp;manage.  Work is done in silos and there is little and sporadic documentation.  Model deployment takes ‘surprisingly’ long.  <p>While these are some of the main signs, this is by no means an exhaustive list (but you get the idea!) If you are in a similar situation, operational efficiency and a quick machine learning deployment cycle, while meeting security and regulatory requirements, seems a distant&nbsp;dream.</p><p>Alongside working on understanding the current state of ML Ops and stakeholders’ pain points we also worked on a vision for the team and an ideal future state. We stated our mission as ‘To enable our organisation to efficiently develop and ship ML-powered features throughout the product.’</p><p>It’s intentional that this statement focuses on the efficient delivery of ML-powered products from an organisational perspective. I believe that ML Ops, like any other successful team or function in an organisation, needs to support the delivery of business value and it’s important to capture this in the mission statement of the team. It is for this same reason (laser focus on delivering organisational value) that having a clear understanding of your team’s stakeholders and extended ML lifecycle is so&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>The next step is to take these pain points and develop a roadmap that will take the infrastructure and operations from the current status to your North Star. The roadmap should focus not only on building infrastructure and tools but also recognise the need to improve processes and practices alongside to fully realise the benefits of the developed infrastructure and tools. Failing to evolve processes, practices and culture alongside the technical infrastructure and tooling is a common organisational issue and one that is important to avoid in the context of ML&nbsp;Ops.</p><p>Once you have all these foundational pieces in place all that is left is to get to&nbsp;work!</p><p>Fast forward to today and, amongst other things, we have managed&nbsp;to:</p>  Perform a security audit of tools and practices to identify gaps and close&nbsp;them.  Build a new data pipeline making data sourcing and management significantly easier and&nbsp;faster.  Improve the development experience by streamlining the number of tools used and their&nbsp;setup.  Hold training with our applied scientists to help improve their python and general coding&nbsp;skills.  Reduce costs by 20% while increasing the number of jobs run by 30% through better resource management.  Reduce overall time from an ML PoC (machine learning proof of concept) to production by&nbsp;20%.  <p>By keeping laser-focused on what matters and relentlessly demonstrating the business impact of the team’s work I was able to build the case to double the team early this year with plans to quadruple by the end of the&nbsp;year.</p><p>So what is next for us? Our next goal is to reduce cycle time from data collection, training and testing the corresponding model in production safely down to 48 hours. For mission-critical systems like ours, this is very ambitious but we are up for the challenge!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/ml-ops-a-tpms-guide-on-how-to-get-started-652c115c02a6">ML Ops — a TPM’s guide on how to get started</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Cryptomode: The high energy consumption and expensive hardware requirements of Bitcoin and other proof-of-work networks are no secret to anybody. In that regard we are proud to have pioneered the first pure proof-of-stake blockchain - Nxt, in 2013 and the first multi-chain network - Ardor, in 2018. Both of them use a 100% proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and their energy consumption is extremely low - a fact that's been recognized many times and once again lately by this article. We can only add that Nxt and Ardor are not only very energy-efficient but they can easily work on any desktop or&nbsp;mobile device.</p>

<p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) is an emerging philosophy that puts you in complete control over your data. In this framework, you get to store your data and share it with just the entities you&nbsp;want.</p><p>This relatively new concept of digital identity management has three essential pillars and they are the issuer, the holder, and the verifier. Together, these three pillars or entities constitute what’s called the trust triangle.</p><p>Let’s start with understanding what these three pillars&nbsp;are.</p> Who are&nbsp;Issuers? <p>An issuer is an entity that is authorized to issue a credential. These issuers are typically government organizations, healthcare centers, banks and financial institutions, schools and universities, and possibly even organizations and startups that verify a piece of information and issue a credential attesting that information.</p><p>For example, the Department of Motor Vehicles is an issuer that is authorized to issue a driver’s license credential that contains the license number of an individual. Similarly, SafeTravel is a startup company that verifies whether an individual has taken his or her COVID vaccination and accordingly, issues a credential to attest&nbsp;it.</p> Who are&nbsp;Holders? <p>A holder is the owner of the credential and has complete control over how it can be managed, with whom these credentials can be shared, or revoked. Holders can be individuals or organizations.</p><p>Since the holder is the owner of the credential, this entity can create a verifiable presentation consisting of one or more <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>, and this presentation is shared with verifiers who will use this information to authenticate the user or validate the shared information.</p> Who are Verifiers? <p>A verifier is an entity that verifies a credential and ensures that it comes from a competent issuer, is tamper-proof, and is still relevant (not expired or revoked). A verifier takes the verifiable presentation from the holder to determine its authenticity.</p><p>Verifiers are entities that need specific information about a holder for authentication, so its services can be offered to the holder. A good example is an alcohol store that has to verify the age of the buyer before selling alcohol to him or&nbsp;her.</p> Why are they Called the Trust Triangle? <p>The relationship between the issuers, holders, and verifiers is called the trust triangle simply because you need an element of trust among these entities for them to work together. Also, this term is typically used to convey human relationships in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>When an issuer issues a credential, the holder is willing to trust the issuer. The same applies to the verifiable presentation shared by the holder to the verifier and when the verifier verifies the issuer’s credential.</p><p>While this does not mean that there is a legal partnership or understanding between the entities involved, it does mean that each of the entities is willing to examine the credibility of the other, and this implicit trust is what constitutes this&nbsp;term.</p> Real-world Examples <p>Here are some real-world examples of how the issuer, holder, and verifier come together to create a transaction.</p> Employment <p>Some companies like GoodWorker verify the profiles of workers and issue <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">employment credentials</a> to authenticate their past employment.

<p>First of all, I want to publicly say that I’ve struggled with obsessive-compulsive disorder for most of my life. This is Dev Pulse 102 and I'm talking about Holochain v0.0.103. Those numbers differ by one, and that really annoys me. But I’ve found that one of the best remedies for OCD is to laugh at myself. So I’m going to have a little chuckle, delight in the mismatch, and move on to the exciting news for this release!</p> Countersigning <p>[Editor's note: this section was modified on August 23rd, 2021, at 04:30 UTC, after I received feedback from the core devs. It's meant to be a gentle introduction to countersigning, not a comprehensive guide. It'll make it into the Core Concepts soon though. In the meantime, <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/countersigning-has-landed-in-holochain-v0-0-103/6739">join this forum thread</a> to share your questions, use cases, and other thoughts related to countersigning.]</p><p>This is the big news in Holochain v0.0.103. Many of you who follow Holochain come from the cryptocurrency world, so naturally you’re probably interested in Holochain as a platform for building new cryptocurrencies. But you probably also know that they <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae">won’t work like traditional cryptocurrencies</a>.</p><p>So how will they work?</p><p>Using a technique called countersigning. Because every participant in a hApp has their own source chain, every transaction is a bit like a cross-chain <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp">atomic swap</a> (not exactly, but close enough).</p><p>Here’s what countersigning looks like, in rough terms. Although it can be used for any sort of interaction where multiple parties come to agreement, we’ll use a currency transaction because everyone is familiar with that. (Other use cases we've seen include legal contracts, ownership transfers (also known as <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/nfts-on-holochain-easy-as-passing-the-ball-2/">NFTs</a>), and even <a href="https://youtu.be/AQ6-_QsuLIw">chess</a> player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">ranking</a>.)</p><p>Alice owes Bob 100 credits for a bicycle purchase. She sends Bob the details of the transaction and Bob acknowledges that it’s the correct amount. This is the human part, where Alice and Bob are interacting with their app UIs.</p><p>Now that the transaction details are agreed upon, Alice and Bob’s hApps start an automated process to countersign and commit the transaction to their own source chains. It's meant to happen quickly, when both parties are online. Once it’s done, each person will have a copy of the transaction on their own source chain, signed by both themselves and the other party, and published to the DHT.</p><p>(Note: From here on in, ‘Alice and Bob’ actually mean Alice and Bob’s computers.)</p><p>Alice creates a proposal that she and Bob come to ‘local consensus’ on the states of their source chains. This is called a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html">preflight request</a>. It specifies who’s involved (her and Bob), the hash of the proposed transaction, and the time window for action. Once she’s created it, she sends it to Bob.</p><p>Bob sends Alice his signature on the preflight request, along with his current source chain state. This is called a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/struct.PreflightResponse.html">preflight response</a>. His source chain is now ‘locked’ at this state until the transaction succeeds or fails. In the meantime, Alice signs the preflight request too.</p><p>Now Alice creates a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/struct.CounterSigningSessionData.html">countersigning session</a>, containing the preflight request, along with her and Bob’s signatures and source chain states. Once again, she sends it off to Bob.</p><p>Alice and Bob both try to commit a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/enum.Entry.html#variant.CounterSign">countersigned entry</a>, including both the countersigning session and the transaction data, to their source chains.</p><p>This is where they both have the chance to back out if something goes wrong — their entry gets passed through a validation function which double-checks that Alice still has sufficient balance. Alice and Bob both run the validation function twice — once from their perspective and once from the other’s perspective — just to make sure it’s valid for both source chains.</p><p>If all goes well in validation, it’s ready to commit — almost. First, Alice and Bob publish the entry and their own headers to a certain part of the DHT, the entry’s neighbourhood, where it gets validated by third parties.</p><p>Once the neighbourhood collects both Alice and Bob’s headers, they send a copy of both headers to both of them.</p><p>Now that Alice and Bob have seen that the other has signed the entry, the transaction is almost complete. There’s one last step: they finally commit the entry to their source chains and publish their headers to two more parts of the DHT, their own neighbourhoods. This allows future counterparties to check for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublespending.asp">double-spend attempts</a>.</p><p>Now the money is transferred, Alice and Bob’s source chains are unlocked, and Bob gives Alice her bike.</p><p>If this sounds complicated, it’s because it is. The good news is that most of this stuff is handled by the Holochain conductor. As a developer, you just need to know about <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html">preflight requests</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/struct.PreflightResponse.html">preflight response</a> signing, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/struct.CounterSigningSessionData.html">countersigning sessions</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/enum.Entry.html#variant.CounterSign">countersigned entries</a>, and the new <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/countersigning/fn.accept_countersigning_preflight_request.html">accept_countersigning_preflight_request</a></code> host function which does most of the heavy lifting for you. The rest is flexible; you can create, distribute, and collect these things in whatever way works for you. And any app entry type that you define can be part of a countersigned transaction, in both <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/6_crud_actions/#simulating-mutability">create and update flavours</a>.</p><blockquote>Note: Countersigning isn't related to 'chain fork detection', which catches the dreaded double-spend attack, so it doesn't have the power to prevent it. That's the job of the DHT, which <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#a-cloud-of-witnesses">collects all the evidence</a> needed to detect a fork and eject the bad actor after the fact. Our core devs are also working on a possible preventative solution; watch the Dev Pulse in the coming months for more details.</blockquote> Parallel network functions <p>Network functions, like DHT gets, remote calls, and remote signals, are blocking calls — that is, they stop execution of your code until they’re done. If you have to retrieve a lot of DHT data or call the same function on a lot of peers’ devices, that means you have to loop over everything you wanted to do and do each call in serial. This can take a lot of time.</p><p>There’s been a change to many network functions; now you can specify multiple DHT hashes for <code>get</code>, <code>get_details</code>, <code>get_links</code>, and <code>get_link_details</code>, and multiple agent IDs for <code>call_remote</code>. Holochain then does the work in parallel, returning a list of successes and failures all at once.</p> Fixes and breaking changes   Breaking: A header timestamp will always be newer than its previous header’s timestamp. Previously it was always newer than or equal to.  Breaking: Conductor configs now <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.103/CHANGELOG.md#holochain_conductor_api-003">require a <code>passphrase_service</code> directive</a>.  Breaking: <code>sys_time</code> returns a <code>Timestamp</code> instead of a <code>Duration</code>.  Bugfix: DNAs can now be <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/881">installed in parallel</a>.  Holochain now uses Lair 0.0.3, which stores entries in SQLite and encrypts them using a supplied passphrase. This is why conductor configs now require a passphrase service directive.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.103/CHANGELOG.md#20210817185301">Read the full changelog</a> for more details.</p> Two more releases coming soon! <p>Over the next two or three weeks, the core dev team will release Holochain v0.0.104 and v0.0.105. These changes are scheduled to include:</p>  DHT sharding (yay!)

Carsten Stöcker, co-founder and CEO at Spherity is to deliver a presentation on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4692/1" title="Identity Is the New Blue"> How an Entire Industry Adopts Digital Enterprise Identity </a>on Wednesday, September 15 starting at 3:30 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Carsten some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>How would you describe the current state of the digital identity sector? </p>
<p>
The current state is determined by industry players and governments that are realizing the importance of digital identity. It's a part of digital identity for interactions on the internet for digital transformations and for digitalization of public services. And this is not only happening here in Germany - the European Union, for example, is pushing very hard for the so-called EU digital identity wallet. There's a large movement in the government to put this in place to stay competitive. It's digitalization of our societies and industries, but it's also happening in the US and in Asia.  A lot of governments and enterprises have realized the importance and are now starting to adopt technology to push this into a field test to experiment with regulatory frameworks, to get these technologies into production.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why are secure digital identities so important in today's economy? </p>
<p>
Yeah, it's not just important. It's also mandatory. And if you look at the sheer numbers, so I, as a corporate, or as a government have terabytes and terabytes of data in my IT systems, but today I don't have any instruments to check the authenticity of the data. So who provided the data, which citizen, which customer, which IoT device, which business partner provides the data? I don't have any instruments. And I also don't have enough instruments to check the integrity of the data. And that's now changing with digital identity technology built upon public key infrastructure. I suddenly have some tools to check the authenticity, integrity, provenance of my data. I can trust my data even more and especially in use cases where I have to interact with a lot of previously unknown supply chain actors. So this is a must-have capability for the circular economy.   </p>
<p>Think about supplier onboarding. Can I trust if my supplier is real or fake? What credentials do they have are they compliant with environment, health and safety standards?  Do I trust the IoT device? I cannot answer these questions today, but with digital identity digital signatures, I get all the instruments to bring digitization to the next step. And, not only to improve the business policies, regulatory requirements, but also improve cybersecurity quite a bit. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Where are you experiencing the adoption of digital identities? What role do you specifically play?</p>
<p>
So we experienced most adoption in ecosystems that have a clear problem to be solved, especially when it's regulatory problems, regulatory requirements where I must do something, I must prove something, I must verify something, and we are experiencing a lot of adoption when there is a government push. Um, for example, in Europe, in Germany, governments want to keep up with digitization and have understood digital identities and their core capabilities. They really push hard to build entire ecosystems. And that's of fundamental importance because this technology is not just for one company, It's for entire ecosystems. It needs to be adopted by a lot of supply chain and value chain actors and ecosystem actors. And that's so crucial. So crucial role as a government to push hard, to get the entire ecosystems in place and even help out with some regulatory requirements and regulatory requirement amendments. And there we are experiencing the biggest adoption when it comes to early productive systems and productive field tests. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You will be speaking at EIC about how an entire industry adopts digital enterprise identity. Could you give us a sneak peek about your talk?  </p>
<p>
Yeah, sure. I will talk about the so-called the US drug supply chain security act, and there's one requirement that's the authorized trading partner requirement. What problem does it solve? It basically solves the problem that previously unknown supply chain actors, such as the manufacturer and the wholesalers they’ve never met before, but they would like to exchange data. Then the law says you must authorize and authenticate your supply chain partner, which means I, as a wholesaler, when I'm interacting with the manufacturer, I must check, is this the real manufacturer and ask the manufacturer if they have a state license to manufacture pharmaceutical products. I must check the state license. Today, that's a manual process. The process takes a long time and with digital identity and verifiable signatures - this can be fully digitized. In addition, what we also speak at EIC. So we talk about role of partnerships, strong partnerships to build an entire ecosystem and to drive full adoption of an entire industry domain, um, because only if the full adoption could be achieved, then this is a massively scalable technology. And yeah, interested in this use case, learn more at the EIC and join our talk. </p>

<p>Whatever your KYC needs are, AutoIdent has got you covered.</p>
 What is IDnow AutoIdent? 
<p>AutoIdent is IDnow’s AI-powered automated identity verification solution. Its automation offers an easy and convenient onboarding process without compromise to security.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent leverages modern AI and machine learning, trained on millions of data sets and backed by the expertise of a network of top identity and fraud specialists. The outcome is the best of both worlds, convenient and secure.</p>
 What makes IDnow AutoIdent so versatile? 
<p>What sets IDnow AutoIdent apart is its ability to adjust to your use case and regulatory needs. No matter how high your security requirements are — IDnow AutoIdent has got you covered. Multiple modules such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signatures</a> (QES) or Bank Transfer allow you to customize AutoIdent to your needs.</p>
<p>Because of this versatility, IDnow AutoIdent is one of the first identity verification solutions compliant with the German AML Act that operates as an automated process and meets high-security requirements.</p>
 Why are there different levels of security? 
<p>Not every country, industry, or use case has the exact security requirements for identity verification. Therefore, different use cases require different levels of security.</p>
<p>For example, verifying the validity of your driving license for your favorite mobility app requires less security than verifying your identity to open a bank account. The same applies when you need to verify your age on an online gambling website, compared to opening an account at the newest cryptocurrency exchange. Furthermore, when looking at geographical differences, opening a bank account in the UK is regulated less than in France or Germany.</p>
 From the UK FCA, over EU eIDAS to the German BaFin, AutoIdent covers it all. 
 UK post Brexit. 
<p>IDnow AutoIdent is also fully compliant with the UK AML regulation and the FCA post Brexit. As the UK recognizes automated remote identity verification solutions for opening bank accounts and other financial services, the standard version of IDnow AutoIdent is sufficient to meet the regulatory requirements.</p>
 European eIDAS. 
<p>Based on European eIDAS regulation, article 24(1)d, IDnow AutoIdent can be used to identify a person in combination with a QES (Qualified Electronic Signature), as long as the procedure is accepted at the national level. In conformity with eIDAS, IDnow AutoIdent is compliant for bank account opening in most European countries, such as France and Italy.</p>
<p>However, some markets, such as Germany, go beyond European standards and have unique country-specific regulatory requirements that require the combination of identity verification with a QES and bank transfer for GwG-compliance. We discuss this in further detail in the next section.</p>
 One of the first automated solutions to comply with the German GwG. 
<p>The German GwG regulation is often considered the holy grail of AML and KYC regulations and, therefore, a benchmark in the industry. IDnow, originating from Munich, sees the German market as its home turf and strives to be a leader in GwG compliant identity verification solutions.</p>
<p>To comply with the German GwG requirements, IDnow AutoIdent can be coupled with QES and Bank Transfer modules. In combination with these modules, IDnow provides a fully compliant remote onboarding solution in accordance with the German AML Act, the Geldwäschegesetz (GwG), under Section §12 sentence 1 No 3.</p>
<p>After starting the automated identity verification process, an extra level of assurance is initiated. By combining the security features of a Qualified Electronic Signature and an existing online bank account, AutoIdent complies with the German GwG requirements. This approach simplifies opening additional German bank accounts tremendously.</p>
  
 How do the different modules work? 
 QES (Qualified Electronic Signature). 
<p>A QES is not necessarily a signature in the traditional sense. You can better compare it to a digital security certificate that certifies the validity of a piece of information. According to the European eIDAS regulation, a QES can only be issued by a Trust Service Provider (TSP).</p>
<p>In the majority of cases, a QES is being used to sign contracts digitally. However, in the case of AutoIdent, we are using the QES to add another level of assurance and verify the identity.</p>
<p>Instead of signing a contractual document, a document with the identity information is signed. The good news is, IDnow AutoIdent, including QES, is certified by a conformity assessment body and is approved by an EU Member State National Regulator for issuing QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) according to eIDAS Regulation Article 24 (1) d).</p>
 Bank Transfer (as small as 1 Euro Cent). 
<p>At first sight, you might ask yourself, “How can a bank transfer improve my KYC process?”. However, the logic behind the process is straightforward.</p>
<p>The prerequisite is that somebody who has already opened a bank account in the same country or regulatory environment before, at the same time, has performed the required KYC and identity verification as well. Consequently, a reference transaction from a qualified bank account is considered a valid form of identity verification.</p>
<p>In practice, the process requires the customer to make a transfer, as small as one Euro Cent, which is being reimbursed, from their existing bank account to IDnow. This approach simplifies the process of opening additional bank accounts.</p>
 Use IDnow AutoIdent plus eSign to sign important contracts. 
<p>Depending on the customer’s needs, the onboarding process offers total flexibility, with the possible of additional components of the IDnow platform added, e.g., <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/esign/">eSign</a>. The add-on for the digital contract signing opens up additional use cases such as taking out a consumer loan. In that case, the QES is being used to sign a contractual document while also validating the identity verification and validating the identity verification.</p>
<p>Use IDnow AutoIdent plus eSign to offer your customers a convenient and secure way to sign important contracts. eSign can be used to sign loan agreements, insurance contracts, employment contracts, or any other form of agreement.</p>

  <p>Even if you’ve never heard of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant, formerly known as the Device Flow, you’ve probably seen it in action on a smart TV or other streaming device. The Device Authorization Grant is commonly used on devices with limited keyboard input ability. The process allows you to log in to an account more easily via a separate browser on your laptop, mobile phone, or other companion rich-input device.</p>

<p>For instance, if AtkoTV is launching a streaming service, its streaming Apple TV app might present you with something like the sign-in screen below. Instead of struggling to input anything on your TV, you’d log in on your laptop or mobile phone to complete the sign-in process.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Back in 2019, <a>Aaron Parecki</a> showed <a>how to support the OAuth 2.0 Device Grant</a>, but it required you to deploy a proxy. Fast forward a couple years, and today we’re happy to let you know that the Okta platform has officially introduced native Device Authorization, and it’s available now as an early access feature. This post will show you how to enable the Device Flow process in your Okta account, and how to use it in a real application.</p>

 The OAuth 2.0 Device Grant Interaction 

<p>The <a href="https://oauth.net/2/device-flow/">OAuth 2.0 specification</a> defines the Device Grant as  “an OAuth 2.0 extension that enables devices with no browser or limited input capability to obtain an access token.” The official <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628">RFC</a> describes the interaction in detail, as you can also see in the following flow diagram.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the code. In the command line, we can perform the first authorization step as follows:</p>

   <code>curl -X POST \
  --url https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/v1/device/authorize \
  --data 'client_id=0oa15wulqt5yqD9FP5d7&amp;scope=openid profile offline_access'
</code>   

<p>We will get back a response:</p>

   <code>{
  "device_code": "df1b060b-4e36-4bbe-98aa-5dcb11909f5f",
  "user_code": "DRTDNTJC",
  "verification_uri": "https://dev-133337.okta.com/activate",
  "verification_uri_complete": "https://dev-133337.okta.com/activate?user_code=DRTDNTJC",
  "expires_in": 600,
  "interval": 5
}
</code>   

<p>In the second step, to poll for the access token, we issue the following command:</p>

   <code>curl -X POST \
  --url https://dev-133337.com/oauth2/v1/token \
  --data 'device_code=df1b060b-4e36-4bbe-98aa-5dcb11909f5f&amp;grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code&amp;client_id=0oa15wulqt5yqD9FP5d7'
</code>   

<p>If the user has not logged in, the response looks like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "error": "authorization_pending",
  "error_description": "The device authorization is pending. Please try again later."
}
</code>   

<p>Otherwise, we’ll get a response back with the <code>access_token</code>, <code>refresh_token</code> and <code>id_token</code>.</p>

   <code>{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "....",
  "scope": "openid profile offline_access",
  "refresh_token": "....",
  "id_token": "...."
}
</code>   

 How to Enable the Device Grant in Okta 



<p>The Device Grant is an Early Availability feature on the Okta platform. First, you’ll need to enable the feature from your org dashboard. From the left navigation pane in the Admin Console, go to Settings -&gt; Features, locate the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant slider, and slide to enable.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Follow these steps to add a new app that supports the Device Grant.</p>

 
   
    <p>In Applications-&gt;Applications, click Create App Integration. In the pop-up, choose OIDC - OpenID Connect, then Native Application. The Device Grant is only available for Native Applications.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>In the next step, check Device Authorization in the Grant type section.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>If you want to use a custom Authorization Server, you also need to accept the grant type in the authorization server’s policy interface:</p>

     
       Go to Security-&gt;API 
       Select the authorization server you want to use (for example, default). 
       Click the Access Policies tab, and edit the rule for your policy.  Make sure to select the Device Authorization checkbox. 
     

    <p></p>
   
 

 How to Enable an SSH Server with Device Authorization 

<p>We’ve identified many use cases for the Device Authorization Grant beyond TV apps, as it can be used to authenticate a variety of devices. In this use case, we share an example of SSH login with the Device Authorization Grant on Okta.</p>

<p>When accessing servers, we typically use SSH. While SSH supports strong security, it has a couple of limitations:</p>

 
   SSH works well for a single user, but it’s harder to manage in an enterprise where multiple users log in to the same server. SSH stores the public key for each allowed user on the server, so the server must be able to update the keys when the permissions list changes (for example, when a new user is granted access). 
   Lack of two-factor authentication: SSH only supports password and private key authentication natively. Adding stronger user authentication, such as SMS verification, requires extra work. 
 

<p>The following example enables the Device Authorization Grant on an Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS server, but the instructions should work for any flavor of Linux server. The end-user login experience looks like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>On a Linux server, the SSH daemon uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) to enable an authentication extension. First, let’s edit the PAM configuration. In <code>/etc/pam.d/sshd</code>, we look for <code>@include common-auth</code>. Then we’ll comment it out to disable the normal authentication method, such as password or private key check. Then we’ll add a line of code directly below to enable Device Authorization.  <code>deviceflow.so</code> is the PAM module that follows.</p>

   <code># @include common-auth             # Disable password authentication
auth    required    deviceflow.so  # register custom authentication module
</code>   

<p>Next we’ll edit the <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file to make sure that challenge-response authentication is enabled, using PAM.  You’ll see a line starting with <code>ChallengeResponseAuthentication</code>. The default is <code>no</code>. Change this to <code>yes</code>:</p>

   <code>ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
</code>   

<p>Later on in the same file, make sure that “UsePAM” is set to yes (it is the default) as follows:</p>

   <code>UsePAM yes
</code>   

<p>Next we’ll develop the authentication module. To make sure the necessary libraries are installed, we run the following commands:</p>

   <code>apt-get update
apt-get install build-essential libpam0g-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libqrencode-dev libssl-dev
</code>   

<p>The full source code for the PAM module is available on <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-ssh-oauth-example">GitHub</a>. For a PAM module, we need to define two interfaces:</p>

   <code>PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_setcred( pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags, int argc, const char **argv)
PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_authenticate( pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags,int argc, const char **argv )
</code>   

<p>The second interface handles the authentication flow, which holds all our authentication logic. The code is self-explanatory, so we’ll only cover the high-level steps:</p>

 
   
    <p>First, plug in your org’s URLs in <code>deviceflow.c</code>. Change the URL based on your org name and whether you are using the org Authentication Server or a custom Authentication Server. Also, define the client ID for the Native App where you’ve enabled the Device Authorization grant type.</p>

       <code>#define DEVICE_AUTHORIZE_URL  "https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/v1/device/authorize"
#define TOKEN_URL "https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/v1/token"
#define CLIENT_ID "0oa15wulqt5yqD9FP5d7"
</code>       
   
   
    <p>We first issue a POST call to our <code>authorize</code> endpoint on the Authorization Server. From the POST result, we can extract the <code>device_code</code> and <code>user_code</code>. The POST call is abstracted away as a call to a helper function <code>issuePost</code>, which takes the URL as the first parameter and the POST data as the second parameter:</p>

       <code>sprintf(postData, "client_id=%s&amp;scope=openid profile offline_access", CLIENT_ID);
issuePost(DEVICE_AUTHORIZE_URL, postData);
</code>       

    <p>The helper function uses libcurl to send the POST request:</p>

       <code>void issuePost(char * url, char * data) {
   /* send all data to this callback function  */
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, WriteMemoryCallback);
   /* we pass our 'chunk' struct to the callback function */
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, (void *)&amp;chunk);
      
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url ) ;
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POST, 1);  /* this is a POST */
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, data);
   int res = curl_easy_perform( curl ) ;
}
</code>       

    <p>The <code>WriteMemoryCallback</code> function saves the callback results in a <code>chunk</code> buffer. Then, we use a helper function <code>getValueForKey</code> to extract the value fields for keys <code>user_code</code>, <code>device_code</code>, and <code>verification_uri_complete</code>.</p>
   
   
    <p>We then prompt the user to login to the activate endpoint. For a more pleasant user experience, we incorporate the URL inside a QRCode. We use the value field for <code>verification_uri_complete</code>, which includes <code>user_code</code> as part of the query parameters, so that a user does not have to type in the code manually. We leveraged the code from <a href="https://github.com/Y2Z/qr">Y2Z/qr</a> to generate ASCII output so that it will output properly in the command shell.</p>

       <code> char * qrc = getQR(activateUrl);
 sprintf(prompt_message, 
   "\n\nPlease login at %s or scan the QRCode below:\n\n%s", 
   activateUrl, qrc);
 free(qrc);
 sendPAMMessage(pamh, prompt_message);
</code>       

    <p>Since this is a PAM module, we cannot just print to screen directly. The <code>sendPAMMessage</code> helper function uses the PAM module’s interface function to send messages to the user:</p>

       <code>void
sendPAMMessage(pam_handle_t *pamh, char * prompt_message) {
   int retval;
      
   struct pam_message msg[1],*pmsg[1];
   struct pam_response *resp;
   struct pam_conv *conv ;
      
   pmsg[0] = &amp;msg[0] ;
   msg[0].msg_style = PAM_TEXT_INFO ; 
   msg[0].msg = prompt_message;
      
   resp = NULL ;
      
   retval = pam_get_item( pamh, PAM_CONV, (const void **) &amp;conv ) ;  
   if( retval==PAM_SUCCESS ) {
      retval = conv-&gt;conv( 1, (const struct pam_message **) pmsg, &amp;resp,  conv-&gt;appdata_ptr ) ; 
   }
   if( resp ) {
      free( resp );
   }
}
</code>       

    <p>In the above, we set the communication type to <code>PAM_TEXT_INFO</code> to indicate that we want to send a message to the user. In the <code>pam_get_item</code> call, we retrieve the PAM conversation module <code>conv</code>, and in the following line, we just invoke the <code>conv</code> module, which writes the message to the user console.</p>
   
   
    <p>We periodically issue a POST call to the token endpoint. If the POST result gives a token back, we return <code>PAM_SUCCESS</code> to allow the user to log in, or eventually, we return <code>PAM_AUTH_ERR</code> to signal authentication failure and deny user access.</p>

       <code>sprintf(postData, "device_code=%s&amp;grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code&amp;client_id=%s", devicecode, CLIENT_ID);

while (waitingForActivate) {
   issuePost(TOKEN_URL, postData);
   // ...
}
</code>       
   
   
    <p>The POST return includes various JWT tokens. From the <code>id_token</code>, we know exactly who logged in, and we optionally print a customized welcome message.</p>
   
 

<p>To compile all our code (<code>deviceflow.c</code> and <code>qr.c</code>), we run:</p>

   <code>gcc -fPIC -c deviceflow.c qr.c
sudo ld -x --shared -o /lib/security/deviceflow.so deviceflow.o qr.o \
        -lm -lqrencode -lcurl -lssl -lcrypto
</code>   

<p>The second command installs the compiled PAM module under <code>/lib/security</code>, which is where PAM looks for additional plugin modules.</p>

<p>Then we restart SSHD daemon to make sure the new PAM module is invoked:</p>

   <code>sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
</code>   

<p>In the repo, we’ve also included a <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-ssh-oauth-example/blob/master/Dockerfile"><code>Dockerfile</code></a>, so you’ll have a local Ubuntu container in which to try out the new SSH sign-in flow.</p>

 SSH Login in the Cloud with Okta 

<p>Although we’ve only added a couple hundred lines of C code, this fundamental change in SSH login using the Device Grant empowers you to do more with Okta.</p>

 
   Move your SSH management to the cloud, and avoid the hassle of local management. With this new feature, there’s no need to manage SSH passwords or public keys locally. 
   You now have the full power of Okta at your disposal! Leverage Okta policies, enable multi-factor authentication, add sign-on policies and multiple IdPs (Identity Providers). 
 

 Other Uses for the Device Authorization Grant 

<p>In this post, we’ve demonstrated how to implement the Device Grant for SSH login. Using the information returned from the tokens—including the user’s profile information contained in the ID token—we can go even further. We can easily create a separate Linux account in the PAM module and set up the permissions correctly, so a user can sign in to their individual account. You may be trying to connect to a root account via <code>ssh root@server.com</code>. Instead, the PAM module can log you in as <code>user@server.com</code>—a less privileged account—by learning who you are from the ID token.</p>

<p>Token-based permissions give you finer granularity in access control. For example, it’s easy to implement time-limited access control. The access token can be set up to expire within a given time span. If the time limit for access is exceeded, the access token renewal will fail, and the server can revoke permission right away. In addition to enabling time-limited access, you can also customize scopes and claims to further fine-tune the access model.</p>

<p>While this app demonstrates how to enable SSH login, we believe there are many other applications for the Device Flow. We’re eager to hear from you with feature requests and new use cases. Let us know what applications are on your mind. You can share ideas and feedback by leaving a comment here.

<p>Since we’ve been learning a lot from the Close-up Magic meetups, we’ve decided to start writing a recap at the end of every event. We hope that these recaps will help you in your career development. Enjoy!</p><p>For our latest Close-up Magic meetup, we welcomed <a href="https://twitter.com/praveenweb">Praveen Durairaju</a>, Senior Developer Advocate at <a href="https://hasura.io/">Hasura</a> to talk&nbsp;about:</p>  The early days of&nbsp;Hasura  What it’s like to build a backend from scratch vs. with&nbsp;Hasura  His journey from Software Engineering to Developer Advocacy  <p>Here are a few of our favorite takeaways.</p> Key Takeaways  Developer feedback is key to success&nbsp;🔑 <p>The road to Hasura was one that was filled with many paths. Hasura initially tried to solve multiple problems for developers, such as the need for better DevOps tooling, and also the need for a faster way to build apps with a data&nbsp;layer.</p><p>By collecting feedback, Hasura was able to find that data access was the biggest pain point developers faced. With this golden insight, the company pivoted to what is now known as Hasura, a Jamstack tool used and loved by large enterprises and exciting startups such as Philips Healthcare and&nbsp;Netlify.</p> Choose Hasura for a backend in minutes, rather than days&nbsp;👏 <p>There are a lot of moving parts involved when setting up a GraphQL-powered app from scratch. You have to set up a GraphQL server that describes your data, a client that specifies how you ask for the data, and then you need to connect the GraphQL server with a database you’ve&nbsp;built.</p><p>For those who are new to backend development, the thought process involved in optimizing data fetching, handling errors and caching with GraphQL becomes slightly more complicated than when using the well-known alternative, Rest API. This is because you’re pretty much reinventing the wheel of Rest API with&nbsp;GraphQL.</p><p>If you don’t have the time to dig into the GraphQL or your chosen database’s documentation, try Hasura. Like us, your mind will be blown away by just how easy Hasura makes it for us to build a backend with a readily available API.</p> Developer Advocacy is all about Developer empathy&nbsp;❤️ <p>Praveen’s journey from Engineering to Developer Advocacy felt inevitable.</p><p>As an early engineer at Hasura, he started helping developers solve a few of the pain points they faced with their tool. Pretty soon, he was helping improve Hasura’s docs and writing content to support developers in their integration phase.</p><blockquote>“I believe in the product and love using the product as well. So there’s a natural progression that happened where I was helping out devs with documentation, finding out their pain points on using the product. And I think that’s where I started writing content, some documentation, some guides and tutorials to fix their pain&nbsp;points.”</blockquote><p>Praveen thoroughly enjoyed doing all of this because he was passionate about using Hasura, and he couldn’t help but to evangelize the product to other developers.</p><p>As it turns out, these are the ingredients needed to become a Developer Advocate. You have to be sold on the value of the product. You have to be able to get into the shoes of a developer and understand their pain points. And you have to be passionate about solving their pain points in any way possible, whether that be answering their questions, improving the documentation or creating tutorials, or communicating the feedback internally.</p> Q&amp;A Session <p>At the end of the talk, we received a great question from one of our listeners.</p><blockquote>“What were some of the most challenging things about the development process of building Hasura from the beginning?”</blockquote><p>Curious to know Praveen’s answer? Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8J4tkwbtCk&amp;t=100s">this recording</a> of the fireside&nbsp;chat!</p> Interested in Close-up&nbsp;Magic? <p>If you ever want to be a special guest for Close-up Magic and talk about a tech you’re passionate about, schedule a chat with Maricris <a href="https://calendly.com/magic-maricris/15min-1">here</a>.

			 José Navalon is Full Stack Developer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Jose Navalon, I currently live with my wife and my son in Geldrop, a little town in the Netherlands. I was born and raised in Valencia, a sunny city on the east coast of Spain. I graduated as an engineer (ing/MSc) from the Polytechnical University of Valencia.</p>
<p>During my professional career, I have developed software solutions for both big companies and startups. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, cooking, reading books and of course spending time with my family and friends.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>After I finished a big project for my previous company, I was looking for a permanent remote position and I got an offer from Tokeny. After interviewing with some team members, I was impressed by the work being done in Tokeny. Tokeny is up to speed with the latest technologies and always works with the leading technologies of the moment. Also, Tokeny’s product vision on blockchain is sure to be a success. So it was clear for me to join Tokeny 🙂</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>All people are really skilled and it is a pleasure working with them. Tokeny gives us full freedom at work, in my case I’m working remotely not only due to the Covid. The honesty and transparency of each member of the team makes you really integrated in the company.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I like traveling a lot with my family and friends. Knowing new places, new cultures, new food, other ways of life…</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I have many, but the most important one is “Mankind beats the Corona”, of course we can make it, be optimistic! xD</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Too many things to be changed 😀 but for example I’d love to see all people, not only nations, working together to solve global problems such as poverty, child education, global warming, ….</p>

<p>IBT: International Business Times is exploring whether the existing NFT platforms are offering a suitable and easy environment for the creation, storage, trading, and auctioning of NFTs, and some NFT projects as well. One of these projects is&nbsp;Mythical Beings&nbsp;- Ardor and Ignis blockchain-based card collection game created by Tarasca Art &amp; Games. The article further explains that Mythical Beings' users can collect cards, buy and trade them, and even earn cryptocurrency while they’re at it - all facilitated by the easy-to-use built-in Ignis features.</p>

<p>CoinPost: The article highlights the key aspects of NFT Magic, the clean, affordable, and complete NFT marketplace on Ardor blockchain. Anyone can publish a wide variety of digital productions, buy and sell NFTs with very low fees, and rely on a secure environment thanks to the SIGBRO app integration. SIGBRO functions as a crypto wallet and secure digital ID authentication to upload and trade NFTs on NFTMagic, or for other services on the Ardor platform. In addition, several Ardor-based NFT-related products and games are in advanced stages, as Bridge Champ, Mythical Beings, and Triffic, which will launch soon GeoMorfs, the revenue-generating NFTs.</p>

And maybe other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk">existential risks</a> like&nbsp;AI.</p><p>We have far too many smart people working together to be shooting for smaller goals than this. We want our work to <a href="https://noahraford.com/wp/2014/08/04/silicon-howl/">matter</a> and nothing smaller than this counts because if we fail on the existential risk stuff it is not going to matter how much volume went through our decentralized exchanges or what our NFT collection was&nbsp;worth.</p><p>The World Computer should be used to do some computation which reduces our chance of extinction or breaking the ecosystem.</p><p>Preferably the world computer should be part of a global effort to reduce the earth’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_the_Study_of_Existential_Risk">existential</a> risk to zero. It’s a long road to get there. Can we do an ICO for long range sky scanning to stop asteroids hitting earth? I don’t&nbsp;know.</p><p>But what I do know is that the World Computer is well positioned to be used to do computation which directly cuts our existential risks by crushing climate&nbsp;change.</p> Carbon Footprint Calculations <p>Right here, right now: what is your carbon footprint?</p><p>Your answer, I guarantee, is “I don’t&nbsp;know.”</p><p>You can get an approximation from a <a href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx">carbon footprint calculator</a>, but it’s just an approximation. The well-meaning among us buy these offsets once a year to cover at least some of our damage. But until these systems are precise they cannot be automated. Imprecision means there is always a manual&nbsp;step!</p><p>When we know exactly what our footprint is, we can easily say “buy offsets for my footprint.” But when it is all approximate there is always a sense that we are making a decision to accept the imprecision, to roll the dice on the estimate. You have to look and think “does that seem about right?” and the whole system grinds to a halt on that decision.</p><p>Having to calculate our own CO2 footprint and accepting that the result is just a guess produces enough friction in the process that very few people in practice do CO2 offsetting. Even relatively well off green activists don’t do it, even though the cost is typically a hundred dollars a year or&nbsp;less.</p><p>Automated, we might all offset our emissions. It might even become mandatory, the cost of staying alive, the most basic act of personal self-responsibility. Because we have systems like zk-SNARKs on top of ERC20s, we could imagine a future with a mandatory CO2 tax. In that potential future everybody has to offset 100% of their CO2 consumption. But their privacy is protected. The system knows how much CO2 they have to offset, but without ever revealing the lifestyle choices which led to generation of that CO2 footprint.</p><p>We could get more privacy and a safer&nbsp;world.</p><p>That seems like a fitting job for a World Computer: to run the global carbon accounting system which makes sure that trillions of dollars a year are spent planting trees and rewilding or grinding up olivine mountains to make sure that the earth does not dry out, burn up, and blow&nbsp;away.</p><p>So let’s put that right into the Ethereum Theory of Change right now. The world computer will run the global carbon accounting system. That’s our ambition. That is one way we’re going to change the&nbsp;world.</p> Reducing waste in the global economy to&nbsp;zero <p>Another grand challenge is global resource overconsumption. It is easiest to see when we think of <a href="https://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/deforestation-facts-and-statistics">deforestation</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/deforestation-facts-and-statistics">Deforestation Facts and Statistics</a></p><p>We are simply using too much wood and land. The forests are getting cut down for other purposes.</p><p>But a third of the food grown is <a href="https://earth.org/facts-about-food-waste/">wasted</a>. If we could not waste that food there would be more than enough land for the forests to be left in peace. Rewilding at scale requires food efficiency.</p><p>The food chain has an enormous number of links. There are tens of thousands of significant actors. Gigantic companies and tiny farms. Huge franchises and one-cook restaurants. It all combines to make the food system. There is simply no way to get a system in place to manage all of this on any database technology other than the World Computer. Every corporation involved will want to keep its private data in a silo. They will want to hide evidence of their own waste, particularly in areas where waste equals profit. To keep people honest, we need to get an overview of how the food is produced, where it is stored, and how it is consumed. Over time we can tighten up the waste in that system and enormously reduce the pressure we place on the land. We need to break open the silos to understand the performance of the system as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>The World Computer. Nothing else is going to do this. Yes, it envisages a World Computer with nearly infinite computing power but that is coming. Computers continue to get faster every year. The underlying algorithms that power Ethereum get more refined every year. L2 solutions which bind to quantum supercompuers can’t be that far away. This thing can actually&nbsp;work.</p><p>And of course it’s not just food. Empty houses in countries filled with homeless people. Systemic structural inefficiencies exist in every supply chain. The world is both cold, starving and homeless at one end, and packed with empty five bedroom houses and untouched boxes of cold pizza at the other. I am not suggesting that we pack the homeless into those five bedroom houses. Rather I am suggesting that if everybody moves up a little we make plenty of room for everybody. Efficient markets should provide for everybody.</p><p>But the efficient market cannot be efficient enough on the existing technical, social and legal infrastructure. The world computer opens up the possibility of genuinely efficient markets in truly dramatic&nbsp;ways.</p> Circular Economy <p>Every manufactured thing in the world eventually winds up in landfills or as scrap, with a few exceptions. Some of the scrap is recycled and turned into new products, but some of it just sits and rots until it <a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/viewers-horrified-over-viral-video-of-thick-black-smoke-100415035.html">catches&nbsp;fire</a>.</p><p><a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/viewers-horrified-over-viral-video-of-thick-black-smoke-100415035.html">Sinister story behind thick black smoke seen from space</a></p><p>In almost no case is the true cost of disposing of things calculated. So much recycling just winds up as landfill or dumped in some poor <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-12/fast-fashion-turning-parts-ghana-into-toxic-landfill/100358702">country</a>&nbsp;too.</p><p>Similarly, when an old camera or an old phone breaks and cannot be repaired because it was designed not to be fixable, both its owner and the world get a little poorer. The global capital base is depleted every time a poorly designed thing breaks and enters the waste stream. All these individual leaks seem small but together they constitute a flood of wasted life. The time and energy of the person who made the thing are wasted when it breaks. Then we must count the cost of a replacement. What of all the natural resources burned to make a thing? All of that is lost when a thing breaks in a way that cannot be repaired. Almost every single one of my old phones and laptops could have been resold to somebody else if it had been designed to be <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/most-repairable-apple-products">repairable</a>.</p><p>In a world this resource constrained we cannot afford that kind of&nbsp;waste.</p><p>Imagine that all manufactured goods have digital twins on the blockchain. As the assets change hands and experience wear and tear every repair is logged. Soon we can see what is repairable and resellable, what can be patched and mended, and what is just dead-loss scrap. If every single thing we buy has a unique ID and a permanent place to store its records, things will change. Manufactured goods cannot fail to improve in every way when exposed to the harsh light of transparency. Nobody wants to buy junk. A property rights transfer is as simple as having a neutral third party check that the item matches the blockchain record of the object, and an NFT is transferred to move the legal ownership.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> has built this. Gold <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/ntfa">bullion</a>, <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">art</a> and <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/third-millennia-collection-1">collectibles</a> to start, but pretty soon we will present prototypes for real estate transactions and consumer goods. I believe this is the unstoppable adoption-driving blockchain use case everybody has been searching for: a better way to buy physical things than anything Web2 has offered. <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/engineering-consumption-ac3bd74b1a21">Read more about this approach to managing our environmental footprint in the Mattereum Manifesto.</a></p>The Investment, Consumption, Production, Waste&nbsp;cycle. Mattereum embodies this theory of&nbsp;change <p>My company Mattereum deeply reflects this theory of change: we are (in the long run) a carbon accounting and radical resource efficiency company. I built the company to implement a theory of change I believed in: the World Computer cleans up the global economy. Computation on the global computer allows us to slash our carbon footprints.</p><p>Mattereum also <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/07/07/mattereum-sells-350000-year-old-hand-axe-a-dali-and-tibetan-buddhist-statue-as-real-world-asset-nfts/">sells</a> half a million year old stone hand axes as NFTs. We believe that art and antiquities, luxuries and collectibles, are excellent initial markets for Mattereum. While the world wakes up to the carbon challenge, we still need to develop the technology. There are many excellent here-and-now use for a system which binds objects to multi-faceted statements of truth about the objects. Very soon, blockchain scaling solutions will enable Mattereum to add trade in clothing, laptops, and eventually all manufactured objects. Real estate is an amazing use case too, and we expect prototyping in late Q4&nbsp;2021.</p><p><a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">Here are some of the first physical artworks we are selling on&nbsp;OpenSea.</a></p><p>There’s also a lovely collection of <a href="https://ntfa.io/">Never Touch Fiat Again</a> gold bars here.

This is a perfect example of the modular and composable nature of services in the Ethereum defi ecosystem: <a href="https://lohkowallet.com">Lohko</a> handles the gold, NTFA handle the art, Mattereum handles the proofs and provenance, UNN provides additional risk handling, and an as-yet-unnamed lender will soon be lending money against these gold bullion&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Of course, we would not be doing this if there were not some more fundamental purpose: every gold bar sold in this system has CO2 offsets purchased from <a href="https://nori.com/">Nori</a>, offsetting not only the CO2 burned by Ethereum mining on the NFTs, but also the CO2 emitted by the original mining of the gold&nbsp;itself.</p><p>We started with gold in vaults because it is one of the highest value and best controlled global supply chains: a good fit for management by NFTs and smart contracts. Fine art is a close second, although it is much harder to prove art fraud than gold fraud. High end liquor is another great area, because so much of the product is stored in high security warehouses. As we get more of these key assets into the system, it will become clear to more people how totally revolutionary this application of the World Computer really&nbsp;is.</p> What is Ethereum’s Theory of&nbsp;Change? <p>Ethereum’s theory of change is comprised of the theories of change of every person working with Ethereum.</p><p>I feel like I’ve made a good case for the potential to use Ethereum tokenization of CO2 and offsets, and as an instrument for the eradication of waste in areas like consumer electronics.</p><p>What are the other areas we could use Ethereum to transform?</p><p>For example, is DeFi the key to accelerating solar and wind energy installations? Funding vaccine research? Could we get that deep sky scan done? Fund space missions?</p><p>What is your vision of Ethereum’s theory of change? What are the elements of global transformation that you feel the World Computer genuinely enables?</p><p>I mean the stuff that matters. Save the world with the World Computer.</p> An economy with a&nbsp;future <p>Things change in fundamental ways <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State">when they have names</a> (or other unique identifiers). ISBN numbers empower libraries. ISIN numbers enable the global financial architecture to function. Namespaces rule everything.</p><p>An Ethereum contract address can map on to any underlying data structure you like. If you use IPFS the immutable data it connects to can be of arbitrary size. A single namespace for all objects and assets is possible. You just need the data structures to represent what is vital about the&nbsp;object.</p><p>Just imagine that for a moment. An Ethereum address attached to every physical thing, and every asset, you own. Orthogonal legal operators for sale, rental, escrow, use as collateral on a loan, or fractionalization and equity release. Those legal operators are based on Ricardian contracts, so they look like legal contracts to a court. But to a smart contract, they look like another smart contract: a digital/legal bridge that creates property rights. Mattereum calls this the Smart Property Register. For anything you own. And everything that everybody else owns&nbsp;too.</p><p>Everything carbon calculated, and fully offset. There would be trillions of dollars a year of offsets going into planting forests and restoring wetlands and everything else. It might be ten years before we have built a blockchain that can handle that kind of data load, but I guarantee you, it is&nbsp;coming.</p><p>In that world a huge number of humanity’s fundamental problems just evaporate.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/evangineer">Mamading Ceesay</a> coined the term “Economies of Omniscience” to describe the total economic transformation that such a world will bring. No more delays, no more things that don’t fit in the back of the truck so there have to be two runs. A computer figures that stuff out, because it has the data to figure it out. If a thing was made using CADCAM then the original digital models ought to be available on chain. Read the barcode or scan the NFC, download the CAD files, pass it to a piece of software which knows how to pack stuff in trucks: “yes it will all fit” and it does. These are the “economies of agility” which are enabled by actually being able to use computers to work with the material world properly. Better still, since the discovery of zkSNARKs and other zero knowledge methods, we can create “blind omniscience” where the coordination systems run perfectly but without any actor being able to see more than their part of the system. In short, the advantages of central planning, without a central planner. A privacy preserving panopticon. Technology now enables us to scale this paradoxical tower.</p><p>Now imagine this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gntV6AePOM">operational</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spime">paradigm</a> applied across everything: when you fly, you borrow everything you need when you land. It’s all waiting for you at the airport. When you move house anything which it is cheaper to sell and rebuy on the other end is waiting for you when you arrive. When you need tools for a job they come from your neighbours. It all starts with being able to identify physical property, clearly record its condition, and bind it to legal frameworks that enable it to transact.</p><p>Then we apply this to the industrial economy: no more shortfalls or warehouses of feedstocks which won’t be used for months. All the advantages of Just In Time, but coupled to the capability to buy and sell components directly to other companies, or your suppliers. Immediate configuration of capability by pre-designing systems using computers, and then provisioning the purchasing for all the necessary items using smart contracts. Option everything you need to buy, then when you have options on everything and you know it will all work if everybody does their jobs, execute the options. It’s a revolution like Just-In-Time manufacturing, but across all organizations rather than simply down a single supply chain: a Just-In-Time industrial web.</p><p>Then property can be fully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_utilization_theory">utilized</a> at all times, and we can create years of economic growth just from increases in fundamental process efficiency without increasing our ecological footprint at all! We are rearranging physical things and their legal property using software. We do this to optimise their utility and their disposition. Optimization and simulation pave the way to globally efficient logistical solutions.</p><p>We can use the World Computer to teach matter to dance. And a dancing world might be able to feed all of us because perfect coordination frees up vast resources.</p><p>It is a moral imperative that the Ethereum community starts to get serious about climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>My work with Mattereum is a culmination of decades spent thinking on how to manage scarce resources on the planet such that people’s basic necessities of living are secured, even in the worst of situations.</p><p>I’ve distilled some core insights on the technological and social transformation of material culture in a little book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Stuff-Vinay-Gupta-ebook/dp/B08B4F5QK3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+future+of+stuff&amp;qid=1629340329&amp;sr=8-1">The Future of Stuff</a>, in which I explore how things came to be and how we can build a better path forward where humanity can live in equilibrium with the&nbsp;planet.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Stuff-Vinay-Gupta-ebook/dp/B08B4F5QK3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+future+of+stuff&amp;qid=1629340329&amp;sr=8-1">The Future of Stuff</a></p><p>If long-reads aren’t your preferred media, our company podcast extends this discussion to other builders and thinkers who are shaping material culture across a range of industries.</p><p><a href="https://podcast.mattereum.com/">The Future of Stuff</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">Can the World Computer Save the World?

<p>Technological and social movements start in minds and manifest in the world. Crypto is no different. What is our view of the world we seek to change, and how do we change&nbsp;it?</p><p>This 3-part series presents a guiding narrative and vision for the blockchain industry fit for the current and oncoming conditions of the&nbsp;world.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-1-wicked-problems-a186c4860bc3">Wicked Problems</a>  World Models &amp; Theories of&nbsp;Change  <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">Building an Economy with a&nbsp;Future</a>  <p>Let’s get to&nbsp;work.</p> What is a theory of&nbsp;change? <p>Right now we have no idea how we are going to get out of this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/aug/09/humans-have-caused-unprecedented-and-irreversible-change-to-climate-scientists-warn">mess</a>.</p><p>Here are some ideas about how we are going to change the world which intelligent people from different subcultures will try and sell you. Each one encompasses a <a href="https://knowhow.ncvo.org.uk/how-to/how-to-build-a-theory-of-change">theory of&nbsp;change</a>.</p>  The problem is governments. Bitcoin will destroy governments.  Solar panels, wind farms, batteries and so on will get so cheap we will entirely stop using coal, oil and gas, and the planet will&nbsp;heal.  We can grind up mountains made of <a href="https://www.projectvesta.org/science#Introduction">olivine</a> into new beaches, which will soak up CO2 faster than humans are pumping it out, at a fairly affordable cost.  The problem is <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/The_Invisibles_Vol_1_3">cities</a>. If people would just go back to human-scaled settlements with deeper personal interconnectedness, we would stop over-consuming physical things to meet our unmet emotional needs. Society needs&nbsp;therapy.  The problem is giant squid from beyond time have invaded the human group mind and are making us drive ourselves to extinction by pretending to be our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJdJEEZvhsA">gods</a>. The magician-artist Alan Moore figured it out and killed them during the process of producing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6eJkZJ1opo">Watchmen</a>, and freed from their awful influence humans will make better decisions. The world is slowly&nbsp;healing.  The planet is <a href="https://www.sapiens.org/culture/gaia-hypothesis-covid-19/">conscious</a> and will defend itself from human overpopulation by sending a&nbsp;plague.  The problem is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism">capitalism</a>. We can reorganize global society along eco-socialist lines and there will be enough for everybody’s needs, but nobody’s&nbsp;greed.  The problem is trauma. Widespread use of MDMA-assisted <a href="https://maps.org/research/mdma">psychotherapy</a> will create saner humans on average, and these saner humans will start living&nbsp;right.  The Pentagon’s <a href="https://astronomy.com/news/2021/07/pentagon-ufo-report-no-confirmed-aliens-but-the-government-wants-to-learn-more">UFO</a> reports make it very clear that our understanding of the laws of physics as we understand them are incomplete. Either the beings operating these devices, or our physicists who learn from observing them, will use these newly discovered laws of physics to save&nbsp;us.  <p>Now clearly nobody could believe in all of these possible futures at the same time. You’d be mad. Not only do they contradict each other,&nbsp;they..</p>  Contradict the laws of&nbsp;physics  Contradict all possible models of history and human&nbsp;nature  Contradict… in fact there are an almost infinite list of things that other people’s models of the future can contradict.  <p>But apart from the one idea I put on that list to test people, intelligent people can hold and argue any one of those&nbsp;beliefs.</p><p>Can you pick which one is the stupid&nbsp;one?</p> World Models <p>In fact, what models of the future we take seriously are tightly tied to two things. These two implicit pieces of mental furniture are profoundly important in understanding why we as humans find it so difficult to agree on how to save each-others’ lives, which is what the world demands of us&nbsp;now.</p><p>The first piece of mental furniture is our world model: what we believe to be the facts of the situation. No human mind can contain the entire global situation. Our world model is inevitably partial and incomplete. It takes us time to ingest information. Our lifespans are not infinitely long. The sheer volume of a field like chemical engineering could take 12 lifespans to master. Or&nbsp;120.</p><p>So the world model system in our minds contains some sub-functions:</p>  A curiosity metric for estimating what information is worth fitting into our world model — what do we choose to learn&nbsp;about?  An existing set of facts that we consider to be true — the world model&nbsp;itself  A mechanism for discarding facts which are no longer thought to be true: the deletion&nbsp;rules  A model of who’s facts we will trust, which forms a trust&nbsp;graph  A detail filter which throws away things like precisely which elements go into making solar panels, now that the Indium Crisis is not thought to be a factor in production  A social harmonizer which tries to make sure that our world model is close enough to that of our tribe (including family, close friends, employers, or even the voting public) to keep our world model from becoming a survival liability  <p>It’s clear in the era of covid misinformation that even relatively small points of scientific knowledge (“are vaccines safe?” “do cloth masks work?” “do FFP3 masks <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1663">work</a>?”) result in dramatically different management of this deadly disease — and even the fact that covid is deadly is hotly debated in some&nbsp;circles.</p><p>It is unsurprising that in an age of infinite information choices, it has become extremely rare to meet two educated people who believe the same things about the world. Our world models have become distant from each other and fractured, because the curiosity metric is empowered by Google to find out anything.</p><p>Even if we stay in the domain of solid academic publications, where you focus results in completely different models of the&nbsp;future.</p> Theories of&nbsp;Change <p>The second piece of mental furniture is our theory of change. Not everybody has a theory of change. Many people share a few basic (and wrong) theories of change based on&nbsp;history.</p><p>Typical working folk are not consciously trying to change the world, for the most part. They’re trying to provide for their kids, their parents, and their own old age. This can turn into “who dies with the most toys wins” but for the most part people are spending on schools and elder-care. The yachts are few, but the prep schools are&nbsp;many.</p><p>The big formulaic theories of change, mostly rooted in historical analysis, are given names like Marxism or Socialism or Capitalism. Each one of these political movements, and all the others like them, contain a historical analysis and a proposed set of actions. In other words, a world model and then a theory of change that operates on that world&nbsp;model.</p><p>However, as people are increasingly self-educating on the internet our world models have become increasingly diverse and disassociated. It becomes harder and harder to synchronize world models with the people around us to participate in collective action. If our general world models do not match up, it is even less likely that our theories of change will match. Another way of saying this: if we cannot agree on the past and the present, it is unlikely we will agree on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoAyizBrk0M&amp;t=22s">future</a>.</p><p>Ethereum does not have a particularly strong theory of change. It starts as a direct evolution of bitcoin: “bitcoin <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html">plus</a> smart contracts.” A simple sense of “this is the next step” technologically is enough to get that started. Afterwards the lack of political consensus between the early founders of the Ethereum project resulted in a sort of forced Swiss neutrality. The exchange of fire about whether Ethereum should be a corporation left enough political fallout that the question of where Ethereum was on the political landscape has gone generally unanswered. <a href="http://radicalmarkets.com/">Radical Markets</a> is probably the political brand most closely associated with Ethereum. But even that has taken a back seat to the rainbow unicorns and various animal-themed token projects. We have here a technology without an ideology.</p><p>Unfortunately the world is still on&nbsp;fire.</p> Proposing an explicit theory of change for&nbsp;Ethereum  Should Ethereum even have a theory of&nbsp;change? <p>Is it possible for the Ethereum community to share a theory of change, given how culturally diverse the community is? The DeFi people and the NFT people, for example, barely&nbsp;touch.</p><p>You could frame this as “the internet does not have a theory of change, so why should Ethereum?” But actually the internet does have a theory of change: “a little bit of everything, all of the&nbsp;time.”</p><p>Omniversal access to information! The internet superhighway. Freedom to&nbsp;know!</p><p>However you frame it, this is the internet’s theory of change — individuals using the internet all embrace this model, at least a little bit, by virtue of their actions. It may be implicit, but that theory of change is universal: somehow, hollering at strangers on the other side of the world using social media will fix things.&nbsp;Somehow.</p><p>So at the very least there are a handful of universals in the Ethereum theory of change, the implicit factors. The basic structures in the world model&nbsp;include:</p>  Not your keys, not your&nbsp;crypto  Anyone can create a smart&nbsp;contract  Radical inclusion through open access to infrastructure  Anonymity and pseudonyms are absolutely recommended  Ethereum runs everywhere in the&nbsp;world  <p>Usually the whole theory of change is summarized as “decentralization”. There’s an idea of tearing down monopolies and dispensing with middle men, kind of freeing up markets to Do The Right Thing freed from exploitation because perfect competition gets rid of rentiers.</p><p>And that’s about as close to a theory of change — a coherent story about how we are going to save the world — as Ethereum gets these&nbsp;days.</p><p>I am very clear that “decentralization” needs a lot of unpacking and context to be a valid way of looking at what the blockchain does. Permissionless also needs serious unpacking in a situation where (for example) exchanges decide which tokens to list. A lot of sketchy projects slip by because we do not get down to the details of who actually makes the decision. Decentralized can often mean oligarchical because one token means one vote, for example. Permissionless usually fares a little better, but then how do people know who to trust or who is being scammed by who? It is not like we have universally adopted Ethereum-wide public key infrastructure and identity infrastructure for projects.</p><p>Also note how much this theory of change shares with bitcoin’s theories of change. Now that EIP 1559 has firmly placed Ethereum on the deflationary path there is no doubt that a lot of the bitcoin-style reasoning about Ether as money will start to converge.</p><p>So in this sense, many of the parts of this theory of change do not belong uniquely to Ethereum. The basic structures of this world model are heavily overlapped with cryptocurrency in general, rather than applying specifically to smart contracts or the whole world computer&nbsp;context.</p><p>Something as revolutionary as Ethereum should have a more clearly articulated theory of change, I think — and not one, but several! Ethereum’s theories of change may be plural, but we would be making a lot more impact if they were clear and explicit: how are we going to help save the&nbsp;world?</p> Who am I to propose&nbsp;this? <p>I came into the Ethereum project in 2014. I decided to quit my job in military academia because it was impossible to change the world from that position in the ways that I wanted to. I wanted to retool the world’s militaries for climate change operations through civilian-military cooperation on disaster relief. It was a dead&nbsp;end.</p><p>Then I heard a story about a team working on a bitcoin-like smart contract system, and recognized that it was going to change the world. I chose to dedicate my life to making it&nbsp;work.</p><p>I was already well experienced with digital currency, having been a full send user of e-gold in the late 1990s. I knew my way around ERIGHTS and ESPEAK, capability based operating systems and all the rest: I had, after all, been a crypto activist in the 1990s when crypto meant “encrypted communications” not “digital currencies.” My background in distributed systems went back into the 1980s (!). I had a choice between the Ethereum technical track in Berlin, or the Ethereum Communications track in London and I chose to stay put rather than move. Comms needed help, and I’d done quite a bit of work for charities doing communications. I wound up as <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/">the release coordinator for the Ethereum launch</a>. Critically, I was managing community expectations about what would be released and when. It’s all ancient history now but for a while I was one of the public faces of the entire&nbsp;project!</p><p><a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/">The Ethereum Launch Process</a></p><p>I’m telling you this now so you understand that I was deeply grounded in the Ethereum project, but in no way foundational to it. I’m often confused as being one of the original Gang of 8, but I was something like employee&nbsp;30.</p><p>The Gupta World Model<br>A word about <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-2-world-models-theories-of-change-cd8aecfd53de">my world model</a>, since world models are what we’re talking about. I’d spent most of my time since 9/11 working on climate change, poverty, natural disaster, and plagues in the think tank world, military academia, and charities. It had been an extremely hardcore 12 years, and I was burned out, bitter, and filled with experience of bureaucracy, corruption in power hierarchies, and the disastrous nature of governance and government. It was, in short,&nbsp;bleak.</p><p>So I viewed Ethereum as a chance to hang up my “end of the world” hat. I got to work with the direct challenges of getting the world the smart contract platform it so desperately needed. I was part of a fabulously talented team of legends. It was a big turn in my&nbsp;life.</p><p>One of the phrases I’d picked up during my time in military academia was “unity of action without unity of command.” I picked it up from Lin Wells (famous for the Wells Memo on <a href="https://library.rumsfeld.com/doclib/sp/2382/2001-04-12%20To%20George%20W%20Bush%20et%20al%20re%20Predicting%20the%20Future.pdf">predicting the future</a> among other things.) This was, to me, the goal of Ethereum: to coordinate the world so we could increase efficiency, reduce waste, and take care of all of humanity’s concerns more effectively.</p><p>Some people heard “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXvs">World Computer</a>” as “a computer that spans the world” but I heard world computer as “a computer that heals the world.” I had a very clear sense of what I wanted from this thing: I wanted a system which could out-perform current models of capitalism (intensely wasteful and wrongfully productive) without requiring political turmoil to adopt. I wanted an evolution in the culture and the machinery of the market, to produce a world with carbon accounting and an end to world hunger because crops no longer rotted in the&nbsp;fields.</p><p>I had not worked out the details, but that’s where I thought the project was&nbsp;going.</p><p>Where do we go from&nbsp;here?</p><p>Part 3:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">Can the World Computer Save the World?

Unlike most of the people in the space I have never owned or held a significant amount of bitcoin: a series of defense jobs made me uncomfortable with the idea of having poorly-understood cryptographic software running on my laptop. I also have some religious prohibitions about speculative finance and zero-sum economic activities like gambling. I’m not going to explain those right now, but it is sufficient to say that I am not crypto rich, and am a fairly neutral observer: I am not talking up my own book right&nbsp;now.</p><p>People completely forget the first iteration of bitcoin. In 2010, bitcoin was mined on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rise-of-asics-bitcoin-mining-history">laptops</a>.</p><p>Mined. On.&nbsp;Laptops.</p><p>It was essentially a basic income scheme for laptop owners. A person could download the bitcoin mining software and run it on their machine at night and have a few bitcoin in the morning. As more people did it, the mining reward was spread thinner and thinner. Bitcoin was, at that point, libertarian socialist (which is to say Anarchist) if it had any politics at all. Very broad participation in economic production was possible, and the rewards were distributed evenly.</p><p>There was no particular return to capital because people were mining on laptops they had already owned. Nobody was buying hardware to run bitcoin&nbsp;on.</p><p>This was a radically different period in history. Nothing worked the same way that it does now. I remember railing against the arrival of ASIC mining, because as far as I was concerned, it ended the revolutionary potential of&nbsp;bitcoin.</p><p>I was wrong, but not in the way you&nbsp;think.</p><p>In the early phases of bitcoin, the workers owned the means of <a href="https://tedcurran.net/2013/04/own-the-means-of-production-what-karl-marx-knew-about-opportunity-in-the-digital-economy/">production</a>.</p><p>After ASIC <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rise-of-asics-bitcoin-mining-history">mining</a> was invented there was a role for capital in the bitcoin ecosystem. Commissioning production of ASICs is extremely expensive. It takes a ton of up front investment.</p><p>The reward is to be able to mine bitcoin cheaper than anybody else&nbsp;can.</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rise-of-asics-bitcoin-mining-history">The Rise of Specialized Mining Equipment on Bitcoin - CoinDesk</a></p><p>Once that role for capital was established, bitcoin went from being libertarian socialist with workers entirely owning the means of production (because they owned their own laptops) to something else. Bitcoin became anarchocapitalist. The line between libertarian socialism and anarchocapitalism has always been&nbsp;thin.</p><p>Gupta’s Libertarian Observation <a href="https://www.appropedia.org/User:Vinay_Gupta#Gupta's_Libertarian_Observation">states</a>:</p><p>Free people create free markets. Free markets do not necessarily create free&nbsp;people.</p><p>Because there is no doubt that if people have political freedom they will engage in trade. But if that trade creates a situation in which workers do not own the means of production — that is to say, the profit created from labour is returned to capital and not to labour — then markets move from being an expression of liberated circumstances to being just another instrument of oppression.</p><p>For people who have a hard time grasping this: there is a difference between a road and a toll&nbsp;road.</p> How is bitcoin going to save the&nbsp;world? <p>Since bitcoin was invented there have been several distinct stories about how bitcoin is going to change the&nbsp;world:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/top-10-bitcoin-maximalist-tweets-of-all-time-8857bc28767c">Maximalism</a>/Hyperbitcoinization<br>Bitcoin will change the world by overtaking the dollar and bankrupting the world’s governments by making it impossible to tax the citizenry. As this became less probable a new narrative emerged…  Banking the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/yayafanusie/2021/01/01/stop-saying-you-want-to-bank-the-unbanked/">Unbanked</a><br>Bitcoin will change the world by banking the unbanked, and bringing sophisticated financial infrastructure to the entire world. People in developing world countries will be able to trade globally. Facilities like microfinance will be administered largely by machines making it economically efficient to deploy capital in villages and farms all around the planet. But this turned out to be hard, nearly intractable. Progress was slow and even the remittance market largely refused to convert to a bitcoin-by-default configuration.  Store of <a href="https://builtin.com/finance/crypto-wont-replace-gold">Value</a><br>Bitcoin will change the world by transforming the centralized financial institutions like pension funds and ETFs into bitcoin holders, providing a “store of value” which cannot be inflated out by governments. Bitcoin is in some sense “digital real estate” in that, like land, there is only so much to go around and if you own it, you own it. Note that this theory of change is confined to bitcoin holders: it’s not a dream of global transformation in the way the first two stories were. Bitcoin has begun to mainstream, but at the cost of its world-transforming values.  Maximalism 2.0<br>There is a potential future phase of the Bitcoin story, which is the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/inflation-rampant-buy-bitcoin">inflation</a> hedge story. Right now inflation is pretty low, or being passed off as a very temporary situation. If this changes and the US economy sees sustained inflation and people watch their savings shrink year on year then things will become extremely dramatic and not in a good way. The “store of value” argument will go from being relatively esoteric to being a mainstream lived experience for an enormous number of people, and bitcoin will be back at phase one all over again: a threat to the primacy of government in the currency&nbsp;market.  <p>Now pause for a moment&nbsp;here.</p><p>Climate change is trashing the planet. Bitcoin is hugely CO2 intensive to produce. It has no environmental value system built into it. It creates no environmental benefit by existing. There are some <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-bitcoin-may-actually-speed-up-the-transition-to-renewable-energy-2021-05-18">weak arguments</a> about how bitcoin mining is accelerating the transition to renewables in some way. But at the end of the day, electricity is being consumed, and those renewable resources could be powering anything. It’s just shilling.</p><p>I believe that crypto is an integral part of the human future: I think it’s the necessary backbone for fixing a lot of the world’s problems.</p><p>But not like this. Not like&nbsp;this.</p><p>Bitcoin inside of the existing narrative is probably a very, very good thing for bitcoin holders in the event of inflation inside of America. But even if those people thrive the world still&nbsp;burns.</p> The economy without a&nbsp;future <p>The correct value of many of our most “valuable” financial assets is&nbsp;zero.</p><p>Ski towns in places with no snow. Island fortresses in hurricane belts. Almond orchards in areas with no water to feed the crops. Real estate in flood plains. All of the oil and coal in the ground. All of&nbsp;it.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranded_asset#Climate-related_asset_stranding">Stranded asset - Wikipedia</a></p><p>It’s worth nothing because in the future it will be illegal, uneconomic (carbon taxes) or both. The people who hold those assets currently hold nothing but that’s not what they report to their shareholders. The size of this financial catastrophe cannot be overstated. But it is a direct result of mismanagement by fund managers and boards who chose to ignore climate change. They have wound up as “bag holders” with portfolios stuffed with worthless coal, oil and gas “assets.”</p><p>They’d have done better to buy bitcoin. At least bitcoin might be worth something in&nbsp;future.</p><p>Even with scenarios like geoengineering most of these assets remain completely worthless: we are not going to wind up in a world where we geoengineer the entire climate and then continue burning oil and coal like nothing ever happened. At the very least the costs of the geoengineering will be passed directly on to the coal, oil and gas producers.</p><p>Have I mentioned the continuing catastrophic subsidization governments are doing of their own fossil fuel industries, while making vague noises about unenforceable climate targets? That’s a topic for another&nbsp;essay.</p><p>But if we take out all the assets which are wiped out in a fully scale climate change scenario there is basically nothing left of the current economy: the oil companies are gone, coal, natural gas wiped out. Entire industries like almonds. Fishing. You can just go down the list: gone, gone, gone, wiped out, worthless, gone. Other industries rocket into existence: solar, wind, renewables, batteries, energy efficient construction, you name it. An entire universe goes, and a different one is&nbsp;created.</p><p>But the pension funds, the behemoths of the financial landscape, are gigantically underwater to climate change. That’s another way of saying the old people who are relying on those pension funds to provide them money to live on further into their old age are not going to get paid. The money they saved their entire lives was pumped into worthless assets in nearly every future scenario. By the time they are old enough to pull the money out of the pension fund, the pension fund is worth 20% of what it was worth because the economy that it invested in is&nbsp;gone.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.vox.com/22291568/climate-change-carbon-footprint-greta-thunberg-un-emissions-gap-report">lifestyle</a> you have ordered is out of&nbsp;stock.</p>Banksy ‘Out of Stock’ — <a href="https://streetartlondon.co.uk/blog/2011/12/banksy-out-stock/">Street Art&nbsp;London</a><p>Part Two:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-2-world-models-theories-of-change-cd8aecfd53de">Can the World Computer Save the World?

**An Interview with UrbitHost**

Urbit has been making great strides to become accessible to those who are non-technical. Port enables a user to launch their Urbit ID from their personal computer without any knowledge of the command line. However, you only have access while you are running Port, which means you can't do things like check your DMs while on the move.

Hosting your Urbit means that your Urbit is always on and available. All that is required to access the network is visiting a URL and logging in.That means you can access Urbit from your phone, laptop, or any device with a browser.

The downside is that running your own server can be a complex and difficult process. Third-party hosting allows an expert to do that work for you. The hosting provider gets paid, and you get 24/7 access to your ship.

[UrbitHost](https://urbithost.com) is one of the latest [hosting providers](https://subject.network/planet-sales/) to enter the market. As of now, it is one of the fastest and easiest ways onto the network. You pay the fee, and you get sent a link that you use to access Landscape. It's that easy.

At least, it's that easy for the end user. For the guy running the operations, ~lavlyn-litmeg, it can be quite a complex operation. I sat down with him to find out about what it's like being a commercial developer on Urbit. We also talked about technology, the developer ecosystem, and the future of Urbit.

If you want to get in touch you can reach him at ~lavlyn-litmeg, the ~sardys/uh group, or [urbithost.com](https://urbithost.com).

**Tell us a bit about yourself and your history with Urbit?**

I'm a software engineer who is currently working at one of the larger crypto currency companies. My history with Urbit goes back quite a long time. I saw one of those early demos by Curtis where he had two dojos running, sending messages back and forth, and I thought it looked interesting. Since then, I often checked in on the project, but I stayed at the sidelines because it felt not quite ready; there were constant breaches and so on. What kept me close by was that I believed in the vision of Urbit.

I think the open internet only has a future if people retain control of their digital identities, which means that, in addition to a cryptographic identity, they need to be able to keep control over their data. This not only includes their social graph, but they also must be able to run computations on that data. Urbit checks all those boxes. The people behind Urbit and all the other contributors have been steadily marching towards these goals with incredible stamina. I'm inspired by that. And, since the release of OS1, Urbit is very much usable, and I find myself spending more and more time on it instead of other corners of the internet.

**Why did you decide to work on hosting rather than another Urbit project? If you weren't working on UrbitHost what would you be working on within the Urbit ecosystem?**

I want my non-tech friends to be able to join Urbit. Most people I know can't be bothered with executing a blockchain transaction, many feel uncomfortable installing an app they don't understand, and almost all would shy away from the command line. For the vast majority of people, getting onto Urbit must be as easy as signing up for Gmail or Twitter, otherwise they won't come.

I thought about how I could contribute to Urbit and decided that now is a good time to build a hosting provider. It's still early, but a non-technical person can actually spend time on the network and be productive. I think we are just now seeing a shift where we need community builders as much as we need engineers working on the internals of Urbit. It is important that those community builders have no barrier to entry for themselves or their communities.

That is why ease of access has been my goal from the beginning. I wanted the site to be fully automated, meaning someone could sign up and be on Urbit within minutes. It was also important to me that users be able to choose their own Urbit ID. As far as I know, there was no offering like that yet, so I decided to build it—but I know that others are working on this too.

If I was working on something else, it would be Urbit apps. We're waiting for the new release for it to be easier to distribute and access apps; there are a few tools I would really like to see. But other than that, I would like to spend more time community building.

**Can you tell us about how you're implementing UrbitHost? You beat Tlon to the punch of having immediate hosted access to the Urbit network -- what're you doing differently? How will your implementation change when programmatic access becomes available via Khan (the new vane to replace Herb)?**

UrbitHost runs on Kubernetes, which is a tool to orchestrate containers. What that means, concretely, is that each ship runs inside a Docker container, and Kubernetes makes sure that each container is running and has enough resources. For example, if a server goes down, Kubernetes will automatically move the ships that were on that server to a new server that is available. No data is lost and there should be very little down-time.

People think Kubernetes should only be used for services that can be scaled horizontally, meaning there are multiple instances running of the same services. Scaling like this is obviously not an option for Urbit, because a ship must only run as a single instance. But in the last few years, Kubernetes has added many features to run single and stable instances of a container, for example a database. UrbitHost is making use of these features—permanent volumes, stateful sets, and so on—to provide a high-availability hosting for Urbit. It also scales well. I surmise, we could host thousands of ships, we would only have to add compute nodes.

As for beating Tlon, I'm not sure if it is a fair comparison. UrbitHost, as it is currently, is a minimal viable product. I tried to realize a simple goal: automated hosting. Tlon is hosting many more planets, not to speak of all the stars and galaxies that make up the network. As far as I can tell, Tlon and UrbitHost are doing things quite similarly. For example, I knew that Tlon is also hosting on Kubernetes, which gave me much more confidence that we could do it too.

UrbitHost's programmatic interaction with hosted ships is quite minimal once it is booted. We use airlock to retrieve the access code and do a few more maintenance things, and we are using it for some upcoming features like automatic S3 configuration. But from what I can tell, Khan looks like a really important step forward, because interacting with the hosted ships via airlock is one of the most brittle areas, and I'm looking forward to making it more robust once Khan is out.

**What is most needed within the Urbit ecosystem — any particular apps or services? Which projects are you most excited about?**

The ability to publish content directly from a planet to the regular internet would be cool. I would really love to see some bigger blogs being hosted on Urbit. The basic idea would be this: everyone can read the blog, but to join the conversation one would have to join Urbit and the group associated with that blog. Of course, a planet could publish other content too, possibly a mix of free and premium content. Either way, it would pull a lot of people into the gravity well of Urbit.

Publishing could also be a good value proposition for Urbit hosting providers. If public content is hosted on a ship, then all the profit from new customers who are brought to the provider could somehow be split between the host and content producer. What is nice, though, is that a content producer can take his Urbit-native community anywhere, anytime, without disrupting the community much. The portability of Urbit at every level would really shine here as communities grow.

There are incredible projects happening on every front. The Bitcoin integration is very exciting, it is being realized in a truly Urbit-native way and could prove to be a great catalyst for the ecosystem. However, as a hosting provider, the constant lower-level improvements are exciting too.

**What will be the effect of two upcoming changes to Urbit:**

1. **Built in software distribution and management**
2. **Layer 2 and the new "Khan" vane**

**For #1, how would you pitch developers on the benefits of building on Urbit?**

**With regard to #2, I think there is about to be an explosion of hosting providers. Will this unleash an Eternal September effect or does Urbit's "walled garden" style of communication make it more resilient? Urbit is not a single silo like Facebook, after all.**

I think that once software distribution is as simple and easy as the iOS app store it will be a watershed moment for Urbit. Put bluntly, it will give users something to do on Urbit besides chat. There are several interesting apps out there already, but they are not easy to discover and install.

Developers want reach. The most important pitch to developers will be that on Urbit they have access to a substantial audience. I remember developing for the iPhone in the early days. Objective-C was really a tough pill to swallow, but because the platform was interesting and promised to reach a large audience, I kept going with it. I think Urbit is an interesting platform for the various reasons already mentioned. But learning to develop for Urbit is really a time investment—I myself am still a novice Hoon developer —and for it to be worth it, there has to be a clear pay-off. For some, this is making system-level contributions, but for most it will be having that app show up in some centrally visible place and seeing people engage with it. Once this exists, it will be much easier to pitch Urbit to developers.

The layer 2 solution which will make spawning planets much cheaper is an important next step, especially for hosting providers. Layer 2 will help us immensely because spawning and keying planets is very expensive right now, and it puts a damper on how much we are actively pursuing growth.

If new hosting providers come online, it will not necessarily mean a huge influx of users. In my experience, building a provider is hard and takes time to mature. However, I would love to see fast user growth.

I honestly don't think having our own Urbit Eternal September would be that bad. I would just see it as growing pains. If we enter a time of sustained growth and rapid user onboarding, the fact that some Urbit groups will get overwhelmed with all the new people will be a small price to pay. The current setup, with a few central groups that act like hubs and discovery points—for example, the fantastic Urbit Index—would have to change. People would need to be funneled into their own Urbit universes that might not overlap much with other areas on Urbit. The nice thing is that all this is accounted for in the Urbit infrastructure.

If a certain hosting provider ends up bringing thousands upon thousands of users to Urbit, like AOL did back then with Usenet, then it will be the provider's responsibility to onboard those users sensibly and not just dump them on the existing groups. In other words, providers, in my opinion, also have a community building responsibility. Of course, this does not mean that providers should be overbearing parents, allowing only this or that, but simply that they should have sensible defaults that don't overwhelm or destroy the network.

**What is the role of commercial providers in the open-source ecosystem?**

Commercial providers will be incredibly important to make Urbit succeed. I think if Urbit attracts a large number of users, many, if not most, will run their ship via a hosting provider. It is the easiest way to get started.

However, using a hosting provider to get onto Urbit might at first seem antithetical to the spirit of the project. If someone is trying to get away from mega-corporations, why would they go right back to another company and give them their data?

Well, because it's a completely different relationship. The relationship between us, the provider, and you, the customer, is transparently straight forward. You are not the product. We have a more traditional provider-customer relationship where we just do the dev ops work. It is in our interest to keep your data private and keep your ship running. We give you an Urbit ID, which you can keep forever, and host your ship as long as you wish. When you want to leave, you can download your pier and Urbit ID and use it with a different provider or on your own computer in minutes. On the other hand, you cannot leave Facebook and run your profile off of your laptop. Basically, we cannot count on customer lock-in, we must provide good and honest service. Again, the portability promise of Urbit is essential here and ensures that we are on an equal footing.

**Once the Urbit payment ecosystem gets built out more, would you consider accepting payments over the Urbit network?**

Of course. Having an Urbit-native economy would be a key marker of success, and I would love to participate in it. Moreover, we are planning to offer a Bitcoin node to our customers soon.

**Are you coming to Assembly 2021?**

Yes. At least, I'm planning to! I would love to meet all the people behind Urbit in real life.

**I know you are a Christopher Alexander fan, how has he influenced your work?**

I've been interested in Christopher Alexander for quite a long time. When I realized that many of the people building Urbit are also inspired by him, I understood why much of the Urbit vibe resonated with me. Critics of Urbit either focus on the technical details or on Curtis Yarvin's writings, sometimes conflating the two. That's fine and perhaps a valid point to start, but what they don't understand is that so many other ideas and ideals have since become driving forces behind the project. This is at least what I observe as an outsider.

Alexander's ideas are all about how to build beautiful houses. He wants us to inhabit places that feel life-giving, places that make us more fully human. The same should be asked of the technology we use. So much of the current internet is the equivalent of a fluorescent-lit cubicle, a brutalist government building, or a flashy central square. It might be interesting to travel through these places, but they do not make good homes.

To explore what makes a building beautiful, Alexander had to wade into metaphysics, because he wanted to give a much more objective account of how beauty is present in physical artifacts, which led him to treat beauty as a universal. I think to build more meaningful technology we need to do the same. We do not have a good metaphysics of technology, and this is something I'm really interested in.

**Give me a brief summary about your personal philosophy of technology. Do all tools fall under the umbrella of "technology"? Or do some tools hit an inflection point where they acquire radically different characteristics (compare a shovel and a computer)? It seems to me that the philosophy of technology often boils down to trying to define what "technology" actually is. What do you make of all this?**

Yeah, I definitely think there is an inflection point once technology becomes digital, but I believe there is something all technology has in common. My approach here is classical. Artifacts have to be distinguished from living things because human made things have their origin outside themselves, meaning they are manufactured (in Aristotelian terms, and stated somewhat simplistically, artifacts have an efficient cause outside themselves, whereas biological things have an innate efficient cause). We are often tempted to think of living organisms simply as elaborate self-replicating machines, but that is putting the cart before the horse. We should rather look to the world of living things to be inspired to build our artifacts.

The question of inspiration becomes even more pressing when discussing modern technology, and you put your finger on it with the inflection point. There is no tradition to fall back on when we are building digital technologies. Someone like Christopher Alexander, who is working on architecture, has thousands of years of architecture to look at. He can read the past and see what worked and what did not. On the other hand, when we build things like Urbit, we must look for inspiration in other places because there is no corpus of, say, thousands of years of constructing digital social networks where we can simply choose the best parts. So far, we have mostly bad examples, how not to do it. And considering how new the internet is, most of it is still a blank slate. So while I'm definitely interested in the ontology of technology, I think it is an even more pressing question to learn the principles of the living world around us in order to build digital places that feel organic and life-giving.

**Thanks for chatting!**

See you on the network!

<p>It is with great pleasure that today I am officially announcing that Chris Hart has joined the Civic Board of Directors and has succeeded me as Civic’s CEO. On behalf of the board, I would like to congratulate Chris on this appointment and thank him for his contributions since 2017 as our COO!</p>



<p>Chris is deeply committed to our mission. He has an exceptional understanding of the ecosystem’s technology, and a compelling strategic vision for the company. I am confident that Civic will continue to reach new heights under his leadership. Chris’ background and track record as Civic’s long-serving COO make him particularly well qualified to assume the mantle of CEO, and I have every confidence that he is the right person to lead Civic into the future.</p>



<p>As part of this change I will become the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors at Civic. In this new role, I will continue to be active at a Board and strategic level within the company, and look forward to contributing to Civic’s future successes. Jonathan Smith, our co-founder and CTO, will continue in his current role, and is more excited than ever about Civic’s next phase.</p>



<p>Over the past six years, Civic has become a leader in identity-based solutions for the fast-emerging blockchain compliance and identity space. Civic is in a great place, and my role change is timely given the many positive developments this year. This timing also coincides with the appointment of <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/new-board-member-maja-vujinovic/">Maja Vujinovic to the board</a>, which was done largely to support the company and advance our strategy.</p>



<p>Last summer, in light of the crippling impact of high ETH gas fees on Civic Wallet, we made a strategic decision to move our company to an ecosystem that can support a high volume B2B model. This was one of the primary reasons why we were one of the first crypto companies to be <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-announces-integration-with-solana-blockchain/">integrated with Solana</a>. As the company shifts to scale sales and ramp up growth in this category, we will be well served by Chris Hart’s strong marketplace, mobile and crypto background.</p>



<p>Most importantly, in my final message as CEO I want to thank all of you, from our community to our team and our investors, for your tireless contributions to Civic’s success over the past many years. I know that in Chris and Jonathan’s able hands, our amazing culture will produce identity services that will support the viability of the digital asset ecosystem and make the world a better place. As Executive Chairman, I will remain heavily involved with Civic but from a different vantage point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m looking forward to the many new milestones ahead for Civic. My conviction and excitement for Civic has never been stronger. Congratulations again to our new CEO, Chris Hart!</p>

 What Is Identity Authentication 

<p>Identity Authentication verifies a user’s identity by specific means. We obtain detailed user metadata from the Identity Provider (IdP) to determine whether a user has access to particular resources.</p>

 Identity Authentication Modes 

<p>There are two main categories of identity authentication: traditional mode and centralized mode.</p>

 Traditional Authentication Mode 

<p>In the traditional authentication mode, each application service needs to support authentication separately, such as accessing the login interface when the user is not logged in. The interface returns a <code>301</code> jump page. All application services need to develop the logic to maintain the session and interact with the identity provider for authentication.</p>

<p>You can see the flow of traditional authentication in the figure below.</p>

<p>First, the user initiates a request, then the gateway receives the request and forwards it to the corresponding application services, and finally, the application services interact with the identity provider to complete the authorization.</p>

<p></p>

 Centralized Identity Authentication Mode 

<p>Unlike traditional authentication, the centralized identity mode removes user authentication from the application services. Take Apache APISIX as an example; you can see the centralized identity authentication process in the figure below.</p>

<p>First, the user initiates a request, then the gateway itself takes charge of the user authentication process, interacting with the identity provider and sending them an authorization request. The identity provider returns user identity information (user info). After the gateway identifies the user, it forwards the user identity information (user info) to the services in a request header.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Compared with the traditional authentication mode, centralized identity mode has the following advantages:</p>

 
   Centralized auth simplifies the application development process, and reduces the development application workload and maintenance costs by avoiding the need to repeat the development of authentication code for each application. 
   Centralized authentication mode improves business security. At the gateway level, it can intercept unauthenticated requests in time to protect back-end applications. 
 

 What Is OpenID Connect 

<p>OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a centralized identity authentication mode. The benefit of using OpenID Connect is that users only need to register and log in with one OpenID Connect identity provider’s website and use one account’s password information to access different applications. <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a> is a common OpenID Connect identity provider, and the Apache APISIX OpenID Connect plugin supports OpenID.  As a result, the plugin can replace traditional authentication mode with centralized identity authentication.  In this case, we’re using Okta.</p>

 OpenID Authentication Process 

<p></p>

 
   APISIX initiates an authentication request to the Identity Provider. 
   The user logs in and authenticates on the Identity Provider. 
   The Identity Provider returns to APISIX with the Authorization Code. 
   APISIX requests the Identity Provider with the Code extracted from the request parameters. 
   The Identity Provider sends an answer message to APISIX with the ID Token and Access Token. 
   APISIX sends the Access Token to the Identity Provider’s User Endpoint for authentication. 
   After passing the authentication, the User Endpoint sends the User Info to APISIX to complete  authentication. 
 

 How to Configure Okta Authentication Using the Apache APISIX OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>Configuring Okta authentication using the Apache APISIX OpenID Connect plugin is a three-step process that allows you to switch from traditional authentication to centralized identity authentication mode. The following sections describe the steps to configure Okta authentication using the OpenID Connect plugin for Apache APISIX.</p>

 Prerequisites 

<p>Have an <a>Okta account</a> ready for use.</p>

 Step 1: Configuring Okta 

 
   
    <p>Log in to your Okta account and click Create App Integration to create an Okta application.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Select OIDC-OpenID Connect for the Sign-in method, and select Web Application for the  Application type.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Set the redirect URL for login and logout. The Sign-in redirect URIs are links a user can go to after a successful login, and the Sign-out redirect URIs are links a user goes to after a successful logout. In this example, we set both sign-in and sign-out redirect URIs to <code>http://127.0.0.1:9080/</code>.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>After finishing the settings, click Save to save the changes.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Visit the General page of the application to obtain the following configuration, which is required to configure Apache APISIX OpenID Connect.</p>
   
 

 
   Client ID: OAuth client ID, the application ID, which corresponds to <code>client_id</code> and <code>{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}</code> below. 
   Client secret: OAuth client secret, the application key, which corresponds to <code>client_secret</code> and <code>{YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET}</code> below. 
   Okta domain: The domain name used by the application, corresponding to <code>{YOUR_ISSUER}</code> below. 
 

<p></p>

 Step 2: Install Apache APISIX

   <code># initialize NGINX config file and etcd
make init
</code>   

 Step 3: Start Apache APISIX and Configure the Corresponding Route 

 
   
    <p>Run the following command to start Apache APISIX.</p>

       <code> apisix start
</code>       
   
   
    <p>Create a route and configure the OpenID Connect plugin. The following code example creates a route through the Apache APISIX Admin API, setting the upstream path to <code>httpbin.org</code>, a simple backend service for receiving and responding to requests. The following will use the get page of <code>httpbin.org</code>. Please refer to <a href="http://httpbin.org/#/HTTP_Methods/get_get"><code>httpbin get</code></a> for more information. For specific configuration items, please refer to the <a href="https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/openid-connect/">Apache APISIX OpenID Connect Plugin</a>.</p>

</code>   

 Step 4: Access Apache APISIX 

 
   
    <p>Visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:9080/get</code> and the page is redirected to the Okta login page because the OpenID Connect plugin is enabled.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   Enter the username and password for the user’s Okta account and click Sign In to log in to your Okta account. 
   After successful login, you can access the get page in httpbin.org. The <code>httpbin.org/get</code> page will return the requested data with <code>X-Access-Token</code>, <code>X-Id-Token</code>, and <code>X-Userinfo</code> as follows. 
 

   <code>  "X-Access-Token": "******Y0RPcXRtc0FtWWVuX2JQaFo1ZVBvSlBNdlFHejN1dXY5elV3IiwiYWxnIjoiUlMyNTYifQ.***TVER3QUlPbWZYSVRzWHRxRWh2QUtQMWRzVDVGZHZnZzAiLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL3FxdGVzdG1hbi5va3RhLmNvbSIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcXF0ZXN0bWFuLm9rdGEuY29tIiwic3ViIjoiMjgzMDE4Nzk5QHFxLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTYyODEyNjIyNSwiZXhwIjoxNjI4MTI5ODI1LCJjaWQiOiIwb2ExMWc4ZDg3TzBGQ0dYZzY5NiIsInVpZCI6IjAwdWEwNWVjZEZmV0tMS3VvNjk1Iiwic2NwIjpbIm9wZW5pZCIsInByb2Zpb***.****iBshIcJhy8QNvzAFD0fV4gh7OAdTXFMu5k0hk0JeIU6Tfg_Mh-josfap38nxRN5hSWAvWSk8VNxokWTf1qlaRbypJrKI4ntadl1PrvG-HgUSFD0JpyqSQcv10TzVeSgBfOVD-czprG2Azhck-SvcjCNDV-qc3P9KoPQz0SRFX0wuAHWUbj1FRBq79YnoJfjkJKUHz3uu7qpTK89mxco8iyuIwB8fAxPMoXjIuU6-6Bw8kfZ4S2FFg3GeFtN-vE9bE5vFbP-JFQuwFLZNgqI0XO2S7l7Moa4mWm51r2fmV7p7rdpoNXYNerXOeZIYysQwe2_L****",

</code>   

<p>X-Access-Token: Apache APISIX puts the access token obtained from the user provider into the <code>X-Access-Token</code> request header, optionally via the <code>access_token_in_authorization_header</code> in the plugin configuration Authorization request header.</p>

<p>X-Id-Token: Apache APISIX will get the Id token from the user provider through the base64 encoding into the <code>X-Id-Token</code> request header, you can choose whether to enable this function through the <code>set_id_token_header</code> in the plugin configuration, the default is enabled.</p>

<p></p>

<p>X-Userinfo: Apache APISIX will get the user information from the user provider and put it into <code>X-Userinfo</code> after encoding it with Base64, you can choose whether to enable this feature through <code>set_userinfo_header</code> in the plugin configuration, it is set to be on by default.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As you can see, Apache APISIX will carry the <code>X-Access-Token</code>, <code>X-Id-Token</code>, and <code>X-Userinfo</code> request headers to the upstream. The upstream can parse these headers to get the user ID information and user metadata.</p>

<p>We have shown the process of building centralized identity authentication from Okta directly into the Apache APISIX Gateway. It is easy to sign up for a free Okta Developer Account to get started. Our approach reduces developer overhead and enables a safe and streamlined experience.</p>

Where we are with the infrastructure/crypto bill Photo: European Central&nbsp;Bank<p>The reality is that the U.S. government is going to want more control and oversight over the $2 trillion and rising crypto economy. That includes DeFi and NFTs and everything else blockchain. That’s inevitable.</p><p>It should be a good thing, though. It’s validation that crypto is important. Like the legalization of marijuana, it’s also an opportunity for new tax revenues. For investors and developers and entrepreneurs, having regulatory clarity protects their efforts and&nbsp;money.</p><p>Of course, things might get a little messy along the way. Such is the case with really new things that break the rules we thought we understood.</p><p>So where are we with the infrastructure bill and its crypto tax provision, reporting requirements, and overly broad definition of the term “broker?”</p><p>As we <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-172-crypto-allies-fail-to-amend-infrastructure-bill-2f4d81e73e55">discussed last week</a>, a compromise amendment was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/senate-compromise-infrastructure-bill">rejected by a lone senator at the final&nbsp;hour</a>.</p><p>Now the bill will go to the House, where the battle&nbsp;resumes.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-13/treasury-seeks-to-quell-fears-crypto-tax-rules-are-overly-broad?sref=3REHEaVI">Bloomberg reports</a> that the U.S. Treasury will release guidance on the new provision:</p><blockquote>The U.S. Treasury Department is set to clarify that only cryptocurrency companies it considers brokers will need to comply with proposed IRS reporting requirements, aiming to quell concerns over a provision in the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by the&nbsp;Senate.</blockquote><blockquote>Other firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market — from developers and miners to hardware and software providers — won’t have any new requirements, so long as they don’t also act as brokers, according to a Treasury official. The Treasury’s guidance won’t grant blanket exemptions based on how firms identify themselves and instead will focus on whether a firm’s activities qualify it as a broker under the tax code, the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.</blockquote><blockquote>The guidance, which could be made public as soon as next week, is an attempt to address concerns in the cryptocurrency industry that the $550 billion infrastructure bill would require a host of companies with ties to digital assets to report data to the Internal Revenue Service that they don’t have. The tax provision, estimated to raise $28 billion over a decade, was included in the legislation as a way to help pay for new investments in roads and&nbsp;bridges.</blockquote><p>Which seems like a positive development. But if you remember, it was also Janet Yellen and the Treasury fighting back against changes to the original wording of the bill. From Yellen’s perspective, that makes sense. Let’s start overly broad, and then release guidance that’s more specific. It allows the Treasury to cover all their bases and the necessary wiggle room if they want to maneuver in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The guidance is also probably a move to help push the bill through the House without as much of a fight. But we’ll see how much this really appeases the crypto community.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/treasury-prepares-crypto-carve-out-from-infrastructure-bills-tax-reporting-provision-report">Coindesk</a>:</p><blockquote>According to Cornell Law, the U.S. tax code defines a broker&nbsp;as:</blockquote><blockquote>“A) a dealer, (B) a barter exchange, and © any other person who (for a consideration) regularly acts as a middleman with respect to property or services.”</blockquote><blockquote>Treasury is reportedly planning to exempt non-broker parties on a case-by-case basis, a far cry from the more sweeping exemptions the industry had&nbsp;sought.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/us-senate-sends-infrastructure-bill-to-house">US Senate Sends Infrastructure Bill to House — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/senate-compromise-infrastructure-bill">Lone Senator Rejects Crypto Compromise in Infrastructure Bill — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/senate-fails-to-amend-crypto-tax-provision-in-infrastructure-bill/">Senate Fails to Amend Crypto Tax Provision in Infrastructure Bill — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/sec-brings-and-settles-first-case-in-crypto-linked-defi-sector-11628266336">SEC Brings and Settles First Case in Crypto-Linked DeFi&nbsp;Sector</a>   2. Felix Salmon on crypto regulations <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-50f20bda-46a8-431b-8a64-ae7b8bbd89de.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Driving the news: SEC chair Gary Gensler — who has taught a course on cryptocurrencies at MIT — gave an important speech last week laying out a maximalist vision for the degree to which his agency can and should regulate the asset&nbsp;class.</blockquote>  FTX, the fastest-growing crypto exchange, last valued at $18 billion, wants to become a regulated stock exchange where stocks can be traded on the blockchain.  Ethereum, the upstart rival to bitcoin, is in the process of moving to a more centralized system that transfers power to the largest holders of the currency, including its founder, Vitalik&nbsp;Buterin.  Stablecoins, which by their nature are inextricably linked to TradFi, or traditional finance, have already started to dominate crypto trading and quell its more anarchic&nbsp;fringes.  <blockquote>How it works: A more regulated system would help solve problems like the difficulty of buying a home using the proceeds of crypto sales, or customers of NBA TopShot being unable to transfer their money to banks, including JPMorgan and Wells&nbsp;Fargo.</blockquote><blockquote>The bottom line: We’re now clearly at the beginning of the end of cryptocurrency as an anarcho-libertarian Utopia.</blockquote>  Most crypto activity continues to take place outside the U.S., often in unregulated (and very risky) venues. But when the U.S. wants to regulate global financial activity, it generally finds it very easy to do&nbsp;so.  <blockquote>Go deeper: Yahoo’s Roger Parloff has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-profile-085444366.html">a big profile</a> of FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried that examines in much more detail the regulatory tightrope he’s&nbsp;walking.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stablecoin-shakeup-messi-s-crypto-compensation">Stablecoin Shakeup; Messi’s Crypto Compensation</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/daos-vcs-put-6m-behind-governance-startup-tally">DAOs, VCs Put $6M Behind Governance Startup Tally — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/polygons-new-gaming-studio-launches-with-cricket-nft-platform">Polygon’s New Gaming Studio Launches With Cricket NFT Platform — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fortune-raises-over-1-3m-in-nft-of-cover-art-sale">Fortune Raises Over $1.3M in Cover Art NFT Sale — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://gokhshteinmedia.com/2021/08/has-xrp-gone-debit/">Has XRP Gone&nbsp;Debit?</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/ether-burns-hit-100-million-post-eip-1559-activation/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Ether Burns Hit $100 Million Post EIP-1559 Activation — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/neuberger-berman-begins-offering-exposure-to-crypto/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Neuberger Berman Begins Offering Exposure to Crypto — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/cryptocurrency-theft-hackers-steal-600-million-in-poly-network-hack.html">Hackers return nearly half of the $600 million they stole in one of the biggest crypto&nbsp;heists</a>  <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/08/05/locating-stablecoins-within-the-regulatory-perimeter/">Locating Stablecoins within the Regulatory Perimeter</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/113874/tether-new-reserves-report-june-2021-treasury-bills">Tether significantly increased exposure to treasury bills as of&nbsp;June</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nfts-over-defi-opensea-just-overtook-uniswap-on-ethereum-usage">NFTs Over DeFi: OpenSea Just Overtook Uniswap on Ethereum Usage — CoinDesk</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/114189/poly-hack-attacker-return-funds-id-slowmist">Poly Network attacker returns $256 million of the stolen cryptocurrency</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/hackers-steal-over-600m-biggest-in-defi-history/">Hackers Steal Over $600M; Biggest in DeFi History — Blockworks</a>   3.

 Global Crypto Exchanges Begin Phased Deployment of Veriscope: The Decentralized Solution to the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>Bridgetown, Barbados, August 17, 2021 — Today, Shyft Core, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.binance.com/en">Binance</a>, <a href="https://www.deribit.com/">Deribit</a>, <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/">Bitfinex</a>, <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/">BitMEX</a>, <a href="https://tether.to/">Tether</a>, <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/">Huobi </a>and other collaborating Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), announced the launch of <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, a decentralized compliance framework and smart-contract platform for VASPs to enable travel rule compliance.</p><p>Participating exchanges are collectively initiating the phased deployment of Veriscope on the Shyft Network, a decentralized infrastructure designed to aggregate and embed trust, validation and discoverability into data stored on public and private ecosystems.</p><blockquote>“In 2019, the FATF tasked the industry to develop a technical response to the Travel Rule (Recommendation 16). This was no easy task as there are a number of technical challenges to doing so — particularly discovery of who a counterparty VASP is to a transaction. The Veriscope solution provides for an answer to this problem that causes the least customer friction, whilst at the same time respecting data privacy, data consent, and security to the greatest extent.” <br> — Malcolm Wright, Chief Compliance Officer at BitMEX and Chair of the Advisory Council at Global Digital&nbsp;Finance</blockquote><p>Veriscope is the result of a collective effort of some of the largest exchanges (by global volume), set out to collaboratively build <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/introducing-veriscope-a-decentralized-solution-to-the-fatfs-travel-rule-d7f3a0b99245">a decentralized solution for global compliance standards</a>, including the FATF’s Travel Rule guidance. Veriscope was designed, built and programmed to assist exchanges to meet these requirements by facilitating address discoverability, and KYC data exchange without unnecessary exposures of user’s&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“In order to truly make data transmission systems work at the scale of the largest VASPs today, we need open solutions that provide the highest level of security on behalf of our users. Blockchains enable global systems that address coordination while at the same time ensuring auditability across hundreds of countries, millions of users, and billions of transactions. Coming together as a global coalition to deploy this solution ensures the rest of the industry has a unified standard, and an open architecture, to help everyone meet global regulatory requirements. It is our responsibility to give clarity, lead regulatory standardization during this transition phase, while also helping smaller VASPs to define secure data requirements that sit at the forefront of regulatory transformation.” <br> — Jonathan Farnell, Director of Compliance at&nbsp;Binance</blockquote><p>By linking user consent-permissioning with VASP-to-VASP data transmission, Veriscope’s design ensures VASPs can determine the difference between honest transactions and data attacks while maintaining GDPR requirements and a trustless audit trail across counterparties. This coordination architecture eliminates the reliance on centralized trust and long-term reconciliation with counterparty VASPs that may or may not exist in the&nbsp;future.</p><blockquote>“Technology that allows VASPs to distinguish between transfers that are coming from or going to another VASP — solving the discovery problem — fulfills an important role in travel rule compliance. Veriscope’s solution for the discovery problem may be helpful in accelerating travel rule compliance and, as a consequence, the adoption of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions.”<br> — Peter Warrack, CCO of&nbsp;Bitfinex</blockquote><blockquote>“The goal of Veriscope was to design a utility that would enable a decentralized coordination system to address global data transmission requirements. In achieving this goal, Veriscope ensures that VASPs maintain full business sovereignty, determines counterparty requirements cross-jurisdictionally, while maintaining a decentralized system that isn’t owned by any one group of VASPs.”<br> — Joseph Weinberg, Shyft Network Co-founder</blockquote><p>To ensure Veriscope’s success, the participating exchanges also created the <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-launches-the-veriscope-governance-task-force-in-collaboration-with-some-of-the-8d045e7443f3">Veriscope Governance Task Force</a>. Chaired by Rick McDonell, former Executive Secretary to the FATF, and Josee Nadeau, former head of the Canadian delegation to the FATF, the Task Force came together to collaboratively work on governance requirements for counterparty onboarding, information indexing, and Know Your Business&nbsp;(KYB).</p><p>Regarding the Task Force, Rick McDonell said: “all systems require a reliable governance framework and workable operational rules. This is true for both the real world and the virtual world. But while the real world has had a long history of devising systems the virtual world has not. This is especially the case in the transfer of money or value which, with new technologies, allows instant transfers but has not had the balancing rules for compliance with global standards and national regulatory requirements. This is now changing with the launch of the collaborative Veriscope system which bridges the gap between highly efficient technology and the need to provide accurate, timely and protected compliance information.”</p><blockquote>“Deribit is glad to join Veriscope as it offers an important step towards adhering to the Travel Rule requirements, whilst at the same time protecting client sensitive information. Global regulatory standards and requirements are changing and we strongly believe the best approach is a coordinated effort by globally trusted platforms to form a feasible approach and set new sensible standards.”<br> — Jos van Griensven, Head of Legal &amp; Compliance at&nbsp;Deribit</blockquote><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

<p>Block Consensus: The article covers Mythical Beings and how, as an Ardor-based NTF card game, it can break through the NFT booming market. NFTs are revolutionizing the current art circulation pattern and becoming a bridge between creators and audiences. Mythical Beings NFTs are not just artwork, but also play an important role in historical inheritance and, together with the card collection incentive measures, they further encourage users to collect NFTs and thus increasing their value. Tarasca chose to deploy the Mythical Beings project on Ardor blockchain thanks to its low transaction fees and its unique multi-chain architecture, which ensures, compared to other blockchains, high performance and scalability, strong data processing capabilities, and security of the network.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/ashford">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>
Eric Newcomer, Chief Technology Officer at WSO2 is to deliver a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4606" title="Identity Is the New Blue"> The Rise of the Developer in IAM </a>on Monday, September 13 starting at 6:40 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Eric some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>What significant identity projects have you been involved in? </p>
<p>
Well, long time ago, I did an application for Salomon Ski for their warehouse subsidiaries around the world. And for that application - because there was no solution - I had to create my own identity management service. So, I got to know quite well what it takes to do that. And I would never do it again, of course, now that there are such good offerings on the market, I would just buy them. It is much more efficient to have a single solution across a company than have each application person develop their own. But it gave me a great insight into exactly what's needed, what's there, what you have to do, how hard it is to maintain administratively, the overheads, and this kind of thing. So, I had that basic experience of having coded one of these things a long time ago. Then when I joined Citi, about 10 years ago now, we had a very strong identity management function there, which had to do more with identity cards and payment cards than anything else.</p>
<p>But we did go into a sponsored partnership with Microsoft, where we worked with Kim Cameron, who is well known in the industry for his identity thought leadership. And we were working on things around how to decorate or enhance the social login credentials from Facebook and Google and things like that to make them strong enough for banking, which was, I thought a very interesting approach to things. And on top of that, at Citi we had done identity cards for the Department of Defense. This was one of our big contracts, and we were trying to think how could we enhance those cards to have payment information, which gets you into a whole other level of identity management, again, strong enough for banking. And then there was another aspect to this [that] we tried to morph that into, which was for the payments systems [for] social security in Italy to get a proof of life identity. It's another interesting challenge in that area, [we] worked with Microsoft on it a bit. Unfortunately, none of these things ever really came to fruition, but it was a great time, a great background, great education for me on identity management, a great chance to work with one of the leading figures in the field as well.  </p>
<p>And, last but not least, I should just add my recent role at Citi. [My] most recent role was head of security, architecture and strategy for the consumer bank. And there, I got involved in the Google project where we were federating the identity of Google users with Citi users in order to enable this Google Pay application to do banking services. And that was very interesting, not the least of which was the culture difference between what it means to have an identity in the Google world and what it means to have an identity in the banking world, but we did manage to smush those together, and that project should be coming to fruition sometime this year. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When you say “everything is code” what do you mean by that? </p>
<p>
Yes, it's a kind of a catchphrase, I guess you might say, but if you look at the world and you see code becoming greater and greater part of our lives with all these smart devices and smartphones and smart homes and smart cities and cars. You know, Tesla basically reinvented the car as a mobile computer on wheels that happens to be drivable. And you have the internet of things, you have Alexa in your home, you have all of these devices at the edge, you know, the Xbox game statistics doing an amazing job of adding computing at the network edge. So, computers and code is just becoming everywhere and becoming a part of our daily life. So for everything is code, I think in the case of security, it becomes also a mentality, or a kind of a culture change, where we start thinking about how can we do as much in code as possible, since the world is moving to code, and we'll need to have a security code as part of all of these devices and all of these smart things. They need to be secure, perhaps more than ever, because of the proliferation of them and perhaps [because] of the lack of attention on security aspects in the early days of creating these devices and their APIs, and so on.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In what sense is identity management becoming code, and how is that useful? </p>
<p>
I think two main aspects here. One of them is the cloud influence. When you bring an application to the cloud - to Amazon, GCP [Google Cloud Platform], Azure - you don't have an operations department anymore to stand up your infrastructure. [You] use APIs, and this is becoming [a] more and more popular trend because it's also very efficient and creates an ability to automate deployments and automate the provisioning of infrastructure that otherwise we would have had to do manually or ask somebody to do and put in a ticket to change something or so on. So, there's this whole aspect of how can we automate the whole provisioning, management, [and] administration process that's kind of going on, not only in the cloud, but also moving to on-prem as applications become more and more automated, security testing becomes more and more automated, [and] standing up of infrastructure and management of infrastructure becomes more and more automated.  </p>
<p>So, you've got that aspect, and you want to make sure security is a key part of that and works well with all of those trends because security needs to be baked in, right from the beginning, in any of these efforts of moving apps to the cloud, or creating digital solutions, or creating IoT solutions - all of these things. As much as those things are being automated, security needs to be automated as well and the infrastructure and the administration of it. And the other aspect is on the coding part, the code that you need to implement security policies and processes also needs to be made available as external libraries that developers can download and integrate into their projects as seamlessly as possible because a lot of developers don't have a lot of security skills and have trouble, of course, keeping up with all the rapid advancement in the security area where things are evolving almost daily between, you know, new techniques for authentication and authorization, new attack surfaces, new ways to protect APIs, [and] new attacks on APIs.   </p>
<p>It's very hard for developers to keep up with all of that, and still deliver the business functionality they are meant to deliver. And this creates in some cases, and we saw this at Citi fairly clearly when I was running the security architecture team, that developers sometimes would not want to pay much attention to security until it was too late. It’s a very common thing, and we we'd have to review projects and say, no, you haven't done your encryption correctly. You don't have your authentication done to Citi standards. You cannot go to production. And they would get very angry with us, of course, because they want to please their business sponsors, go to production, meet their deadlines. We just wanted them to think about security from the beginning so we wouldn't end up in this kind of position. And some of the people would, but having the security libraries and security capabilities available as code makes it easier, and helps break down some of these traditional barriers between the security teams and the application development teams. </p>   
<p>So that you can say to them, here, just take these pre-built libraries, these policy definitions, and implement the company standards. Please include them in your development process as early as possible. Make sure you have the automated testing so you can test those APIs for the correct authentication, authorization capabilities and policies, check all the vulnerabilities, put in the code scanning, put in the container scanning - everything in the pipeline. So, there's this whole process of getting into the coding process, the modern coding automation processes with pre-built security code, security tools, and getting that “shifting left” is one of the terms for it - as much as possible. And to help do that, we want to provide as much of the security capabilities and policies in code as possible.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How can organizations ensure that IAM code is wherever it is needed, when its needed, and that it is automated like any other code? </p>
<p>
Well, as I was previously saying, the “security as code” trend, provides a lot of code that's available in library form for handling things such as identity access management, and that in particular, is a specialization of the security as code trend, where it’s becoming more available from different vendors, from industry sources, from open source libraries -  that a lot of the code that you need to include in your applications, mobile apps, web apps, internet of things apps, is available as a downloadable library. So, what you want to do is make sure when you're doing your development, that you identify the library specific to identity access management functionality, and for policies, that you need to include in your code chain as you're building it out and as you're testing it. Another important aspect of this, is to make sure you have automated tests, especially for the identity of APIs, for example, which can be a real vulnerability.   </p>
<p>When you publish APIs, you need to have a strong identity, and that needs to be tested as well as part of the identity access management as code capability. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What can attendees of EIC expect in your presentation? </p>
<p>
I'm really looking forward to EIC and to talk. I'll talk about the topics we mentioned today, and go into more detail about how exactly it can be done so that we can improve time to market, which is a critical thing. Sometimes you have this problem where security is not baked in, and you can't really put it in very well at the end. How do we avoid that problem? How can we shift left? How can we include the code in our pipelines? How can we ensure we have the right levels of testing? In other words, it's kind of the bits and bytes of the mechanics of doing this kind of thing, as well as just covering the concepts in a bit more detail.   </p>
<p>What does it mean to think about security as code, in particular for the IAM space? And so we've got the conceptual, how do you think about it? How do you do it? And then with a particular focus on being productive and getting that code to market with as few hurdles as possible, avoid those security guys saying no, get the time to market productivity for those APIs and for those digital transformation projects, as smooth as possible, while relying as much on security as code, IAM as code, as possible. Why [to]do it and how to do it. </p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/fisher">Paul Fisher</a></p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) is an essential component in protecting organizations against cyber-attacks, ransomware, malware, phishing, and data leaks. No longer a tool for protecting admin accounts only; privilege management now extends across the entire organization, from on-premises and cloud infrastructure to every user, no matter where they are working from, or what they are accessing. To assist with this, Managed Service Providers (MSP) are increasingly offering PAM capabilities to their portfolio. This Whitepaper examines the options for MSPs and their customers in the market for PAM as a Service.

<p>Diagnostic is a series of essays and hosted conversations exploring the challenges of building more inclusive digital economies. For hosted (virtual) conversations, like the one described below, Caribou Digital convenes a diverse set of experts and thought leaders with unique insights on an issue and gives them the opportunity to explore a topic together. The conversation here occurred in June 2021 and included investment officers from large foundations as well as thematic experts and employees from multilateral and bi-lateral donor organizations. The conversation was private to facilitate open exchange so the following is an edited summary of key themes and not attributed to any participant.</p><p>The conversation we discuss here was kicked off by reviewing a post called “<a href="https://medium.com/dfs-lab/fortune-at-the-middle-of-the-pyramid-3a6886eb97f3">Fortune at the Middle of the Pyramid</a>” that uses high-resolution income and consumption data to understand opportunities and limitations of various for-profit investment strategies in sub-Saharan Africa. While that post focused more on private sector concerns, in the Diagnostic discussion we tried to understand the implications for aid, government, and donor policy (i.e. the “development sector”).</p><p>A large set of impact investor, international donor, and government anti-poverty policy is based on the notion that for-profit companies can be induced to serve the poor with life changing services like banking or schooling but the limits of the for profit model are not always taken into&nbsp;account</p><p>According to the <a href="https://thegiin.org/research/publication/impinv-survey-2020.">Global Impact Investor Network (GINN)</a>, there was $715B USD under management by global impact investors in 2019. The majority of the investors surveyed are targeting market-rate returns and attempting to improve the lives of low-income people as their primary impact. This is to say that most of them believe they can help low-income populations by investing in for-profit companies who serve them or their communities with some kind of good or&nbsp;service.</p><p>Beyond the impact investing sector, there is a much broader set of development actors (donors, governments, and other aid organizations) whose strategies implicitly or explicitly embody a similar belief — that with proper support, the private sector will serve low income people with products and services that improve their lives in meaningful ways and thus help them out of&nbsp;poverty.</p><p>Identifying the limits to this kind of for-profit model is thus quite important for a large number of impact investing and development strategies. In this Diagnostic, we summarize our research and the discussion of our panel of experts around the question of whether the poor can be a profitable market segment. This is a necessary condition for for-profit companies to want to serve the poor at&nbsp;all.</p><p>African data showing the shape of consumer purchasing power at different levels of income shows that the largest segment of consumers below $2 per day control only a small fraction of total purchasing power</p><p>The main data source we are going to look at is PovCalNet, a decades old project by the World Bank to compile comparable measures of income and consumption across countries. Using detailed household surveys, PovCalnet attempts to estimate daily consumption per adult in each household.</p><p>The example depicted above shows how we used this data to calculate the height of the below curve at each point along the x-axis. The height is the amount of discretionary spending power wielded by the entire population at each level of consumption (total income * y % which is discretionary * total number of people at this income). Thus, we believe this amount is a good proxy for spending power (and thus for the size of the market opportunity) for non-food, non-essential goods. (We address food and essentials below.)</p><p>Adding in realistic cost to acquire and serve low income customers shows most of the poor to be unviable as customers</p><p>Importantly, we can see that aggregate discretionary spending is relatively small — below $3/day — despite the fact that the majority of the population live at this level. Their incomes are low and spent almost entirely on necessities. The graph peaks around $4–$6, which is where the smaller number of people is best offset by higher income. Beyond that, everyone gets richer rapidly, but the population numbers fall even faster than income rises — thus absolute spending power falls. Interestingly, the spending power (calculated as the area under the curve) of the consumers in the $5–$10 band of income (which comprise only ~10% of the population) is about double that of the $0–$4/day group (which comprise&nbsp;~85%).</p><p>This is the key observation of the analysis — this dynamic will create strong incentives to push for-profit companies to serve the much smaller group in the $5–$10+ band. This is especially true to the extent that product developers must make a trade-off and tailor their products to be more attractive to one group and less attractive to the other. (There are very few universal products;most must be tailored and thus a trade-off must be&nbsp;made)</p><p>Curves in this figure represent the total disposable income net of cost to acquire and serve where hypothetical costs increase from curve 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).</p><p>Lowering the cost of acquisition and distribution is&nbsp;key!</p><p>So far we’ve only considered spending figures — for-profit actors care about profits, so we have to consider customer acquisition costs as well as the cost of goods sold. Factoring these costs into the equation changes the picture quite a bit, as seen in the curves above. As costs rise, some consumers at the very lowest end will become infeasible (i.e. even if we captured all their discretionary spending, which is nearly impossible, the cost to acquire and serve would still be higher.) Also, the peak of the curve will shift to higher income brackets for two reasons. Not only is there more money, but also it is distributed across fewer people, so the cost to acquire a dollar of discretionary spending is assumed lower. In the graph above, we can see that the peak goes from $5 to closer to $20 as costs rise and the area under the curve (the total potential market value) shrinks dramatically.</p><p>Another way to look at this graph is in reverse — any entrepreneur that can design distribution models that dramatically lower cost to acquire and serve will create huge market value and make many more people feasible as customers (perhaps there are government or donor investments that can also have this&nbsp;effect).</p> From the Diagnostic conversation: <p>There may be business models that can serve populations despite a lack of significant purchasing power and thus show promise as poverty alleviation strategies based in the private&nbsp;sector</p><p>The financial inclusion field is one area of development policy that seeks to identify for-profit delivery models for services that will benefit low-income consumers. One area of discussion centered on the kinds of financial services models that could be successful. One observation was that this logic essentially rules out savings-based models, as they depend almost entirely on discretionary income and tend to have high acquisition costs due to most people’s low urgency for savings. An exception might be the voluntary savings circles, but most participants actually see those as credit. Insurance seems to suffer a similar fate. The very basic package of P2P remittances, bill payments, and credit that has become the standard mobile money offering seems to be pretty close to what is sustainable for lower-income populations. This is partly because these products are high-margin due to the degree of need and can almost be seen as necessities (sending money or borrowing it in an emergency can be very urgent&nbsp;needs).</p><p>The discussion also touched on products (like airtime or fast moving consumer goods) that can be sold as individual package pricing where profit is guaranteed at the level of the individual sale. Because there is no risk of acquiring a customer that is unprofitable, producers of these services are likely to be more open to serving the poor and see them as a limited but potentially profitable subsegment.</p><p>Finally, the group discussed cross-subsidy models (like Facebook) where a richer segment of the user population can cross-subsidize unprofitable lower-income users. <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-land-where-facebook-loses-money-d850c6593f70">Caribou Digital’s analysis of Facebook users</a> in the developing world shows that while Facebook makes lots of money on users in North America, Europe, and Latin America, they likely lose money on users in Africa and a few other parts of the world where user discretionary income is too low. Thus advertisers are not willing to pay the premiums they are willing to pay elsewhere (very much in-line with this analysis indicating they have low discretionary income), and lower-quality devices and constrained usage patterns make them harder to serve. We estimate that Facebook loses something like a dollar a year on hundreds of millions of users in the developing world. But because Facebook’s revenues are tens of billions of USD per year, these losses are likely considered a cost of doing business when running a global platform that benefits from the network effects of having everyone on board. But this strategy depends on the money-losing population of users being a relatively small fraction of the total user base, and one where the total losses are limited. Thus, outside of the handful of massive global platforms where this applies, cross-subsidy models are not a feasible way to serve the population below the poverty line with digital services.</p><p>Very low-cost acquisition models might also break this logic, at least to the extent they assure the population in the $4–$8/day range are feasible as customers. Finally, models focusing on selling food and daily necessities also have potential, as shown below. There was some excitement about models that focus on agriculture value chains as a perennial development sector that has recently seen more activity from new technology startups. It was noted that the development sector has not paid as much attention to models focusing on small business supplier marketplaces and last-mile logistics even though they often have necessities and food at the core — perhaps because they have mostly focused in urban areas to&nbsp;date.</p> Focusing on models that deliver food and basic necessities helps expand the opportunity for the private sector, but it is still an uphill&nbsp;battle. <p>The above analysis assumes that most companies are creating services that target discretionary expenditures. Above we show the same curve when we include all expenditures, including primary necessities like food. When considering basic necessities, we now see a much larger market and one where the peak of consumer spending power is at a lower level of income — now in the $2–$5 range. This comports with the “Bottom of the Pyramid” argument that there is significant spending power among the lower income populations when it comes to food, and other primary necessities. Nevertheless, we still show relatively limited aggregate spending power for the large group of people who live on less than $2/day, which biases the for-profit sector to higher incomes. Most digital and technology powered models do not focus on necessities, but we believe there is significant scope to do&nbsp;so.</p> What are the key takeaways from this&nbsp;data?   Purely B2C models that seek to sell discretionary goods or services directly to low-income African households are unlikely to be profitable due to low discretionary income and the relatively high costs of acquiring and serving customers.  The largest block of discretionary income is in the hands of the population who live at $4-$8/day. These folks are not formally poor by global development standards.  With realistic acquisition costs factored in, the incentive is more often to target $10+/day, which represents only about 5% of the population in most of&nbsp;Africa.   From the Diagnostic conversation: <p>Two conclusions for the wider implications of impact investing and the poor as a profitable market&nbsp;segment</p>  You can’t spend your way out of poverty — you have to increase&nbsp;income!  <p>One area the group went into in some depth was whether models that increase income could break the logic above. Digital services that include remittances, gig work platforms, marketplaces where SMEs can be sellers, and productive lending all potentially increase income and thus don’t depend as much on the initial income of the user (in fact, they increase it). We believe these models should be pursued aggressively by the development sector to the extent it can be shown any of these models increase welfare along with increasing income (many rigorous studies within the microcredit sector have not shown increases in welfare from productive lending, for example, despite the narrative that they were a way for low income people to pull themselves out of poverty).</p><p>2. The development sector could use a strategic repositioning from financial inclusion towards digital livelihoods</p><p>Some of the participants noted a trend of development actors pivoting away from financial inclusion as an example of a strategy focusing on delivering a service via for-profit providers to low-income populations. As one participant noted: “We did focus groups at some point and financial services was never anything the poor asked for. They ask over and over for jobs and ways to increase income.” So that participant’s organization is now more focused on broader financial sector development that will lead to increased economic growth and therefore jobs.</p><p>The group noted a number of development actors who had undergone similar strategic repositionings towards digital livelihoods or jobs. Often the repositioning was towards digital livelihoods, including platform marketplaces where people can go to find gig work (e.g. Uber, Gojek, Upwork) or seller marketplaces (e.g. Alibaba, Jumia) or a wider range of informal digital livelihoods (MSMEs who transact over WhatsApp or Facebook). Many of these opportunities are new and seem to present significant opportunities, though the potential downsides of the digital platform economy are also important to understand. Caribou Digital maintains a site with a trove of research and references in this new area called <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">Platform Livelihoods</a> and DFS Lab has looked at the Indonesian landscape in this area&nbsp;<a href="https://dfslab.net/our-research/">here</a>.</p><p>Finally, there was some discussion about what would be difficult about such a transition for many donors. Even if it does turn out livelihoods have a better business model and are what people actually want, it can be hard for donors to move in this direction. Since livelihoods cut across sectors, donors will need to understand multiple sectors at once, as well as the fast-moving dynamics of digital platform economies. It can also be more nuanced because dealing with digital platforms has potential positives and negatives where data privacy, working conditions, and the general balance of power is tilted in favor of platforms in setting the terms of engagement with workers or sellers. These nuances can be hard to navigate. For donors and governments it is relatively easy to defend giving a digital savings account, and harder to justify demanding gig-work with relatively low wages (even if this is clearly something that the workers benefit immensely from and want because it improves their&nbsp;lives).</p> What do we take away from this exercise? <p>This data helps quantify some of the key reasons most startups and technology companies as well as more traditional corporations target only a relatively small subset of the population at the higher end of the income spectrum in&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>In doing so, it also calls into question the notion that funding innovation or subsidizing the private sector in other ways will result in reaching the lower-income population. Realistic levels of customer acquisition costs may make much of this population unprofitable to serve regardless of the model or the technology. And, even if they are feasible, for-profit models will almost always be pushed by incentives to focus their marketing on the population above key global poverty line measures (e.g. $1.90 or $3.10) and potentially even try to discourage lower income people from using their services (especially if the total cost to acquire and serve make those people unprofitable).</p><p>In light of this logic, one of the areas our group identified as high potential for further research and donor intervention was digital livelihoods which give people a chance to improve their income directly. We hope to see more work in this area down the&nbsp;road.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/what-are-the-limits-of-the-private-sector-in-serving-the-poor-3ee9a9a468fc">What are the limits of the private sector in serving the poor?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is a guest post featuring Vadim Slavin, director of the credentials platform at GlobaliD.</p><p>“So what is your digital trust halo?” — you ask. It is the combination of different traits and qualities of your digital footprint comprising your digital identity.</p><p>“Can you be more&nbsp;… umm… clear?” I’ll&nbsp;try.</p>Image: James St.&nbsp;Louis Your trust halo is the amount of trust others attribute to your identity&nbsp;online. <p>Consider a Facebook profile requesting access to your Facebook group. The profile was created yesterday and already has 300 friends. Take a look at another one. It was created 11 years ago and has a long history of Facebook posts, friends commenting on its feed, and a carefully curated album of travels around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Both of these are someone’s identities. Which of these will you trust more? You instinctively assess the trust halo of each profile/identity to answer this question.</p><p>So how can we distill this instinctive measure into a formulated approach?</p><p>Consider the following 7 attributes which help determine the size of the trust halo of your digital identity. As you read about these, think about your own identity, digital or not, and how these concepts apply to&nbsp;it.</p> Community. <p>From the early days of human collectivization, the participation in a community has been a great indication of trust. A new member of the tribe would not be trusted as much as older&nbsp;members.</p><p>A smaller community enables greater visibility and transparency. Collectively, members of the community who know us well can vouch for us and can quickly call out behavior not typically attributed to us. One can suppose that in a digital community, the longer you stay a part of it, the longer the members&nbsp;… tolerate your presence, the more trust one can attribute to your&nbsp;persona.</p><p>Of course it all depends on each particular case:</p>  how long you have been a&nbsp;member  how reputable the group&nbsp;is  how selective the group was to admit&nbsp;you  how engaged you have been to be visible to the group (see&nbsp;below)   Engagement. <p>The collective reputation of the community will influence your trust halo more if you are an active member of this community. This means that engagement and visibility will greatly enhance the trust attributed to your presence in this community (see&nbsp;below).</p> Leadership. <p>The ultimate measure of trust transferable to your identity is whether you actually started the community which others consider reputable. Have you heard of a fella by the name of Brian Epstein [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Beatle">ref</a>]? Would you ever trust the management of your band to this guy? Now look him up. How about&nbsp;now?</p> Reputation. <p>Perhaps nothing is more synonymous with trust than reputation. It is easier to earn reputation through engagement and leadership in a community. Reputation speaks not only about who vouches for you, it is also about what you have done. Perhaps it’s the predictions you made that came true, or maybe it’s the people you helped that are grateful or the length of time you kept your reputation unspoiled.</p> Vouches. <p>What is the best way to represent your reputation? Get vouched by someone who has a great deal of it themselves. Part of that reputation may just rub off on you. But be careful, negative reputation is transferable via a vouch as&nbsp;well.</p> Investment. <p>Yes, you can invest in your identity—curate it, build your reputation over time, avoid unnecessary confrontation and backlashes, and protect it from takeover by malicious actors. You have a LinkedIn account for 10 years with a healthy pattern of recommendations? There is more trust in whether this account is real. Why? Because you showed proof of&nbsp;work!</p> Verifications. <p>Last but not least — verifications. What can you prove about yourself or what others, trusted by the community, can prove about you. Have a real passport verified? It matches your verified driver’s license and a selfie you just took? What if you can verify that the face on the passport matches the face most commonly found on your account’s pictures? Now we’re&nbsp;talking.</p><p>Can you be trusted not to say mean things online? Not directly, but hey, if you value your identity, if you built a reputation and invested in your digital footprint, you are more likely to be a good guy with your real information verified rather than a bad&nbsp;actor.</p><p>Final thoughts. No single factor will influence your trust halo. Just like there isn’t a single definition of trust — it’s in the eye of beholder. Trusting someone to predict the rise and fall of the XRP isn’t the same as trusting someone not to pretend to be someone else. And yet, you can’t help but score each identity you come across online according to some formula. Just like everyone else does to&nbsp;you.</p><p>Have any notes on how you manage YOUR trust halo? Share! Remember, participation counts.&nbsp;:)</p><p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/veeslavin">Vadim on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/what-determines-your-digital-trust-halo-6448e2095fd2">What determines your digital trust halo?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>A 2020&nbsp;<a>report</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;The Brookings Institution’s Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology (AIET) Initiative says,&nbsp;“As artificial intelligence evolves, it magnifies the ability to use personal information in ways that can intrude on privacy interests by raising analysis of personal information to new levels of power and speed.”</p>



<p>And then we have the human factor. Despite knowing the risks to their privacy and safety from leaving their&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital exhaust</a>&nbsp;unchecked, many consumers fail to take any sort of remedial action (such as using&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>).&nbsp;This is known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404818303031">privacy paradox</a>, that disconnect between&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer concerns</a>&nbsp;about privacy and their actual actions to protect it. Users can make all sorts of other privacy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/human-error-cybersecurity-stats/">missteps</a>&nbsp;too, like falling for phishing and other scams, failing to properly secure accounts with strong and unique passwords and 2FA, mishandling sensitive corporate information, and using unsecured Wi-Fi networks. As long as humans are fallible, a comprehensive privacy solution will remain elusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020 we made some optimistic but cautionary&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">predictions</a>&nbsp;for privacy out to 2030. We believe the next eight or nine years can bring step change towards a brighter privacy future, but a neat package of solutions tied with a bow, not so much. Any one of the factors at play—</p>



  the data collecting machines and the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">business models</a>&nbsp;driving them  consumer rights and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">expectations</a>  <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">regulatory advancements</a>  <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">criminal activity</a>  corporate social responsibility  the rise of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/07/the-business-benefits-from-using-decentralized-identity-technologies-for-customer-identity-management/">decentralized identities</a>  ongoing fallout from&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/businesses-face-rising-cybersecurity-risks-from-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>  



<p>—could change the privacy game at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>No privacy system is perfect. That’s the basis of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>&nbsp;as a data (and military) protection strategy: no system is perfect, breaches are always possible, so it’s wise to manage the risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So long as change is constant, humans are humans, and capitalism is alive and well, the privacy problem can never be fully solved. And with no airtight privacy solution in sight, consumers won’t have much choice but to protect their own data privacy. Risks to privacy and safety will increasingly become the cost of admission to the digital landscape. And&nbsp;tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and the capabilities in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, our business toolkit for rapidly deploying branded privacy and cybersecurity solutions, will thus become essential.</p>

			 DeFi vs Regulation: Round One<br>
 
<p>Due to their decentralized nature, the crypto and DeFi markets have always been complicated subjects when it comes to legislation.</p>
<p>It is currently becoming a big mess: in the last few months, we have seen legislators in Europe, and more recently in the US, struggling to bring compliance and control in the space, mostly because they are trying to regulate wallets like bank accounts. Let me tell you: it is not going to work that way. Blockchain participants are not financial institutions and the information is either private or public, for all participants. If a law is not applicable, I guess it loses its meaning at some point.</p>
<p>Debates about the Infrastructure Bill in the US are really fun (and scary) to follow because the capabilities of the technology are not considered at all. How could blockchain participants declare to the IRS if they don’t know who their counterparties are? In the same way, discussions about MiCA and new rules for AML in Europe are going in the wrong direction. Why? Because wallets are actually browsers for the internet of value, not vaults. Controlling your own wallet (as a sole owner of the private key) doesn’t prevent other parties from sending tokens to you, or even taking them back! Wallets don’t contain the tokens, they are just access points. What if someone else (person or smart contract) has access as well?</p>
<p>So, what is the solution? The answer is simple: identities on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Let’s dream about a secure system to identify investors, agents, assets, and things on the blockchain. This system would ensure the confidentiality of data, and at the same time, ensure the eligibility of the identity owners for the permissioned tokens or permissioned DeFi protocols they want to use. One or several wallets could be connected to each onchain identity. It would act as a compliance layer on top of wallets.</p>
<p>The good news is that we have made this system, it’s called <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchainid/">ONCHAINID</a>. It is already used for the management of €8B+ of tokenized compliant and controllable securities on public blockchain networks.</p>
<p>ONCHAINID is a blockchain-based identity system that allows users to create and manage self-sovereign identities on DLT. This identification solution allows the enforcement of regulatory legal and other compliance processes and rules on digital assets or on any other web-based system that requires identity validation. The main added value of ONCHAINID is that it enables compliance and identity verifications within the pseudonymous framework of public blockchain networks.</p>

Collators are located in orange coloured&nbsp;areas.<p>13 August 2021, Berlin — KILT Protocol today announced the selection of the first 16 collators that will comprise the Initial Collators Programme. This cohort represents a distributed network of collators from around the world who are well known in the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems.</p><p>The number of active collators will gradually increase to 75 after KILT’s mainnet launch, and become permissionless as the network matures. The Initial Collators include:</p>  <a href="https://botlabs.org/">BOTLabs GmbH</a>,&nbsp;Germany  B.T.E BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH,&nbsp;Germany  Canontech, Switzerland  <a href="https://twitter.com/__c0d3">Cody King</a> of Codenode, Canada  <a href="http://www.dwellir.com/">Dwellir AB</a>,&nbsp;Sweden  <a href="https://galaniprojects.de/">galaniprojects GmbH</a>,&nbsp;Germany  <a href="https://zcloak.network/">Glacier Blockchain Technology Co.</a>, Ltd.,&nbsp;China  <a href="https://martin222.medium.com/">Martin</a>, Germany  Pacobits of <a href="https://stakely.io/">Stakely</a>,&nbsp;Spain  Petr of <a href="https://polkadotters.medium.com/">Polkadotters</a>, Czech&nbsp;Republic  Shez of <a href="https://www.staking4all.org/">Staking4All</a>, South&nbsp;Africa  Skedley, Germany  <a href="https://stakenode.medium.com">STAKENODE</a>, Poland  <a href="https://stakin.com/home">Stakin</a>, Estonia  Tjwelde, Germany  Yarco Hayduk of <a href="http://pragma-invest.com/">Pragma Ventures</a>, Ukraine  <p>KILT’s mainnet will launch after it secures a Kusama parachain slot. As mentioned in our earlier <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilts-parachain-plans-an-update-efb9a9e35394">blog post</a>, KILT’s parachain will include staking and our <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-token-economy-an-update-db207611f5ce">initial token economy</a> at launch. This means the first phase of staking will be possible on KILT from&nbsp;genesis.</p><p>To prepare for KILT’s launch, we selected and onboarded this first group of collators over recent weeks. In the near future we anticipate the number of collators will be gradually increased to 75 active collators, with a possible maximum of 150 collators (active and candidates). Collator selection will become permissionless when decided by governance, after the Sudo key is removed and KILT is decentralised.</p> Collator and Delegator Framework <p>Kusama uses a Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) system, with validators securing the Relay Chain and validating blocks. KILT uses a modified version of DPoS called <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-continuing-evolution-of-kilt-protocol-limited-delegated-proof-of-stake-640403427c48">Limited Delegated Proof of Stake</a> (LDPoS). In this system, collator nodes hold the data of the blockchain, collect transactions and build&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Delegators can choose a collator to back with their stake, thus increasing the total stake on that collator. One collator can have a maximum of 25 delegators backing them, where delegators with higher stakes for one collator displace delegators with smaller amounts at stake for the same collator.</p><p>Block rewards go to the collator who produces an actual block, and their delegators. By putting their stake on a collator, delegators signal their trust in quality performers. As recognition for bootstrapping and maintaining the system, the delegator rewards are higher in the first years and then decrease as&nbsp;follows:</p>  At the start, collators receive rewards up to 10% per annum on their stake from the first year. The reward rate decreases by 2% per year (which would mean that in the second year, the rewards will be up to 9.8% per&nbsp;annum).  Delegators receive rewards up to 8% per annum on their stake in the first year, 6% in the second year. From the beginning of the third year there will be no reward for delegators, as it is anticipated that by then other KILT functions will be in place that will provide opportunities for token holders to support the system and earn&nbsp;rewards.  <p>We chose this LDPoS mechanism as part of a carefully-considered token economy that aims to have relatively low inflation, starting at 5% and decreasing to 1% within the first 6 years and slowly moving to 0% afterwards.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials for Web 3.0. KILT enables innovative business models around identity and privacy, addressing the need for reliable identity solutions in the digital world. It allows users to claim personal attributes, have them attested by trusted entities, and store the claims as self-sovereign credentials. KILT Protocol is developed by BOTLabs GmbH in Berlin and is the technology on which SocialKYC, a decentralised identity verification service, is&nbsp;built.</p><p>Press contacts:</p><p>Christine Mohan, christine@kilt.io</p><p>Elisa Dratsdrummer, elisa@kilt.io</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-first-cohort-of-kilts-initial-collators-programme-4e4b65159246">Announcing First Cohort of KILT’s Initial Collators Programme</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Blockchain and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI) are often talked about as complementing technologies. But do you really need blockchain to enable&nbsp;SSI?</p><p>Before we answer this question, it merits to note that SSI is a digital movement that aims to enable individuals or organizations to have sole ownership of their identity, and to have control over how their data is shared and used. It functions on cryptographic key pairs which can be based on blockchain technologies.</p><p>As always, let’s answer this question with an&nbsp;example.</p><p>Frank is a traveler who is going on a vacation from Singapore to Germany. As per the existing government norms, he has to be fully vaccinated to board the flight. He is eligible to travel but has to present his vaccination details to the airport authorities to get the boarding&nbsp;pass.</p><p>So, there are three parties involved here — the healthcare facility that issued vaccination details (<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>), Frank, and the airport official who will check the credential. In other words, the healthcare facility is the issuer of a credential, Frank is the owner, and the airport official is the verifier.</p><p>Now, let’s get down to the implementation. How can the airport official verify the credibility of Frank’s vaccination, given that the healthcare facility is not in the same network as that of the verifier?</p><p>One possibility is to use blockchain technology to store the credential because it is immutable and&nbsp;secure.</p> Using Blockchain for&nbsp;SSI <p>No discussion of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> is ever complete without questions about blockchain. This is because blockchain provides the perfect alternative to centralized repositories as the credentials can be stored on blocks and linked to the larger&nbsp;network.</p><p>Since the blockchain network is spread across multiple computers, there’s no single owner. Also, the very nature of blockchain makes it impossible to change data, and this means you have high levels of online security and credibility.</p><p>In all, blockchain is a secure way to store and share your credentials and be in complete control of your data at all times, thereby enabling&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>That said, blockchain is not the only option for enabling SSI as there are other ways of implementing it such as IPFS, DID anchoring, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/peer-dids-an-off-ledger-did-implementation-5cb6ee6eb168">peer DIDs</a>, public-key cryptography, and more. You can even use gateways to avoid interacting with blockchains directly.</p><p>To give you an idea, let’s look at how <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">public-key cryptography</a> is used for enabling&nbsp;SSI.</p> Using Public Key Cryptography <p>Public key cryptography secures the communication among entities, and in the process, enables the implementation of&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>Here’s a brief workflow of how it&nbsp;works.</p>  The healthcare facility issues the credential and signs it with its private key, and encrypts it with Frank’s public&nbsp;key.  Frank decrypts the credential using his private key and stores it in his digital wallet. When it’s time to present it to the airport authorities, he signs it with his private key and encrypts it with the verifier’s public&nbsp;key.  Finally, the verifier decrypts the credential using its private key and validates both the holder and the issuer using their respective public&nbsp;keys.  <p>As you can see, blockchain is not needed to implement SSI&nbsp;here.</p> Using IPFS <p>Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a versioned file system that stores files and tracks their versions. It is a distributed file network where the file URL of the actual file is shared among&nbsp;users.</p><p>For example, let’s say the vaccination details are stored in /ipfs/ZTmu48720mlp/vaccinations/frank.txt and this file can be shared directly with the concerned authorities. Here, the URL is similar to HTTP requests, except that the actual file name is used instead of the location where it is stored. Here, the cryptographic hash on the file is a part of the URL, and this is also what secures its contents.</p><p>Blockchain is not needed here as&nbsp;well.</p> Using Peer&nbsp;DIDs <p>In a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/peer-dids-an-off-ledger-did-implementation-5cb6ee6eb168">peer DID</a>, there’s no network involved. Here, the healthcare center creates a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifier</a> (DID), puts it in a DID document, and sends it directly to the airport authority. Likewise, the airport authority creates a DID, puts it in a DID document, and sends the doc to the healthcare facility</p><p>So, both entities create their records and send the metadata of their records to each other, so one can use that metadata to look up the record of the other. This information can also be cryptographically encrypted for security.</p><p>Again, no blockchain here.</p><p>To conclude, blockchain can be used for enabling SSI, but it is not the only way to implement SSI. The choice depends on the company/developer who is implementing it.</p><p>We hope this will get you thinking about enabling SSI using an option that best suits your application or business requirement.

  <p>Modern applications must work smoothly on high loads and with a high number of concurrent users. Traditional Java applications run blocking code and a common approach for scaling is to increase the number of available threads. When latency comes into the picture, many of these additional threads sit idle, wasting resources.</p>

<p>A different approach increases efficiency by writing asynchronous non-blocking code that lets the execution switch to another task while the asynchronous process completes.</p>

<p>Project Reactor is a Java framework from VMware that implements the <a href="https://www.reactive-streams.org/">Reactive Streams</a> specification. This initiative provides a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure for the JVM and JavaScript runtimes. It is the foundation of the reactive stack in the Spring ecosystem and WebFlux applications. Some studies suggest that performance differences are negligible in Spring applications unless the application makes more than 500 API requests per second. Thus, it’s not mandatory to do asynchronous programming, but it is the right approach for specific use cases.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll summarize some core Reactor concepts, introduce the Scheduler abstraction, and describe how it is used to encapsulate blocking code and prevent Java reactive applications from stalling.</p>

 Reactor Execution Model 

<p>Reactor is an API for doing asynchronous programming. You describe your data processing as a flow of operators, composing a data-processing pipeline.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Using the assembly line analogy, the initial data flow from a source, known as the <code>Publisher</code>, goes through transformation steps and eventually the result is pushed to a consumer, known as the <code>Subscriber</code>. A <code>Publisher</code> produces data, and a  <code>Subscriber</code> listens to it. Reactor also supports flow control via backpressure, so a <code>Subscriber</code> can signal the volume it’s able to consume.</p>

 Nothing Happens Until You Subscribe 

<p>In general, when you instantiate a <code>Publisher</code> (a <code>Flux</code> or a <code>Mono</code>) you are describing an asynchronous processing pipeline. When combining operators, no processing happens–you are describing the intent. This is called assembly time. You only trigger the data flow through that pipeline when you <code>subscribe</code>. The <code>subscribe</code> call emits a signal back to the source, and the source starts emitting data that flows through the pipeline. This is called execution time or subscription time.</p>

<p>A cold publisher generates data for each subscription. Then, if you subscribe twice, it will generate the data twice. All the examples that follow below will instantiate cold publishers. On the other hand, a hot publisher starts emitting data immediately or on the first subscription. Late subscribers receive data emitted after they subscribe. For the family of hot publishers, something does indeed happen before you subscribe.</p>

 Operators <code>map</code> and <code>flatMap</code> 

<p>Operators are like workstations in an assembly line. They make it possible to describe transformations or intermediate steps along the processing chain. Each operator is a decorator, it wraps the previous <code>Publisher</code> into a new instance. To avoid mistakes, the preferred way of using operators is to chain the calls. Apply the next operator to the last operator’s result. Some operators are instance methods and others are static methods.</p>

<p>Both <code>map()</code> and <code>flatMap()</code> are instance method operators. You might be familiar with the concept of these operations from functional programming or Java Streams. In the reactive world, they have their own semantics.</p>

<p>The <code>map()</code> method transforms the emitted items by applying a synchronous function to each item, on a one-to-one basis. Check the example below:</p>

   <code>public class MapTest {

    private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MapTest.class);

    @Test
    public void mapTest() {
        Flux.range(1, 5)
                .map(v -&gt; transform(v))
                .subscribe(y -&gt; logger.info(y));

    }

    private String transform(Integer i){
        return  String.format("%03d", i);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Note: You can find this test and all the code in this tutorial in <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-reactive-service-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>In the code above, a flux is created from a range of integers from 1 to 5. The <code>map()</code> operator is passed a transformation function that formats with leading zeros. Notice that the return type of the transform method is not a publisher and the transformation is synchronous–a simple method call. The transformation function must not introduce latency.</p>

<p>The <code>flatMap()</code> method transforms the emitted items asynchronously into Publishers, then flattens these inner publishers into a single <code>Flux</code> through merging, and the items can interleave. This operator does not necessarily preserve original ordering. The mapper function passed to <code>flatMap()</code> transforms the input sequence into N sequences. This operator is suitable for running an asynchronous task for each item.</p>

<p>In the example below, a list of words is mapped to its phonetics through the Dictionary API, using <code>flatMap()</code>.</p>

   <code>@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class FlatMapTest {

    private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FlatMapTest.class);

    public static class Word {

        private String word;

<p>There is a rich vocabulary of operators for <code>Flux</code> and <code>Mono</code> you can find in the reference documentation. This handy guide can help you choose the right operator: <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#which-operator">“Which operator do I need?”</a>.</p>

 Reactor Schedulers for Switching the Thread 

<p>Project Reactor provides the tools for fine-tuning the asynchronous processing in terms of threads and execution context.</p>

<p>The <code>Scheduler</code> is an abstraction on top of the <code>ExecutionService</code>, which allows submitting a task immediately, after a delay or at a fixed time rate. We’ll share some examples below of the various default schedulers provided. The execution context is defined by the <code>Scheduler</code> selection.</p>

<p>Schedulers are selected through <code>subscribeOn()</code> and <code>publishOn()</code> operators, they switch the execution context. <code>subscribeOn()</code> changes the thread where the source actually starts generating data. It changes the root of the chain, affecting the preceding operators, upstream in the chain; and also affects subsequent operators.</p>

<p>Using <code>publishOn()</code> switches the context for the following operators in the pipeline description, downstream in the chain, overriding any the scheduler assigned with <code>subscribeOn()</code>.</p>

<p>The scheduler examples ahead will use <code>TestUtils.debug</code> for logging the thread name, function, and element:</p>

   <code>public class TestUtils {

    public static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(TestUtils.class);

    public static &lt;T&gt; T debug(T el, String function) {
        logger.info("element "+ el + " [" + function + "]");
        return el;
    }
}
</code>   
 No Execution Context 

<p><code>Schedulers.immediate()</code> can be seen as the no-op scheduler, which the pipeline executes in the current thread.</p>

   <code>@Test
public void immediateTest() {

    logger.info("Schedulers.immediate()");

    Flux.range(1, 5)
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v, "map"))
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.immediate())
            .subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe"));
}
</code>   

<p>The test above will log something similar to:</p>

 <code>2021-07-29 09:36:05.905 - INFO [main] - element "1" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "1" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "2" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "2" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "3" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "3" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "4" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "4" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "5" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "5" [subscribe]
</code> 

<p>Everything executes in the main thread.</p>

 Single Reusable Thread 

   <code>@Test
public void singleTest() throws InterruptedException {

    logger.info("Schedulers.single()");

    Flux.range(1, 5)
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v, "map"))
            .publishOn(Schedulers.single())
            .subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}
</code>   

<p>When running the test above, you will see a log similar to this:</p>

 <code>2021-07-13 23:19:16.456 - INFO [main] - element 1 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 2 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 3 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 4 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 5 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [single-1] - element 1 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.465 - INFO [single-1] - element 2 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.465 - INFO [single-1] - element 3 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.466 - INFO [single-1] - element 4 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.466 - INFO [single-1] - element 5 [subscribe]
</code> 

<p>As you can see, the <code>map()</code> function executes in the main thread, and the consumer code passed to <code>subscribe()</code> executes in the single-1 thread. Everything after the <code>publishOn()</code> will execute in the passed scheduler.</p>

<p>You may have noticed there is a <code>Thread.sleep()</code> call at the end of the test. As part of the work is passed to another thread, the <code>sleep()</code> call delays the application exit, so the worker thread can complete the task.</p>

 Bounded Elastic Thread Pool 

<p>A bounded elastic thread pool is a better choice for I/O blocking work, for example, reading a file, or making a blocking network call. It serves to help with legacy blocking code if it cannot be avoided.</p>

   <code>@Test
public void boundedElasticTest() throws InterruptedException {

    logger.info("Schedulers.boundedElastic()");

    List&lt;String&gt; words = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    words.add("a.txt");
    words.add("b.txt");
    words.add("c.txt");
    Flux flux = Flux.fromArray(words.toArray(new String[0]))
            .publishOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
            .map(w -&gt; scanFile(debug(w, "map")));

    flux.subscribe(y -&gt; debug(y, "subscribe1"));
    flux.subscribe(y -&gt; debug(y, "subscribe2"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}

public String scanFile(String filename){

    InputStream stream = getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(filename);
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(stream);
    String line = scanner.nextLine();
    scanner.close();

    return line;
}
</code>   

<p>The test above should log something similar to this:</p>

 <code>2021-07-15 00:41:51.443 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "a.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.443 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "a.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.446 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "A line in file a.txt" [subscribe2]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.447 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "b.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.447 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "A line in file b.txt" [subscribe2]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.447 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "c.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.448 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "A line in file c.txt" [subscribe2]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.448 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "A line in file a.txt" [subscribe1]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.449 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "b.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.451 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "A line in file b.txt" [subscribe1]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.452 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "c.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.453 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "A line in file c.txt" [subscribe1]
</code> 

<p>As you can see in the code above, the <code>flux()</code> is subscribed twice. As the <code>publishOn()</code> is invoked before any operator, everything will execute in the context of a bounded elastic thread. Also, notice how the execution from both subscriptions can interleave.</p>

<p>What might be confusing is that each subscription is assigned one bounded elastic thread for the whole execution. So in this case, “subscription1” executed in boundedElastic-1 and “subscription2” executed in boundedElastic-2. All operations for a given subscription execute in the same thread.</p>

<p>The instantiation of the <code>Flux</code> above produced a Cold Publisher, a publisher that generates data anew for each subscription. That’s why both subscriptions above process all the values.</p>

 Fixed Pool of Workers 

<p><code>Schedulers.parallel()</code> provides a pool of workers tuned for parallel work, with as many workers as there are CPU cores.</p>

   <code>@Test
public void parallelTest() throws InterruptedException {

    logger.info("Schedulers.parallel()");

    Flux flux = Flux.range(1, 5)
            .publishOn(Schedulers.parallel())
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v, "map"));

    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe1"));
    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe2"));
    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe3"));
    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe4"));
    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe5"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}
</code>   

<p>The test above will log something similar to the following lines:</p>

 <code>2021-07-15 22:57:33.435 - INFO [parallel-2] - element "1" [map]

</code> 

<p>As you can see, different subscription executions interleave, and as I am testing with only four CPU cores, four workers seem to be available: parallel-1, parallel-2, parallel-3, and parallel-4. The <code>subscription5</code> operations, execute in parallel-1.</p>

<p>Again, observe how all operations for a given subscription are executed in the same thread.</p>

 Using Both <code>publishOn</code> and <code>subscribeOn</code> 

<p>When the <code>publishOn()</code> and <code>subscribeOn()</code> operators are used, the <code>subscribe</code> call accepts a consumer. The consumer will execute in the context selected by <code>publishOn()</code>, which defines the scheduler for downstream processing, including the consumer execution. At first, this might be confusing to understand, so check the following example:</p>

   <code>@Test
public void subscribeOnWithPublishOnTest() throws InterruptedException {
    Flux.range(1, 3)
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v, "map1"))
            .publishOn(Schedulers.parallel())
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v * 100, "map2"))
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
            .subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}
</code>   

<p>The log should look like the following lines:</p>

   <code>2021-07-29 08:40:30.583 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "1" [map1]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.584 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "100" [map2]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "100" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "2" [map1]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "200" [map2]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "200" [subscribe]
...
</code>   

<p>As you can see, the first <code>map()</code> operator executes in the boundedElastic-1 thread, the second <code>map()</code> operator and the <code>subscribe()</code> consumer execute in the parallel-1 thread. Notice that the <code>subscribeOn()</code> operator is invoked after <code>publishOn()</code>, but it affects the root of the chain and the operators preceding <code>publishOn()</code> anyways.</p>

<p>A probably simplified <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#howtoReadMarbles">marble diagam</a> for the example above might look like this:</p>

 Reactive Java Spring Services 

<p>In Spring WebFlux, it is assumed applications don’t block, so non-blocking servers use a small fixed-size thread pool to handle requests, named event loop workers.</p>

<p>In an ideal reactive scenario, all the architecture components are non-blocking, so there is no need to worry about the event loop freezing up (reactor meltdown). But sometimes, you will have to deal with legacy blocking code, or blocking libraries.</p>

<p>So now, let’s experiment with Reactor Schedulers in a Reactive Java application. Create a Spring WebFlux service with Okta security. The service will expose an endpoint to return a random integer.</p>

<p>The implementation will call Java <code>SecureRandom</code> blocking code. Start by downloading a Spring Boot Maven project using <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a>. You can do it with the following HTTPie command:</p>

   <code>http -d https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  bootVersion==2.5.3 \
  baseDir==reactive-service \
  groupId==com.okta.developer.reactive \
  artifactId==reactive-service \
  name==reactive-service \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.reactive \
  javaVersion==11 \
  dependencies==webflux,okta
</code>   

<p>Unzip the project:</p>

   <code>unzip reactive-service.zip
cd reactive-service
</code>   

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.reactive.service</code>, and add the <code>SecureRandomService</code> interface:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.service;

import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

public interface SecureRandomService {

    Mono&lt;Integer&gt; getRandomInt();
}
</code>   

<p>And the implementation <code>SecureRandomServiceImpl</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.service;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

import java.security.SecureRandom;

@Service
public class SecureRandomServiceImpl implements SecureRandomService {

    private SecureRandom secureRandom;

    public SecureRandomServiceImpl() {
        secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
    }

    @Override
    public Mono&lt;Integer&gt; getRandomInt() {
        return Mono.just(secureRandom.nextInt());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Think for a moment about the <code>getRandomInt()</code> implementation. It’s hard to resist the temptation to wrap anything whatsoever in a publisher. <code>Mono.just(T data)</code> creates a <code>Mono</code> that will emit the specified item. But the item is captured at instantiation time. This will invoke the blocking code at assembly time, perhaps in the context of an event loop thread.</p>

<p>For now, let’s move forward to create the package <code>com.okta.developer.reactive.controller</code>, and add a <code>SecureRandom</code> class for the data:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.controller;

public class SecureRandom {

    private String value;

    public String getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void setValue(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public SecureRandom(Integer value){
        this.value = value.toString();
    }
}
</code>   
<p>Create the <code>SecureRandomController</code> class:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.controller;

import com.okta.developer.reactive.service.SecureRandomService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@RestController
public class SecureRandomController {

    @Autowired
    private SecureRandomService secureRandomService;


    @GetMapping("/random")
    public Mono&lt;SecureRandom&gt; getSecureRandom(){
        return secureRandomService.getRandomInt().map(i -&gt; new SecureRandom(i));
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add <code>spring-security-test</code> dependency to the pom:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>SecureRandomControllerTest</code>:</p>
   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.controller;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.AutoConfigureWebTestClient;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.ActiveProfiles;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

import static org.springframework.security.test.web.reactive.server.SecurityMockServerConfigurers.mockOidcLogin;

@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class SecureRandomControllerTest {

    @Autowired
    private WebTestClient webTestClient;

    @Test
    public void testGetSecureRandom() {
        webTestClient.mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())
            .get()
            .uri("/random")
            .exchange()
            .expectStatus().isOk();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run with:</p>
   <code>./mvnw test -Dtest=SecureRandomControllerTest
</code>   
<p>The test should pass, but how can you make sure the REST call won’t freeze up the service’s event loop? Use <a href="https://github.com/reactor/BlockHound">BlockHound</a>!. Blockhound is a Java agent that detects blocking calls from non-blocking threads, has built-in integration with Project Reactor, and supports the JUnit platform.</p>

<p>Add the Blockhound dependency to the <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.projectreactor.tools&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;blockhound-junit-platform&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.0.6.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>It has been reported that when <a href="https://github.com/reactor/BlockHound/issues/173">Spring Security is enabled, BlockHound does not detect blocking calls</a>.</p>

<p>Disable security for the test profile. Add the file <code>src/test/resources/application-test.yml</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>spring:
  autoconfigure:
    exclude:
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.client.reactive.ReactiveOAuth2ClientAutoConfiguration
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.resource.reactive.ReactiveOAuth2ResourceServerAutoConfiguration
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.reactive.ReactiveSecurityAutoConfiguration
</code>   

<p>Rerun the test, and you should see the following error:</p>

 <code>reactor.blockhound.BlockingOperationError: Blocking call! java.io.FileInputStream#readBytes
	at java.base/java.io.FileInputStream.readBytes(FileInputStream.java) ~[na:na]
	Suppressed: reactor.core.publisher.FluxOnAssembly$OnAssemblyException:

</code> 

<p>As the log above shows, <code>SecureRandom.next()</code> produces a call to <code>FileInputStream.readBytes()</code>, which is blocking.</p>

<p>The <code>SecureRandomService</code> returns a <code>Mono</code> publisher, but it is an Impostor Reactive Service!</p>

   <code>return Mono.just(secureRandom.nextInt());
</code>   

<p>The implementation above has logic up front, first the calculation <code>secureRandom.nextInt()</code> and then the assembly.</p>

<p>What is the right way to wrap a blocking call? Make the work happen in another scheduler.</p>

 Encapsulation of Blocking Calls 

<p>Blocking encapsulation needs to happen down into the service, as explained in the <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#faq.wrap-blocking">Reactor documentation</a>. The scheduler assignment must also happen inside the implementation.</p>

<p>Create the class <code>SecureRandomReactiveImpl</code>.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.service;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;
import reactor.core.scheduler.Schedulers;

import java.security.SecureRandom;

@Service
@Primary
public class SecureRandomReactiveImpl implements SecureRandomService {

    private SecureRandom secureRandom;

    public SecureRandomReactiveImpl() {
        secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
    }

    @Override
    public Mono&lt;Integer&gt; getRandomInt() {
        return Mono.fromCallable(secureRandom::nextInt)
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run the test again and the BlockHound exception should not happen. Avoid the logic up front and assemble the pipeline. Everything should be fine.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s do an end-to-end test. Run the application with Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080/random</code> and you should see the Okta sign in page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sign in with your Okta account and you should see a response similar to this:</p>

   <code>{
  "value": "-611020335"
}
</code>

 Interview CFO of Credify MAURIZIO RAFFONE 



<p>With over 20 years of experience in capital markets and international finance, Maurizio Raffone had worked in various leading roles at renowned banks and in different environments including corporates, academics, and start-ups. Thus, he has been witnessing the development of global finance through diverse lenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing such potential of Fintech development, Maurizio Raffone has been taking a role as a Fintech consultant, and now, he is our Chief Financial Officer at Credify. In this interview, we had a discussion with him about the impacts of the pandemic on the global financial market and the opportunities for Fintech’s development in this period. In addition,&nbsp; Maurizio Raffone also shares some lessons that we could learn from developed countries to revive emerging markets.</p>



”..it is truly game-changing, putting the user firmly at the center of all innovation.”



 How does the global financial market react under the impact of COVID-19? 



<p>Global financial markets have been incredibly resilient in the face of the pandemic. Stock markets are solidly up, there has not been any banking crisis and we have seen continued investments in privately-funded companies. This has been mainly thanks to an aggressive monetary policy and fiscal support by many of the leading world economies.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the actions that the global financial market has been taking in order to overcome the COVID recession? 



<p>Leading central banks have been pumping money into their economies for years and as this was about to slow down, COVID hit and their loose monetary policies were extended. I think it is a bit more difficult for emerging economies to match the developed countries’ strategies, however, they indirectly benefit from them too, given developed markets are open for exports and corporates continue their global investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my opinion, emerging markets’ governments need to take this opportunity to support the rapid modernization of the regulatory, financial, and technology infrastructure of their countries, in order to implement leaner and more efficient means of economic growth. The key to successfully combating the COVID-induced difficulties is to make it easier to do business for people and companies.</p>







 Please share your opinions on the role of Fintech in recovering and developing developed countries’ financial market during and post COVID-19. 



<p>Fintech firms can play a crucial role in kick-starting the economy and ensuring less privileged people can also improve their economic situation. Access to credit, for example, is fundamental for people and businesses at a time of economic hardship: I believe fintech companies can help by being able to provide support when perhaps some of the traditional financial institutions aren’t willing or capable to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not because fintech companies necessarily take more risks than traditional lenders, but because they generally operate with a much lower cost base and are able to provide more customized services, meaning that their clients can be offered a financial service that they actually afford.</p>



<p>Furthermore, fintech firms have a strong track record in providing very clear solutions to specific problems their clients face and are able to turn an idea into a service fast. I see this characteristic of fintech companies as being particularly useful in this COVID climate as there is a lot of uncertainty over lockdowns, travel bans, and so forth.</p>







 In terms of developing countries, what internal and external factors do you think could support or hinder Fintech development? 



<p>Many emerging economies have not fully embraced fintech from a regulatory perspective, so some of the potential innovation and developments are either taking place in a bit of a grey zone or not at all. I think it is crucial for governments to create a framework where fintech innovation is promoted whilst protecting retail clients/users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in some countries, generally in the more developed economies, financial regulators have launched fintech sandboxes, essentially allowing selected fintech firms to test their solutions and technology, collaborate with established financial institutions, and get limited access to clients. This way, they can evaluate the suitability of their services and the legal and regulatory approach that may be required. These sandboxes not only help the selected fintech firms understand better how to operate their business model but also help regulators learn about new technologies and come up with regulations that can help the introduction of new services and financial products to the market.</p>



 What is your advice for financial and non-financial firms from emerging countries to catch up with Fintech’s development in the future? 



<p>Financial and non-financial firms from emerging countries need to educate themselves with the latest technologies and business models and applications and experiment a little more. It is very natural to feel more defensive at a time of difficult market conditions such as now. However, that’s exactly the time to push on with innovation and bring better solutions to their clients.</p>

<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Mike some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Why use the history of a color as an analogy for identity?  </p>
<p>
Great question. I think as I tend to think about identity and other technology and innovation, what fascinates me most is not even how much the technology works, but how it impacts society, how it impacts culture and the semantic value that that technology has. I was looking at museum artifacts because I'm actually on vacation, as you can see. And I started to notice that there was a lack of blue everywhere I look. And so reading more about the trajectory of blue, it really was an easy analogy there to think about how blue has impacted society over the years. And the growth in its semantic use by the culture and by society at large, and by taking lessons from Blue's narrative path, we can see kind of where identity is and where it may be going and how we want, or don't want it to wind up like the color blue as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How does the rise of the color blue, specifically, parallel identity?   </p>
<p>
Well, blue, as I said was particularly fascinating because in the old days, old, old, really old days, it wasn't really used for technological reasons and for cultural impact reasons as well. And so over time, innovation hit, wave after wave of technological innovation. And along with that, the culture started to appropriate blue. It went from kind of non-existence – not even used to describe the sea like you see behind me. Terms like green or even brown or yellow, believe it or not, were used to paint the sea or to talk about the sea. And then this changed 13 hundreds or so when some innovation hit and it became massively popular among a niche group of people – the wealthy, the affluent – and so what that already showed was that the early adopters had an advantage and the early adopters have had an advantage in identity, as well.</p>
<p>As blue progressed, it became the color of normalcy, kind of a normal color. There weren't a lot of outliers. It was still too new to have a lot of cultural weight. And so it was kind of an open Greenfield for people to inject it with their own meaning. It was a safe color. And so it became from the rich, the affluent and powerful, it transitioned into something more common and more accepted by society because it didn't have any negative earlier connotation. And then finally blue exploded in the last century or two into one of the West's most popular color of all colors of all time. I see identity kind of going through a similar progression, maybe cyclical progression, where it doesn't quite exist in a culture or a subculture, and then innovation and culture work together to foster adoption and to drive new use cases to where ideally in the future, I think identity. And it would benefit everyone in terms of being ubiquitous and not just ubiquitous, but also popular. And so I'm wanting to propose in my talk at the European Identity and Cloud Conference this year, a parallel between the two and then people can come find me and we can argue about it later and discuss it regardless of whether or not you agree with me. It's a great framework for discussing the technology and the cultural impact of something like identity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is driving the progression of identity today: innovation or cultural significance? </p>
<p>
If you had asked me 5, 10 years ago, I would have said innovation. In part because I was younger, in part because the world was different. I think now it's almost impossible to split apart those two notions – or one drives the other, drives the other. We've seen in the past year how quickly the world can change. You look at the impact of COVID for instance, and COVID mandates, and identity being used to validate who's vaccinated, who's not. What your health status is. These things can turn on a dime. And so I think it's kind of a false question in a way to say, is it one or the other? I think it's an unholy weaving of both together – and one takes the lead and then the other takes the lead. But by knowing that they're equally powerful or can be equally powerful then we can seek to harness that and try and steer the path of identity towards a beneficial, good direction, rather than one that might be more malicious. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What obstacles stand in the way of identity becoming as popular as blue? </p>
<p>
Great question. I think one of the primary obstacles standing in the way of identity continuing its ascendancy and it's move towards popularity is quite frankly, ease of use. The people we're talking about here are not identity professionals, they’re not practitioners, they're not even technologists. Think of someone who you would not think of interacting with identity, and that's the target audience that I'm thinking about or contemplating in terms of identity being popular. For that to work, it's not going to be technology as such that is going to move them to adopt that. I think what it's going to be is something that's natural, part of their daily process, where they don't think about it. And so I think we haven't achieved that yet. And that's one of the main barriers, as opposed to, say, the next wave of innovation or technology. If it's not as easy to use – as a friend of mine says – as a spoon, then we've kind of lost the battle there already.  </p>

<p>IDnow enables an automated identity verification solution for highly regulated use cases, complying with Anti-Money-Laundering-Law in Europe.</p>
<p>IDnow, a leading European Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, is expanding its automated solution AutoIdent for additional highly regulated use cases, including areas regulated by the Anti Money Laundering Act (AML), such as banks and financial service providers.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent is an AML Act compliant identity verification solution that operates as an automated process and meets the high-security requirement. It serves a wide range of industries and use cases, such as onboarding a player for online gaming, opening a bank account, or signing a loan agreement. Taking advantage of a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES), IDnow AutoIdent seamlessly blends state-of-the-art technologies into an easy, secure and fully compliant identity verification process.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent including QES, is certified by a conformity assessment body and is approved by an EU Member State National Regulator for issuing QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) according to eIDAS Regulation Article 24 (1) d). If the use case requires an even higher level of assurance IDnow AutoIdent including QES could be combined with a bank transfer, turning it into a fully compliant remote onboarding solution in accordance with the German AML Act – Geldwäschegesetz (GwG), under Section §12 sentence 1 Nr 3.</p>
<p>“Our belief in providing an advanced identity verification platform which increases security improves conversion and streamlines our customers’ onboarding process across geographical borders drives us forward. By making our automated solution AML-compliant with additional regulations, our customers can offer a faster process and therefore a better user experience while ensuring high security and regulatory standards.

<p>Summary: We explore how to issue credentials using secure messaging.</p><p>At MATTR, we’ve pioneered a way to request and receive credentials using <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a> capability.</p><p>However, if you already have a robust mechanism in place to authenticate users, then setting up additional OIDC capability is unnecessary. Sending credentials using secure Decentralized Identifier (DID) messaging or directly with a QR code is a safe, convenient alternative. In this article, we’ll explore this alternative method in more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>The MATTR mobile wallet supports two main channels for issuing a credential:</p>  OpenID Credential Provider  Secure DID messaging  <p>Note: We’re building DID messaging on the JOSE stack to facilitate signing and encryption.</p><p>OpenID Credential Provider</p><p>If you haven’t yet authenticated a user, using OpenID Credential Provider offers a secure way to authenticate a user at the point of credential creation. It involves setting up and configuring an OpenID Provider to work alongside the MATTR VII OIDC Bridge Extension — simple if you’re already using OIDC infrastructure, but more complex to set up from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Secure DID messaging</p><p>If you’ve already authenticated a user through another method, issuing a credential through a secure DID message is a reliable alternative to OIDC. This approach works well if you’re authenticating users through a website login or even in person (like a classroom or training&nbsp;centre).</p><p>Let’s see how this might work in practice.</p><p>1. Authentication</p><p>Before issuing a credential, you need to authenticate the user. The most common way to do this is having a user login to a session on your&nbsp;website.</p><p>2. Linking</p><p>Now that you’ve authenticated the user, you need to link their DID to the session of the user. This DID will be generated by the wallet they are using to hold the credential. You can obtain it in a few different ways:</p>  If the user already has a credential you’ve issued, and you trust they are still in control of the subject DID in the credential, you can create a new credential based off the DID inside the credential.  If the user needs to link their DID from their mobile wallet, you can use a <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/dids/did-auth-oidc">DID Auth</a> flow to make sure you’re obtaining a validated DID that the user can prove they&nbsp;own.  If you needed to verify credential data from the user as part of the transaction anyway, you’ll need to use the Holder DID from the Verifiable Presentation as the determining DID.  <p>For very simple use cases like demo and testing, if a user has the MATTR mobile wallet they can use a Public DID — they can simply copy the DID and pass it to you out-of-band.</p><p>3. Constructing the credential and&nbsp;message</p><p>Now that the DID is ‘known’ and we’ve authenticated the user, a Verifiable Credential is <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/issue-basic">created</a> using the MATTR VII platform. This credential is then packaged into a secure DID message format to be delivered to the recipient. Because the subject DID is known, the DID message can be encrypted to ensure the data is safe in transit. Use the <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/api-reference/v1.0.1#operation/encryptMessage">messaging endpoints</a> to easily perform this&nbsp;step.</p><p>4. Delivery</p><p>The MATTR mobile wallet can read DID messages in either a secure DID message, QR code or deep-link.</p><p>Sending a secure DID message is an easy way to push messages to mobile wallet holders. Once the message has been encrypted, it can be <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/messaging/messaging-send">sent to the subject DID</a> and the MATTR VII platform will route the encrypted message to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>QR codes and deep-links typically make the messages too large to be reliably read by most smartphones. To solve this, we embed a URL to an endpoint hosting the DID message. Then, the MATTR mobile wallet simply follows a redirect to obtain the&nbsp;message.</p><p>5. Storing the credential</p><p>Once the MATTR mobile wallet receives the message, the user can view the credential to make sure it’s correct, then store the credential in the&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>At this stage, the wallet will also perform some checks to verify the credential, including:</p>  Validation of the credential proof  Resolving the issuer DID&nbsp;document  Checking that the issuer is publishing a valid DID-to-Domain linkage credential.  <p>The checks are clearly visible to the user, and there’s assurance that when it comes time for a user to present their credential, it’ll be accepted by trusted verifiers.</p><p>Wrap up</p><p>If you’re already using a secure mechanism to authenticate your users, then setting up OIDC capability isn’t necessary. As we’ve explored, sending credentials using secure DID messaging directly or via a QR code or deep-link is safe, convenient and allows users to obtain their credentials directly.</p><p>Try this out for yourself now on the MATTR VII platform and in the MATTR mobile&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>MATTR VII&nbsp;trial</p><p>Sign up today for a <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">free trial of our MATTR VII platform</a> to experience the powerful capabilities that can be deployed in the context of your organization.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/issuing-credentials-directly-to-the-mattr-mobile-wallet-8e8cab931e2e">Issuing credentials directly to the MATTR mobile wallet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

611 Million Dollars Was Stolen Today In The Largest DeFi Hack In Cryptocurrency History<p>Introduction: What Is&nbsp;DeFi?</p><p>Decentralized finance, otherwise known as DeFi, has revolutionized the paradigm of traditional finance as we know it. But what is decentralized finance, and how has it impacted the way monetary instruments operate? Decentralized finance is, in essence, an umbrella term that consolidates cryptocurrency or blockchain applications geared towards disrupting traditional financial intermediaries. Centralized financial intermediaries are non-existent in the world of DeFi and non-custodial applications are the embodiment of how DeFi operates. Such intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges or banks are traditional financial entities that operate as an intermediary, enabling your finances to be at the mercy of organizations other than yourself; although this maybe enticing, many individual’s wish to have complete autonomy and control over their own finances.</p><p>DeFi utilizes smart contract technology, such as Ethereum to allow individuals to borrow, lend, speculate on the price of securities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, real estate etc. and earn interest at rates unheard of in your traditional savings account. Decentralized finance is no longer exclusive to Ethereum; many blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Aergo, ICON, Vechain (and many more) have conceived of their own blockchain applications dedicated to decentralized finance.</p><p>DeFi Exposure: Are Your Coins At&nbsp;Risk?</p>This Chart Above Analyzes How, In Accordance To How Fast DeFi Has Taken Off, The Amount Of Hacks That Have Occurred Coinciding With It: Notice, Todays Hack Hasn’t Been&nbsp;Included<p>As DeFi has risen as a dominant force in the blockchain space, hackers and malevolent entities have capitalized on such a paradigm and over the course of the last two years (including Tuesday’s attack), DeFi hackers have effectively stolen over 1 billion dollars since 2020. Put that into perspective, one billion dollars in less than two years has been stolen by numerous investors and that could be you if you ignore the risks of not securing your cryptocurrency assets. Just because a DeFi application has been audited, doesn’t mean that it can’t be hacked; this is an unfortunate truth within the web of blockchain technological applications, especially ones in their infancy. It is important to highlight the numerous attacks that have occurred in 2021 alone to garner perspective on how much of a risk you can be in if you don’t take necessary precautions.</p><p>In February 2021, DeFi platform Yearn Finance had a flash loan attack; as Yearn Finance is one of the largest aggregators in the space, this comes as no surprise. Being one of the largest aggregators in the space, this allowed hackers to siphon 11 million dollars worth of users funds from the Dai Vault through a smart contract exploitation. This allowed the hackers to garner approximately 2.7 million dollars in profit after having to spend over 8 million dollars in fees. The hackers were able to successfully attack the platform by exploiting the flash loan feature on Yearn Finance, which arbitraged from other DeFi platforms within the blockchain sphere. Not only did Yearn Finance suffer an exploitation, but Alpha Homora’s Iron Bank Exploit also occurred during the same month because of their very own flash loan feature as well. This time, the protocol lost a whopping 37 million dollars. The hackers borrowed millions of stablecoins from Cream Finance’s IronBank, doubling their loans after every succeeding one. It is evident that these hacks are a result from smart contract exploits, which many thought were indominable. Fast forward to March and we saw the Meerkat Finance Exploit which was a yield farming protocol on the Binance Smart Chain which was reported being hacked one day after it went live resulting in approximately 73,000 BNB being lost (approximately 13 million dollars). Paid Network had an infinite mint attack where the hackers resulted in 180 million dollars being lost by minting PAID tokens causing massive inflation, sending its value down 85% within a few hours. Easy Fi, another DeFi platform on Polygon, was hacked for 75 million dollars and the team had to initiate a hard fork to recover most of the lost funds. These are just a FEW DeFi hacks that have occurred in 2021 alone, and many more have been reported (like the one that happened today, the largest in DeFi history). Many investors have also suffered from DeFi rug pulls since the inception of decentralized finance, but what exactly is a rug&nbsp;pull?</p>The Infamous Rug Pull: A Dominant Malevolent Action In&nbsp;DeFi<p>Imagine a rug being pulled from under you, you fall and possibly fail to get back up, think as this as a synonymous notion towards your cryptocurrency finances resulting from rug pulls. A rug pull is an event where a protocol token is launched on a decentralized exchange such as Pancake or Uniswap and paired with a prominent cryptocurrency asset such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. Liquidity providers known as yield farmers are then actively pursued by anonymous hackers and social media magnets that promise absurd Annual Percentage Yields. Smart contracts, unfortunately being able to be exploited, once they have enough funds locked into the smart contract, the developer, who has complete authority and control over the operation of the smart contract, withdraws all the funds from the liquidity pools and disappears with the&nbsp;funds.</p><p>611 Million In Cryptocurrency Stolen: The Great DeFi Hack: Tuesday, August 10th,&nbsp;2021</p>The Biggest DeFi Hack In History Occurred Today: But Why, And&nbsp;How?<p>Today, over 611 million dollars was stolen in a massive hack that will go down as the largest DeFi hack in blockchain history up until this point in time. This hack, reporting over 600 million dollars in losses, outweighs all the DeFi hacks from February-April combined! But how did this happen and why? It started with Poly Network, a network dedicated to swapping cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Poly Network was attacked on three different chains, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon and were transferred to the hacker’s addresses. Poly Network swaps tokens across different blockchains, which include Ethereum, Ontology, Binance and Polygon. Based on the statement created by Poly Network, over 273 million dollars in Ethereum assets were taken, 253 million dollars in Binance Smart Chain assets and 85 million in USDC. The hack was so massive that Tether, a controversial stablecoin, even got involved and freezed 33 million dollars worth of the coin to prevent further exploitation. The hack, forced O3, a trading pool that utilizes the Poly Network to trade tokens on different blockchains, to cease functionality, disrupting the cross-chain interoperability that was created on the Poly Network. This hack wasn’t a result of a rug-pull, but of an issue with cryptography which enabled the hacker to take these funds. This hack is eerily similar to the AnySwap attack, which resulted in 7.9 million stolen in July because the hacker was able to exploit the private key. This quote creates perspective on how incumbent it is to secure your coins “just eight month into 2021, more DeFi hacks and exploits have occurred than throughout the years 2020 and 2019.” As DeFi, blockchain and cryptocurrency markets expand, so will malevolent entities, and crimes will rise as a result which is why we must stay vigilant.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1425073987164381196">@PolyNetwork2</a></p></blockquote><p>How To Secure Your Coins From DeFi&nbsp;Exploits</p>Protect Your Coins From Exploitation Or Face The Consequences!<p>While DeFi protocols have initiated rapid innovation and transformation of traditional and blockchain finance, their is numerous rooms for error and exploitation. It is incumbent that you, the investor, understand the risks and consequences thereof of participating in decentralized finance applications. The first and obvious method of securing your cryptocurrency assets is to get a hardware wallet. Whether your coins are on an exchange or within a DeFi protocol, I’m sorry to say, they’re not your coins. Hardware wallets negate the risk of your coins being exposed as they store your cryptocurrency assets&nbsp;offline.</p><p>Such cryptocurrency wallets such as Trezor run on open source coding, which many argue makes them more secure because open source codes are consistently watching for vulnerabilities and being open source makes it impossible for any entity to open up a “back-door.” The Ledger is also another hardware wallet that is fantastic for security, however, their database was breached in 2020, which was irresponsible and absurdly ridiculous; you would think a secure digital asset wallet company would know better to not keep customers information on their databases. My advice to you as an investor, is to never use your real name when buying these hardware wallets, make sure you’re buying them from the real Trezor or Ledger website, don’t have it mailed to your house and use a fake burner email address. Consistently keep your keys stored offline and never stored on your computer or cell-phone, never trust, always verify websites and never vaunt your cryptocurrency holdings on social media (we all have egos, but they can be a detriment to your finances and mental health). There are also some DeFi protocols that offer insurance risks in case of a smart contract vulnerability or hack (think of this as if your money was in an FDIC insured bank account but your bank goes under, your funds will still be safe). In short, keep your private keys safe, offline and buy a hardware wallet and be wary of any DeFi protocols that have been previously hacked.</p><p>Conclusion: DeFi, A Massive Innovation With Unfortunate Risks</p>All Innovations Are Accompanied By Risks: As DeFi Grows, So Will Hacks: Secure Yourself!<p>This article was not meant to bash or to create a negative perspective on DeFi: decentralized finance is a massive innovation within the web of blockchain and the financial paradigm as a whole. But with any innovation comes massive risks, and it is incumbent that investors are aware of such risks when participating in these activities. Always remember, not your keys, not your&nbsp;coins!</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

<p>At Onfido we’re continually innovating and thinking about how we can improve important things like our communication, customer experience, processes and services. After all, one of our core values is ‘find a better way’ and Onfidoers practice this in their daily work. When Patrick Cahill from the Onfido legal team attended an Onfido University session ‘Introduction to Design Thinking’, hosted by the fantastic design team, it sparked a discussion about how in the legal team we could learn from this approach and adopt it in different ways in our interactions with customers, Onfidoers and external lawyers (to name a&nbsp;few).</p><p>Queue the fantastic Adam Bradley from the design team, who put his hand up to help turn legal minds upside down and facilitated replacing wigs and gowns with post it notes and sharpies! Adam worked with Patrick in developing and facilitating a series of workshops which explored legal design thinking. Legal design isn’t a new concept and there’s even a fab <a href="https://www.legalgeek.co/legaldesign/">Legal Geek conference</a> where you can learn more about it. Margaret Hagan from Stanford Law School’s Legal Design Lab <a href="https://www.legalgeek.co/learn/legal-design-wtf/">summarises legal design</a> really&nbsp;well.</p><p>“Legal Design is an innovation approach — that means focusing on the humans within the legal system to understand where the crucial breakdowns in the system right now exist — and to make the creative leap to define what a better system might&nbsp;be.</p><p>It means a priority on who the ‘users’ of the system are — whether it be people who are ‘lay’ outsiders trying to use it to solve problems, or the ‘professionals’ who work inside it. A legal design approach has us talk to these people, observe them, co-create with them, and test with them — so that we can make a system that actually solves problems, and does so in the most usable, useful, and engaging way possible.</p><p>A legal design approach can help us create small changes to huge overhauls. You can use it to make better documents, products, services, organisations, or policies. It is about using creative, human-centered strategies to find better ways forward, to serve people&nbsp;better.”</p><p>With Adam’s help and guidance, the first step was to figure out how we’d facilitate the workshops and what areas the workshops should cover. Planning was key for this step and using <a href="https://miro.com/">miro</a>, we identified objectives and outcomes for the team and created a structure of how to achieve those outcomes. As design thinking was a relatively new concept for the team, we kicked off with a 101 in design thinking approach, so the legal team were armed with the right tools, encouraged to put aside any preconceptions and prejudices and to come to the workshops with a user centred problem solving&nbsp;mindset.</p>A screen grab of part of the miro board that we worked&nbsp;on<p>The following workshop focused specifically on who the users of Onfido’s legal terms: (i) who they were, taking a broad brush approach beyond the obvious users (characteristics and expertise); (ii) the context in which they engage with legal terms; (iii) what they hope to achieve in using the legal terms; and (iv) potential challenges they face when using the legal terms. From distilling this information, in our next workshop we moved onto reviewing some of the problems that we wanted to solve for each of our users. For example, receiving lots of redline and that the context/background of a clause may not be&nbsp;clear.</p><p>Our last workshop looked at solution ideation and we were encouraged by Adam to think outside of the box and come up with ideas that pushed boundaries. There was definitely no right or wrong answer at this stage of the process. Taking the problems above, we looked at potential solutions such as providing an explanation of each clause to external lawyers, adopting a pre-contract intake form and doing more internal education to our Growth team to foster a deeper understanding of contract positions.</p><p>The workshops were hugely beneficial to the legal team and we’ve now got lots of ideas and insights in how to solve some of the problems that our users face. Having an awareness and understanding of design led thinking also means that we’ll continue to view problems through a user-centred lens and continue to collaborate cross functionally to improve and iterate on the service and systems we provide as a legal team, pushing boundaries and innovating as we grow with our wig, gowns, post it notes and sharpies.</p><p>If you’re interested in finding out more about our experience and legal design thinking, please feel free to reach&nbsp;out.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-cahill-23865461/">Patrick Cahill</a> is Legal Counsel at Onfido and a Visiting Fellow at the Centre for Commercial Law Studies,&nbsp;QMUL.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adambradleyuxr/">Adam Bradley</a> is UX Researcher at&nbsp;Onfido.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/onfidos-legal-design-journey-7b950950af2e">Onfido’s Legal Design Journey</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Automated Vending Technology Showcased in Black Fire Innovation’s Living Lab</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO and LAS VEGAS (August 11, 2021) — <a href="https://www.civic.com/">Civic Technologies</a>, a leading innovator in digital identity solutions, and Black Fire Innovation, the hospitality technology hub created by Caesars Entertainment, Inc., and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), today announced that a vending machine using Age Verification by Civic will be serving up an assortment of non-alcoholic beverages to Black Fire’s tenants. The technology is based on Identity.com’s open source identity verification ecosystem.</p>



<p>Designed specifically to dispense beer, canned wine and similar age-restricted beverages, the vending machine being piloted at Black Fire is filled with sparkling water, energy drinks and canned espresso for demonstrative purposes only.</p>



<p>The vending machine is housed in Black Fire to demonstrate the importance and utility of private identity verification to the top innovators who work in Black Fire’s concept-testing lab.</p>



<p>“Now, we’re finding new ways to assist the hospitality industry within Black Fire, the home of disruptive innovations. By making digital identity verification easy — without sacrificing privacy — Civic offers forward-looking technology that will help foster more breakthroughs across gaming and entertainment,” said Robert Rippee, Executive Director of UNLV’s Black Fire Innovation Hub.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make an age-restricted purchase at the vending machine, a user simply signs up for Civic Wallet and is authenticated as a real person. Civic verifies the user’s age at the vending machine using Identity.com’s open-source identity verification ecosystem. Users have more control over their personal information and the ability to purchase age-restricted products anonymously.</p>



<p>“We’re delighted that our groundbreaking identity-verification vending machine has found a new home in Black Fire Innovation’s Living Lab,” said Vinny Lingham, CEO and co-founder of Civic. “We’re proud to bring automated age verification technology to innovation leaders in the gaming, hospitality and entertainment industries.”</p>



<p>A vending machine selling age-restricted products, including beer, is just one application of private identity verification. Other real-world opportunities for identity verification technology abound, especially when it comes to enhancing the entire customer experience — both online and offline — including opportunities for product enhancement across vendors and properties without collecting any personal data. Civic and Black Fire Innovation are confident that this collaboration will lead to new customer insights and better casino rewards programs. Vending machines with Age Verification by Civic are currently in use around the United States in partnership with a large vending partner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Anonyome Labs, our solutions help mitigate violence and abuse that is&nbsp;tech-facilitated&nbsp;(via a computer, device or app). We empower people to be able to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. We provide survivors and those at risk of harassment, violence and abuse, real and effective tools for protecting their personal information.</p>



<p>In May 2020, we proudly became a partner of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/anonyome-labs-joins-global-fight-against-stalkerware/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>,&nbsp;a global working group uniting advocacy groups, software developers, security firms, victims and survivors, in the fight to protect consumers against stalkerware and to eliminate abusive technology and software.</p>



<p>We are also growing our own safety initiative, known as Sudo Safe.&nbsp;Through Sudo Safe, we partner with organizations that promote safe use of the Internet as well as those organizations that support at-risk people who may have a specific need for privacy and security in their life.&nbsp;Our goal is to support at-risk users, and to be a privacy resource for organizations supporting their members.</p>



<p>Sudo Safe encourages the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, to help people keep their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;private.&nbsp;MySudo enables people to communicate and interact with other people and services without using their own information such as personal phone number, email address and credit card, which mitigates the risk of that information being used for tracking or stalking.</p>



<p>See how an&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/04/why-i-use-mysudo-as%e2%80%afan%e2%80%afeducator/">educator uses MySudo</a>&nbsp;to privately and safely communicate with students and their families.</p>



<p>Remember, MySudo helps disconnect a user’s online accounts and activity from their private information, such as personal phone number and email address, which mitigates the risk of that information being used for tracking or stalking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can explore MySudo through our 90 second&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">explainer video</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/06/8-strong-privacy-and-security-features-youll-find-in-mysudo/">Here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/all-the-privacy-features-packed-into-mysudo-app/">here</a>&nbsp;we also explain all the privacy and safety features in the app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Traditional credit scoring is a lagging indicator of financial health 
 Credit scores do not follow individuals across borders 
 62 million Americans have a thin credit file or are credit invisible 
 Millennials are lagging behind other generations in building credit 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed problems with traditional credit scoring

<p>Open banking data augments the foundation of credit histories and credit scores by providing real-time insights into cash flow, stable income and the actual room in someone’s monthly budget to afford a loan or a new purchase.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans have thin credit files meaning they don’t have enough data in the credit bureaus to even create a score. By looking at data from their bank account, lenders can determine if they are able to to pay back a loan based on income and expenses, not the lack of data.</p>
<p>Above all, consumer-permissioned data helps to empower consumers with control over their data, access to better financial products and a simple way to connect with fintech apps or financial services.</p>

There will be a limited supply of KILT Coins that are gradually introduced into the system over&nbsp;time.</p> Key Metrics   Total supply at Token Generation Event (TGE): 150 million pre-minted KILT&nbsp;Coins.  Initial circulating supply: 32.5&nbsp;million.  The remaining pre-minted coins will be gradually unlocked over a period of 6 to 60&nbsp;months.  Initial inflation will be around 5% per annum, dropping to 1% per annum within the first 6 years and then slowly moving towards&nbsp;0%.  There would be only one KILT network and one KILT Coin, regardless of whether KILT moves from Kusama to a Polkadot parachain, as determined by community governance.  <p>And it’s important to remember that <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilts-parachain-plans-an-update-efb9a9e35394">KILT’s parachain will launch</a> with significant activated functionality — staking for collators and delegators, and the initial token economy outlined in our tokenomics document. This means the first phase of staking will be possible on KILT from&nbsp;genesis.</p> Migration of KILT from Kusama to Polkadot Parachain <p>The tokenomics is designed to reward the KILT Treasury with 10 million KILT Coins linearly over the first five years. In the future, governance may decide to exchange these accumulated KILT Coins for DOT and use them to bid for a Polkadot parachain slot.</p><p>If KILT moves from Kusama to Polkadot, we assume that governance would transfer the existing KILT Coins without changing the balances or owners of these KILT Coins, and without changing the metrics and economics.</p><p>We hope the community finds this tokenomics update useful. By carefully designing the framework for the KILT system, we aim to enable a new economy around the KILT&nbsp;Coin.</p><p>Finally, we want to thank our builders and partners for supporting KILT’s mission of restoring digital identity and dignity to the individual.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-token-economy-an-update-db207611f5ce">KILT Token Economy: An Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Hello Monethians! We’ve are hard at work accomplishing the goals set in Monetha’s Roadmap for 2021. These past months proved to be fruitful and we would like to share with you what has been achieved since we last spoke. So, let’s get into&nbsp;it.</p> Validation of the&nbsp;concept <p>Our main goal for H1 2021 was to validate the concept of the Monetha Identity and make sure that it is valuable both for businesses and consumers. As stated in the roadmap, we aimed to fulfill three main objectives:</p>  Onboard advisors,  Determine data points with high value for businesses,  Engage early adopters from eCommerce businesses.  <p>We have been working closely with several eCommerce shops from the United Kingdom and Baltic states, testing our ideas and assumptions under real-life conditions to find out what value zero-party and first-party data can bring and what exactly it should be to have the best&nbsp;effect.</p><p>As a result, we have shaped a solid basis to the B2B side of the Monetha Identity platform. Its value goes far beyond simply bringing businesses zero-party data from Monetha Identity users. Instead, it aims to bring businesses ready-to-use marketing insights based on all data they have. The solution enriches first-party data that businesses already have with Monetha’s zero-party data and analyzes it as a whole using machine learning algorithms.</p><p>We also have onboarded affiliate and loyalty program advisors from Italy, Spain, France and Poland. They will be handling regional markets and validating our product-market fit&nbsp;there.</p> Monetha Identity application <p>The team is currently focused on the analytical part of the solution, i.e., turning raw data into valuable insights while keeping it in accordance with GDPR and other privacy acts. All development works on the improved MVP are going to begin in September.</p><p>Starting from October, a new Product Director of Monetha Identity with vast experience in eCommerce loyalty will join Monetha. He will be leading the development of the consumer part of the solution and, among other things, help to design the most effective utilization of MTH token within the whole ecosystem.</p><p>The Monetha team thanks you for your continued support and we can’t wait to share more news with you when they will be ready for a public announcement. In the meantime, you can reach us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Monetha.io">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Monetha_io">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monetha/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://t.me/monethagroup">Telegram</a>.

<p>IDnow enables an automated identity verification solution for highly regulated use cases, complying with Anti-Money-Laundering-Law in Europe, including Germany.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, August 12th, 2021, IDnow, a leading European Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, is expanding its automated solution AutoIdent for additional highly regulated use cases, including areas regulated by the Anti Money Laundering Act (AML/GwG), such as banks and financial service providers.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent is an AML Act compliant identity verification solution that operates as an automated process and meets the high-security requirement. It serves a wide range of industries and use cases, such as opening a bank account, signing a loan agreement, or onboarding a player for online gaming. Taking advantage of a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) and existing online bank accounts of the user, it seamlessly blends state-of-the-art technologies with existing identity and banking data into an easy, secure and fully compliant identity verification process.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent including QES, is certified by a conformity assessment body and is approved by an EU Member State National Regulator for issuing QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) according to eIDAS Regulation Article 24 (1) d). The process can include a one-cent-bank transfer, turning it into a fully compliant remote onboarding solution in accordance with the German AML Act – Geldwäschegesetz (GwG), under Section §12 sentence 1 Nr 3. According to the AML law, automated identity proofing in connection with a reference transaction is permitted, pursuant to Article 32 eIDAS.</p>
<p>“Our belief in providing an advanced identity verification platform which increases security improves conversion and streamlines our customers’ onboarding process across geographical borders drives us forward. By making our automated solution AML-compliant with additional regulations, our customers can offer a faster process and therefore a better user experience while ensuring high security and regulatory standards. This gives our customers, who operate in a constantly evolving environment, the peace of mind and the flexibility to choose the solution that meets their needs best,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO at IDnow.</p>
<p>The IDnow platform, which includes AutoIdent as a building block, effortlessly orchestrates all necessary components into a seamless, secure and AML-compliant identity verification.</p>
<p>Depending on the customer’s needs, the onboarding process offers total flexibility. Further components of the IDnow platform can added, e.g., eSign, the add-on for the digital contract signing opening up additional use cases such as taking out a consumer loan in a wholly digital process.</p>
<p>In recent years, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering specific identity verification products and has become an overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year, used by over 800 customers worldwide. In 2021, IDnow acquired the French market leader for identity technology, ARIADNEXT, and the German identity Trust Management AG, enabling IDnow to offer its customers one of the broadest identification solutions through a single, integrated platform.</p>

				  Jointly-developed LAVCE platform solves the problems of privacy and security for sharing sensitive health data, such as COVID tests and vaccine records.   
			  
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, August 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Indico, the leading developer of decentralized identity blockchain networks and software, in a partnership with Liquid Avatar Technologies, a publicly listed, global blockchain, digital identity and fintech solutions company and Vector Laboratories (“Vector Labs”), an Ontario, Canada licensed laboratory healthcare verification organization , have launched the first Canadian blockchain-based decentralized identity solution for issuing and verifying COVID test results. </p>
<p>Supported by Indicio’s credential exchange tools, the Liquid Avatar Verifiable Credential Ecosystem (LAVCE) enables people to receive a digital credential from Vector Labs confirming their COVID test result. This can be verified when it is presented without an individual having to share any private, personal data or be tracked. LAVCE can be integrated with healthcare facilities, testing labs, government agencies, schools,  sports arenas, transportation, trade shows, and workplaces to confirm health status and assist efforts to reduce new outbreaks. It combines a mobile app from Liquid Avatar for individuals, a SaaS model platform for healthcare issues, and a software development kit (SDK) that can power mobile apps, corporate portals, and government websites. This approach makes it possible for all types of organizations to support digital wallets and verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>“Liquid Avatar Technologies shares Indicio’s vision—the world needs technology that works for people by delivering real privacy and security,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “When we launched the Indicio Network, we saw the need for a space for innovative companies to collaborate on changing how we manage identity, enable verification, and create trust. Our partnership with Liquid Avatar Technologies, one of many, shows what can happen when innovators solve pressing problems with ground-breaking technology.”</p>
<p>Both Indicio and Liquid Avatar are steering committee members of the Linux Foundation Public Health’s Cardea project, designed to provide public health agencies around the world with open source interoperable privacy-preserving technology to manage COVID testing and vaccination. The LAVCE credential also aligns with the Global COVID Credential Network and the Good Health Pass Collaborative.</p>
<p>“LAVCE is leading the market for interoperable, privacy-preserving identity that provides a flexible yet uniform approach to revealing health and other verifications when necessary” said David Lucatch, CEO. “Privacy and security of personal data is essential to a ‘return to normal’ and a host of other activities.  Having a patchwork of systems can quickly get out of hand. Supported by the expertise of Indicio, LAVCE makes it quick and easy to handle test data and other verifiable credentials in a way that earns people’s trust, keeps them safe, and helps open up society.”</p>
<p>Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. is a minority equity holder in Indicio.tech</p>

We understand you may be an awesome candidate, or have access to great candidates, but we will not consider such applications at this time.




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is looking for a&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Lead&nbsp;for&nbsp;our&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;team, where you can contribute to the success of our product team developing our globally awarded personal data platform. The Meeco platform is comprised of suite of products including a decentralised wallet, key management store, exchange for identity, credentials &amp; tokens and secure data enclave (vault).




 




At Meeco we build the tools to enable people and organisation to access, protect and create mutual value from personal data. We are personal data pioneers offering a range solutions powered by Meeco and decentralised on Hedera Hashgraph.




 




We are passionate about building a new digital economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, for the benefit of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organisations enter a relationship of mutual value and build a new, more meaningful way to personalise digital services. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a> to learn more about our thinking and the vision that drives us.




 




We have built a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia, Belgium and the UK. Collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, and each bring a unique personal data story that advances our mission.




 About the role 





 




We are a global team of 25 people based in Australia, Belgium and the UK. The platform team currently consists of 17, responsible for designing, implementing, supporting and documenting several services that, all together, form the backbone of our platform.




 




Currently our technology stack consists mainly of several Ruby on Rails, Elixir and Java components for the backend services. For frontend, we primarily use Javascript and Dart for smartphone and decentralised applications, based upon blockchain and distributed ledger technology.




 




We’re a company that embraces innovation, so it is likely that our technology stack will continue to evolve and change. We are not averse to adding other technologies if the need arises for specific services.




 




We take pride in building software that is easy to understand, clean, well-structured and properly tested. We have formed our own opinions on how to write good code that are a result of programming for more than two decades. Sometimes, we have even found ourselves going against the popular vote on several topics.




 




• We favour the explicit over the implicit




 




• We treat frameworks as tools and not as an unquestionable authority




 




• We embrace the relational database and its possibilities and as such treat it as a first order citizen.




 




The following will help you understand what you’ll be doing on a day to day basis:




 




• Being a technical leader; mentoring, triaging problems, offering a guiding hand




 




• Coming up with a detailed plan on how to approach high-level requirements including tasks and&nbsp;estimations




 




• Supporting the team to allocate and distribute the work according to individual capabilities




 




• Designing and implementing&nbsp;new services&nbsp;with business logic called from&nbsp;existing &amp; new&nbsp;endpoints




 




• Investigating bug reports that inevitably occur, helping a colleague identify problems




 




• Reviewing and approving Pull Requests




 




• Implementing data integrations to&nbsp;enable end-users access public&nbsp;and&nbsp;private&nbsp;data, this might include open banking,&nbsp;social, health, wearable, weather, travel or IoT&nbsp;data




 




• Working&nbsp;with the&nbsp;latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a> &amp; <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF</a>&nbsp;Standards&nbsp;for&nbsp;implementations for distributed ledger&nbsp;implementations including Verifiable Credentials, Distributed Identity including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>




 




• Working on leading-edge payments solutions including micro-payments and tokens




 




• Contributing to a more transparent, open and trust-based personal data eco-system.




 About you 





 




We are looking for someone who has a deep understanding of how to write RESTful resources exposed as APIs, cares about clean code (a lot) and is ready to learn (a lot). It is a big plus if you have experience writing these web-based applications in Ruby on Rails and/or in building decentralized applications in blockchain technologies.




 




We build applications for the internet of tomorrow, a place where personal data is placed right at the center, protected start to finish. This means we often tackle questions that have no established technical solutions. Google won’t help you as much in this case as it requires a combination of existing tech and emerging solutions. One class of technology that we are exploring and see great potential is in the distributed ledger space. A good understanding and professional experience building decentralised applications or dealing with DLT is a big plus.




 




Meeco is an environment with more questions than answers. If you are drawn to original problems, which require imaginative solutions, you’ll feel right at home. This does require you to be open for and comfortable learning new things and develop proof-of-concepts on short timelines, identifying the tasks that matter the most.




 




In addition to established experience as a developer, we expect that you have at least 2+ years experience in steering a team. using an agile methodology, be it scrum or a derivative.




 




You are able to support our executive team (Technology, Product, Design and Commercial Officers) in writing up technical proposals, along with translating Meeco’s technical vision into practical goals that support the commercialisation of our products.




 




The following is our crazy wish-list. It is not necessary that you have all this experience, but the more proven competencies you have will increase your chances of success in the role:




 




• You have taken lead on directing and implementing solutions to complex, unbounded (technical) problems based on limited scope




 




• You have a track record of setting direction for teammates




 




• You know how to take steps in improving the quality of existing and future software




 




• You are comfortable communicating your ideas both verbally as well as written. We love to create diagrams to describe future systems.




 




• You have used more than one programming language to build software, which can&nbsp;of course include&nbsp;hobby&nbsp;and passion&nbsp;projects




 




• We have a soft spot for functional programming, so maybe you have too




 




• We build both&nbsp;backend&nbsp;and frontend&nbsp;applications, so&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;any relevant frontend programming experience, especially with JavaScript, TypeScript and/or Angularjs&nbsp;would be awesome




 




• You have used languages with built-in concurrency models like Go, Erlang, or Elixir




 




• If you have a language you love, tell us about it!




 




• You have a good understanding of what goes on in a RDBMS, especially Postgresql. You are familiar with devops&nbsp;and&nbsp;Microsoft Azure&nbsp;would be a bonus.




 




• You know how to use Docker and Kubernetes.




 




We don’t expect you to know everything from the start and we have a team to show you the ropes. A good set of solid programming skills, natural leadership and to care about our mission is all you need.




 




You might have a computer science or related degree, or you might not. This is not what we are about. We care about what you know now and how you are improving yourself every day.




 




This is a job where we&nbsp;support&nbsp;remote work.&nbsp;However, we do have an office at Stone &amp; Chalk at Docklands in Melbourne. Given the leadership and mentoring aspects of the role,– we would like you to be in the office at least three days a week.&nbsp;At other times&nbsp;you are free to work where you work best.




 




We have team members in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, London (UK) and spread out in Belgium. An important reality is that this can often mean early mornings or long days.




 




We have flexible hours, so you can design your day around being an early bird or night owl. For six months of the year the time difference with Europe can feel brutal, and then the other six months when Europe is on summertime it is much easier. However, being able to work across time zones and self directed is a critical aspect of this role.




 




We value people who can work independently, are able to manage themselves, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed. We love you asking for help!




 





 What we offer 




We pay a competitive start-up package based on your experience and seniority in line with the existing members in the team. As we are still building our foundation team, additional incentives such as Options are available for the right person.




 What we have achieved 




We are&nbsp;early&nbsp;pioneers&nbsp;in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012. You can read more on our achievements and announcements on our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/">blog</a>.




 




Funding; our founder bootstrapped the company for the first two years before raising private equity. We have runway and revenues, so the focus for us now is building awesome products




 




Brand &amp; Reputation: We launched our first product into the market in 2014 and have built a strong brand in the personal data community. Check out Meeco on Twitter or LinkedIn and you will see our consistent focus in helping build a global personal data economy.

Awards: We have won&nbsp;eight&nbsp;international awards in Australia, UK, Netherlands and Germany for personal data management, identity, innovation and FinTech services.




 




Market: In December 2019 we launched our secure data vault inside KBC’s (Belgium) banking app, recently we  launched a media platform&nbsp;for kids&nbsp;called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.miks-it.com/">mIKs-it</a>&nbsp;and have just shipped the first version of our new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/be/app/meeco-wallet/id1570355469">decentralised identity Wallet</a>. These are just three great examples of how enterprises and other start-ups are using our technology to developer better Privacy and Security by Design personal data solutions.




 




Innovation:&nbsp;Through&nbsp;2020&nbsp;we doubled our engineering team along&nbsp;with some really interesting&nbsp;blockchain/distributed ledger&nbsp;projects&nbsp;which we are currently&nbsp;productising&nbsp;to launch throughout&nbsp;2021.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>I’ve always been a bit baffled by the enduring popularity of MySQL. I mean, it’s great and we have been using it in many internal projects for years, but what makes it so popular even nowadays, when the competition from other vendors, commercial or open-source, is so strong? And yet, 26 years after the first release, MySQL is still the most popular open-source database in the world, an integral part of every web development stack, the one product you expect to find on every hosting platform, and, of course, in every public cloud.</p>
 MySQL: a database for all applications? 
<p>Developers love MySQL because it’s easy to deploy and operate, the learning curve is extremely low, it implements a “de facto standard” connection interface, and, most importantly, it’s lightweight and fast. Well, at least to a certain extent.</p>
<p>While “vanilla” MySQL is perfectly capable for small- or medium-scale projects, its popularity extends to the enterprise world as well, with companies like Facebook or Siemens operating massive infrastructures with database instances expertly tuned for high performance and availability. Other companies opt for managed offerings offered by cloud service providers – every major CSP has its own database service based on MySQL but augmented with its native services and sometimes with proprietary advanced capabilities.</p>
<p>However, even when highly tuned for the performance of transactional (OLTP) workloads, MySQL just isn’t designed for analytical processing (OLAP), since its database engine simply lacks the necessary functionality. Thus, even the most hardcore MySQL fans must face the necessity of a data movement and integration process with a separate database optimized for analytics. This process is not only time-consuming and expensive but also prone to significant security and compliance risks, especially in a public cloud.</p>
 Same database, but 1000x faster! 
<p>Back in December 2020, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/mysql-analytics-engine-almost-too-good-to-be-true">we have already covered the solution</a> Oracle offers for this problem: the service that at the time was called MySQL Analytics Engine - renamed MySQL HeatWave soon after. Based on the in-memory database technology that the company has perfected over the years in the labs and real-world environments, the service is designed to run alongside an existing managed MySQL database, access its transactional data directly, optimize it for OLAP processing, and execute analytical queries, returning the results as if they were obtained by MySQL database itself.</p>
<p>From the user’s perspective, this works completely transparently, with the additional infrastructure fully managed by Oracle. The only metrics that change for a customer are performance (thousands of times faster than any plain MySQL) and cost (much lower thanks to the software being optimized for low-cost compute, storage, and networking on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure).</p>
<p>Fast forward to August 10th, 2021, and the company has just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUbnOTlJ7mI">announced the next major release</a> of the service with a machine learning-based automation capability called MySQL Autopilot. The unique value remains the same: Oracle Cloud customers can keep their data in the same MySQL database and still easily and efficiently run complex analytical queries against it, without any third-party tools or processes involved. However, the service is now significantly faster than before with the addition of MySQL Autopilot and the new Scale-Out Data Management layer.</p>
 Autopilot is not just for cars 
<p>The new HeatWave release incorporates multiple performance improvements thanks to its AI-based decision logic that uses a combination of automated analysis methods to identify the most efficient data management and query execution parameters, which are continuously optimized even further as the service learns on new queries. HeatWave is designed to tune its ML models separately for each user and can now even predict how the optimization will improve in the future with explainable change recommendations.</p>
<p>Other newly introduced AI-based capabilities include memory usage prediction that helps estimate the required cluster size just from a small sample of existing data; concurrent execution optimization that ensures that short queries are prioritized over the longer ones running in parallel, thus delivering interactive results earlier which is useful for mixed workloads; and significantly improved internal scalability to ensure that reload times remain constant regardless of the data size.</p>
<p>All these optimizations, according to Oracle, lead to the ability of the service to outperform its major competitors by a factor of at least 1400x, while remaining more economical in terms of overall cost than any other managed MySQL service. I’m sure you’ll find many tests and comparisons on Oracle’s website, but for me, the cost factor is not the most important by far.</p>
 Security and compliance benefits 
<p>At KuppingerCole, we focus primarily on the security of database solutions and compliance aspects of storing and processing data in the cloud. The very idea that your data no longer needs to move between data stores with different access models and security controls or that it has to be exposed to a complex and error-prone ETL process has massive security and compliance implications: this dramatically reduces the risks of accidental exposure that leads to data breaches, and, inevitably, to compliance fines. It’s also worth noting that HeatWave now enforces full data encryption, both at rest and in transit – a setting that users cannot deactivate.</p>
<p>In a way, Oracle continues to bridge the gap in functionality between MySQL, its popular open-source product, and the Oracle Database (ODB), the flagship enterprise one. One could argue that everything HeatWave can offer now, ODB already could do years ago. However, the company is making this functionality available to an entirely new audience, ensuring that people can utilize their familiar technology for new business use cases without the need to change anything in their existing applications.</p>
<p>And, of course, by being fully compatible with MySQL-based services offered by competitors (like Amazon Aurora or RDS) at the API level, HeatWave makes it easy for potential customers to migrate to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, while still avoiding the danger of vendor lock-in. After all, MySQL is MySQL on every platform, and if you ever have to move away from Oracle, you’ll face no technical difficulties whatsoever. Well, other than a 1000x performance drop, that is…</p>

You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-170-a-bombshell-in-the-battle-for-the-future-of-crypto-2eb78259300b">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI — <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/introducing-the-xrp-mastercard-debit-card-827c0b37445b">Introducing the XRP Mastercard® Debit&nbsp;Card</a></p><p>Also, check out this piece from <a href="https://global.id/vs">/vs </a>— <a href="https://medium.com/@vslavin/what-determines-your-digital-trust-halo-ece88bb4ab23">What determines your digital trust&nbsp;halo?</a></p> This week:   A brief history of the infrastructure bill’s crypto controversy  An overview of team&nbsp;Wyden  The Toomey-Warner-Lummis-Sinema-Portman amendment  What Gary Gensler and the SEC are up&nbsp;to  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. A brief history of the infrastructure bill’s crypto controversy <p>Let’s catch up. Last Monday, we <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-171-how-crypto-will-be-regulated-in-the-u-s-1185eddf7c6e">chatted about the U.S. infrastructure bill</a>, and how crypto found itself included as a potential source of tax revenue to help fund some of the stuff we’d like to build in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>That in and of itself is not necessarily contentious. The issue was around the use of the term “broker” and how it was too broadly defined such that anyone — developers, node operators, users might all be lumped under the umbrella of “broker.”</p><p>Around the time that I published last week’s newsletter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/us/politics/infrastructure-deal-cryptocurrency.html">last minute concessions</a> pushed by the crypto industry and its lobbyists had just made its way into the bill. It seemed like that may have been the end of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Instead, a “fierce lobbying war” ensued as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the Biden administration <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/06/crypto-bitcoin-infrastructure-senate/">fought the&nbsp;changes</a>.</p><p>And so — lines were drawn and key players emerged. Because crypto is apparently <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/09/cryptocurrency-influence-washington-infrastructure-fight-502792">a really big&nbsp;deal</a>:</p><blockquote>“This has definitely been a wake-up call to crypto,” said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, an industry lobbying group. “But on the flip side, I think Washington is starting to see that crypto is more of a force than anybody ever anticipated.”</blockquote><p>Jake Chervinksy has <a href="https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1423653975459516416">a great tweetstorm explainer of the ongoing battles and warring factions</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a>) — Senators Wyden, Lummis, and Toomey on the side of crypto, Senators Portman and Warner on the other, and Yellen and the Biden administration looking nervously on.</p><p>But as of Sunday night, no agreement had been&nbsp;reached.</p> 2. An overview of Team&nbsp;Wyden <p>From <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/09/cryptocurrency-influence-washington-infrastructure-fight-502792">Politico</a>:</p><blockquote>Lobbyists scored a clear victory by winning over Wyden, the top Senate Democrat responsible for writing tax legislation. Wyden, who has served in Congress for four decades, has long had a soft spot for emerging technologies.</blockquote><blockquote>His Democratic predecessor at the helm of the Finance Committee, Max Baucus of Montana, was hired earlier this year as an adviser to the digital currency exchange&nbsp;Binance.</blockquote><blockquote>Wyden teamed up with Toomey and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) to offer an amendment to scale back the tax reporting rules so they would not capture software developers and miners. The proposal put Wyden at odds with the White House and fellow Democrats. In response, Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), in cooperation with the Biden administration, came up with an alternative amendment that would have fewer exclusions.</blockquote><blockquote>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen personally spoke with Wyden to push back against his amendment, an administration official said. She and the White House believed his language would tie Treasury’s hands when it came time to develop regulations spelling out the details of how the rules would&nbsp;work.</blockquote><blockquote>“Crypto’s success with Wyden is one of the most fascinating D.C. influence developments of 2021, and one I suspect other industries will be studying throughout the rest of the decade,” said Jeff Hauser, who tracks corporate lobbying as executive director of the Revolving Door&nbsp;Project.</blockquote><blockquote>Wyden said in a statement that he has spent his career “working from the proposition that Congress needs smart answers to tech policy that actually improve people’s&nbsp;lives.”</blockquote><blockquote>“When civil rights groups, tech experts and folks in Oregon raised concerns that this provision could be interpreted to regulate independent developers and force programmers to create government backdoors, I took their concerns seriously,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote> 3. The Toomey-Warner-Lummis-Sinema-Portman amendment <p>And then Monday afternoon, <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/toomey-warner-lummis-sinema-portman-announce-agreement-on-digital-asset-reporting-requirements-in-infrastructure-bill">a compromise emerged between the two factions</a>:</p><blockquote>“There’s broad agreement that digital asset exchanges behaving as brokers should be required to report transactions just like other kinds of brokers already do. There is also concern that tax evasion and non-compliance are becoming significant issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Some have expressed confusion concerning the underlying text of the infrastructure bill, suggesting it would result in the application of reporting requirements far too broadly and ensnare individuals, developers, and other elements of this ecosystem that could not comply with a reporting mandate.</blockquote><blockquote>“We’ve worked with the Treasury Department to clarify the underlying text and ensure that those who are not acting as brokers will not be subject to the bill’s reporting requirements. While we each would have drafted this solution differently, we all agree it’s important to ensure that these obligations are properly crafted to apply only to entities that are regularly effectuating transactions of digital assets in exchange for consideration. To best memorialize this common understanding, we propose to incorporate this important amendment into the infrastructure bill and urge our colleagues to join us in enacting this bipartisan clarification.”</blockquote><p>At the time of this writing, the Senators are on the floor requesting unanimous consent on adoption of the Toomey-Warner-Lummis-Sinema-Portman amendment. <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424758804667895817">Jerry Brito’s tweetstorm on the compromise amendment</a> is worth checking&nbsp;out.</p><p>But it appears that Senator Ricahrd Shelby (R-AL) objected to the compromise (for apparently unrelated reasons). <a href="https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1424830138995417096">According to Chervinsky</a>, the compromise amendment is already&nbsp;dead.</p><p>Two possible outcomes? Either Senator Shelby changes his mind before the final vote, or the battle wages on at the&nbsp;House.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/09/cryptocurrency-influence-washington-infrastructure-fight-502792">Washington wakes up to crypto influence amid infrastructure fight</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/two-senators-propose-exemptions-to-crypto-tax-reporting-required-by-us-infrastructure-bill">2 Senators Propose Exemptions to Crypto Tax Reporting Required by US Infrastructure Bill — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://pomp.substack.com/p/bitcoin-doesnt-need-presidents-but">Bitcoin doesn’t need Presidents, but Presidents need&nbsp;Bitcoin</a>  <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/toomey-warner-lummis-sinema-portman-announce-agreement-on-digital-asset-reporting-requirements-in-infrastructure-bill">Toomey, Warner, Lummis, Sinema, Portman Announce Agreement on Digital Asset Reporting Requirements in Infrastructure Bill</a>  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/06/crypto-bitcoin-infrastructure-senate/">Cryptocurrency brawl bogs down infrastructure bill, as Yellen and White House fight&nbsp;changes</a>  <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/cryptocurrency-surveillance-provision-buried-infrastructure-bill-disaster-digital">The Cryptocurrency Surveillance Provision Buried in the Infrastructure Bill is a Disaster for Digital&nbsp;Privacy</a>   4. What Gary Gensler and the SEC is up&nbsp;to Photo: Third Wave Think&nbsp;Tank<p>The new SEC chief <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03">spoke at Aspen last week</a>. First, he’s on the same page as Jay Clayton on the topic of&nbsp;ICOs.</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-chair-gensler-agrees-with-predecessor-every-ico-is-a-security">They’re all securities</a>:</p><blockquote>“Generally, folks buying these tokens are anticipating profits, and there’s a small group of entrepreneurs and technologists standing up and nurturing the projects,” Gensler said in prepared remarks. “I believe we have a crypto market now where many tokens may be unregistered securities, without required disclosures or market oversight.”</blockquote><p>Gensler also hinted that the SEC might start targeting exchanges next:</p><blockquote>“A typical trading platform has more than 50 tokens on it. In fact, many have well in excess of 100 tokens. While each token’s legal status depends on its own facts and circumstances, the probability is quite remote that, with 50 or 100 tokens, any given platform has zero securities,” Gensler&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-pro-rata-f62e200a-033e-41ee-a5dd-ece2362c2ef3.html">Dan Primack on&nbsp;Gensler</a>:</p><blockquote>Between the lines: While Gensler is less hard-line than Clayton on existing laws being all that are needed to regulate this new world of digital tokens, he’s quite firm in his view that much of the investment in crypto is driven by speculation and hope of profits — and should be regulated as&nbsp;such.</blockquote>  “Standing astride [of the law] isn’t a sustainable place to be,” he&nbsp;warned.  <blockquote>Details: Gensler noted that while existing laws are quite clear when it comes to figuring out if something is a security, his agency may need new laws from Congress to help better regulate new crypto trading platforms.</blockquote>  He also said that some of them “are trying to play arbitrage between the jurisdictions” of various countries, making it all the more important for his agency to have the right&nbsp;tools.  The emergence of the “decentralized finance” protocols that let participants execute various transactions directly with each other instead of using intermediaries are creating new unregulated ways for people to engage in activities that would otherwise fall under strict&nbsp;rules.  Gensler also signaled his agency could move to finally approve some form of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund — a vehicle many have tried to get approval for, unsuccessfully so far given regulators’ concerns over market manipulation risks.  Also on his watch list: stablecoins, which he noted can be used to get around regulatory oversight.  <blockquote>The bottom line: Expect to hear a lot more about cryptocurrencies from the&nbsp;SEC.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile the SEC took actions against <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-145">a DeFi protocol</a> and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-147">a crypto exchange</a> on Friday and Monday, respectively.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-will-police-cryptocurrencies-to-maximum-possible-extent-chair-gary-gensler-says-11628007567">Crypto ‘Wild West’ Needs Stronger Investor Protection, SEC Chief&nbsp;Says</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-chair-gensler-agrees-with-predecessor-every-ico-is-a-security">SEC’s Gensler Agrees With Predecessor: ‘Every ICO Is a Security’ — CoinDesk</a>   5.
