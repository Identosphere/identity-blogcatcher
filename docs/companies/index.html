<p>It’s been a while since the last Dev Pulse. My commitment to you, dear reader, is that, at a minimum, I always publish a Dev Pulse if there’s a Holochain release with breaking changes. But it turns out that I missed something way back in Holochain 0.0.172! I apologise for the oversight.</p><p>You may also have heard that we’ve announced an important date — we’ll be releasing Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 by December 15th, and we’re asking all devs to write a bunch of tests for their hApps and hammer this RC with those tests. The goal is to discover bugs and stabilise it for the 0.1.0 beta release in January. Read more about how you can help in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold/">official announcement</a>.</p> Release notes  Holochain 0.0.172: <code>AuthorizeZomeCallSigningKey</code> name change <p>Release date: 9 November 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.8<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.160<br>Breaking changes: admin API, HDI, HDK</p><p>Breaking (admin API): The admin API endpoint <code>AuthorizeZomeCallSigningKey</code> had its name and call signature changed, as I <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/hackathon-tool-upgrades-hrea/#holochain-00170-authorise-signing-key-get-dna-def">warned</a> in the previous Dev Pulse. It’s now called <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.0.69/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.GrantZomeCallCapability"><code>GrantZomeCallCapability</code></a> to better reflect that it can be used to create any capability grant, not just an assigned one for signing zome calls. As part of this change, the <code>provenance</code> field has also been removed, as it duplicated information already contained in <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_zome_types/0.0.55/holochain_zome_types/capability/enum.CapAccess.html#variant.Assigned"><code>CapAccess::Assigned</code></a>, which can be used in the payload’s <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_zome_types/0.0.55/holochain_zome_types/capability/struct.ZomeCallCapGrant.html#structfield.access"><code>cap_grant.access</code></a> field. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1647">#1647</a>)</p><p>Breaking (HDI/HDK): Wasmer has been updated to 2.3.0. As part of this change, the Holochain wasmer crate has led to simplifications that require fewer <code>.into()</code>s in your HDK code. You probably won’t need to rewrite any code, but you will need to recompile your zomes against HDI 0.1.8 and HDK 0.0.160 because serialisation across the host/guest boundary has changed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1620">#1620</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.173: Network performance tweak #1 <p>Release date: 16 November 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.8<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.160 and 0.0.161<br>Breaking changes: none</p><p>This release brings the first of a series of experiments to reduce network traffic, timeouts, and deadlocks, which appears to be the primary cause of slow gossip. <code>rpc_multi</code>, a low-level function in the networking layer used to retrieve DHT data, no longer contacts multiple peers. Because it's an experiment, this change may not remain. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1651">#1651</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.174: Smaller gossip packets, signals from <code>post_commit</code> <p>Release date: 23 November 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.8 and 0.1.9<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.160 to 0.0.162<br>Breaking changes: network protocol</p><p>Breaking (network protocol): To reduce network timeouts, the amount of traffic being transferred in a network message has gotten smaller in two ways:</p>  Hard breaking: Entry data can only be 4 MB in size (down from 16 MB to reduce gossip bottlenecks for nodes with slow upload speeds). If your hApp does any blob chunking, it’s time to change the chunk size!  Soft breaking: Gossip rounds have a soft limit of 1 MB. This is more of an agreement than an enforced limit, although older conductors will likely have a hard time syncing with this version and newer.  <p>(<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1659">#1659</a>)</p><p>Bug fix (HDK): You can now use <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/p2p/fn.emit_signal.html"><code>emit_signal</code></a> within your <code>post_commit</code> callbacks, which allows a hApp’s UI to respond to writes triggered by <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/time/fn.schedule.html">scheduled</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-scheduler-in-your-zome">tasks</a>, calls from other <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#inter-zome-call">zomes</a> and local <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#bridge-call">cells</a>, and <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#remote-call">remote calls</a> into a cell from other nodes, as well as simply receive notifications that a <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#client-call">locally</a> triggered post-commit has finished.

(<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1667">#1667</a>) Here’s the full list:</p>  <code>ZomeId</code> → <code>ZomeIndex</code>, <code>zome_id</code> → <code>zome_index</code>  <code>AppEntryType.id</code> → <code>AppEntryType.entry_index</code>  <code>AppEntryType</code> → <code>AppEntryDef</code>  <code>AppEntryDefName</code> → <code>AppEntryName</code>  <code>AppRoleId</code> → <code>RoleName</code>  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20221130011217">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Getting an hREA node set up: quick start <p>Connor Turland has posted a quick-start guide for getting a <a href="https://hrea.io">hREA</a> node set up.

Holochain Beta and more <p>This section is written for developers who are planning the development of their app and need precise details. If that’s not you, here’s the tl;dr: Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc will be released by 15 December, 0.1.0-beta will be released sometime in January, and it’ll be API-stable and supported for the following six months. Meanwhile, we’re working on performance improvements, security audits, and important components for developers and users. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold/">Read the announcement</a>.</p><p>The core dev team is working hard to stabilise everything for the upcoming release candidate and the following 0.1.0 beta release. The first release candidate will arrive by 15 December and the beta sometime in January.</p><p>0.1.0-beta will have a long-term support (LTS) promise, marking a freeze on all breaking changes and a promise to support hosted discovery services for six months from its release date, as long as you and your users stick to the 0.1.x series. (We may release and support &gt;=0.2.x series in this same timeframe, and you’re welcome to move your app and users to them, but they’ll be separate and parallel and won’t affect our promises for 0.1.x.) This means that you can depend on the stability of the following things within 0.1.x’s LTS period:</p>  Network protocol: You won’t have to ask your users to keep upgrading their Holochain version to keep interacting with their friends and colleagues who are using newer versions.  Discovery protocols and services: Your users will still be able to find each other, because the bootstrap and proxy protocols won’t change, and Holochain’s hosted bootstrapping and proxying services will keep running.  Host API (HDI and HDK): You won’t have to refactor your hApp’s core code to keep up with SDK changes.  App API: You won’t have to refactor your hApp’s UI code to keep up with conductor updates.  Admin API: If you’re a container creator (e.g., you build something like Launcher, Embedded Holochain Runner, or the Tryorama test framework), you won’t have to refactor your codebase that controls the conductor.  <p>Here’s what’ll be included in beta-0.1.0 (if you’ve been following the project for a while, most of these will be old news).</p>  A runtime executable (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain">conductor</a>) and a WebAssembly VM for running the core of your applications  An end-user <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">launcher</a> with a built-in app store, available for Windows, macOS, and Linux  A secure key store for Holochain-related secrets  Developer tools for stubbing, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding">scaffolding</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">testing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/develop/crates/hc_sandbox">running</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/develop/crates/hc_bundle">packaging</a> applications, and a <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/">development environment</a> based on Nixos that gives you the full suite of Holochain tools and lets you keep all your application’s dependencies pinned — not just Rust libraries but all the binaries too  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#how-to-secure-functions-against-unauthorized-use">Capability-based security</a> that allows developers to write applications that give their users control over the ways their agency is accessed  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/">Source chains</a> for recording individual state changes  A peer-to-peer protocol that connects machines into separate, private, TLS-encrypted network spaces  A sharded <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/">DHT</a> that validates and stores content-addressed <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/5_links_anchors/">graph data</a>, creating a separate distributed database for each network space  Composability via <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#bridge-call">bridge function calls</a> between a user’s running applications  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#remote-call">Remote function calls</a> that allow people to delegate their agency to each other  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/">Node-to-node signals</a> that bypass the DHT  Countersigning of atomic state changes across multiple parties’ source chains, including a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/quantised-gossip-optional-countersigners/#holochain-00148-enzymatic-countersigning-functional">primary witness with M-of-N optional witnesses</a> for building highly available, lightweight consensus  Cell cloning for creating new private network spaces with existing applications  <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/quantised-gossip-optional-countersigners/#holochain-00147-quantised-gossip">Quantised gossip</a> and a host of other performance improvements to make both publishing and gossiping faster and more respectful of system resources  <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/integrity-and-coordination-part-ways/#holochain-00144-integritycoordination-split">Integrity and coordinator zomes</a>, for maintaining the core data rules over long periods while issuing updates to controller logic  External hash references and Holochain resource locators that allow an application’s graph database to refer to data on other DHTs or outside of Holochain   What are we asking of you? <p>If you’re developing a hApp, library, tool, or container, we ask you to:</p>  Update your hApp’s zome and client code to work with Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc when it’s published.  Run all your tests against the upcoming release candidates (if you haven’t written tests yet, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/">Tryorama</a> is a JavaScript-based scenario testing framework, and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/latest/holochain/sweettest/index.html">Sweettest</a> is a Rust-based framework that comes with the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain">holochain</a> crate and allows you to mock certain parts of the Holochain stack).

This milestone will allow them to move more confidently, which will translate to more rapid movement.</p><p>In addition, they’ve been rewriting their <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/web-sdk">Holo Web SDK</a> to align more closely with the API of the Holochain JavaScript client. This will mean that it’ll be easier for you to get your hApps ready for pre-beta testing on the hosting network.</p> What will happen after this? <p>Here are some <a href="https://holochain.org/roadmap/">roadmap</a> items that won’t be part of 0.1.0-beta. We'll also be updating the roadmap and adding more details beyond the 0.1.x-beta milestone.</p>  Immune system / warranting to identify and take action against bad actors  Ephemeral store for storing non-source-chain data that can be removed later  Merkle tree entries that provide public proofs of the existence of private data, which can be selectively disclosed to those who ask for it  Pub/sub signals which allows nodes to selectively listen for messages and DHT events by topic  A new large-scale testing framework, which allows developers to spin up &gt;100k nodes across multiple machines and run automated test scenarios  Attack Factory, a library of common threat scenarios that can be played against your hApp to test it for vulnerabilities  <p>Holochain 0.2.0, the ‘network stable’ beta, will include the immune system, end-to-end encryption, a new transport protocol based on WebRTC and TURN, and potentially other features from the list above. It will likely come out while the 0.1.x series is being supported, and will carry its own separate six-month long-term-support promise.</p><p>Not all point release bumps (e.g., 0.2.x, 0.3.x) will contain breaking changes for the things you touch as a developer, so you may find that your hApp will work just fine on the next point version.</p> Happening in parallel <p>In the meantime, things are happening in the larger ecosystem. In the coming months, you can expect further performance improvements, a revamped scaffolding tool (similar to the famous Rails scaffolder), as well as useful core libraries like DeepKey. Various dev teams will be sharing their rollout plans soon.</p> Let’s go! <p>I’m not gonna lie — I’m really excited for this next phase of Holochain’s journey. I know that existing hApp developers are looking forward to things quieting down (although new features are cool too), and I’ve also talked to app developers who are waiting for this stage of maturity before they start devoting time to building on Holochain. It feels like there’s a lot of energy just waiting for this moment, which is fast approaching.</p><p>If you want to know more, read the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold/">official announcement</a> from the Holochain Foundation and take a look at the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/roadmap/">Holochain roadmap</a>.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@zhpix?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Pascal Meier</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/runway?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 In an industry rife with grooming, racism and even money laundering, isn’t it time the video games industry fixed its KYG (Know Your Gamer) problem? 



 



<p>It’s safe to say that many of us have played at least one video game in their life. Today, over <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/three-billion-people-worldwide-now-play-video-games-new-report-shows">3 billion people</a> in the world play video games in their spare time, whether that’s on a console, a computer, or a smartphone. Little wonder then that the market is estimated to be worth approximately <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-152/Accenture-Gaming-Article.pdf">$300 billion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The industry has changed considerably since Pong (a table tennis-themed video game released by Atari) launched in 1972. Long gone are the days of gamers queuing up outside video games shops to get their favorite release. Now, 83% of video games sales are made online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also been a huge rise in online gaming, thanks in part to the introduction of lightning-fast internet speeds and other technological developments that can facilitate battle royales, and other mass group games. Nowadays, huge communities of gamers can be found in gaming companies’ online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery services, such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network (PSN), Steam or Ubisoft Connect. According to a <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-152/Accenture-Gaming-Article.pdf">study from Accenture</a>, 84% of gamers believe video games allow them to meet people who share common interests. In an increasingly insular world, the social aspect of video games has never been more important.&nbsp;</p>



 Community-centric experiences.&nbsp; 



<p>Although video games offer the gamer exciting and rewarding adventures, and the opportunity to meet people from around the world, the industry has never been far from controversy. Much like horror films in the 80s, video games are often used as the scapegoat for <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/26/20754659/video-games-and-violence-debate-moral-panic-history">real life violent events</a>. They are also criticized for their addictive nature, with children racking up <a href="https://gamerant.com/6-year-old-spends-16k-microtransactions-moms-credit-card-sonic-forces-ios-apple/">thousands of dollars</a> in microtransactions, and with increasing incidents of online grooming, harassment and racism, certain online gaming platforms have been accused of being toxic cesspools, and certainly no place for children to be spending their spare time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, online gaming platforms are feeling a growing pressure from their communities to provide a safe and respectful environment. If they don’t, there can be serious repercussions for revenue and reputation, and for the gaming experience and community at large. For example, the notorious French gamer Yannox was <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/ubisoft-obtient-la-condamnation-d-un-tricheur-notoire-sur-rainbow-six-39935583.htm">fined €2,600</a> in January 2020 after creating a toxic environment for the Rainbow Six (tactical First Person Shooter) community. The gamer was found to have cheated regularly, and was banned 80 times by developer Ubisoft, which of course affected other players’ gaming experiences. It was also alleged that Yannox caused the swatting (phoning a false emergency to cause disruption) of Ubisoft offices in November 2020, after getting banned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, such misconduct is not an isolated incident. In fact, the bigger the online community, the more <a href="https://www.protocol.com/unity-online-gaming-toxicity-study#toggle-gdpr">toxic behavior</a>. Perhaps emboldened by the anonymity that online gaming platforms provide, misbehavior like bullying or verbal abuse is now an almost inescapable part of the gaming community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://www.adl.org/hateisnogame">third annual report</a>, conducted in 2021, the Anti-Defamation League surveyed a representative sample of US players regarding the prevalence of toxic behavior. It found that 71% of adult online gamers experienced severe abuse, including physical threats, stalking, and sustained harassment, while 60% of responders aged 13-17 experienced harassment in online multiplayer games. On top of that, 42% of women and 41% of African Americans reported to have been harassed because of their gender or race.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how can video game companies provide a safe environment for their players, free from verbal abuse, harassment, or cheating? The actions currently taken by gaming platforms like banning or freezing accounts do not seem to act as a big-enough deterrent. Players can simply just create a new account and rejoin the community and continue to engage in misconduct. How? Well, one of the main reasons is because there are currently either very limited, or no identity verification checks when registering for online gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why KYC in video games should be a priority.&nbsp; 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC requirements</a> have been in place for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-regulations-uk/">online gambling</a> for several years, the video games industry has enjoyed a comparatively hands-off regulatory oversight. However, with increasing pressure from campaigners, the general public, and the gaming communities, gaming platforms now face a conundrum: Should they implement rigorous customer onboarding to verify players’ identities, and run the risk of losing customers who don’t want to prove who they are? The more pressing question, however, should be: with the potential impact to reputation, business disruption, and a negative experience for gamers, can they really afford not to?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the future, is it foreseeable that regulators could turn their attention to gaming platforms, making it a requirement to verify the identities of all players? This level of accountability would not only act as a deterrent from gamers engaging in nefarious activities, but it would also, of course, prevent underage gamers from playing certain games, or purchasing microtransactions online. Such restrictions could be based on <a href="https://www.internetmatters.org/resources/video-games-age-ratings-explained/">PEGI standards</a>. KYC checks could also be used to prevent anti money laundering.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Not all fun and games.&nbsp; 



<p>A <a>recent study</a> from the Radicalization Awareness Network from the European Commission highlighted that Steam and PSN (among others) could be considered “hotbeds for radicalization”. Indeed, as it has become increasingly difficult to launder money through financial services providers, criminal organizations have begun to look out for new avenues, like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-protect-owners-guests-holiday-rental-scams/">holiday home rental scams</a>, for illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combine the rise in popularity of microtransactions, with the potential for money laundering, and you have a deadly cocktail that may very well push authorities to start asking for KYC requirements in the industry in the very near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With criminal organizations constantly on the lookout for new streams of revenue, payment systems in video games have become a target of choice. The use of convertible and non-convertible virtual currencies for in-game purchases, in particular, has proved to be an efficient way to launder money, as identity verification is yet to be enforced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/5510338/Sixgill%20Threat%20Reports/Carding%20and%20the%20Gaming%20industry%20-%20Sixgill%20Threat%20Report.pdf?utm_campaign=Lead%20Gen%20from%20Threat%20Reports&amp;utm_source=hs_automation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=74779191&amp;_hsmi=74779191">report from Sixgill</a> highlighted how <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/fr/home">Fortnite</a> is often used for carding (a form of credit card fraud, in which a stolen credit card is used to charge prepaid cards or purchase gift cards) and as a haven for money-laundering.&nbsp; Bad actors will use illicitly gained funds to purchase in-game currency, then use the virtual currency to buy in-game goods. Finally, they will sell the goods in exchange for “clean” money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Valve <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xw7nx/nearly-all-counter-strike-microtransactions-are-being-used-for-money-laundering">reported</a> that “nearly all” microtransactions in Counter Strike: Global Offensive were being used for money laundering, and was forced to stop specific trading between accounts. Perhaps the question should therefore be not if regulators will consider KYC requirements for the video games industry, but rather when.&nbsp;</p>



 Painful account opening processes.&nbsp; 



<p>From a gamer’s perspective, registering and opening accounts is often seen as a pain point that gets in the way of the fun, but automated identity verification solutions can be integrated seamlessly into a player’s onboarding journey without impacting on the gaming experience. From the business side, not only does KYC help gaming companies gain a better understanding of their players, but it also enables them to weed out the toxic gamers wreaking havoc on their communities. Having these processes in place now will enable video game companies to stay ahead of the pack if AML regulations were ever introduced in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>KYC should be considered the next step in building better and safer online gaming communities. Gaming accounts that have been correctly vetted and verified will allow for easier and more accurate identification of bad actors, and eliminate verbal abuse, cheating, bullying, and fraud. It can also help players retrieve their account after a takeover, as they will be able to easily verify their identity and prove they are the rightful owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although digital identity verification solutions are typically adopted by banking and financial services as regulated entities, such technology and processes have a wide application of use cases in different industries, including gaming companies. Transparent, efficient and painless for the user, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> from IDnow is an ID solution that can be integrated easily into a mobile app through SDK, a web flow or directly through the IDnow AutoIdent application.</p>

             <p>Our award-winning management book ‘Everything Transaction’ is now also available in German. (‘Alles Transaktion’).</p>

<p>In an increasingly digital world, every interaction is becoming a transaction. These transactions go beyond the exchange of money in return for a product or service. In fact, exchanges based on data are rapidly becoming the norm in the digital world. These data-driven transactions are becoming relevant across industries, and especially in the financial services industry in the shape of ‘Open Finance’. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Financial institutions have reached a strategic crossroads and need to answer several fundamental questions, including: How will transactions evolve in the context of financial services? What role should entities like financial institutions and service providers play? And which commercial opportunities and risks are involved?</p>

<p>These and many more questions are answered in the award-winning book called ‘Everything Transaction’, which has now also been published in German (‘Alles Transaktion’). The book offers numerous up-to-date insights and concepts for players operating in an increasingly data-driven economy, and helps executives better navigate the digital world from the unique perspective of data-driven transactions.</p>

<p>In September, Anonyome Labs’ co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley was once again invited to share his insights on the “topic of the era in the privacy and identity space”—decentralized identity—this time, for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OwU73L-T4Y">Ethereum Engineering Group meet-up</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> is the community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications. The engineering group regularly meets to discuss applications, engineering, and research, and records each meet-up for its thousands of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ethereumengineeringgroup">subscribers</a>.</p>



<p>For Ethereum, Dr Ashley delivered his landmark talk on progress and pitfalls on the path to decentralized identity. It’s this talk that has event organizers regularly inviting Dr Ashley to speak on the topic of decentralized identity—known as the third wave of identity and access management on the internet. That, and the fact Anonyome Labs is at the leading edge of implementing DI technology through its API platform, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>. (See our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">identity wallet</a> and our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> service.)</p>



<p>Dr Ashley told the Ethereum group that with the continued rise of the <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance economy</a>, the world needs solutions that improve <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> for the general public—and we’re seeing those solutions come from <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity</a>.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity is the most important privacy technology innovation for the next decade because it gives users control of their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.</p>



<p>The anchor of trust for decentralized identity-based applications is the blockchain/ledger and as such decentralized identity is one of the most important use cases for blockchain/ledger technology. (See <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/dr-ashley-presents-on-opportunities-and-challenges-of-real-world-applications-of-blockchain-at-australian-event/">Dr Ashley’s presentation</a> on that topic.)</p>

   A look into the evaluation process for the Forrester Wave™ for CIAM 2022 

<p>When considering a technology investment, many organizations seek the expertise of industry analysts, often turning to the most respected firms and popular industry reports as a way to shortlist their vendor selections. From my perspective, as a vendor undergoing the evaluation process, it's been interesting to observe the different approaches researchers take as they analyze companies and their product offerings. In this post, I'd like to explore our experience with one firm in particular, Forrester, in its creation of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forrester-names-forgerock-leader-ciam">The Forrester Wave™: Customer Identity and Access Management, Q4 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone (myself included) loves to see how different vendors stack up in a report's final chart or diagram. But have you wondered what goes into those findings? How do the analysts reach their conclusions, and how do they ascertain that vendors can actually do what they claim they do? We feel it's not always obvious in the rankings, nor can you derive a lot of insight from the short vendor descriptions that are a part of most reports.</p>

<p>I was deeply involved in the request for information (RFI) with Forrester for the 2022 report, and I believe I can shed some light on the evaluation process.</p>

<p>Typically, analyst reports begin in similar fashion: the team conducts primary research on a given technology area to develop a list of vendors to consider for evaluation. From that initial list, the vendors are narrowed down based on various inclusion criteria until the final list is determined. While different firms take different approaches to reach their conclusions, this is the point at which Forrester will gather details on the product and strategy of each vendor through a detailed questionnaire, along with use-case demos, briefings, and customer reference interviews. Forrester takes those inputs, along with each of its analyst's experience and expertise in the marketplace, to score vendors using a rating system that compares each vendor against others in the evaluation.</p>

<p>The approach taken by Forrester in its Wave for CIAM report is extensive, much like a full vendor selection, evaluation, and proof process we would see from an enterprise customer and in some cases moreso.</p>

<p>For this report, 15 vendors were asked to provide a thorough RFI response detailing their strategy and market presence. As the head of the sales engineering organization at ForgeRock, I've been involved in our response to numerous requests for proposals from prospective customers, including some of the world's largest enterprises, and I've rarely seen any request as exhaustive as the one submitted by Forrester for this report. Their evaluation included 22 criteria, including detailed descriptions of our product vision, roadmap, market approach, partner ecosystems, delivery models, revenue, and number of live installations, including such details as the largest number of customer authentication attempts per hour at a single client organization. We were also asked to supply a list of customers so that Forrester could conduct reference interviews. Which they did.</p>

<p>Each vendor also had to document how it delivers a set of key use cases. The use cases for the latest Forrester Wave™ for CIAM included:</p>

  Data orchestration: configure intelligent workflow scenarios (aka low-code approaches to deployments). What kinds of visual workflows are available? 
	 Users and roles: manage role-based access control (RBAC), including adding users to roles and roles to users, editing fine-grained permissions, and using role inheritance and/or embedded roles. 
	 Customer IDV and registration: configure identity verification of a new user. What out-of-the-box integrations are available? 
	 Consent management: configure privacy-by-design (data residency) for customer PII that the CIAM solution stores. Show configurations for multiple customer countries, geographical segmentation of users, etc. 
	 Authentication methods: configure protection against credential stuffing, account takeover, and password spraying, and how to enable single sign-on (SSO), passwordless, biometrics, and tokens for multi-factor authentication. 
	 Risk-based authentication: configure risk-based customer authentications and rule-based risk scores, and configure which authentication methods will be invoked based on the risk score. 
	 Customer-self-service: configure policies for customers to recover a forgotten user ID, manage their devices, update their profile, and more. 
	 Business systems integration: configure the CIAM solution to integrate with CRM (e.g., Salesforce), MDM, web analytics, ecommerce portal, and others. What features are available beyond SCIM? 
	 IDV and fraud management: configure the CIAM solution to integrate with third-party IDV solutions, such as Equifax, Experian, LexisNexis, TransUnion, etc., and with an Enterprise or Retail Fraud Management solution, among others. 
	 Reporting, dashboarding, and scalability: set up, define, and run an ad-hoc report. Show filtering, changing order of columns, hiding/showing columns in the output. And show how to set up customized dashboards for CIAM administrators. 
 <p>And this is where it is a little different with Forrester. In addition to written descriptions, they required vendors to demonstrate each use-case scenario in real time to the analyst, which typically took three hours. Under each of the use cases listed above were five or more specific use cases. Vendors had to document and demonstrate their effectiveness in all of them, for a total of 50 use case demos. Beyond just responding to and demonstrating the use cases documented, the analyst can "go off-script," asking the team to demonstrate other capabilities or prove something out a little further — this is a real examination of both the platform and the team presenting.</p>

<p>The use cases Forrester examined for its analysis represent a comprehensive set of requirements for any modern CIAM solution. We believe that any organization considering buying and implementing identity for their customer- or citizen-facing services should be looking at these capabilities and understanding why certain vendors outperformed others.</p>

<p>The team at Forrester has many years of experience in the IAM and CIAM segment and rigorously tests vendors. But we believe this rigor is exactly why ForgeRock obtained the highest score possible in 15 criteria, including data orchestration, users and roles, customer IDV and registration, consent management, authentication methods, risk-based authentication, and customer self-service. And ForgeRock earned the highest score amongst all vendors in the current offering and strategy categories.</p>

<p>When investing in an essential technology, like CIAM, it's important to examine the capabilities that matter most to your organization's success. Reading <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forrester-names-forgerock-leader-ciam">The Forrester Wave™: Customer Identity and Access Management, Q4 2022</a> is a great place to start.</p>

				  Twitter already showed how misinformation moves fast; but botched identity shows that “verified” misinformation can move even faster  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By James Schulte</p>
<p>With his acquisition of Twitter, Elon Musk has set about to make sweeping changes, one sure to be analyzed in business school case studies for years to come</p>
<p>Until now, a Twitter blue check was, for many, a status symbol reserved for those with high numbers of followers, celebrity, or organizational status; it was something to be achieved. More importantly, it also served as a way for users to know for certain that a tweet truly originated from the high-profile person purported to be behind the account. It was designed to protect the reputation of individuals and organizations and made it easier for users to parse through the never-ending flow of opinions and updates of hundreds of millions of users and organizations each day. But it was reserved for the few. Musk wanted to democratize verification through charging for a blue check.</p>
<p>“You too can have the long sought-after blue checkmark for just $8” Sure, ok.<br>“Eliminate the bots and spam!” Sounds great.<br>“Cut down on fake news?” Yes, please. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it was launched.</p>
<p>But what, exactly? It was not clear that verification was being performed at all—or it was being done in a way to make a mockery of the process. Some were quick to take advantage of the situation. By simply changing their Twitter handle, tweaking their profile name, and paying $8 for “verification,” they could easily impersonate other people or companies. Now you could be anyone you wanted to be AND have it officially verified by Twitter — a perfect storm for an online identity crisis.</p>
<p>For business, the result was a nightmare:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>&nbsp;Incredibly, fake accounts led to billions of dollars in lost market cap:&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 And it wasn’t just Eli Lilly that took a hit. Two of its top competitors, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, saw sharp drops in share price as well, also equaling billions of shareholder dollars.<p></p>
<p>Twitter’s largest source of revenue has, historically, come from large companies looking to reach a large audience. But now, some companies are questioning their presence on the platform, viewing it as a liability to their brand. Some major advertisers have paused paid ads, including General Motors, United Airlines, General Mills, and Audi.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, the new verification scheme had been paused. Some 140K users had signed up for the $8 “verification.” This is the equivalent of $13.4M ARR— or an amount easily obtainable from the ad spend of a single advertiser. In addition to being a small amount of revenue, this low-quality verification scheme has likely cost Twitter itself billions of dollars.</p>
<p>How should Twitter solve its verification problem?<br>
Part of Twitter’s problem with verification is that it doesn’t have good resources to lean on when it comes to verifying every company, government, and person; it becomes the sole arbiter of impersonation attempts. Pre-Musk Twitter solved this problem by limiting verification to those invited — this allowed it to limit the amount of leg work required while avoiding the combinatorial effect of ‘open’ registration. Musk’s attempt was, perhaps, noble, but naive to the difficulties of actually proving identity.</p>
<p>The solution is portable trust enabled with verifiable data. This approach avoids the logistical, technical, and regulatory issues with database and API integrations. Data is cryptographically signed, which allows it to be verified when it’s presented. The data can move with the subject, rather than rely on direct contact with the authority.</p>
<p>All kinds of data can be made into a verifiable credential. Business registrations, proof of employment, drivers licenses, anything.</p>
<p>So how does this help Twitter?</p>
<p>Imagine an ecosystem where a variety of credentials are available to both businesses and individuals. During registration, credentials may be presented to Twitter. Twitter can verify both the cryptographic signatures and the validity of the issuer, and use that verified information to make decisions about the names being registered. This is a vast improvement over today’s ad-hoc verification process of manually chasing down information from a wide variety of sources.</p>
<p>Before you ask, we are not going to claim that the product we sell will solve Elon’s problem in 15 seconds or less. What we do have is experience with the&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">open-source decentralized identity technology</a> that begins to solve the underlying problems with verifying data and identity online — and which will make Twitter’s verification challenge a much easier task.</p>
<p>Indicio has experience working with verifiable credentials and the open-source projects that support their issuance and verification. We have a packaged offering called <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven™</a> that offers commercial support for those that don’t want to use the open source project directly. This allows the issuance and verification of credentials and functions as an important part or a start of a credential ecosystem.</p>
<p>With an active ecosystem of credential issuers, verification procedures for Twitter (or anyone else with a verification problem) become fast and efficient — and much more resilient to impersonation attempts and other issues that can cause the havoc we are observing now.</p>
<p>We can also offer design consulting or assistance for any circumstance. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Give us a call!</a></p>

  Brazil’s crypto bill permits its use as a means of payment, but it doesn’t make crypto a legal&nbsp;tender.  Being approved by Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies, the bill awaits President Bolsonaro’s signature to be enacted into&nbsp;law.  Being a regional powerhouse, Brazil might lead the way to more Latin American countries allowing crypto payments within their boundaries.  <p>The Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, a federal legislative body, has legalized cryptocurrencies as a payment method throughout the&nbsp;country.</p><p>It is a massive win for the industry, although a notch below what El Salvador did by adopting Bitcoin as a legal&nbsp;tender.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/TheCryptoLark/status/1598076989428363264?s=20&amp;t=rsAEhuVdzFIfGcx2AXfsOA">Image Source</a>)<p>This is not the first time Brazil has taken crypto-friendly steps. Earlier this year, in June, a similar proposal was issued to allow Brazilians to use crypto as a means of payment and protect their private keys from being taken by&nbsp;courts.</p><p>The bill was approved by the Senate in April but was stuck for the Chamber of Deputies’s approval for a considerable time. Finally, it got greenlighted on Nov. 29, and now it only requires outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro’s signature to be enacted into&nbsp;law.</p><p>Once the bill becomes law, the government will decide which office will run the cryptocurrency sector in the country. Meanwhile, tokens considered securities would remain under the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission’s jurisdiction.</p><p>However, this law doesn’t make crypto a legal tender in the country. Instead, it includes digital currencies along with frequent traveler rewards from airlines (air mileage programs) in the definition of payment&nbsp;methods.</p> Bringing VASPs Into Legal&nbsp;Folds <p>The new law will directly impact all virtual asset service providers (VASPs) that conduct transfers, exchange virtual assets, exchange virtual currencies for local or foreign currencies, or are involved in financial services connected to issuers or vendors of crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In addition to approving crypto’s usage as a payment method, it is mandatory for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to obtain a&nbsp;license.</p><p>According to local media outlets, all active crypto providers in Brazil will be forced to have a physical entity in the country, with fines and even prison sentences for those breaching the new rules. The bill, however, would give companies a grace period for compliance.</p><p>One of the most critical aspects of the regulation is the exchanges are required to make a clear distinction between company and user funds to avoid another incident like the FTX collapse, which misused $10 billion of customer&nbsp;funds.</p> Regulators on the&nbsp;watch <p>The country has made considerable progress in crypto regulation. But as a FATF member country, Brazil needs adequate AML/CFT safeguards to ensure crypto isn’t used in illicit activities.</p><p>For instance, the FAFT, too, has crypto-specific guidelines that countries must adopt, known as the Travel Rule, according to which VASPs must obtain and exchange information on senders and beneficiaries whenever the amount transacted is above $1,000. This is not a hard limit, as countries can lower it if they see a need for&nbsp;it.</p><p>Although Brazil hasn’t enforced the FATF Travel Rule yet, its move to legalize crypto payments may very well be a catalyst that will compel it to adopt it at the earliest.</p><p>That is not to say that Brazil lacks laws to penalize crimes involving cryptocurrencies, as, under Brazil’s regulatory framework, those guilty of fraud involving virtual assets will have to serve a jail sentence between two and six years plus a fine.

 2022 has witnessed record growth for fintechs, but wherever there are opportunities, there is increased competition, and greater scrutiny from regulators. 



 



<p>There has never been a time of greater opportunity for financial technology businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continual advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics are delivering digital-first solutions to meet ravenous consumer demand for instant, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">mobile-led products and services</a>.</p>



<p>A glance at Forbes’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2022/06/07/fintech-50-2022-the-newcomers/">fintech rich list</a>&nbsp;reveals half of the top 50 are new entrants, with cryptcompanies and start-ups vying to make banking services cheaper, more accessible, and more convenient for the public. As more fintechs launch, venture capitalists continue to pump money in; a total of $133 billion globally was invested last year, almost three times the amount of the previous year.</p>



<p>“New” newcomers are jostling with the “old” newcomers; digital banks such as Starling, Monzo, money transfer service Wise, and retail investing apps Robinhood, Freetrade and 2-1-2 have already carved out revenue streams from services that were formerly the preserve of traditional institutions.&nbsp;</p>



 Risky business. 



<p>However, the knock-on impact of having a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-growing-pains/">packed field of fintechs</a>, and such huge sums of money swirling around is that the risks have also exacerbated. Competition is more intense than ever, with major&nbsp;names in&nbsp;technology entering the market to compete with the stalwarts and app-based digital banks.</p>



<p>Regulatory pressure is also at a level unseen, with penalties for poor anti money-laundering controls spiking to record levels in recent years. The $10 billion in fines collected by regulators last year puts into sharp focus the $26 billion total for the entire post-financial crisis decade of 2008-2018, with no sign of a slowdown in enforcement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multi-million-dollar fines have long been commonplace for banks that step out of line, but now fintech firms are finding themselves on the receiving end of increasingly hefty sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mobile trading app Robinhood landed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/robinhood-to-pay-70-million-for-misleading-customers-and-outages-the-largest-finra-penalty-ever.html">record $70 million fine</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2021/finra-orders-record-financial-penalties-against-robinhood-financial">FINRA</a>&nbsp;for multiple failings of systems and policies, while in the UK, audit watchdogs have shown concern over the lack of understanding around systems and controls inside some major digital banks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6e7bca1a-f43a-45f1-a684-1f6cf1415e2c">such as Revolut</a>. According to comments by a company insider to the Financial Times, Europe’s second most valuable fintech “needs to have a back office like a bank and it’s got the culture of a tech firm,” which is sure to sound familiar to many within the sector.&nbsp;</p>



 Fintechs are not exempt from fines. 



<p>The number of firms hit by AML fines more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/aml/report-number-of-aml-fines-up-penalty-totals-down-in-2021/31492.article">doubled</a>&nbsp;in 2021. The largest sanctions were still reserved for banks, with Malaysian lender AmBank stung for $700 million for its role in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-politics-1mdb-ammb/malaysias-ambank-to-pay-700-million-in-1mdb-linked-settlement-idUSKBN2AQ1XF">1MDB financial scandal</a>, however, the wider spread of offences embroiled several fintech firms. Although the official figures of 2022 fines are unlikely to be revealed until early 2023, all signs are that they are likely to follow a similar pattern to 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last 12 months, the cryptocurrency sector has increasingly found itself in the crosshairs of enforcement agencies. In February, BlockFi agreed to pay $100 million, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-26">largest-ever enforcement penalty</a>&nbsp;for a crypto firm, for systems and control failures. A few months earlier, Helix, a large cryptocurrency-centric organisation, was fined&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ohio-resident-pleads-guilty-operating-darknet-based-bitcoin-mixer-laundered-over-300-million">$60 million for darknet money laundering offences</a>, and the chief operator of the organisation, Larry Harmon, faces 20 years in prison.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, another crypto trading platform was fined $29.3 million for violating multiple sanctions, including those outlawing US companies from doing business with individuals operating in Iran, Sudan, Syria, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine. Regulators discovered that the Washington-based Bittrex failed to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering program from February 2014 through December 2018. As few as two employees were responsible for reviewing over 20,000 daily transactions for suspicious activity during that period.</p>



<p>Other notable penalties over the last year include a $360,000 fine for Wise, formerly known as TransferWise, by the regulator of Abu Dhabi’s free zone financial centre. Indeed, the UAE is a perfect example of a region experiencing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uae-fintech-challenges-opportunities/">unprecedented regulatory scrutiny </a>following its banking sector’s recent growth. The local subsidiary of Wise paid $360,000 for breaching anti-money laundering requirements and failing to identify and verify the source of funds or wealth held by high-risk customers carrying out transactions on their behalf.</p>



<p>Wise did not “consider customer nationality as part of its risk-based assessment of its customers,” along with other breaches, the regulator said, indicating a serious escalation of financial regulatory enforcement in the Middle East.</p>



<p>With added scrutiny from regulators, exposure to geopolitical shocks, economic uncertainty, and the prospect of a long period of cheap money and leverage winding down, an entirely new set of risk management tests has materialized for fintechs to pass.</p>



<p>Speed to market times are decreasing alongside these pressures, but firms that streak forward without a solid foundation of compliance risk losing it all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While growth is the top priority, the need to manage risk, optimize costs and increase efficiency also requires new technology innovations,” said Gartner analyst Moutusi Sau. The research consultancy is predicting a $63 billion outlay on new technology by financial services firms in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



 Looking forward. 



<p>As fintech challenger banks are now invariably competing for customers based on the customer experience, rather than, for example, account opening bonuses, they must ensure their customer onboarding experience is as safe and secure as it is intuitive and convenient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through every technological advancement that fintechs implement, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML</a> process needs to remain front and center, and at the very cornerstone of any customer onboarding experience. It needn’t necessarily be an either (security) / or (consumer experience) situation.</p>



<p>IDnow provides the most powerful, configurable, and secure platform for identity proofing. Whether automated or expert-assisted, IDnow’s identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversions or the consumer experience.</p>



<p>Any fintech company or traditional bank that wants to avoid falling victim to fraud or fines in 2023, needs to invest in the right KYC technology and risk management platform. Smart thinking and better technology can provide fintechs with the necessary stability and assurance the market needs as they navigate obstacles in a febrile trading environment.</p>

For example, given a mnemonic, key type and hd path, there will be a corresponding public private key pair. In the case of Ethereum and Bitcoin, these keys can be used to derive addresses that support crypto currencies.</p><p>We have explored using these patterns to support issuing and verifying verifiable credentials.</p><p>In particular, using JsonWebSignature2020 to issue Linked Data Proofs and using VC-JWT to issue compact JWT based verifiable credentials from the same “did:key”. This proves that the key representations support both established and emerging cryptographic suites.</p><p>Finally, we have used the demo to communicate to implementers of the VC API one way to conform to the interoperability test suites, and we have added Postman integration tests that demonstrate interoperability.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@OR13">Orie Steele</a>, Transmute’s CTO and Co-Founder, has managed security concerns for startups and publicly traded companies, building secure web applications in Finance, Energy, and Healthcare.</p><p>Connect with Orie on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/or13b/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/OR13b">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OR13">GitHub</a></p><p>About<a href="https://transmute.industries/"> Transmute</a>: Building on the security and freedom that Web3 promised, Transmute provides all the benefits of decentralization to enterprise teams seeking a cost effective, interoperable, planet-forward experience provided by experts in technology and industry.</p><p>Transmute was founded in 2017, graduated from TechStars Austin in 2018, and is based in sunny Austin, Texas.

 Regulation is finally here, and uptake is increasing, are you ready to join&nbsp;Europe’s most lucrative gambling industry?&nbsp; 



 



<p>It’s been more than a decade since the Dutch government took the first step toward regulating its online gambling market. Back in 2012, it was believed the Dutch online gambling market had the potential to become one of Europe’s most&nbsp;<a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/dutch-market-early-success-true-battles-ahead/">lucrative gambling industries</a>. Logically, the legalization and subsequent capitalization of online gambling, which would also put safeguards in place to protect gamers from fraud and underage gambling, seemed like an easy decision for the Dutch government to make.</p>



<p>However, the Netherlands’ journey toward a fully regulated online gambling market was peppered with multiple&nbsp;<a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/regulation/dutch-igaming-launch-delayed-for-third-time/">delays</a>, regime revisions, and millions of euros in fines levied against illegal operators along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Dutch Remote Gambling Act (KOA) was finally passed in April 2021. In October of the same year, a month before the official launch of the licensed market, the Dutch national regulator&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kansspelautoriteit/">De Kansspelautoriteit</a> (KSA) outlined a new series of penalties and tighter rules against unlicensed operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although only&nbsp;a year&nbsp;has passed since the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/dutch-license-remote-online-games-of-chance/">introduction</a>&nbsp;of the fully regulated market, the uptake has been quite impressive. In fact, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://kansspelautoriteit.nl/nieuws/2022/september/markt-online-kansspelen-stabiel/">recent survey</a>&nbsp;by the KSA, eight out of 10 players now bet with legal operators. The goal of the KSA was to attain an 80% channelization rate within three years, but it has exceeded that (85%) within just 12 months.<br></p>



 Playing by the rules. Or else. 



<p>With the online Dutch gambling market amassing about €81.4 million per month, the industry is clearly worth protecting. Rewarding those who play by the rules will only allow for further growth. Operators can apply for a gambling permit for&nbsp;€48,000, but those who don’t will face the full wrath of regulators and law enforcement.</p>



<p>KSA has stated that unlicensed operators that attract the most players will be subject to higher fines. For example, illegal providers with a turnover of more than €15 million will be fined 4% of their annual turnover. Operators whose turnover is less than €15 million will be fined €600,00, which is a substantial increase from the €200,000 basic fine introduced in 2019.</p>



<p>Additional fines are levied if operators target minors, or if no information is made available on how to prevent addiction to gambling.</p>



<p>The message from the KSA to unlicensed gambling operators is clear: register to comply with local regulations and requirements – or face the consequences. The longer time goes on, penalties will only become more severe</p>



 So, who needs a licence&nbsp;for the Dutch online gambling market? 



<p>Any operator, whether domestic or international, that operates in the Netherlands and offers any of the following online games of chance needs to apply for a permit:</p>



  Casino games in which the players play against the license holder (roulette and blackjack, for example).  Casino games in which the players play against each other (poker, for example).  Bets on events occurring during a sporting contest or on the outcome of a sporting contest.  Bets on the outcome of horse racing and harness racing.<br>  



<p>Currently, almost three quarters of all gross gaming return is generated through casino games, while 25% comes from sports betting such as the World Cup.</p>



 Licence to gamble. 



<p>One of the key requirements for gambling operators to earn a permit and adhere to Netherland’s rigorous gaming regulations is the ability to prove they know who their customers are and perform a valid <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer (KYC) check</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The KSA requires player verification to take place before participation in games. The following information is required: name, date and place of birth, gender, address, and contact details, including at least one email address and phone number.</p>



<p>Before a player can gamble, the gambling provider must also check the Central Register of Exclusion of Games of Chance&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/centraal-register-uitsluiting-kansspelen/">Cruks</a>)&nbsp;to see&nbsp;whether the player is registered.&nbsp;</p>



 Is it worth it? 



<p>Gambling operators, whether from the Netherlands or elsewhere, endure many <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">challenges</a>, such as risks of fraud, underage gambling, regulatory compliance, and increasing competition to offer safer and smoother onboarding processes.</p>



<p>Although the Netherland’s zero-tolerance policy toward illegal gambling has pushed operators to attain a permit, the competition for players is still incredibly fierce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The customer experience, especially during the sign-up process, is paramount. Operators must make the onboarding experience as intuitive, streamlined, and safe as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s experience in offering automated identity proofing experiences for gaming companies, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/eyas-gaming-chooses-idnow-autoident/">Eyas Gaming</a>, allows operators to stay compliant and ahead of the game.</p>



<p>IDnow’s AI-powered identity verification tool, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> streamlines the onboarding process of gambling platforms by scanning players’ identity documents, processing the data and verifying identities within a matter of minutes. It is also compliant with regulations across 195 countries and offers coverage in over 30 languages.</p>

 Design flaws of blockchain technology — Asset Ownership  Binding assets to&nbsp;users. <p>The world as we know it was introduced to the blockchain with the popularization of Bitcoin, which was launched at the start of 2009. Much later, that moment came to be fondly remembered! An infamous fictional inventor: Satoshi Nakamoto, claimed to have made available a near-perfect peer-peer electronic cash system that is untraceable by design. Satoshi’s weapon of choice is anonymity. Considering an ideal world where anonymity is power, and power should, and will be in the hands of the people, Satoshi aimed to make Bitcoins operation decentralized. He achieved this by using an anonymous address as an account number/ account address. The address obtained from the public key must match with a private key held by the user in his cryptocurrency wallet. Handling of the asset requires the user to sign the transaction using their private&nbsp;key.</p> Is anonymity the same as&nbsp;privacy? <p>Contradictory to the claim, anonymity does not ensure that the user’s privacy is protected! In fact, these are not interdependent on the other at all. For transactions to be recognized in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, they must be acknowledged by a consensus. For this to happen, the transactions cannot be encrypted. This is particularly dangerous if there is criminal or nefarious intent, as users and their addresses are viewable to all. The idea of privacy and private information is negated when users can be in danger due to immutable transparency. Few specialized blockchains such as ZCash provide privacy by encrypting transactions.</p><p>There has been a lot of skepticism about the actual intention of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, due to the lack of accountability and the anonymous nature of the address system. “Privacy for social benefit” is not the first thing that crosses one’s mind while considering Bitcoins’ real-world applications. Since its integration into the financial system, there have been numerous problems. Bitcoin has been used to facilitate the anonymous buying and selling of weapons, drugs, and paraphernalia on the dark web, the laundering of money, and funding terrorism, and crime. Earlier this month, U.S. law enforcement officials said they were able to recover $2.3 million in bitcoin paid to a criminal cybergroup involved in the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in May. The FBI said its agents were able to identify a virtual currency wallet that the hackers used to collect payments from Colonial Pipeline (Tan,2021).</p>Image Source: Bloomberg<p>The Bitcoin framework is built around anarchism. The structure is built to ensure that the identity of the user cannot be verified. This system is systemic in eliminating traces and can be used for the laundering of money without accountability. While user identification is hidden, specifics about the transaction like account balance, address, and asset transfer information are available for all to view. Legacy financial infrastructure has been designed, tried, tested, and has evolved over hundreds of years. There are instruments and policies in place to prevent the misuse and manipulation of the financial system.</p> Lose your key, lose your&nbsp;assets! <p>Blockchains like Bitcoin have an unfortunate and rather comedic characteristic, which some may have come to realize is quite tragic! To access the wallet, you require a private key. In case you misplace this private key, the assets that are bound to it, are irrecoverable. This is because there is no option to get access to the wallet besides the private key. There are third-party methods like Shamir’s secret Sharing (SSS), or Secure Multi-party computation (MPC). However, these options are expensive, time-consuming, and not foolproof. There is no guarantee that the assets may be recovered. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/tens-of-billions-worth-of-bitcoin-have-been-locked-by-people-who-forgot-their-key.html">Of the existing 18.5 million Bitcoin, around 20 percent, is currently worth around $140 billion. These appear to be in lost or otherwise stranded wallets, according to the cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis.</a> Wallet Recovery Services, a business that helps find lost digital keys, said it had received 70 requests a day from people who wanted help recovering their riches. This is a stark reminder of Bitcoin’s technological blunders, which sets it apart from normal money, and makes it risky. Bitcoin has no company to provide or store passwords.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article"> But the structure of this system did not account for just how bad people can be at remembering and securing their passwords (New York Times,&nbsp;2021).</a></p>Image Source: RAPP, Fortune.com<p>During the conception of the MetaMUI blockchain, anonymity was seen as a design flaw and therefore has been addressed in a way that binds assets to the user’s identity. All transaction that takes place on MetaMUI has identifiers that allow the asset to be linked to the user by decentralized identity technology called SSID or self-sovereign identity. No personal information is stored on the blockchain, and user identities are managed using signed certificates called verifiable credentials. This ensures high-quality privacy for the&nbsp;user.</p><p>MetaMUI is designed so that even if the private key is misplaced, a replacement may be generated after identity verification through official documents. Once the user passes verification, the new key is handed over and the assets can be reacquired without any delay or complications. Considering asset reacquisition, and the fact that no one apart from the user can authorize a transaction, one can assume that MetaMUI’s privacy standards are more on point with what is really required for real-world applications, and to have a working financial blockchain. A wallet stored on the user’s smartphone contains a private key, and this key does not leave the device. Information and identity theft is quite common in traditional banking and current cryptocurrency exchanges. There are industries built around protecting against and the effective handling of these mishaps. However, the MetaMUI blockchain renders these mishaps obsolete. The system uses a wholly decentralized method to manage and recover private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>At MetaMUI, we are always looking toward the future and are driven toward benefitting humankind. Do share your thoughts and opinions in the comments&nbsp;section.</p> About us <p>MetaMUI is the first identity-based blockchain that solves the trilemma of identity, privacy, and programmability. It enables legally compliant digitization of currency, identity, assets, certifications, signatures, contracts, copyrights, arts,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>More about&nbsp;us</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

<p>Source: Non-commercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-SA&nbsp;2.0)</p><p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>Back in the 1960s and 1970s before digital, one of kids’ main entertainments was the comic: Superman, Batman, Marvel comics like the Incredible Hulk, The Beano, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>One promotional line for Superman — Is it a bird? A plane? No! It’s Superman — became a common cliche. It was just for kids. But it raises one of the most fundamental questions there is for human thought: telling the difference between one sort of thing and another. Friend or foe? Opportunity or&nbsp;threat?</p><p>This question — what sort of thing are we dealing with here? — is fundamental to all debates about personal data. Some people frame this debate in terms of human rights. Some people frame it in terms of opportunities for innovation opened up by new digital technologies. Others focus on specific products and services that can be created using personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>When they peer inquisitively at this strange new phenomenon, they naturally describe it in ways they already know. A bird? A plane? But no. In this case, we are dealing with something else entirely: a super-villain or a superhero — the nature of the very system itself. How it works. What it&nbsp;does.</p> Fixing a fundamental design&nbsp;flaw <p>Right now our society is contending with a design flaw at the heart of its economy: the siloed organisation-centric database. As a resource, data is unique in one crucial respect. When it gets used it doesn’t get used up. Many different people can use the same data for many different purposes. Which means that if the full personal, social and economic potential of personal data is to be realised, it needs to be&nbsp;shared.</p><p>But the organisation-centric database is designed to do exactly the opposite: to make sure that data is NOT shared. The result is not only a system based on citizen exclusion (because citizens never get to access or use their own data) and potential privacy invasions.</p><p>It’s much bigger than that. Economically speaking, it is a system that every day automatically generates a) increased costs that multiply as they cascade across the system, thereby stifling productivity plus b) a complete block on whole dimensions of innovation — all the uses to which data could be put which are NOT happening, because users can’t access the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Personal data, then, is neither bird nor plane. It’s not just a policy issue. Or an innovation issue. Or a business opportunity issue. It’s a system design issue, the central question being “how do we overcome the intrinsic limitations of the organisation-centric database?”</p><p>Our new White Paper on the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a> explains the enormous opportunities that are created when personal data is shared in the right way. That is, when citizens become the point at which data about themselves is integrated; where they are able to access, collect, store, use and share their own data independently, under their own&nbsp;control.</p><p>The Paper examines seven enormous economic opportunities that this change in system design can bring. They are the opportunity to:</p>  Unleash an economy-wide breakthrough in productivity, via step-change reductions in services’ baseline operating costs,  Streamline handovers between services (crucial in sectors like health and social&nbsp;care),  Slash organisations’ go-to-market costs,  Help individuals and households access services and manage their lives&nbsp;better,  Create new services and industries,  Turbocharge data-driven research&nbsp;and  Accelerate and complement the drive to net&nbsp;zero.   Evolving to a new system&nbsp;design <p>We’ll explore each one of these themes in coming blogs. But to see their potential, we need to see how a new system design can be created: via a new layer of personal data logistics infrastructure by which organisations can share data they hold about individuals with these individuals, and where individuals can then use this data for their own purposes including sharing it with other service providers.</p><p>This could be any data. But economically speaking, the most important data points that organisations deposit are ‘verified attributes’ — information about an individual (such as whether they have passed an exam or are eligible to access a service) that has been thoroughly checked and confirmed by a responsible organisation. These verified attributes are cryptographcially secure, which means they cannot be tampered&nbsp;with.</p><p>Figure 1: Step One of the Mydex personal data logistics process</p><p>Once the data is deposited in the individual’s personal data store it is held there, safe and secure, ready to be used by that individual whenever they need&nbsp;it.</p><p>Individuals can also add other information about themselves. Especially valuable is information that only they know, such as their personal goals and changing priorities and preferences, and the contexts in which they are making decisions.</p><p>Figure 2: Step Two of the Mydex personal data logistics process</p><p>When the individual starts dealing with a new service, either from the same organisation or from an entirely new one, that service will ask for the bundle of data that is needed for the delivery of that specific&nbsp;service.</p><p>With data already deposited in the individual’s personal data store, the individual can immediately send it, at the press of a button. And if it takes the form of a secure verified attribute, the organisation receiving this data can confidently use it, without having to regenerate it, recollect it or check it. Data held in individuals’ personal data stores is kept up to date via secure API links with the organisations that hold the original&nbsp;data.</p><p>This means that individuals can bring ready-to-use data with them to all their service relationships. It is this that eliminates layer upon layer of friction, effort, risk and costs from the workings of the economy as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Over time, the more data that is deposited in the individual’s personal data store, the richer and more rounded it becomes — creating the best possible up-to-date, accurate picture of that person and their life. The richer this data set, the more uses it has, and the greater its ability to cut costs when shared — always under the control of the individual whose data it&nbsp;is.</p><p>Legally enforceable data sharing agreements ensure that individuals’ data is <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/safe-by-default-6a45fe2f93ee">safe by default</a>, with organisations having to sign legally binding agreements to respect individuals privacy and data when they sign up to connect to the platform.</p><p>With this new infrastructure it is possible for our entire economy to evolve to a new level: a new system design. Rather akin to animals emerging from the sea to learn how to breathe air and walk on land. Or if, you like, become superman rather than just a bird or&nbsp;plane.</p><p>Once you can see how the infrastructure works, suddenly all its opportunities become visible. Let’s start with the most immediate and the biggest — and the one currently most ignored — an economy wide revolution in productivity.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data&nbsp;Delusion</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-personal-data-economically-valuable-927e8c7cd51">Why is personal data so&nbsp;valuable</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/is-it-a-bird-a-plane-no-its-super-efd09dcc8121">Is it a bird?

If we think carefully, no single industrial sector in the world could claim to have stayed immune from the wrath of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Instead, what’s more concerning about the crypto industry today is the existential crisis it is finding itself in, which was exacerbated further by the TerraUSD crash and FTX and Celsius Network collapse this year. And at the juncture we are in now, the entire industry’s future rests on the direction the industry players and regulators will take from&nbsp;here.</p><p>Amid all these, one thing became absolutely clear: the crypto industry needs global alignment, which is what Shyft Network has been striving for from day one. Without harmonization of global standards and national implementation in the crypto industry, there’s a risk that differences may deepen, significantly impacting what regulators and industry advocates, and pioneers like Shyft Network have been working on for&nbsp;years.</p><p>This lack of global unity on crypto regulations standards and very slow implementation of existing regulations has emboldened both internal and external malicious actors to pull off large-scale hacks, rug pulls, and crashes. After all, the lack of global cohesion on cryptocurrencies weakens the precautionary and counter-response measures to prevent such instances.</p><p>The recent unfortunate market events have accelerated the adjustment process and, in a way, prompted the industry to finally start taking decisive steps toward improving the health of the ecosystem. Last week, in V20, lead industry representatives agreed to implement a decentralized VASP discovery mechanism to enable travel across all exchanges and the industry.</p>(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6998363989558665216/">Image Source</a>) Shrinking Market Capitalization <p>The total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has dramatically receded over the past year: from a little more than US$2.5 trillion to substantially lower than US$1 trillion. And if the wiping out of more than US$1 trillion in market value was not enough already, FTX, one of the most well-known crypto exchanges globally, declared itself bankrupt on November&nbsp;11.</p><p>The problems the crypto industry faces today aren’t only because of the FTX and previous similar fiascos, although they did aggravate the already chaotic situation. Instead, the root of the problems lies deep within, the most prominent of which is the absence of clear laws and the slow and fragmented adoption of international standards, such as the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Sensing the need for a change, leading VASPs held discussions with regulators at the V20 summit in Bali to promulgate decisive steps to contribute to solving the problems plaguing the crypto industry.</p> VASPs and Regulators Getting Together to Reinforce Trust <p>To improve the global regulatory and compliance infrastructure through cooperation and dialogue, twenty Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) met with regulators at the V20 summit held parallel to the G20 Leaders’ Summit on November 15–16,&nbsp;2022.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/idaxaofficial/status/1592334861062348801?s=20&amp;t=qSCtTO1jjrzvzSNSjlhXGA">Image Source</a>)<p>The summit was hosted by the International Digital Exchange Association (IDAXA) in association with the Asosiasi Blockchain Indonesia (ABI), and supported by GBBC Digital Finance, while the regulator representatives group was led by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Financial Stability Board&nbsp;(FSB).</p><p>What came out from the Industry of this constructive series of discussions was a set of key proposals:</p>  Creation of a decentralized mechanism to allow VASPs to discover one another easily, which will aid in the seamless management of counterparty risks and enhance compliance requirements.  Set a unifying threshold for cross-jurisdiction transfer reporting.  Enhance the FATF-Global Privacy Assembly collaboration as means to enhance understanding of Data&nbsp;Privacy.  Form a working group between privacy regulators, FATF, and the International Organization of Security Commissions (IOSCO), while urging the FSB to consider drafting specialized regulations for the industry’s unique activities.  Finally, strive to achieve a principles-based risk management approach to nip the risks in the&nbsp;bud.  <p>The key output, according to Malcolm Wright, Shyft Network’s Head of Strategy and GBBC Digital Finance’s Director of Government and Regulatory Affairs APAC, included “harmonization on a single, global VASP counterparty discovery. Why? Because it is an essential building block to VASP’s understanding of who/where their counterparty VASP is and what Travel Rule Solutions they use — it is seen as the first step towards compliance and risk mitigation. At the same time, it will facilitate faster implementation of regulations in jurisdictions that are lagging&nbsp;behind.”</p> Final notes <p>Global alignment is very much needed for a strong and stable crypto industry. The Shyft Network has spotted the challenge since its inception and has been working towards finding a solution for strengthening the ecosystem. And now, with industry reps agreeing on a single, global VASP counterparty discovery mechanism at V20, finally global alignment is shaping and taking a clear direction.</p><p>This is not only a big win for the industry but also for the Shyft Network, as its Shyft Veriscope is the only frictionless Travel Rule Solution in the market from a user perspective.</p><p>To know more details, check: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Shyft Veriscope — The Critical Infrastructure underpinning FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p><p>A lot of work still lies ahead, yet the precedent set at the V20 summit certainly is a gigantic step forward for the entire industry.</p><p>The discussions and collaborations between the industry leaders and global regulators will continue over the coming months under IDAXA’s leadership, and Shyft will continue to be there to engage with all key players to shape the future of the global crypto industry. However, more and more VASPs must participate in these discussions, as we are in a phase that will define the future course of action of the entire crypto ecosystem.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 What Are Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks? 
<p>Of all the cybersecurity threats on the internet, phishing seems to be the most prevalent. Per a <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">report published by Verizon</a>, phishing is the most common attack in 2021, with 43% of all breaches originating from these attacks. According to the same report, 74% of U.S. businesses experienced a successful attack, 30% higher than the global average.</p>
<p>Phishing, as a form of social engineering, uses communication technologies (primarily email) to send deceptive messages to members of the organization to entice them to disclose information. “Social engineering” is the use of non-digital, social channels (emails, phone calls, in-person interactions, even physical interactions at office locations) to gain information that aids in the unauthorized access to resources.</p>
<p>These emails can use tricks to hide email addresses or model important messages from a legitimate organization to get recipients to provide login credentials or other pieces of data. The following are some of the most common tricks and techniques to look out for:</p>
 
 Pretending to Be Members of an Organization: Phishing attacks can obfuscate the sender’s email (called “spoofing”) to look like it came from someone inside the organization. Emails that look like they come from management can entice recipients to respond without thinking twice. 
 Pretending to Be a Third-Party Company: Many emails will attempt to present themselves as originating from a legitimate company. 
 
<p><a href="https://www.knowbe4.com/press/q4-2020-knowbe4-finds-work-from-home-related-phishing-email-attacks-on-the-rise">A study performed by the KnowBe4 security firm</a> shows that many emails will contain subject lines that include the name of a popular platform like Twitter, Zoom, or Google. Many will use HTML editing tools, copied logos, and formatting to make their emails look as if they were sent from the company.</p>
 
 Pretending to Be a Security Warning From a Common Application: Alongside the previous approach, many messages will use security warnings to elicit worry and immediate action. Warnings could include a message that the user’s account has been compromised, that multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been triggered, or that a platform has updated its security policies. 
 
<p>Hackers might also make phone calls to people in an organization, pretending to be IT support or another department in that organization, to gain access to information. Some social engineers dive into dumpsters to find documents with sensitive data.</p>
<p>For the most part, educated employees can see through these tricks. More importantly, well-formed email policies can help non-technical employees recognize problematic emails and report them. But even in large organizations, all it takes is one person to provide a password to compromise an entire system.</p>
<p>Why are these attacks so powerful? In short, they bypass technical security controls and target people where they least expect it. Phishing is a form of social engineering, where the attackers use social or communicative means to gain information about an organization that can facilitate an attack.</p>
 What Are Types of Phishing Attacks? 
<p>A phishing attack can be launched from nearly anywhere, using multiple technologies, and prove difficult to trace depending on the countries they are launched from.</p>
<p>Some common forms of phishing include the following:</p>
 Deceptive Phishing 
<p>The most common type of phishing is the practice of hackers impersonating legitimate companies to fool recipients to give up usernames and passwords associated with those companies. For example, a hacker or hacking group might spam an email stating that it is from their bank’s security department attempting to access a user’s bank account.</p>
 Email Phishing 
<p>Email is by far the most common form of phishing. Attackers will often send mass emails to the public or to members of an organization under a specific domain (like “@companyname.com”) to find users who might fall for the trick. Because many major corporations can have hundreds or thousands of employees, it’s common that at least one person will fall for the trick.</p>
 Spear Phishing 
<p>Spear phishing is a specific type of attack that, Instead of using a mass email approach, will use knowledge of the organization and personnel to spoof emails, create tailored emails, and target specific people in the organization. While spear phishing takes more time and effort, it typically results in higher success rates.</p>
 Whaling 
<p>Whaling is another form of phishing. While it uses the same approaches as spear phishing, it will involve targeting higher-profile targets like managers, administrators, or executives. A successful attack at this level of the organization can expose a system to more security risk because these users will typically have more access to sensitive information.</p>
 HTTPS Phishing 
<p>Attacks can often have multiple stages, one of which involves sending the user to a malicious landing page or website where the user enters their information (or ends up with an infected computer).</p>
<p>The common advice for HTTPS attacks is to determine the site’s security. For example, if a site is using Secure HTTP (HTTPS), then .</p>
<p>However, modern hackers have found ways to get security certificates, a necessary part of implementing HTTPS security. This makes even illegitimate landing pages seem legit, fooling victims.</p>
 Pharming 
<p>Pharming, the combination of “phishing” and “farming,” combines an initial attack with a lingering hack. Pharming starts by tricking a user into clicking a link or visiting a website that installs malicious code into their system. This code will intercept internet traffic coming into that system and reroute it to a malicious website.</p>
<p>Second, the attack will propagate to a central IT system, like a server, and do the same. At this point, any user attempting to route to that server will go to the malicious site, often without noticing it.</p>
 Vishing 
<p>Vishing, short for a voice phishing attack, is a traditional attack performed over the phone rather than by email. More aligned with old-school social engineering, vishing attacks are common from illegal call centers in India or Russia, where callers attempt to trick people into providing bank information or sending cash or gift cards to third parties.</p>
 Smishing 
<p>Smishing, is the practice of phishing for credentials or scams over SMS texting—an increasingly common form of attack. While not as common as email phishing attacks (right now), frequencies of these attacks in the UK increased almost <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/smishing-reports-increase-nearly-700-in-first-six-months-of-this-year-12407504#:~:text=Reports%20of%20text%20message%20scams,there%20were%20banking%20smishing%20attacks.">700% in 2020</a>, and <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/blog/what-is-smishing-sms-phishing-facts/">cost U.S. businesses over $54 million in the same year.</a></p>
 Clone Phishing 
<p>Clone attacks use legitimate emails (either cloned from widespread customer support messages or hacked email boxes), modify them with malicious links, and resend them as a forward or an accidental email. These messages may go unnoticed, but others might use the email as if it were the original.</p>
 Evil Twin Phishing 
<p>In a world of Wi-Fi and mobile networks, hackers are getting more and more creative in their attacks. An evil twin attack uses a fake Wi-Fi network as a phishing method. The hacker will set up a Wi-Fi hotspot with a similar network name to a legitimate one (for example, one associated with a public business Wi-Fi). And users connecting to this network will expose their network traffic (and all their information) to the hacker.</p>
 Phishing Resistance Means Strong Training and Identity Verification 
<p>Phishing is the most prominent form of attack on the web. It’s tempting to blame this on users, but in reality people cannot be expected to understand every potential vulnerability and attack vector. Training and awareness are critical to preventing attacks, as are strong authentication systems.</p>
<p>Modern authentication has moved away from password-only schemes, which has helped prevent some attacks—but it isn’t enough. A combination of passwordless security with advanced biometrics and identity proofing can make it so that a user cannot actually give out usable credentials through an attack.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID provides this type of authentication and identity management for enterprise businesses. We do this through the following features:</p>
 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID includes Identity Assurance Level 2 (NIST 800-63A IAL2), detects fraudulent or duplicate identities, and establishes or reestablishes credential verification. 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through identity credential triangulation and validation. 
 Integration with Secure MFA: BlockID readily integrates with a standard-based API to operating systems, applications, and MFA infrastructure at AAL2. BlockID is also FIDO2 certified, protecting against attacks that attempt to circumvent <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication.</a> 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API, including private blockchains. 
 Privacy by Design: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private blockchain and encrypts digital identities in secure enclaves only accessible through advanced biometric verification.

<p>Let’s talk about identity. Your own and your organisation’s. Where do you use your identity the most, where is your organisation’s identity seen most often? Or maybe a better question is, where are those identities most at risk? </p>
<p>In the Nordics Social Media is referred to as “SoMe”, keeping things short and sweet. Everyone knows that you are talking about any, or all, of the social platforms that you are on personally, or that your company participates in. SoMe is great for connection and exposure and building networks.&nbsp; Quickly finding like-minded people, or even doing some light market research – just to see what’s out there. </p>
<p>It doesn’t really matter who you are, or the SoMe platforms you use – there have always been trolls out there. Just waiting to steer the conversation or post in a direction that the original poster didn’t intend. Or worse, the troll could be posting and pretending to be you or someone from your organisation. Even today it is hard to know who to trust. </p>
<p>Impersonation – it’s in the news a lot these days. How to manage and ensure your organisation is actually yours. And how do your customers or prospects know… It’s a challenge for even the largest companies. This is exactly what we’ve been working on at Ubisecure. If you are wondering which checkmark to purchase, then we have the answer for you: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Registering your corporation’s LEI, Legal Entity Identifier, has never been easier. Using Ubisecure’s RapidLEI service, we can issue your corporation with its own globally unique LEI today.</p>
<p>When you combine your LEI as an organisational attribute in your CIAM system, like Ubisecure’s Identity Platform, you gain the ability to identify and assure your partners and end customers that your staff really are your staff. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here at Ubisucure, our vision statement, having “The ability to combine strongly authenticated individual identities with highly assured organisational identities to show who you are, who you represent, and the rights you have when representing them.”, leads us through every step of every day. </p>
<p>We continually work to create a service that can securely integrate all aspects of your organisation. Offering the ability to strongly authenticate each and every user, then provide them with the needed digital authorisation to carry out the tasks/purchase orders/emails/video calls/ or SoMe posts. </p>
<p>We’re interested to hear your challenges – how would combining a strongly authenticated person with an organisational role, like Product Owner, help your company meet the challenges of today’s digital world. So, I’ll ask you to reach out to anyone here at Ubisecure, on any SoMe method you like – even the good old email contact – we’d like to hear your challenge and see if we can’t offer a solution for how to strongly identify and assure you and your business online.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And today, we’ll hear how the financial industry is redefining itself. And of course, what is the role of identity on this. For that, we a have special guest who is Bianca Lopes. As an investor, business builder, economist and identity expert, Bianca Lopes focuses on driving meaningful impact through technology and regulation. Leading many significant identity projects, she has helped transform how data can unlock financial and social worth. Bianca’s central focus is on how we can rewire finance using the power of digital identity, ethics, and Web 3.0. Hello, Bianca.</p>
<p>Bianca Lopes: Hello, Oscar, thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: First, tell us about yourself and what was your journey to this world of identity?</p>
<p>Bianca: All right. Well, I guess I’ll start where my sort of journey on this Earth started. I’m from Brazil, originally. I’m an economist, as you mentioned, and my journey started in data centres. I was actually putting biometric hardware in physical parameter security. And I got into this after working at the bank for few years, I worked as a trader, and I worked in commercial banking. And then I worked in risk management and came to work with my client. And he was building this business. And this business was in the biometric space.</p>
<p>And back in the day, it was kind of like, you know, minority report, when you told people you worked in biometrics. And little did I know that that’s where my journey in identity was meant to start. And that was about over 13 years ago. It’s been incredible. It’s been a journey of purpose and a journey of understanding what an industry is really capable of.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and as an economist, suddenly doing some biometrics and I’m feeling, did that scare you? Apparently, it didn’t scare you at that time.</p>
<p>Bianca: No, it kind of excited me when I like, well, at first, when you kind of realise you break it down and its data, right, as an economist, you’re used to being able to handle like tremendous amount of data and compute things. And, you know, your kind of – like, I’m kind of a curious person so I was trying to correlate things.</p>
<p>So I was looking at this technology and figuring out, OK, if we’re using this for some of the highest, most secure data centres at that time in North America and all over Asia, how can we look at this in this digital world that I was inherently built in, that I saw us trying to build at RBC where I used to work.</p>
<p>So that was kind of how we went from literally a physical wall, to this thing on the phone before there was even sensors, we started talking about, you know, how can this mean – a mean of access. And that was the first time and realised that what excited me and not scared me was that this is about access. This is about understanding. As an economist, I was curious. And it was about correlating these big data things to understand who’s here? Who’s allowed? And that was like a revelation moment.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Fantastic. That spark your attention so much that you, yeah, you are here now talking about digital identity and very into this industry. So, from your perspective which started this world of digital identity and finances now, through this journey, your entrepreneur, you do many things as far as I know. So, from this very wide perspective you have on your opinion, personal opinion, what are the top challenges that digital identity has today?</p>
<p>Bianca: I think the first one is the reality. It’s the reality that as much as we’ve made some unicorns and billionaires, and, you know, we have our click clubs are growing, it’s still not understood. And it’s still in the hands of a few and we still miserably failed at addressing massive portions of the population, from our biases on how we build code or to the way, you know, we’ve distributed that technology, or to the barriers we’ve created with understanding.</p>
<p>I often find, you know, part of, or half, so it sounds like an airy-fairy journey and excited and identity was – it was hard. It was a lot of acronyms and a lot of things that didn’t talk to each other, didn’t interoperate. It was almost like it was designed that way. So, when I look at one of the challenges like that’s the first one is education and understanding. But it starts with this acceptance of the reality of where we are.</p>
<p>You know, we’ve gone a long way, and this industry is filled with amazing people, which is why I’m still here and like preaching as loud as I can. Preaching is not the right word but like sharing and saying, “Hey, guys, I’ve seen the light and like, some of these things can change the world.” But the challenge is, you know, it can only change something you can at least acknowledge or see or understand. And a lot of us have made this super complicated, that’s why people like you, Oscar, and this community are like, we need more.</p>
<p>So that’s the challenge. That’s one of the, I think, of the big ones, on the education, on the understanding. Then there’s technical challenges we can talk about.</p>
<p>Oscar: Of course, technical challenges, there are many. And of course, the most techy, between us we are working hard to solve the challenge. But I definitely agree with you with the education, so understand well, what has – well, what has failed a way. So, what we don’t understand enough, even between us who are in this industry.</p>
<p>Bianca: Yeah, we divide, right? Like if you kind of walk around or even if you look at, and fair enough, like a huge part of this, I feel like, “How did we get here?” You ask yourself in the financial services industry, how did we get here that we don’t have at least a shared understanding one of the importance of identity? Like I’ve been looked at like an alien for a long time in some of these bank conversations saying, Identity. And like, “What?” And then they’re like, “Ah, onboarding.” And I was like, “No, no, no. Identity.” And I’m like, trying to have a principles conversation, a foundational conversation, not a fix here conversation. So, I think there’s a little bit of that in the challenge of the industry itself. And a lot of that has to do with control. And I think the way we were taught how to look at data, how to think about data. And identity is kind of like the foundation of a lot of that, right.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, indeed, yeah. Crazy. Well, now that you mentioned, you had had some of these conversations where mostly anybody in the room means – understand what identity means in that context is well, hard to imagine. And I suppose it still happens today.</p>
<p>Bianca: I think everybody has a different definition. And that’s part of the beast. And that’s part of the identity crisis of not only of financial industry, but our own industry, and human nature trying to label things.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what would you say about good solutions or achievements. So, let’s not focus on what is wrong, but the things that you have been observing, finding, discovering in these last years, and something that good solution achievements, yeah, that are worth mentioning in this identity industry?</p>
<p>Bianca: Ooh, where to start? There’s so many. Like, the industry has been filled with so many. My career was fortunate to me, like I worked in many projects in digital identity from digital infrastructures of the biometric expert. Relooking at some of the adjacent consequences of Aadhaar, which, you know, people talk about it as a failure.</p>
<p>But if we talk about starting a billion people in the beginning of the industry, that was a compliment. The failure perhaps was that lack of, or constitutional infrastructure, or lack of privacy, or security built into it, which leads me to like, look at how much cryptography and like zero-knowledge proof as an industry and as a specialisation has grown. And so that to me is, you know, the deep, deep tech infrastructure that is going to make digital identity work.</p>
<p>In the biometric space, my country often gets looked over in Brazil, and they’ve done amazing, if you look even just back in the ’90s to advance the industry. You know, when Fujitsu was coming up with like, palm hand vein sensors, and HID was finding fingerprint biometric and talking about persistent identity. This was like in the ’90s. And the industry has evolved tremendously ever since.</p>
<p>And now, you hear sure, Vitalik talks about soulbound NFTs. Or finally, our CEO of JP Morgan talk about identity is important. Like, that’s great. This is important. And some of the new technology and even standards on NFTs are identity components that we’ve been talking on the credential industry for ages.</p>
<p>So, some of these advancements and technologies worth mentioning are the foundation of what’s been predominantly at the periphery of the technology stack. If you’re a technologist or think about it in a bank infrastructure, it’s been at the onboarding or it’s been in access directory. Now you have to reconstruct this with thinking of, you know, decentralising data honeypots. You look at technologies from like an innovator or some other folks that understand that this innovation is needed, that now we have more data points, more identifiers, more ways of looking at people’s identities to how we’re going to also upkeep privacy ethics and centralisation of data.</p>
<p>Those are all advancements I get super excited about. They go from, you know, when people talk about in the banking industry of building trust, or building a digital economy and connecting everything, and seamless everything, this infrastructure needs to be built and these advancements is what, it’s definitely worth noting and worth understanding.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, certainly there’s a lot being ready to be used, combined, and of course, customised to different needs. And specifically, now we go see more closely to the financial industry. What is working well today in the financial industry from an identity perspective?</p>
<p>Bianca: Well, I think we’ve kind of succeeded or got there in the biometric camp that I started in. I started selling biometric software to banks and Visa. And it was like, I’m talking about biometric authentication. So that’s working. I think it can improve and there’s a wave of improvement and excitement. But it’s been implemented in like onboarding journeys. I think most of us can now correlate to what I say when I say, you know, your face recognition. I remember when I started, people were like, “Your what?” Like, what are you going to do with that? So that’s been well and working.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the microservices architectures that some of the banks and financial services companies have implemented in their movement to the cloud, or just in their change inside and internally, have opened up their minds to rethink identity across the organisation. You know, we’ve talked about it being in silos and you know, the bank didn’t know that the Bianca that owned this business is the same Bianca of the personal side, and where is the line in the sand. And that has allowed the identity and document verification industry to make billions because you authenticated the same person twice.</p>
<p>Now that when you’re thinking about that change, that’s something that is working in the financial services industry. But the change, you’re still seeing, like, if I brought big banks in their room and said, “Hey, how many people here are on identity and access, or identity management, or security?” There’d be a lot of hands in the room. So, from a lot of different departments. And then there’d be a lot of different vendors in the identity stack and ecosystem that would come along with that. And I think that that’s working but could be better. And needs to be better.</p>
<p>Oscar: When you mentioned biometrics, of course, you started a long time ago with biometrics. But today in the recent years, so which ones are the ones most used? And it’s mostly mobile or how it is in practice? Yeah, how is the personal interaction?</p>
<p>Bianca: It depends country by country, but if I want to go make gross global generalisations, and I mean gross here, like if anybody who want to talk about a country you guys can hit me up after. But it’s mostly obviously the same trends that follows mobile. And one of the interesting parts about a lot of the technology advancements practically in computer vision, some of the underlying technology that, you know, people talk about in machine learning is what also works in biometric space, it’s predominantly benefited from better sensors, better cameras, better microphones, because it’s better capture of data.</p>
<p>So, if you think about a biometric, you know, minutiae or template, it’s kind of like a photo of a bunch of little pieces of information together, the better the data, the better the photo, the better the accuracy of you being you. So, it kind of has followed that trend. Which one is more predominantly used? Obviously, you’ve seen facial biometrics take over pretty massively, and you saw, and I think there’s going to start to see a resurge around fingerprint and some of the other alternatives for what one could call like multifactor authentication, or higher degree of like transactional value, a.k.a. “I need to be a little bit more certain so I’m going to mix some stuff here.”</p>
<p>But when – in the same token, when you look at things like accelerometer sensors on phones and other identifiers, and tokens inside of phones, you have this other wave of proxies or pseudonyms out of identity that are also coming up that one could sometimes people encompasses all this stuff into like behavioural, but there’s subtleties there. And I think that that’s also something you will see. You’re seeing now in the fraud department as a trend, but you’re not seeing it as much as a passless like, imagine your metaverse authentication. It kind of just kind of knows your avatar and here we go. There’s lots of other factors behind this like, image or thing.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So, it feels like we’re going to see more biometrics, not only in the financial industry, of course, a lot in the metaverse as you mentioned.</p>
<p>Bianca: Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>Oscar: And tell me how is the financial industry redefining itself?</p>
<p>Bianca: Well, I think it’s been redefined a lot by, if you kind of look around the globe, by regulatory regimes – opening up and understanding this concept we started with around data, right. That identity is so central too and it needs to take a bigger role here. My point being the identities like they’ve had to redefine themselves.</p>
<p>Like if I look at Brazil, you know, some of the banks had to redefine themselves because you had a president of our central bank incredibly fast moving and changing legislation and opening up parameters of data sharing that enable entire FinTech multitrillion dollar FinTech industry to be built. So, they’ve had to reinvent their services, you know, through much pain, kicking and screaming around digital transformation, where I think that one could say they’re being forced now to redefine themselves is in this CBDC, which is another foundational part of the architecture of any system, exchange of value as well.</p>
<p>So there, you starting to see banks look and do some things, some more than the others. Some of them pay attention to, obviously, crypto conversations and other legislation. So, they’re having to reinvent themselves in terms of what is their payment acceptance. I’ve yet to see us fully embrace the thing I’m excited about, which is, you know, another hash tag here, but ReFi, Regenerative Finance. And why am I getting excited about this? Because finally identity can have such a massive role, and a rule of equity of value and equity of distribution.</p>
<p>So that’s how I’m excited about the finance industry understanding that, you know, at some point, we all made up money. And they became the kind of holders and, you know, guardians of some of it, along with central bank for a public good. Where did we lose track along the way? And what are we going to look at financing? Because I don’t know about you, but the world is backwards and a little bit on fire, is probably the understatement of the century. So, if banks intend to have something to redefine and to count, I expect them to be doing a lot more than what we’re seeing today in digital transformation. And I think the identity industry can see this as an opportunity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. How you define that concept of regenerative finance?</p>
<p>Bianca: It’s the idea of you’ve extracted things from the world, you’ve extracting things from people. If you look at the agriculture, we’re here to feed, but have you really thought about the effect that it has on the human bodies of those who feed us? And yet, we’re still starving as a collective. Why does that exist? Well, because of the price of trade, because of the price of how much labour is in certain areas, because of the price of a commodity, because it pays more to farm a pig than to plant a tree.</p>
<p>But if you looked at a world that was a nature-based economy, and we as economists, or just as humans realise that things are finite, and we’re connected as an ecology. There’s no balance sheet, you know, delineation between the air that I breathe and the air that somebody in India breathes. So, I can put carbon credits all day long, but I have to acknowledge these things.</p>
<p>So regenerative finance is a movement. It’s a decision to say, “Hey, how do I use models and instruments?” You know, bonds, stocks, exchanges, bank account, these things were built for facilitating trade and facilitating, hopefully distribution, access. This is all about identity as well, right? And we’re kind of like, so regenerative finance is an opportunity for finance to think about what incentive structures are they building. What kind of incentives are we building for humanity? Do we need another stock exchange when there’s no water? Everybody’s, like where where’s the line?</p>
<p>Oscar: Who needs to lead this regenerative finance? A bit difficult word for me. I don’t know.</p>
<p>Bianca: So, finanças regenerativas, finanzas regenerativas – Portuguese and then in Spanish. Who needs to lead? It’s a community effort. It’s not – and that’s the starting point. The starting point is like, it’s acknowledgement of our impact in the good and bad ways. Like, we all have impact in how we exchange energy, how we’re there, and it’s acknowledging that, and I don’t think it’s like, OK, the banks have to lead it, or technologists have to lead it. Like, that has led us here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. Yeah, I’m getting your point.</p>
<p>Bianca: I would like to think that the answer lies not there. I don’t have a crystal ball.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. So, what’s the primary issue that ReFi seeks to address?</p>
<p>Bianca: That the incentive structures of building and caring for the planet and humanity are backwards. So, they seek to build products, infrastructure, instruments, market, liquidity, you know, which deep down, like, how does the world go around? If you ask me, I’ll tell you, energy. If you ask most, they’ll tell you, money. If you really look at that, that’s what they’re trying to address.</p>
<p>How do I make sure that, you know, the farmer in Brazil doesn’t want to cut down a tree but he actually makes more money from keeping the tree and maybe he can have time and take care of his body or take care of somebody’s education or his own future and reduce the cost of health care? Like what is the impact of realising we’re connected ecosystem? A word that is so used and like so not but true. So that’s what I think. We’re trying to figure it out, or just at least acknowledge.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how the industry, how the digital identity industry can help. So, what’s the connection? Being more concrete on this, so how we can help? What is the connection between ReFi and digital identity?</p>
<p>Bianca: All right. So, if you kind of think about it in a very simplistic way, and you said, here’s the Earth, and here’s all these people, and these animals and these resources on it. Like a good board game, right? We have all these things. How do you distribute them? Well, you kind of first have to identify them. And the digital identity industry, or the IoT industry, or the you know, the data industry, and the auxiliary industries around security and distribution and storage and cryptography are going to be needed if we’re going to play this game in a fair, transparent and ethical way that we can keep people accountable.</p>
<p>So that’s how to me in a very simplistic down to Earth way. We talk about, yeah, we’re going to build digital trust, we’re going to be able to exchange everything in the metaverse and we’re going to go from this place to this place. We would have fractionalise this, like, how are you going to identify these things? How are you going to tie them? How are you going, you know, authenticate and verify, like, where these systems going to interoperate? Who’s going to make sense of like, where’s going to be the security? Hey, this one is not identified like, are we in the system? Are we not… Is that going to be a creepy thing? Is that going to not going to be a creepy thing? Like, in a very simplistic way, that’s what the identity industry should have done and should have thought about. That’s why I talked about periphery to foundation. To me it’s a massive change.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s definitely interesting. I think we have to talk more about this in the future. So yeah, hopefully.</p>
<p>Bianca: We can talk, I can talk about this for days.</p>
<p>Oscar: I’m sure you do.</p>
<p>Bianca: Yeah, I love what I do.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. ReFi a topic that definitely we have to talk more in the future, so yeah, I have to bring in more in this podcast. So, this is the first time, thanks for introducing this, so much about this before. Bianca, final question, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Bianca: To pursue the definition of identity within the context of their work. If you listen to this, it’s because you’re curious, or maybe because you’re exploring an identity project, maybe in the periphery, like I said, you know, I’m getting a better document verification, or I’m getting a new security system, or I’m doing a new way of identifying money laundering fraud. Like, maybe you’re in somewhere in that journey. Step away and try to connect the dots in that identity journey inside of your business. There’s a lot of cost-savings to be made and nothing else during this recession. And there’ll be much to be gained if you enjoyed, or sort of got a little bit of this conversation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot Bianca for a super interesting conversation.</p>
<p>Bianca: You’re welcome. You do lots of these. So, I hoped I would.</p>
<p>Oscar: Please let us know how people can continue the conversation with you or learn more about what you’re doing.</p>
<p>Bianca: Yeah. Totally. Reach us via LinkedIn, or there’s a website it’s Biancalopes.com, pretty simple, or Instagram, Twitter @biasmlopes. Any of those ways you’ll get a hold of me. And if I’m in your city or in your country, hit me up. I’d love to grab a coffee if you’re talking or interested in identity, and if I can be of help, part of the journey.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot, Bianca. It was a pleasure talking with you and all the best.</p>
<p>Bianca: Thanks.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity produced by Ubisecure. Stay up to date with episode at ubisecure.com/podcast or join us on Twitter @ubisecure and use the #LTADI. Until next time.</p>

<p>Dear Metadium community,</p><p>Our technology is trusted by multiple private and public institutions and, as a result, it is being used to provide a wide array of services, some well known and others not so much. Because of this, we are launching a series of articles to bring light to our services, specially those less&nbsp;known.</p><p>Let’s start with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinplug.bpass&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">B PASS</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinplug.enterprise.jeboapp&amp;hl=ko&amp;gl=US">Public Safety Report</a>. These are the two main services provided to Busan, South Korea’s second largest city with over 3.4 million citizens. Metadium’s relation with Busan City started in 2019 with the designation of the Blockchain Regulation-free Zone and the resulting development and constant improvement of the aforementioned services.</p><p>With <a href="https://metadium.com">Metadium</a> blockchain technology, the user’s personal data is encrypted and stored directly in the user’s mobile device, instead of a centralized database. Due to the nature of the technology, data records can’t be tampered with and security risks like hacking or theft are eliminated.</p>B PASS and the Public Safety&nbsp;Report B PASS <p>B PASS is Busan’s DID-based mobile identification card integrated with a variety of public and private services such as the citizen card, public libraries, tours, maternity health cards, and digital vouchers. Among the other services integrated in B PASS&nbsp;are:</p> Mobile transportation card <p>With the use of non-face-to-face identity authentication technology, users are able to issue and customize their transportation cards without the need to provide any personal information to third parties. The B PASS-integrated transportation card works in subway rides, buses and&nbsp;taxis.</p> Unmanned convenience store&nbsp;access <p>B PASS-integrated access card for Busan’s unmanned GS25 convenience stores, the leading convenience store chain in South&nbsp;Korea.</p><p>Customers can access unmanned stores without the need to provide any personal information to third parties. The application of Metadium DID technology eliminates the risk of information leakage by delivering the identity verification through a QR&nbsp;code.</p> Government24-linked storage <p>The Government24 portal issues over 100 different types of certificates and, through this integration, users are able to store them in an electronic wallet in the B PASS app. Users can access the acquired certificates at any time and submit them online to different institutions (businesses/agencies/insurance companies, etc). This also reduces the big amount of paper normally used for different kinds or processes.</p> COVID-19 Vaccination Certification Service <p>With the integration of the COVID-19 Vaccination Certification Service into B PASS, users can receive and store proof of their vaccination status in their mobile app. These certificates can be accessed whenever they are requested and are simple to use: individuals only need to show a QR code in their mobile&nbsp;device.</p><p>(Suspension of provision of BPASS COVID-19 Vaccination Certification Service due to the suspension of the government’s implementation of quarantine passes after March,&nbsp;2022)</p>B PASS The Public Safety&nbsp;Report <p>The Public Safety Report app is a secure and transparent data sharing platform that promotes citizens’ participation in the community’s safety improvement. With the Public Safety Report, users can relay information regardless of time and location with DID authentication, this ensures the anonymity of the informants and data reliability, while using a reward system to encourage citizens’ participation in the&nbsp;reports.</p><p>There are two types of reports within the&nbsp;app:</p>  Regular Report: Citizens can report an accident, public inconveniences or a natural disaster to the appropriate public facility.  Mission Report: Public facilities launch missions with the intention of getting information to increase safety and prevent accidents. They can be a general mission, a location verification or a survey mission. With this kind of report, participants get rewards that can be exchanged with the Busan Digital&nbsp;Voucher.

<p>The Silicon Salon is Back for the New Year!</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons will be facilitating Silicon Salon 3 in mid-January, tentatively on January 18th. These Silicon Salons are an ongoing series of virtual events intended to bridge the gap between wallet requirements and semiconductor development, between academic research and real-world practice. Our ultimate objective is to ensure that the next generation of cryptographic semiconductors meets everyone’s needs, advancing the entire cryptography industry.</p>

<p>We will bring together semiconductor designers, secure hardware developers, academics, and other experts to present at Silicon Salon 3 and are calling for other contributors who are interested in making a presentation focused on silicon-logic-based cryptographic acceleration or support for new functionality such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC) leveraging hardened semiconductor-based security.</p>

<p>The field of MPC (Multi-Party Computation) for security applications has been an area of energetic academic research since first introduced by Andrew Yao in 1986. More recently, increases in computation capability and improvement in the efficiency of algorithms have enabled MPC to move from the theoretical to the practical. Varous MPC-TSS (MPC-Threshold Signature System) approaches offer significant benefits in security, robustness, and recovery versus traditional “single private key” systems. However, practical MPC is still in its infancy and is rapidly evolving, which introduces challenges in providing silicon support for the future of cryptography.</p>

 Read More 



<p>Some presentations lined up so far are:</p>
 
   In Pursuit of an Open Secure Element.  What are the elements that make a semiconductor more or less “open”, and what is really important? 
   Silicon &amp; MPC (Cramium). In this talk Cramium will overview silicon architecture approaches to addressing concerns of security, performance and efficiency, economic concerns, and flexibility to accommodate future improvements.  We will overview some facets of MPC-based distributed key management that receive little academic attention, but are important in a practical context. 
 

<p>If you are interested in making a presentation at Silicon Salon 3, please <a>contact us</a> with a proposal. Include the following:</p>

 
   The title. 
   A summary of what your presentation will be about. 
   A summary of how that relates to silicon-logic-based cryptographic acceleration &amp; new functionality and/or the general topic of integrating cryptography into new semiconductors. Note that this can be a discussion of capabilities from the point of view of a semiconductor manufacturer, of needs from a wallet manufacturer, or other discussions from someone in the broader decentralized community. 
   The name of the presenter(s). 
   A description of who they are and how they or their company have the expertise, capability, or reach to benefit the Silicon Salon conversation. 
 

<p>Final presentations should be about five minutes long, supported by a slide deck or some sort, which you will present in our Zoom salon on the date of the salon.</p>

<p>Please note the following deadlines for Silicon Salon 3 proposals and contributions:</p>

 
   December 23 - Final date for submission of proposals. 
   January 4 — Blockchain Commons selection of proposals. 
   January 11 — Submission of draft slidedecks to Blockchain Commons for any comments. 
   January 16 — Submission of final slidedecks to Blockchain Commons for inclusion in post-event web pages. 
   January 18 — Presentation at Silicon Salon 3. 
   January 25 — Blockchain Commons finalization of web site release. 
 

<p>Also please note that the January 18th date is tentative. We are checking with likely participants for conflicts, and ensuring that the holidays won’t cause too much conflict. If it moves, then the January deadlines will move accordingly.</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in Silicon Salon 3 and the future of semiconductor integration with cryptography! If you have any questions or want more information, please email us at <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">team@blockchaincommons.com</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you do not want to present, please Save the Date of January 18th, 2023, so that you can participate in the conversation. We’ll make an announcement as soon as we’ve finalized the date and have an Eventbrite page availabale for signups.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">https://www.siliconsalon.info/</a> for our salons to date. Silicon Salon 3 will continue this discussion.</p>

				  The goal of DIDComm is summed up well by Daniel Hardman, CTO of Provenant:&nbsp; “The goal is to help DIDs interact while retaining properties of DID methods. [The] Goal is not [to] use DIDs to authenticate people (though it enables this).”  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>DIDComm — short for Decentralized Identifier Communication — provides a method for creating a direct, secure line of communication between the owners of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). But DIDComm is more than just a mechanism for an individual message, it’s a framework for safe, structured interactions built on decentralization technology.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>In this framework each holder of a DID agrees to accept a connection and enables communication along that channel, whether it be through a website, email, mobile push notifications, QR codes, or a text message. These connections benefit from the built-in features of DIDComm technology, including message encryption, mutual authentication, and message routing.</p>
<p>While some interactions happen entirely within DIDComm protocol messages, such as identity verification and connection creation, DIDComm protocols can also be used to facilitate interactions within other protocols. For example, a video conference call or a phone call could be coordinated using DIDComm protocols to make use of the trust provided by the DIDComm relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key use for DIDComm is in the communication of verifiable credentials. In the annotated stack diagram from Trust Over IP (below) we can see the role that DIDComm could play in its architectural design.&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>But DIDComm opens up a lot of use cases, or “interesting stuff,” once an initial, secure connection is agreed upon by two users. This includes:</p>
 
 Secure payments and money transfers. 
 Privacy-oriented shipping, where the sender doesn’t receive private destination details.

  <p>If you were to follow security best practices, your passwords would be long and complex, containing no dictionary words. You'd have a unique one for every online account, service, or application – roughly 100 passwords if you're like most people. You'd change them regularly and you'd remember them all, perhaps using a password manager but never saving them in a file (or a notebook next to your bed).</p>

<p>Passwords have become the bane of most people's online experiences. If you switch devices, you'll have to enter your credentials and remember that complex password. If you forget, you may have to go through a reset — you might even get locked out of your account.</p>

<p>We've all heard it before, but I'll say it again: passwords are inherently bad. They're bad for the user experience, bad for security, bad for support, and bad because they enable credential phishing attacks. And yet, as we head into 2023, passwords remain the most widely used form of authentication. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

 It's time to do away with passwords; "passkeys" represent a major step forward 

<p>As a long-time champion (and enabler) of passwordless authentication, ForgeRock has been a part of the war on passwords. The latest front in this war has come from the FIDO2 (Fast Identity Online 2) Alliance's introduction of passkeys, quickly followed by announcements from Apple and Google about their support for the use of passkeys on iPhone and Android operating systems.</p>

<p>This introduction remedies a key usability and experience gap that has been holding back the broader adoption of passwordless authentication, promising to deliver better end-user experiences and reduce the risk of credential phishing attacks.</p>

 Passkeys remove login friction by working across your devices 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> is based on the FIDO2 WebAuthn standard, and features the convenience of biometrics, such as a fingerprint or facial scan. WebAuthn eliminates the need to enter a password by utilizing private and public key cryptography for secure authentication.</p>

<p>Until now, the widespread use of passwordless has faced headwinds due to limitations in the portability of WebAuthn, which has been tied to the physical device enrolled to the user. The private keys stay in the vault on the user's mobile phone or device. So the frictionless experience goes away when the user changes devices or gets a new one, as the new device no longer holds the login credentials (private key) to authenticate.</p>

<p>Passkeys eliminate this restriction by allowing the private keys to be stored in a vault in the device vendor's cloud instead of on the device itself. Passkeys remove the reliance on hardware from the equation and, in so doing, remove friction when you change devices.</p>

 By eliminating passwords, you thwart the most common types of attack 

<p>Unauthorized or fraudulent access remains the number one attack vector and will continue to be as long as passwords are around. According to the 2022 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2022-forgerock-consumer-identity-breach-report">ForgeRock Consumer Identity Breach Report</a>, compromised credentials accounted for half of all data breaches in 2021. Passkeys and other approaches to passwordless authentication remove attackers' ability to use and re-use stolen credentials, and can play a powerful role in your multi-factor authentication (MFA) strategy.</p>

 ForgeRock delivers no-code, out-of-the-box support for passkeys 

<p>While other vendors have had to code it into their platform and upgrade their systems to support passkeys, we are excited to announce that the ForgeRock Identity Platform already supports passkeys without requiring any coding changes or upgrades to the platform. Passkeys have been supported by ForgeRock since their inception and available for our customers to use.</p>

<p>Our unique platform enables passkey support to be offered out-of-the-box (OOTB), and it's seamlessly integrated into user journeys to deliver multiple authentication choices to users. ForgeRock customers with active deployments will receive passkey support along with FIDO support, as the platform does not differentiate between, and equally supports, keys that are device-bound and those that aren't.</p>

 Enabling more flexibility and choices in passwordless authentication 

<p>ForgeRock customers are already building no-code passwordless authentication journeys with ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access Trees</a>, which facilitate <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">journey orchestration</a> in the identity platform. We also provide OOTB integrations for the FIDO2 WebAuthn standard through Intelligent Access.</p>

<p>With passkeys already supported by these WebAuthn nodes, our customers can provide more passwordless authentication choices to end users, depending on the user's specific mobile device. Building passwordless user journeys is quick and easy — you simply drag and drop the pre-configured WebAuthn nodes and adjust the journey to meet your needs. Supported in WebAuthn nodes, passkeys are easily embedded in user journeys which then steer towards different passwordless paths based on run-time signals.</p>

 Never login again 

<p>Passkeys represent an important step forward in achieving truly seamless, outstanding experiences while dramatically reducing credential-based attacks — all by making passwords a thing of the past. We are enhancing passkey configuration options for different deployments to further improve security and interoperability, and to address customer needs for maximum choice and flexibility. As the recognized leader in passwordless technology, we continue to innovate and move closer to our mission of "never login again."</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>Securing data and complying with the growing number of associated local, regional, and international regulations are two of the biggest challenges facing most modern organizations as they become increasingly reliant on complex IT environments.</p>
<p>Key to achieving both data security and regulatory compliance is the ability to manage identities effectively and enforce policy-based access controls to ensure only authorized people and things have access to IT systems and data under the correct circumstances.</p>
<p>This has become increasingly challenging with the proliferation of digital identities, applications, security threats, and data security compliance requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability for organizations to ensure that only the right people have access to the right resources at the right time, and to be able to prove it – is essential. This not only provides the foundation for good cybersecurity, but also for effective regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)is a core component of Identity and Access Management (IAM) infrastructure and refers to integrated solutions that combine Identity Lifecycle Management (ILM) and Access Governance. IGA helps to cut costs, increase security, improve compliance, and give users access to the IT resources they need.</p>
<p>Depending on maturity in terms of IAM, some organizations may need to bolster their capabilities in ILM while others need to focus on Access Governance. But most organizations are looking for a comprehensive IGA solution, that combines traditional User Access Provisioning (UAP) and Identity and Access Governance (IAG).</p>
<p>In general, IGA solutions support the consolidation of identity information across multiple repositories and systems of record in an organization's IT environment. The identity information including user accounts, associated access entitlements and other identity attributes are collected from across the connected target systems for correlation and management of individual identities, user groups as well as roles through a centralized administration console.</p>
<p>Comprehensive solutions typically include end-to-end identity life-cycle management, access entitlement management, workflow and policy management, role management, access certification, SoD risk analysis, reporting and access intelligence, and Access Intelligence for business-related insights to support effective decision making and potentially enhance governance.</p>
<p>In response to the demand for comprehensive solutions, the IGA market is growing and maturing, although it continues to evolve. Organizations should therefore ensure that they thoroughly understand their needs and how the market can best support those needs with innovative technologies and approaches.</p>
<p>As part of the evolution of IGA products, identity and access intelligence has become a key capability, as has automation aimed at reducing management workload. There is also an increasing focus on interoperability with other related products and services.</p>

 Press Release — idFlexNetz <p>Digitalizing flexibilities in the energy grid with renowned project partners — digital wins, data spaces, marketplaces, and&nbsp;more.</p>idFlexNetz members<p>Press release — Dortmund, 28.11.2022</p><p>Dortmund, November 2022 — At the beginning of May, Spherity launched a digitalization project for the energy sector together with renowned partners from the fields of industry, research, and software/consulting. The aim of the research project, called idFlexNetz, is to create digital models (“twins”) of existing grid resources in order to make them available to the market along with algorithms for operations management.</p><p>With a view to the requirements of decarbonization, the digitization project, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate with around 2 million euros, links the electricity, electromobility, gas, and heat sectors. In principle, the aim is to make the distribution networks fit for the future and to coordinate increasingly decentralized and highly dynamic energy generation with increasingly flexible local consumers in an overarching and intelligent manner.</p><p>The basis — tamper-proof digital&nbsp;twins</p><p>A standardized description language, which has yet to be developed, will initially be used to create a uniform ICT ecosystem for corresponding prediction and operator models from the previous individual, highly heterogeneous stand-alone solutions of the grid operators. Its digital products can then later be traded on a digital market that meets the highest security requirements.</p><p>For this purpose, digital images of real network components such as local network stations will be created, i.e., forgery-proof models known as digital twins. Network operators can then use these models, for example, for various network operation applications such as network capacity estimations, network simulations, network load forecasts, or even maintenance measures in different characteristics and scenarios. These are all parameters that meet their specific conditions on-site with a lot of operational experience. They are ultimately available to all network operators in comparable situations and, last but not least, to the industry. This should reduce time and&nbsp;costs.</p><p>Renowned project partners — intradisciplinary</p><p>In order to achieve universal usability of digital goods in network applications, standardized interfaces will be developed within the project. The aim here is to develop standardized procedures that enable players to convert models into digital twins and offer them on the marketplace for trading purposes. To this end, the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence GmbH and Fraunhofer IOSB-AST, Schneider Electric GmbH, Spherity GmbH, Fraunhofer ISI, as well as the Frankfurt School of Finance and SAP SE, under the leadership of Saarbrücken-based VSE AG, will work on cross-sector solutions and their commercialization in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>“We are pleased to start this exciting research project together with the diverse partners,” comments Dr. Stephan Tenge, technical director of VSE AG, on the start-up phase of the future project. “I think we have exactly the right mix of partners in this project. Personally, I have high expectations for the project and am already looking forward to the first results. The topic of the digital twin,” Tenge knows, “opens up new possibilities for us in the context of the energy transition.”</p><p>Secure Marketplace for Digital Goods — The business&nbsp;model</p><p>The business model of such an ecosystem is based on the comparability and transparency of the digital twins. Digital models that network operators will in the future be able to offer for sale on the digital marketplace, together with master data and other valuable parameters such as location and usage data, but also purchase for their own fields of activity. Other network operators will benefit from the experience of the entire industry in that they will be able to purchase, use and evaluate models that are exactly right for them, following the example of the online platform Amazon. The emerging ICT ecosystem with all its digital models will enable them to operate their networks more economically, i.e., at lower cost, and more securely, and charge their customers lower network usage&nbsp;fees.</p><p>But the industry also potential benefits from the new digital marketplace of the future. For producers of grid components, for example, system suppliers or software and hardware manufacturers, the emerging data pool on this platform represents an unprecedented source of information from the field for more targeted product development of their own for the energy&nbsp;sector.</p><p>About Spherity</p><p><a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a> is a German decentralized digital identity software provider, that brings secure identities to enterprises, machines, products, data, and even algorithms.

<p>Most software developers learn OpenID Connect or other identity standards by chance. Some will love and others may hate that experience. Regardless of their affection to the standards, it’s crucial that software engineers understand reasonably well how these standards work and what their implications are, in terms of usability but especially in terms of security. Just finding a library and making it work is a recipe for failure.</p>
 What is the most common task, the problem 
<p>The most common task a developer faces in which OpenID Connect comes into place is: integrate our application with an authentication method (e.g. login with Office 365, bank authentication), so as a result, this new authentication method is enabled in the application. In quora.com or stackoverflow.com you will easily find articles starting with “how to integrate openid connect …”</p>
<p>The problem to solve is the following: unless OpenID Connect was thought of from the very first moment an application was designed, the application cannot use an external authentication method such as “Login with Apple” so add a login button besides its own username+password boxes.</p>
<p>In order to capitalise on the numerous advantages of adding an external authentication method, the application has to become an OpenID Connect relying party. In practice, the developer must embed such functionality into the application. The most common way to do it is by using libraries approved by The OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>The OpenID Connect standard has different flows for different use cases that involve user authentication, and the most common flow used today for both web and mobile applications is authorisation code flow. The next step besides flow choice is to define how the client authentication will happen.</p>
 Types of clients 
<p>RFC 6749 defines type of clients in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-2.1">Section 2.1: OAuth 2.0 Client Types</a> as show below.</p>
<p>OAuth defines two client types, based on their ability to authenticate securely with the authorization server (i.e., ability to maintain the confidentiality of their client credentials):</p>
 Confidential 
<blockquote><p>Clients capable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials (e.g., client implemented on a secure server with restricted access to the client credentials), or capable of secure client authentication using other means.</p></blockquote>
 Public 
<blockquote><p>Clients incapable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials (e.g., clients executing on the device used by the resource owner, such as an installed native application or a web browser-based application), and incapable of secure client authentication via any other means.</p></blockquote>
 When would you need to use a confidential client? Possible reasons are for example: 
 
 It is a policy requirement defined by the Identity Provider 
 The claims returned by the Identity Provider could be highly confidential 
 There could be a cost associated with each authentication transaction 
 
<p>Now that we understand types of clients better, we can see that most of today’s real life scenarios require confidential clients. Broadly speaking there are two types of credentials for confidential clients:</p>
 
 Symmetric credentials using any of the client_secret authentication options 
 Asymmetric credentials using either private_key_jwt or mutual TLS authentication options 
 
<p>Confidential clients must send client credentials with requests to endpoints that require authentication, which includes token, introspection and revocation endpoints.</p>
<p>Today for most scenarios, the integration of applications is done with OpenID Connect using client_id and client_secret. However private_key_jwt is another option that often comes to developer’s attention.</p>
<p>This is when the question “Should I use private_key_jwt or client_secret?” comes into play.</p>
 Should I use private_key_jwt or client_secret? 
<p>First of all, it’s good to clarify that there are three flavours of client_secret. Let’s review each by one:</p>
 
 On client_secret_basic, the client uses HTTP Basic authentication scheme with client_id and client_secret. 
 On client_secret_post, the client sends client_id and client_secret as HTML form parameters 
 On client_secret_jwt, the client uses JWTs for client authentication. The JWT is signed with a key derived from client_secret. 
 
<p>The first two are very similar and only differ on how the client_secret is sent in the POST (or GET) calls. The most common one is client_secret_basic, while client_secret_jwt is very rarely used.</p>
 Now let’s analyse how client_secret works. 
<p>Let’s imagine we have an OpenID Connect compliant application, which wants to allow users to authenticate with an external identity provider such as Login with GitHub. The very first step is to check what the type of client authentication used is. In case of GitHub, client_secret is used.</p>
<p>In this scenario, GitHub is the identity provider as all the user accounts (and its respective credentials) are stored on its servers. When you, as a developer, want to integrate GitHub login to an application, you must go to GitHub developer portal to register an OAuth 2.0 application. In that process, GitHub will generate a client_id and client_secret for this new client.</p>
<p>The developer copies this piece of information on the relying party’s CIAM system, and the registration is completed. For reference, step-by-step instructions to do this on Ubisecure Identity Platform are <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KNB/pages/8989147157/Github+Login+Setup">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please observe that:</p>
 
 The identity provider has generated the secret. 
 Every time the application wants to perform client authentication to the server, first it must send the client_secret through the channel in order to obtain an access token. 
 
 Let’s compare those similar steps to analyse how private_key_jwt works. 
<p>Now imagine the OpenID Connect compliant application wants to allow users to authenticate with an external identity provider like the Finnish Trust Network. In this case, private_key_jwt is the only allowed option for client authentication.</p>
<p>When you as the developer want to integrate Finnish Trust Network login to an application, you have to follow an identity broker’s integration guide. The identity broker has publicly shared all its relevant metadata on the .well-known/openid-configuration endpoint. This includes its JSON Web Encryption keys (<a href="https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Jwks_uri">jwks_uri</a>). For instance, Telia Identification Broker Service’s jwks_uri is <a href="https://tunnistus.telia.fi/uas/oauth2/metadata.jwks">https://tunnistus.telia.fi/uas/oauth2/metadata.jwks</a>. In the registration process, the relying party must generate its own pair of asymmetric keys, typically throughout its CIAM system.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</a>, a “registration request” is sent to the identity provider (identity broker strictly speaking for Telia) and the service provider will receive back a “registration response” metadata file. The developer uploads this metadata on the relying party’s CIAM system, and the registration is completed.</p>
<p>Notice that:</p>
 
 Both the relying party and the identity provider generate a pair of asymmetric keys on their own side. 
 Every time the application wants to authenticate, no secret is sent through the channel. Instead, the private key is used to sign the request so a signed client_assertion is sent. The other end can use the sender’s public key to decrypt the assertion. 
 
<p>If you are unsure which one(s) of these two are supported by the identity provider you want to integrate, the OpenID Connect discovery endpoint of a server (.well-known/openid-configuration) shows the list of client authentication methods supported.</p>
 Comparison table 
<p>The table below offers a succinct comparison between the two client authentication options.</p>



Client_secret
Private_key_jwt


A secret is shared
No secret is shared


Based on symmetric cryptographic
Based on asymmetric cryptography, which offers stronger algorithms


Secret is usually generated on the Identity provider side, and then shared to the relying party in order to integrate the specific application
Key pairs are generated by the service provider side (using the Identity and Access Management system), and only the public key is shared to the identity provider


It’s used today in the vast majority of identity providers, including all social media
It’s a requirement for Open Banking APIs under the Financial Grade API (FAPI), the Finnish Trust Network, and other similar profiles.


Manual key rotation, based on a shared secret
Dynamic key rotation



<p>Overall, in the near future you will use both, especially client_secret. But as FAPI has adopted it because of its improved security, private_key_jwt is the way to go if you have the choice.</p>

 On-Chain “Polkadot Alliance” Formed to Recognize Ecosystem Contributors and Establish Community Code of&nbsp;Ethics <p>Today seven teams from the Polkadot ecosystem announced the formation of the Polkadot Alliance, an on-chain collective that establishes and upholds a set of ethics for the community to follow. Founding Fellows <a href="https://acala.network/">Acala</a>, <a href="https://astar.network/">Astar</a>, <a href="https://www.interlay.io/">Interlay</a>, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a>, <a href="https://moonbeam.network/">Moonbeam</a>, <a href="https://www.subscan.io/">Subscan</a> and <a href="https://www.phala.network/">Phala</a> have initiated the Alliance with a mission of ensuring standards of excellence across the rapidly growing ecosystem.</p><p>The Polkadot Alliance was first referenced in the August 2022 blog post “<a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/proposal-for-common-good-parachains/">Proposal for Common Good Parachains</a>” by Joe Petrowski of the Web3 Foundation:</p><p>The new proposal for Polkadot governance introduces a new collective, the Fellowship, which allows a ranked group of experts to express its opinion on sensitive or highly privileged proposals.</p><p>Another collective in development is the Polkadot Alliance. The Alliance is already deployed on the Westend test parachain and will likely be the first one on Polkadot. Several community teams banded together about two years ago and came up with the idea for the Alliance, primarily to fight misuse of the Polkadot brand and unattributed code…The Alliance would be an on-chain industry collective that sets a code of ethics regarding brand use, scam activities, and harmful behavior, but also provides recognition to teams who do make positive contributions to the growth and success of the Polkadot&nbsp;network.</p><p>A <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1318">proposal</a> for a Collective common good parachain followed in October 2022 and the parachain launched on 21 November 2022. A referendum is now needed to initialize the Founding Fellows; a motion will be made later this&nbsp;week.</p><p>The Alliance will exist on-chain and will publish its findings of unscrupulous websites and accounts on-chain. But it will not have any governance powers; its domain does not reach into other parts of the Polkadot protocol.</p> Background <p>As the Polkadot ecosystem has expanded, some low-quality teams have started to pollute the Polkadot brand. These teams copy code without attribution, use “Polka” branding with no intention of building on Polkadot, conduct scammy token raises on Ethereum, launch rival relay chains, and are disrespectful in their interactions with other community members.</p><p>The Polkadot Alliance provides a framework to recognize the teams who empower others and contribute to the ecosystem in alignment with open source culture, and includes an on-chain mechanism that calls attention to those teams that do&nbsp;not.</p> Membership <p>Alliance members are expected to be companies, projects, other collectives, or even other networks in the Polkadot ecosystem (e.g. a company working on a parachain, or the Kusama network itself). Membership consists of two tiers: Fellow and&nbsp;Ally.</p><p>Fellows have voting rights on Alliance motions and carry out on-chain operations. Being a Fellow requires a strong commitment not only to abide by the standards, but also to enforce these standards in a consistent and timely manner. For instance, Fellows are responsible for membership management including promotion to Ally (or removal), and curation of an “Unscrupulous List” of problematic team URLs and accounts.</p><p>A subset of the Fellows is the seven Founding Fellows, which are the teams who built the Polkadot Alliance and started to contribute before it was live on-chain.</p><p>Allies are members of the Polkadot Alliance and do not have voting rights. There are two ways to join as an&nbsp;Ally:</p>  By submitting a transaction to join and placing a deposit of 1,000 DOT, which is locked until retirement from the collective.  By nomination by a Fellow, which does not require a&nbsp;deposit.  <p>Anyone can join as an Ally (with a deposit), but only Fellows can promote Allies to Fellow. Allies that wish to take a more active role in operating the Alliance, and who demonstrate active and sustained contributions to the ecosystem, can request promotion to Fellow. The motion to do so requires 60% approval from voting members to&nbsp;pass.</p><p>Read the Alliance <a href="https://crustwebsites.net/ipfs/QmdBBY5JTzazy4zK3ZP4dMXVnM5XXo3QfhEkMrZEzxBFn6?filename=Polkadot_Alliance_Charter_v1_28Nov2022.pdf">Charter</a> to learn more about how to become a&nbsp;member.</p> About the Polkadot&nbsp;Alliance <p>The Polkadot Alliance is an on-chain collective that establishes and upholds a community code of ethics.

<p>London, 29 November, 2022&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>,&nbsp;a leading European identity proofing platform provider,&nbsp;has appointed Jason Tucker-Feltham as its Head of Crypto Sales. Based in IDnow’s London office, Jason brings with him more than a decade of experience in financial services, with the last four years spent specialising in crypto.</p>



<p>Jason, who is also the committee chairman at Crypto Club Global, is a passionate industry advocate, and regularly engaged as a speaker at crypto events in the UK and beyond. Previously, he worked in business development and European sales at Celsius, where he covered some of the largest institutional clients in the crypto space. Before that, he was the Head of UK Advisory Compliance at UniCredit, where he lobbied for proportionate MiCA regulation on behalf of the entire banking group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenting on his appointment, Jason said: “The crypto market has been consistently growing in relevance ever since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009. In that time, market capitalisations of most crypto assets have varied considerably, but industry momentum indicates that crypto has a future and may well turn traditional finance on its head.”</p>



<p>“However, with decentralised finance (DeFi), there are concerns that bad actors can exploit digital asset platforms. This is where Know Your Customer (KYC) and the tokenisation of identity can come in. These processes can build an additional layer of trust between all market players. As one of the leading platform providers for identity proofing in Europe, IDnow is a great fit for the rapidly maturing crypto industry,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benjamin Haas, Senior Sales Director EMEA at IDnow, commented: “We’re excited to have someone as knowledgeable in the crypto market as Jason as part of the team. In his capacity as Head of Crypto Sales, he will be responsible and accountable for our go-to-market crypto strategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Given the developments in the crypto industry currently, having Jason join the team now is great timing. The crypto market is clearly in need of regulation and with our team and our market leading solutions, we want to be at the forefront of this change,” Benjamin added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MATTR teams have been hard at work adding new capabilities and additional features to our MATTR VII platform, SDKs and MATTR&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>We’ve spent a lot of time collaborating with customers to better understand their needs and expectations when it comes to data security, auditability and user experience.</p><p>Here’s a walkthrough of what’s new in the MATTR universe — including new cloud deployment options, enhanced security features and a fully revamped digital&nbsp;wallet.</p> Introducing event logs to the MATTR VII&nbsp;platform <p>We have added enhanced logging for all key API calls (platform events logs) to the MATTR VII platform. Over 130 different types of events are now&nbsp;logged!</p><p>There are three different levels of logging that can be configured:</p>  Level 1 — Basic Information such as the API name, date, time, request&nbsp;ID  Level 2 — Basic Information + Meta&nbsp;Data  Level 3 — Basic Information + Meta Data + Full API Payload information  <p>All MATTR VII public cloud deployments are set to Level 1, which excludes any personally identifiable information (PII).</p><p>In MATTR VII private cloud deployments, the logging level is configurable based on the customer’s audit, user privacy and operational requirements. Private cloud users can also leverage our integration adaptor to extract the platform event logs to their systems, e.g., centralised audit logging stores, SIEM, billing capability or data warehouses.</p> Get notified of event updates automatically with&nbsp;webhooks <p>MATTR VII now supports webhooks, a standard design pattern that allows subscription to specific MATTR VII platform events in real time. Customers can be automatically notified of these platform events and either integrate that information into specific workflows or store additional information.</p><p>The first webhook that customers can subscribe to will notify them each time a credential is issued by the MATTR VII OIDC bridge. This enables ongoing credential lifecycle management activities with the information returned in the webhook, such as sending additional communications to the holder or augmenting end user&nbsp;records.</p><p>We’ll be adding additional webhooks in the future to give MATTR’s customers even more flexibility in integrating their systems with the MATTR VII platform.</p> Use our HTTP Signatures Library <p>To provide customers with confidence in the integrity and validity of webhook events, we’ve open-sourced our HTTP signatures library — anyone can now integrate it with their own applications.</p><p>HTTP message signatures are a way of digitally signing an HTTP request to give the receiving party assurance of the integrity of the message, and that the party sending the information is who they say they&nbsp;are.</p><p>Though this mechanism can be applied to any HTTP request, it’s particularly effective when used with MATTR VII webhook events. It allows the subscriber to authenticate that the signed request is, in fact, coming from MATTR VII. We’ve also published:</p>  An <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mattrglobal/http-signatures">NPM library</a> to allow for easier software integration of this capability.  A <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/sample-apps/tree/master/verify-webhook-http-signature">sample app</a> to demonstrate how to use the open-source library in your implementation.  <p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/webhooks/overview">Read the technical tutorials about implementing webhooks on MATTR&nbsp;Learn.</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@mattrglobal/open-sourcing-our-http-signatures-library-821c04a640ec">Read more about how we’re enhancing the security of webhooks with HTTP signatures</a>.</p> Meet the new MATTR&nbsp;Wallet <p>We’re thrilled to announce we’ve re-released the MATTR Wallet — our digital wallet app that helps showcase to developers and ecosystem pilot partners how verifiable credentials can work in the real world, in real-time.</p><p>The latest release has been designed with end users in mind, accessibility tested and informed by in-depth customer&nbsp;insight.</p><p>It includes a fresh onboarding flow, which reduces friction for first-time end users, and a new home screen that consolidates important information. Improved navigation and powerful new search capabilities make it easier and faster for users to find what they&nbsp;need.</p><p>An interactive activity tab has been introduced. It lists all interactions and highlights items that need attention. End users can view their history and filter interactions quickly. Clearer transaction screens make it easier to review what’s being received and give consent for&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>Our research has shown that end users trust digital credentials that mimic their real-life cards and certificates more readily, so issuers can now customise their credentials. Customers can add logos, choose background colours and create watermarks on digital credentials to make them feel more like real-world versions.</p><p><a href="https://mattr.global/contact">Get in touch with us</a> to explore how the MATTR can accelerate your project’s time to market and how MATTR’s wallet capabilities (including SDKs, white-label options) can be used to support your proof-of-concept phase and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>For those who want to see the MATTR Wallet showcase these new features in action, download and prototype with our latest tech by visiting the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mattr-wallet/id1518660243">App Store</a>, or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=global.mattr.wallet&amp;pli=1">Google Play store</a>. Remember, this product may only be used in production by pre-approved pilot partners.</p> Security and deployment to meet enterprise-level needs <p>One of our top priorities at MATTR is offering the right options when it comes to how and where our platform is deployed, and meeting our customers’ availability, security, efficiency and privacy&nbsp;needs.</p><p>MATTR VII is now live in two additional AWS regions — Frankfurt, Germany and Montréal, Canada — which gives our European and North American customers enhanced platform support and options to meet their data sovereignty and compliance requirements.</p><p><a href="https://mattr.global/platform/deployment-options">Find out more about how the MATTR VII platform can be deployed.</a></p><p>We’re committed to providing high-quality enterprise and government-grade solutions with our SOC2 and Cyber Essentials Certified Plus compliance. Additionally, security firm Trail of Bits has completed an independent audit of the key code libraries that power the MATTR VII platform.</p><p>We take customer data very seriously and continue to uphold the highest possible standards for confidentiality and integrity throughout our organisation, including our processes, our people and our&nbsp;systems.</p><p><a href="https://mattr.global/platform/security">Read more about how the MATTR Security Framework supports diverse compliance and safety&nbsp;needs</a>.</p> More options for OIDC bridge issuances and configurations <p>For customers, integration with existing infrastructure eases the burden of adopting the new tools and capabilities MATTR provides. In particular, the use of OpenID Connect as a common protocol for credential exchange has been a very effective pattern for our customers and continues to gain traction in the broader internet standards community.</p><p>We’ve enhanced our OIDC bridge extension to support additional identity providers like Okta, ForgeRock and AzureB2C. Customers can now easily integrate credential issuing capabilities with more of the identity providers they already&nbsp;use.</p><p>Additional OIDC configuration options are also now available to help customers customise and simplify the user experience of collecting credentials.</p><p>— —</p><p>MATTR helps organisations and governments incorporate verifiable credentials into their operations in a secure, simple and accessible way.

<p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! We are back with some of the most interesting news from the world of crypto regulations this week, from the crypto regulations being discussed at the Commonwealth Law Ministers meeting to Kenya’s plans to tax crypto transactions. So, let’s dive straight into it without further&nbsp;ado.</p> Crypto Regulations Discussed at Commonwealth Law Ministers Meeting <p>Amid the flurry of devastating blows that the crypto industry has experienced this year, digital asset regulations remain a hotly debated topic in various global&nbsp;forums.</p>(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7001825345221922816/">Image Source</a>)<p>The most recent meeting where crypto regulations were discussed was the 2022 Commonwealth Law Ministers Meeting in Mauritius, where leading global public policy influencer Loretta Joseph briefed the honorable ministers on effective regulations of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The ministers agreed that the work on potential crypto framework model law must begin at the earliest in line with the 54-nation grouping’s values. Considering the growing usage of virtual assets and the vulnerability of smaller member states to it, they demanded the Secretariat work with finance ministers to plan a data-backed course of&nbsp;action.</p> V20 Taking Steps Towards Compliance and Risk Mitigation (<a href="https://twitter.com/idaxaofficial/status/1580722212625330177?s=20&amp;t=U1tGurNnN_201C0vnUjBuQ">Image Source</a>)<p>This year’s V20 summit comes at a time when the crypto industry is facing an existential crisis caused by back-to-back setbacks since 2021, the most recent one ^being the FTX collapse.</p><p>Industry leaders have realized the need for global alignment at such a crucial phase. This is why they agreed to implement a single, global VASP counterparty discovery system at V20, which is not only a big win for the industry but for the Shyft Network as&nbsp;well.</p><p>We are coming up with a special editorial on it this week with details on what transpired at the V20 summit and its crucial role in shaping the direction the global crypto industry takes from here&nbsp;on.</p> IMF Calls for Increased Crypto Regulation in&nbsp;Africa <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is urging local authorities and governments to tighten the regulations of the region’s crypto industry. And while noting it, the IMF said that it is “one of the fastest-growing markets in the world,” and yet, only 25% of the countries in the sub-Saharan African region regulate&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>The international organization cited the FTX collapse and its ripple effect on the global crypto market while demanding strong crypto regulations in Africa. After all, it is “prompting renewed calls for greater consumer protection and regulation of the crypto industry” for increased oversight.</p><blockquote>Additionally, the IMF said in <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/11/22/africas-growing-crypto-market-needs-better-regulations">its blog</a> that the “risks from crypto assets are evident, and thus, “it’s time to regulate” to find a balance between minimizing risk and maximizing innovation.</blockquote><blockquote>The agency further stated that policymakers are worried that crypto “can be used to transfer funds illegally out of the region and to circumvent local rules to prevent capital outflows.”</blockquote><p>On top of this, the widespread use of cryptocurrencies can “undermine the effectiveness of the monetary policy, creating risks for financial and macroeconomic stability.”</p> SEC Chair Criticized for his “Inconsistent Approach” to Crypto Oversight <p>US Congressman Tom Emmer criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, Gary Gensler, on his approach towards regulating the crypto industry as “his strategy (missed) Celsius, Voyager, Terra/Luna– and now&nbsp;FTX.”</p><blockquote>He also accused Gensler of being in cahoots with the FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, intending to “give them special treatment from the SEC that others aren’t getting.”</blockquote>(<a href="https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1596274611745787904?s=20&amp;t=clQ-Og5SrQOiHzOIcZUZ9Q">Image Source</a>)<p>Meanwhile, the good actors in the industry face prosecutions and investigations from the regulator, said Emmer, noting that “we need to get to the bottom of this” and understand why the agency and Gensler “were not doing their&nbsp;job.”</p><p>According to Emmer, “Congress shouldn’t have to learn the details about the SEC’s oversight agenda through planted stories in progressive publications,” while criticizing the mainstream media for their portrayal of&nbsp;SBF.</p> Kenya Starts Taxing Crypto Capital&nbsp;Gains <p>Kenya has introduced an amendment to The Capital Markets Bill, 2022, allowing the government to tax crypto exchanges, digital wallets, and transactions.</p><p>Under the bill, crypto investors would have to shell out capital gains tax to the Kenya Revenue Authority on crypto transactions. Besides that, local investors would also be required to inform the government’s financial regulator — Capital Markets Authority — of the details of their crypto ownership.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoAmb/status/1595057008658579458?s=20&amp;t=9lH4KtvrFmSqskfY42VWtA">Image Source</a>)<p>The bill, authored by Mosop MP Abraham Kirwa, would define digital currencies as securities and set a base for a nationwide centralized electronic register to track crypto transactions within the borders of the country, provide licensing to individual crypto traders, and institute consumer protection measures.</p><p>According to a Chainalysis survey released in September, with about 8.5% of the population crypto users, Kenya has the world’s fifth-highest rate of crypto ownership.</p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer! (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1575878765363793922?s=20&amp;t=nvFMIf3wUOMwUrY0ZrvA5Q">Image Source</a>)<p>After Shyft DAO approved the Veriscope VASP grant proposal, an aggregate of 10,000 SHFT has been granted for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that integrate to the Veriscope mainnet by September 30, 2022. The fund will enable VASPs to pay the Shyft Network gas fees while using Veriscope.

<p>An important part of creating a future where digital trust is embedded into business practices is creating tools to strengthen secure communication across systems and applications.</p><p>Part of this effort for our products at MATTR includes implementing standards that make our API communications more secure. We recently announced that we’re introducing the use of HTTP message signatures to our flagship MATTR VII platform, which enhance data security and make the interactions between different parties on the web&nbsp;safer.</p><p>We also champion open and interoperable standards across the internet and web applications in our mission to make a safer internet for all. To aid both our customers and others in the community in this, we’ve made our HTTP Signatures library fully open-sourced and publicly accessible.</p> HTTP message signatures <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol, more commonly known as HTTP, is a core technology that underpins the internet. As it enables global systems to communicate with each other, it’s critical to secure HTTP messages as much as possible.</p><p>Much like an artist’s signature on a painting in the real world, a digital signature assures a verifying party that information:</p>  has integrity — it hasn’t been tampered&nbsp;with  originated from an authentic source — it’s from where it says it’s&nbsp;from.  <p>HTTP message signatures apply the power of digital signatures to HTTP, providing integrity and origin authenticity properties to the message or&nbsp;request.</p><p>Other digital security methods like OAuth and shared secrets, used to implement authentication and access control on APIs and web applications, require a round-trip to confirm the client. The HTTP Signatures scheme doesn’t. The integrity of a message sent can be verified independently and directly by the receiver and both parties can be confident that information has not been tampered&nbsp;with.</p><p>The use of HTTP message signatures is currently a draft standard incubating at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures/">Read the draft IETF standard]</a>. If the draft is progressed to a finalised standard, this technology could become more commonly utilised across applications.</p><p>HTTP signatures have broader benefits for the community. There are various use cases where security features can be applied to different kinds of interactions. Examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Authorising access to a secure storage&nbsp;backend  Filtering spam and other messages sent to a communication endpoint  Allowing ecosystems to authenticate access to permissioned APIs  And many&nbsp;more   How we use HTTP message signatures with&nbsp;webhooks <p>Within our MATTR VII platform, we’re using HTTP message signatures to help customers verify the authenticity and integrity of webhooks sent by the platform. A webhook is a standard design pattern that enables a party to “subscribe” to one or more events on a system by supplying a callback URL. The URL is used to communicate with another party when a certain condition or event&nbsp;occurs.</p><p>With a “publish and subscribe” model, MATTR VII customers can be set up to be notified that the specific event has been triggered, such as a credential issuance events or configuration updates –they then use those to take further action based on business&nbsp;needs.</p> What HTTP message signatures do for&nbsp;webhooks <p>Using webhooks on the MATTR VII platform requires customers to set up an endpoint to receive information, and that endpoint must be open to the public internet.</p><p>Because of this, there needs to be a way for the subscribed system to authenticate that the request is coming from MATTR VII and that the request is valid and not being spoofed, intercepted or modified in any way by malicious actors.</p><p>We sign the outbound webhook events with HTTP message signatures so our customers can safely call MATTR VII APIs from webhooks, and any subscriber can confidently verify the received requests are coming from&nbsp;us.</p><p>HTTP message signatures provide an easy and scalable way for our customers to authenticate messages or requests from our platform. The same pattern can be used to provide authenticity for any kind of web interaction or event&nbsp;trigger.</p> Leverage the technology for your own implementations <p>The application of the HTTP Signatures library in the context of webhooks is one of many implementation examples.</p><p>Broader implementation of the HTTP message signatures scheme will lead to more secure digital interactions and a safer internet for all, so we have open-sourced our HTTP Signatures library for both MATTR customers and for the community at&nbsp;large.</p><p>The library is permissively open-source, and we believe it will help the community establish higher levels of security between web services and applications.</p><p>Open-sourcing the library also encourages interoperability and integration with the MATTR VII platform, making it more accessible for businesses of all shapes and&nbsp;sizes.</p> Get started <p>It’s easy to get started today.

<p>In this vlog, 1Kosmos’ Product Manager, Sheetal Elangovan, joins 1Kosmos’ CMO, Michael Cichon, to discuss how employee onboarding can be fixed with document verification and identity based authentication.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Right, hello, everybody. This is Michael Cichon, a chief marketing officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here today with a special guest, Sheetal Elangovan, a product manager at 1Kosmos. How are you, Sheetal?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Very well, Michael. How are you?</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
I’m good. And it’s special talking to you because we started at 1Kosmos on the very same day back in early 2021. So welcome to the vlog. I invited you here because I wanted to talk to you about onboarding.</p>
<p>If we could start with just employee onboarding, the typical process, what does it look like? All of us have been through this but step us through it.</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Absolutely. So if you look at onboarding at most organizations today, one of the biggest challenges that they’re handling is remote onboarding. It is a common problem across most organizations that you step into. And usually, there’s an HR person who you are in contact with.</p>
<p>The first step is to provide some documentation about yourself that helps the HR person establish your identity. In most cases, these government documents are being shared over email, fax, or an insecure medium to say the very least, right? Once these documents are in possession of the HR person, they’re being kept in a database and being processed by multiple parties within an enterprise. And after which you’re going through some manual verification before you get to the next step.</p>
<p>As an employee, after you’re cleared for verification, you go on to get an account, they provision you into your single sign-on applications or anything that you require access to. After which finally as an employee, you have to go ahead and set up your account with a password. Of course, you have to remember that you’re going to forget your password or have to make a call to the help desk before you can actually be fully set up. So that’s what employee onboarding looks like for most people today.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. So this is to comply with the employee eligibility requirements, but something very similar happens on the banking side of things. If I wanted to set up a bank account online, I’d have to make the same kind of identity-proofing process, correct?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Yes. You’ll have to go through extensive KYC processes before you get an account.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. So in either of these cases, we go to our go-to documents, our driver’s license and a passport is generally what we use. And I know from my experience, it’s generally either taking a picture and faxing this information or sharing it online. So, what are the drawbacks there?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Of course, the biggest drawback is, first of all, it’s going through an insecure channel, either email, fax, all of these are potential for hacks. And all of the sensitive information, you definitely don’t want it out there being exposed to any of the threats out there. So that is the biggest risk of having it out there.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
And then, of course, we’re all doing things more remote these days in the post-COVID era, we’re remote identity-proofing for new jobs remotely and then for our bank accounts. So everything’s going online, going digital. So what’s the way to improve this process?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
The definite way to improve this process from a user perspective is to make things easier for them to access with having good checks and balances in places. And for a business, you want to make sure that they are able to give the right people the right kind of access, and this is really where 1Kosmos steps in, right? We are able to help you prevent fraud right on day one by adding identity-proofing to the mix.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
What’s identity-proofing?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Identity-proofing is a way of verifying your identity. And identity verification begins with a government-issued document, not just one form of it, but using your government-issued document along with your biometric to make sure that you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>NIST provides a lot of guidelines today around digital identity and how a identity can be verified remotely. So we follow those standards and guidelines to go through identity verification.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay, so when we’re scanning a driver’s license, that driver’s license is then verified, correct?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Just scanning a driver’s license does not mean that you’re verified. We have to go ahead and make checks against that driver’s license, make sure that the document that’s being presented is a match with your biometric, your actual face, right? I don’t want to present your identity, Michael, so just making sure that that is in place.</p>
<p>And also, a lot of triangulation, right? It’s not just one form of document in place but triangulating information across different signals to make sure that you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. There’s 50 states, 50 driver’s license at least. I mean, there’s quite a few documents that you have to be able to verify, correct?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Yes, there are 50 states, 260 countries, different document types that we have to handle to really verify a user.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So obviously, 1Kosmos has solutions for this. So what is unique about the way 1Kosmos goes about identity-proofing and user onboarding?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
So the most unique thing about 1Kosmos when it comes to onboarding is that we are able to automate the entire process from identity verification, making sure that the user is who they are, to making sure that they are able to use that same information every day when they authenticate into their systems.</p>
<p>We are able to not just on day one, prove the identity of the user, but on day 10, day 360, we are able to leverage government-issued information that the user provided to make sure that who they say they are.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. So the old way of doing things, I take a picture, I scan it, the other side gets it somehow either on a fax or email, maybe they can’t read it, so I got to send it again, so it’s in my sent folder now, it’s in their inbox. The information exposed in this modern way of doing it. It’s encrypted end to end, correct?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Absolutely. So when it comes to the 1Kosmos journey, what does it really look like? We have a heavy focus on user experience, making sure that it’s the end user. It’s very an intuitive journey where we put you through… You receive a request from your HR person that tells you, “Hi, Michael, are you ready to onboard your go through this journey?”</p>
<p>The first step essentially is to verify your email followed by a phone number verification, and then you go on to present a government ID of choice. After that, we are able to do checks against the documents that were presented and then we determine your identity assurance level. How strongly can we state that you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>But the extremely unique thing about 1Kosmos is that we operate on the concept of having an identity wallet. So an identity wallet is a… Think of your wallet, but your wallet is in possession of you. We use cryptography behind the scenes to make sure that all of this information lives within your identity wallet and can only be accessed with your permission. And that just makes it that much more secure for a person because this is privacy by design in action, right? We’re making sure that the user is always in control of the information that they’re sharing.</p>
<p>From an employer perspective, it reduces the liability when they do not have to keep any of this information on their database. They just have to present the information. They just have to see that information. Identity verification is automated by us, so they just benefit end to end by using 1Kosmos as their identity-proofing provider and authentication service.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. Okay. Do you have something to show us? Can you show us how this works?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
So the process looks like this. So HR sends out an invite to a end user. Usually, this is their personal email address asking them to begin their onboarding process. So once they click on that particular link, they are asked to create an account. They go through their provided email address. Once their email address is provided, they go through an email verification to make sure that that email is in possession of them.</p>
<p>The next step is to go ahead and provide additional information about themselves, which is around account creation, having a verified phone number. So we go ahead, make sure that the user’s phone number is verified as well. Behind the scenes, we are able to perform device checks to make sure that the user is in possession of that particular device and that particular phone number for a certain period of time, just to make sure… It’s an additional signal in making sure that the user is who they say they are.</p>
<p>Once they complete that process, the next step really is to go through the identity wallet creation. We are one of the most unique players in this space leveraging the concept of an identity wallet just so that this identity wallet is in control of by the user. That is where all of their documents get stored. Driver’s license, passport, SSN, any of their sensitive information gets stored in their identity wallet. It can only be unlocked by the user.</p>
<p>Once they go ahead and set up their wallet with 1Kosmos, the next step is to go through a driver’s license, verification or really any government-issued document to begin with. The user is asked to leverage their mobile phone camera to go ahead and perform a scan off the document. They go through a scanning process to do the front, the back. And once they successfully get through that process, the next step is to make sure that there is a biometric verification, which is looking for a match between the photo in the driver’s license as well as the biometric that was provided at this time.</p>
<p>Once they’ve been able to pass that, we are able to add in an optional SSN verification check just to make sure that there is sufficient triangulation across different signals that we’ve been able to build up for this particular user. And once that’s done, we have all of this information ready within the user’s wallet.</p>
<p>At this point, the user can be redirected to an HR portal where they will be requested to present all of their documents. Mind you, they’ve already been through all of these checks with respect to identity-proofing, meaning they’ve been verified against third-party verifiers we’ve built signals about the user. Now, all they have to do is just present their information.</p>
<p>Once they consent to present all of this information, HR is able to receive the necessary information, or they can just receive the identity assurance level. We can authoritatively say, “This person is who they say they are based on government-issued documents, based on their biometric, and email, phone verification.” Once this is done, HR can go ahead and choose to go through any downstream processes to enable this users account.</p>
<p>Now, the other benefit with 1Kosmos is that on day one, you also can make sure that the authentication mechanism is set up. If they’ve successfully gone ahead and completed identity-proofing, you can make sure that on day one, as soon as they approved and been through sufficient systems, they can go ahead and log into any of the downstream applications.</p>
<p>That’s just a quick preview of what our remote onboarding looks like today.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, that’s pretty cool. You covered some of the benefits. I mean, I’ve done this with the driver’s license scan, and it takes a minute. Just when you think of all of the… Well, first of all, the privacy, right? The information is kept confidential, end to end, but then all the administrative work that it would take to normally vet somebody and prove their identity manually, you’re streamlining all of that. And then on the back end, you have this strong credential now, which the user has at their disposal with 99% facial match to access their systems and nobody else can access it because they’re not that person. That’s a pretty amazing product, Sheetal.</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Thank you for spending time with us today. Really appreciate it and keep up the great work in the product management team.</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Thank you. Thank you, Michael.</p>

 IDnow sits down with global advisor and investor in digital financial services, David Birch to discuss the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework, whether KYC is just a box-ticking exercise,&nbsp;and why regtech may become even more important than fintech in 2023. 



<p></p>



 Do you think the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework does enough to reassure British people of the benefits of digital identities? 



<p>Well, I’m sure the British people have never heard of the Framework and probably never will. If the government proposes a national digital identity, then there many well be considerable resistance, especially if it is made mandatory. However, the idea of a bank identity, a social security identity, a health identity and so on is a different story. If these are interoperable with the framework, I am sure that they will be accepted.</p>



 Speaking of which, what do you foresee as some of the main benefits and advantages in the use of digital identities in the UK? 



<p>A smoother, simpler online life with considerable cost-savings and an actual improvement in security. Remember that <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-kyc-risk/">fraud is the number 1 crime in the UK</a> today. I read recently of the case of an airline pilot caught using forged documents. He was flying for two years for two major airlines before this was discovered. A working digital identity infrastructure would stop this, and a thousand similar frauds going on every day.</p>



 With the creation of a solution comes the inadvertent creation of a new problem, so conversely what are some of the major risks associated with a digital identity future in the UK? 



<p>As always: confidentiality, integrity and availability. That last point needs particular focus: If you need a digital identity to open a bank account, open your office door or open a bottle of wine, then the infrastructure better be there! It would become an obvious target for agents of foreign powers. I wouldn’t want to find that I can’t start my car in the middle of Wales because I can’t get online to a blockchain or because my mobile phone has run out of battery!</p>

 What are some of the important things that service providers should look out for when choosing a digital identity solution provider? 



<p>At a high level, I would strongly distinguish between the provision of identification, authentication and authorization services. If you mean identification services, I would say the key requirement is for fully automated processing.</p>



 With Sanctions, AML/CTF, Fraud, and KYC departments often working in silos, how important is it for cross collaboration, especially in highly regulated markets?  



<p>I’m not an expert on the internal structure of financial organizations but to be honest I do see compliance and fraud as separate functions that respond to separate drivers. Organizations implement compliance because they are made to, whereas they implement anti-fraud measures because they want to.</p>



 KYC has traditionally been seen as a mere box-ticking measure, but considering how intertwined eKYC is with customer onboarding digital solutions, is that opinion set to change for both businesses and consumers? 



<p>KYC is a box ticking measure, that’s the point of it.</p>



 Will there ever come a time when a person’s digital identity becomes more valid, more secure, and more trustworthy than in-person validation? 



<p>We have already reached that point. You think the guy that asked to see my vaccine certificate at the airport today is an Israeli airport security-trained counterfeit documentation spotting genius? There is ample evidence that digital identity is more secure than analog identity. I saw a story in the newspapers recently about a guy who had taken his wife’s passport by mistake. It didn’t stop him from getting on the plane.</p>



 What are your predictions for the fintech and regtech space for 2023? 



<p>My top three would be: Firstly, for most of the companies I deal with, regtech has much more of an impact on the bottom line than fintech so with the economy going through difficult times, their focus will shift to cost-cutting via the former than new products or services via the latter; Secondly, that we will see the impact of open banking really begin to be felt as more and more embedded finance services (not all of them to do with money or payments) are launched; Thirdly, that the digital assets business (the tokenization of everything) will become mainstream and separate further from the “crypto” business.</p>



 Many predict that with the upcoming crypto regulations, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">TFR</a>, 2023 will be the “coming out” year for crypto assets. How do you think the industry will react? Will regulation have a positive impact on crypto businesses and consumers? 



<p>I agree with this view, but as I noted above, I distinguish between the digital asset business and the crypto asset business. They may well be built of the same technology, but they are not the same thing.</p>



 As the UK will not have to comply with EU crypto regulations, will that place UK cryptos at an advantage in the marketplace? 



<p>You need to ask a lawyer! I have no real idea what either the EU or UK’s crypto regulations will look like. I will, however, point toward the law society of England and Wales recent work on “digital objects”: this seems to me to be a good foundation.</p>

<p>The recent quick collapse of FTX, which not too long ago was one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has had a significant impact on the entire cryptocurrency market. On November 11, 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy which has wiped billions of dollars of value from the broader crypto markets. This event has led many people to understandably be concerned about investing in blockchain projects. </p><p>But it’s important that people first know that no $DOCK is held by FTX and our network will continue to operate without any impact from these events. We will continue to scale with many exciting updates coming in Q1 2023.</p><p>There are many unpredictable events and factors that can impact the overall market, but the important thing for long-term supporters is not to focus on the day-to-day prices of projects, but rather on the long-term utility and value that a project will bring to solve problems. </p><p>We held an AMA with Dock’s CEO Nick Lambert to answer questions and concerns from our community.</p><p>Question: To what extent have we been impacted by the bear markets? </p><p>I’ll first address what recently happened with FTX. While we’re not directly impacted by FTX’s downfall because Dock has never used FTX as an exchange, the entire industry will be affected.</p><p>For Dock, we’re focused a lot on good governance and financial management. One of the downsides of FTX is they didn’t have a board of directors. There was no one to look after the people running the company, giving them advice, and making sure they were making good judgment calls. </p><p>It’s understandable why people are nervous. At the end of the day, there has to be some element of trust in the people running companies. Structures need to be put in place to make sure that those individuals are held accountable to do things in responsible ways.</p><p>We spend a lot of time with our directors, lawyers, and accountants on the team making sure that when we make decisions, they are checked and verified by others to make sure we are doing things the way we should be. </p><p>To be sustainable, we’ve moved assets and spread our risk by holding a number of tokens. More recently, we’re putting more priority on holding assets that are not volatile like non-algorithmic stable coins and cash. We’re in a solid and stable position as the Dock team has not changed in size at all. We have a consistent team which is important for the continuous enhancement of the types of products we’re building.</p><p>Question: What are the most ambitious goals of the project in the future? &nbsp;</p><p>For Dock, the biggest goal is to become the largest independent entity and provider of identity and <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a>. We’re well-placed to become one of the market leaders.</p><p>Question: What is one of the main priorities on the roadmap?</p><p>The mobile wallet upgrade is the biggest focus in the next two months. We’re making a lot of enhancements to it including the storage and management of credentials by users. </p><p>Question: What kind of transformations and advancements can be done with the Dock network in the healthcare sector? &nbsp;</p><p>BurstIQ is using Dock’s Verifiable Credential technology. Their vision is to turn any piece of health data into a Verifiable Credential. Some of the most important features Verifiable Credentials have are that they are controlled by the holder or recipient of those credentials, tamper-resistant, and fraud-proof.</p><p>If you think about healthcare records being controlled by the holder, that becomes quite powerful because it moves us away from the current status quo where if you went to a local healthcare provider and they have your records, they decide what you see and who gets your record. If you turn healthcare records into Verifiable Credentials, it should be the case that you control that information, where it’s stored, and who gets to see it. This is a significant contribution that Verifiable Credentials and Dock’s partnership with BurstIQ will bring into the healthcare space. </p><p>We’re building other technologies including zero-knowledge proofs, anonymous credentials, and selective disclosure. Selective disclosure is enabling something to be proven without needing to reveal everything to prove that information. For example, you could use selective disclosure with your own medical records. If your doctor needs your blood type, then you can decide to just reveal the blood type only to give you maximum privacy and control over your data. Those are going to be some of the exciting things that we’ll see in the healthcare space.</p><p>Question: People want to know how we are expanding, what type of marketing strategies we’re doing to increase brand presence, and if we have strategic partnerships to help us grow.</p><p>There are 3 main aspects to our adoption strategy:</p>  Inbound marketing  <p>We produce a lot of content online so people who are interested in what we’re building as users or issuers can find out how Dock is doing things. If they’re interested, they’re getting in touch with us and we engage with them to see how we can help. </p><p>This has been the most effective strategy because when companies come to us first, they’re already interested in what we’re building and they’re pretty well-educated about what we do. </p>  Outbound marketing (more sales-led)  <p>We are picking industries where we know we provide value and reach out to companies to see if they’re interested in what we can offer. </p>  Integration with marketplaces  <p>There are many marketplaces for things like apps. But for B2B businesses, there are marketplaces for many things that some people may not be aware of. One example would be marketplaces that provide tools for developers to allow them to enable their users to authenticate and access their services like Auth0. </p><p>Auth0 is offering our <a href="https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/dock-web-3-id">Web3 ID</a> product for enabling private and secure access to systems using Verifiable Credentials. By being in that marketplace, we’re tapping into an entirely new audience and making them aware of what we’re building. </p><p>We’ll be looking at more marketplaces in the early new year. Another example is an API marketplace for developers to be aware of Dock and try our software. </p><p>Those are the main strategies we have for growing adoption.</p><p>Question: What type of strategies do you have to attract new investors? </p><p>Our main focus is to build things that have value that companies can come and use to get a business benefit. Individuals get the product benefits that make their life easier, more secure, and provide more privacy and control of their own data. If we build and market it in a really efficient way as a project, people will start to use it more and that value will spread in the ecosystem.</p><p>We’re not just trying to do some quick fix and run marketing campaigns without any real structure and innovation behind the company. We’re working as far away from that as possible because we want to bring long-term value in the ecosystem by providing solutions to organizations and individuals.</p><p>Question: Many people are not that aware of Web3. How do we pull more people to join Web3 for DIDs? </p><p>It comes down to user experience. We have to make new technology as easy and as good to use as the technology it’s replacing. And if it’s not then it won’t replace it. If you think about how much of a hassle it is to use a different web browser, it's annoying at the start and slower because you’re not familiar with it.</p><p>From the perspective of users, young people are much more privacy-conscious than the previous generation. I think as soon as these tools become great, they'll start to make that switch. They’ll start to recognize that their data is being used in a way that they might not agree with or consent to. &nbsp;</p><p>For companies, they’re wanting to be able to add value. It becomes more about making efficiencies where Web3 is better than some of the technologies. With Verifiable Credentials, you can issue a credential that the verifier doesn’t need to manually check if the credential is legitimate. For example, if an employer needs to check the authenticity of a university degree, they don’t have to phone up the university. They can simply check the verifiable presentation instantly in seconds and they can know who issued that credential. This verification process is much more efficient for businesses.</p><p>KYC is another relevant use case because every time we use centralized exchanges, we’re continually having to go through a KYC every time we sign up for a new exchange. Or even for exchanges we are members of, they may ask us to reverify. </p><p>Instead of having to go through that process every time, imagine if you go through the identity verification check just once and you’re issued a credential after that. So every time afterward that you’re asked to do an identity verification, all you have to do is send them a Verifiable Credential. This process is much more efficient for businesses and this can increase onboarding percentages quite massively while creating a better user experience by spending less time doing the verification process. </p><p>Businesses will adopt Web3 when they realize the benefits and efficiencies they’ll get from using this technology.</p><p>Question: We will be providing a white-label wallet where customers can have their own branded wallet. What are the advanced security features that will be provided in this white-label wallet app? </p><p>White labeling is a way for developers, companies, and projects that want to offer a mobile wallet app for their customers but don’t want to build it. They can take the essential components of the Dock wallet, switch some features on and off as they prefer, and rebrand it. Then they have a ready-to-go wallet. </p><p>Security features they would have included having custody of your own keys and credentials. You manage your own private keys with the wallet and no one else has ownership. No one can take those tokens away from you. </p><p>Another thing we built is the ability to log into the wallet with biometrics using facial recognition or a thumbprint, which is more secure than PINs and passwords. We’ve also enabled the ability to create an encrypted backup so in case a device gets lost, damaged, or stolen, you won’t lose access to your tokens or credentials. Everyone who has a Dock wallet should create a backup. </p><p>Question: Are validators selected randomly based on the amount of Dock tokens staked or a mix of both?</p><p>Validators are selected like in any Proof of Stake network. We have 2 types of validators: an active set that is actively validating and those waiting to become validators. </p><p>In an active set with Dock, there are 50 validators and the ones that will become active are the ones that have the most stake. We combine what the nomination or delegators are putting into that node (computer connected to the Web3 network) plus their own stake which gives you a total. The top 50 with the highest total are validating the network. The network itself is calculating and running elections which means that the active validator set could change based on how much stake each of those nodes has.</p><p>Question: A large percentage of investors are focused on the token price in the short term rather than the long term. Why should investors choose Dock and what are the advantages of holding the Dock coin in the long run? </p><p>It’s unfortunate that many people are focused on the short-term price, but that is the reality of the space right now. The motivation for holding Dock over the long term is that we’re building something of value with products that people are using today for commercial benefit and to make their lives better. </p><p>We have a strong team, we have paying clients, and we’re very focused. It’s just a case of scaling, growing, and to keep improving all of the time. </p><p>Question: We’ve been tracking the progress of soulbound tokens. I’ve seen many other projects getting involved with the Web3 identity space with soulbound-based products. Can you briefly explain how these tokens are different from Dock’s DIDs? What kind of similarities and differences are there to NFTs for example? </p><p>Some of the similarities are that they are both about identity. Soulbound tokens are non-transferable NFTs. Normally NFT ownership can be transferred and that is all recorded on the chain. But a soulbound NFT is intended to not be transferable. So once you get this token, it’s completely yours which makes it more effective for managing identity because identity is something you shouldn't be able to transfer. </p><p>The differences are that with Verifiable Credentials, a big aspect is that they are often off-chain. What is in the blockchain is the identifier of who issued the credential and who it is going to. A Verifiable Credential is usually held in the wallet of the holder and not on the blockchain. </p><p>Because soulbound NFTs are all on-chain, the information is there for everyone to see. Of course, because blockchains are unencrypted, you can view that information so it’s a lot less private for the individual. </p> Connect With Us Anytime<br> <p>If you have any questions about us or our projects, please reach out to us anytime at:</p>  <a href="mailto:marketing@dock.io">marketing@dock.io</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">Twitter</a>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/feW8KGf7r3">Discord</a>  <a href="https://t.me/dockio">Telegram</a>   Learn More About Dock   <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identifiers">Decentralized Identifiers</a>  <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/certificate-fraud">How to Prevent Certificate Fraud</a>  <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/supply-chain-fraud-blockchain">How to Prevent Supply Chain Fraud</a>  <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/what-are-digital-credentials">Digital Credentials</a>  <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity</a>

<p>La soluzione è stata realizzata in collaborazione con Swascan, parte del polo Tinexta Cyber</p>



<p>Roma, 28 novembre 2022 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, presenta il servizio Mail Defender, rivolto a PMI, professionisti e privati cittadini e sviluppato in collaborazione con Swascan, società di Tinexta Cyber, il polo italiano della cybersecurity.</p>



<p>Mail Defender garantisce all’utente il monitoraggio continuativo delle sue caselle email – tradizionali o PEC, indipendentemente da chi ne sia il provider – e segnala con appositi report mensili eventuali furti ed esposizioni fraudolente delle relative credenziali: in tal modo i titolari, consapevoli dell’accaduto, possono agire di conseguenza e assumere le opportune contromisure. In caso di episodi di compromissione, infatti, vengono suggeriti anche le possibili azioni di Remediation.</p>



<p>Mail Defender è fruibile completamente online al costo massimo di 1 euro + IVA al mese a casella (con canone annuale).</p>



<p>È da evidenziare come il servizio, basato su tecnologia proprietaria Swascan, ricerchi, selezioni e analizzi costantemente un vastissimo elenco di fonti presenti non solo negli ambienti di dominio pubblico della Rete, ma anche in quelli “chiusi” del Deep e del Dark Web.</p>



<p>La dimensione della minaccia è testimoniata dai dati: secondo il “Rapporto Clusit 2021 sulla sicurezza ICT in Italia” gli attacchi BEC (Business Email Compromise) e EAC (Email Account Compromise) sono risultati il principale reato nel 2020, causando perdite per oltre 1,8 miliardi di dollari (FBI, “2020 Internet Crime Report”), pari al 44% di tutte quelle subite da aziende e consumatori nell’anno.</p>



<p>“Quali artefici e fautori della “fiducia digitale”, in InfoCert siamo da sempre attenti alla sicurezza. Oggi, con l’escalation di minacce informatiche di varia natura, è indispensabile moltiplicare gli sforzi in quest’ambito anche rendendo disponibili soluzioni e servizi complementari alla nostra offerta e in grado di rispondere alle sempre più forti esigenze di cybersecurity in contesti business e non solo.</p>



<p>Mail Defender, in particolare, indirizza un rischio più che mai concreto e che non può essere ignorato, visto il ruolo preponderante dell’email non solo per la trasmissione di comunicazioni sensibili, ad esempio con le banche, ma anche per la registrazione, l’accesso e la gestione dei propri social media in ambiti professionali e privati. Ma sappiamo anche che è ancora l’errore umano la causa principale delle violazioni di sicurezza informatica ed è per questo che investiremo anche per rendere disponibili sul nostro portale corsi di formazione sulla cybersecurity rivolti a cittadini e aziende” – afferma Marco Lauro – Chief Digital Sales &amp; Customer Experience Officer di InfoCert – Tinexta Group.</p>



<p>“L’identità digitale è oramai inscindibile dalla nostra quotidianità professionale e personale. Il dilagare del cyber crime, sicuramente accelerato dalle condizioni di lavoro da remoto diffuso, create dalla pandemia, ha aumentato notevolmente la quantità e l’intensità di data breach e incidenti informatici. Mail Defender nasce proprio per scongiurare i rischi posti da una potenziale mail compromessa – da possibili account takeover fino a tutte le forme di social engineering – e lo fa grazie alla tecnologia proprietaria di Threat Intelligence Swascan e all’expertise di InfoCert.”, spiega Pierguido Iezzi, CEO di Swascan, parte del polo cyber di Tinexta Group.</p>



<p>L’impegno di InfoCert nell’area della cybersecurity si concretizza nella proposta di soluzioni e servizi spesso frutto di partnership con le realtà ad alta specializzazione del Gruppo Tinexta.</p>



<p>Ad esempio, l’offerta – sempre in collaborazione con Swascan – di servizi sia di formazione su temi della cybersecurity sia di sicurezza predittiva, preventiva e proattiva contro le minacce informatiche. O, ancora, la soluzione Legalmail Security Premium, nata dalla partnership con Yoroi, altra società di Tinexta Cyber, che consente ai clienti di Legalmail – il servizio di Posta Elettronica Certificata di InfoCert – di bloccare le comunicazioni sospette e neutralizzarne gli elementi malevoli prima della consegna del messaggio.</p>

 Upgradable and easy-to-deploy ERC3643 V4 for tokenized securities 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in november 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>In the midst of the FTX chaos,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/why-ftxs-catastrophe-could-have-a-positive-impact-on-the-tokenization-industry/">we shared our views</a>&nbsp;on its impact on the tokenization industry. Like many builders in this space, we continue to develop solutions to solve market problems. And today, we are excited to announce the&nbsp;launch of the version 4 of the ERC3643 smart contracts, providing upgradability and easy deployment for tokenized securities.</p>
<p>The code of a smart contract cannot be changed once it has been deployed on a blockchain. This is a huge concern for securities issuers, as they need to have full control over their digital securities. As regulations and business needs evolve, additional logic must be added and being able to fix potential vulnerabilities is essential. Therefore,&nbsp;issuers of tokenized securities must be able to upgrade their smart contracts.</p>
<p>To this end, the new version of ERC3643 is made upgradable through the use of the proxy method.&nbsp;A proxy contract delegates its logic to an implementation contract, so it can be ‘upgraded’ by pointing to a new implementation contract.</p>
<p>The ERC3643 V4 points the token logic to a central contract called Implementation Authority. This contract stores the address of the implementation contract. To update the smart contract,&nbsp;the owner can set the address of the new version of the implementation contract&nbsp;and the token will adopt the new logic of this contract. Furthermore, multi-token issuers can point all tokens to the same Implementation Authority contract so that upgrades are automatically applied to all their tokens simultaneously.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>In addition to upgradability, issuers or their authorized agents can leverage&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-onchain-factory/">Onchain Factory</a> to automate the&nbsp;deployment of the entire ERC3643 suite in 1 single blockchain transaction.&nbsp;The ownership of the smart contracts is given directly to the chosen stakeholder during the deployment, eliminating the dependency on any third-party. Finally, with Onchain Factory, a token can keep the same token address across all EVM blockchains for simpler multi-chain operations. This drastically reduces the dependency on a single blockchain network.</p>
<p>The release of ERC3643 V4 is our latest contribution to the standardization of tokenization for capital markets. These upgrades are open source. By making sure that the main token standard for security tokens is always up-to-date with the latest innovations, we accelerate the growth of the ecosystem. Furthermore, to ensure the highest level of security,&nbsp;ERC3643 V4 smart contracts are currently being audited by prestigious firms.&nbsp;The results will be shared publicly once they are available.</p>

 Why is personal data so valuable? <p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>Everyone knows data is incredibly valuable. After all, many of today’s biggest, richest and most powerful organisations get their riches and power from their ability to amass and leverage huge amounts of data. But what is it, exactly, that makes data so valuable?</p><p>If you ask that question today, it’s surprising how uninformative the resulting discussion is. Very often it quickly veers off on a tangent, to a different question entirely: “how to put a money price on data and create a market for it?”. Or people start repeating cliches such as “data is the new oil” — a cliche that tells us that, economically speaking, data is important without ever actually saying&nbsp;why.</p> Back to&nbsp;basics <p>To understand the economic value of personal data we need to go back to basics: to what it enables people and organisations to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Why has oil been so economically valuable? Because it’s been a key source of energy that provides the heat, light and motion upon which our civilisation is based. Look around you. Anywhere, everywhere, you’ll see oil at work in the form of heat (and refrigeration), light and motion. We need these things for virtually everything we want to&nbsp;do.</p><p>What is data’s equivalent of heat, light and motion? Here is the answer which, strangely, you won’t find anywhere except in this blog; which is almost universally ignored in debates about personal data, resulting in the building of countless castles of speculation that rest on foundations of&nbsp;sand.</p><p>Understanding this answer is important because it acts as a sort of filter and North Star that helps us assess the many contradictory claims and arguments that are made about personal data. It helps us distinguish between smoke and mirrors, snake oil and practical realities and opportunities.</p><p>Data provides us with reliability and surprise.</p><p>Like oil’s heat, light and motion, reliability and surprise lie at the heart of countless things every person and organisation do every day without fail: make decisions and implement them. To make good decisions and to implement them well we need information that is reliable and surprising (e.g. which keeps us up to date with a changing&nbsp;world).</p><p>Just how economically important these two contributions of reliability and surprise are, only really becomes apparent when they are&nbsp;absent.</p><p>If you know a piece of information is reliable, you can rely on it to make a decision and to implement your decision. If a piece of information tells you something you didn’t know before (a surprise, in other words) that means you can keep your decisions and actions in tune with what’s needed, rather than getting out of&nbsp;kilter.</p><p>Now consider what happens if these things are absent. If you are not confident that your information is reliable you have to stop what you are doing to get information you can rely on or check the accuracy of the data you are given. This causes delays and creates extra effort. You also have to invest time and effort, not in doing what you want to do, but in getting the information you need to do what you want to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Unreliable data also creates risks of error (resulting in wasted resources) and damage, which also add cost and waste. If you spill milk, you not only waste your milk, you have to spend time and effort clearing it up — time and effort you could spend more productively doing other&nbsp;things.</p><p>Surprises are information that is new to you, and which can therefore change how you act. A key part of every organisation’s activities is the methods it uses to gather such new information. Today, for example, forms are ubiquitous. Nowadays we have to fill in a form (in some form) to do anything we want online. These forms gather information that is new to the organisation in question (even though this information might not be new to other parties), and this new information is then used to deliver a service. Without this new information, the service either cannot be delivered, or cannot be delivered as efficiently or effectively as it&nbsp;could.</p><p>If you lack access to the right ‘surprises’ your decisions and actions get out of kilter with what’s needed. This means that all the time, money and effort that goes into making these decisions and implementing them risks being&nbsp;wasted.</p><p>In other words, without reliable and surprising data everything we do gets burdened with huge amounts of extra work, delays, errors and risks and all the costs associated with&nbsp;them.</p> FERC busting <p>Without reliability and surprise huge amounts of time, energy, material resources, effort and money is wasted doing unproductive things. We call this FERC, which stands for Friction, Effort, Risk and&nbsp;Cost.</p><p>This is true of both non-personal and personal data but o<a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">ur Paper</a> shows how these two sources of data’s value — reliability and surprise — lie at the heart of new economic revolution revolving around personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Today’s data systems operate with a design flaw at their heart: the siloed, organisation-centric database which is designed to make sure data is NOT shared. This means that reliable, surprising data that could be shared and used to avoid FERC never gets shared. The result is layer upon layer, upon layer, of FERC embedded into our economic system works, suffocating its potential and weighing it down with unnecessary costs.</p><p>It affects every individual and household trying to manage their lives, and every service that deals with identifiable individuals, including public administration and services in both central government and local government, financial services (banking, insurance, etc) health and social care, education, charities and the third sector, retail, transport, leisure, media and entertainment. Economically, it is pivotal to the workings of 80% of the economy (basically, ‘services’), affecting every man, woman and child and every household.</p><p>The new personal data logistics infrastructure built by Mydex provides a very efficient way for individuals to collect, store and share data about themselves easily, safely and in a way that ensures data protection and privacy. It helps ensure the reliability and surprises that people and organisations need to manage their affairs better, opening up the possibility of a new productivity and innovation miracle along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>This is why fixing personal data logistics — in how it is verified, gathered, stored and shared — is one way of fixing the economy&nbsp;itself.</p><p>The third blog in this series explains&nbsp;how.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data&nbsp;Delusion</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-personal-data-economically-valuable-927e8c7cd51">Why is personal data economically valuable?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Ontology’s ongoing mission to deliver Web3 to the&nbsp;people <blockquote>Time is a great writer and will give everyone the perfect&nbsp;ending.</blockquote><blockquote>- Chaplin</blockquote><p>If you had to describe the fifth year of Ontology’s deep dive into the Web3 world, it’s hard to see past the “OWN Infrastructure” as one of the most important achievements. Like the smooth indent on a rock, resulting from years of dripping water, Ontology has steadily been carving out its Web3 ecosystem. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary, we invite you to join us on a recap of Ontology’s journey to build the infrastructure necessary to make Web3 accessible to&nbsp;all.</p> Foundation of the public chain&nbsp;platform <p>The high-performance and scalable underlying public chain is the foundation of the entire ecosystem and directly affects the subsequent trust ecosystem construction. Therefore, since its inception, Ontology has focused on building this underlying infrastructure, building a universal platform, and developing the first batch of smart contract blockchains with an identity&nbsp;system.</p> Summary of major technical events: <blockquote>In 2017, Ontology released the first phase white&nbsp;paper;</blockquote><blockquote>In 2018, Ontology MainNet version 1.0 was launched successfully;</blockquote><blockquote>In 2019, Ontology launched its own sharding&nbsp;design;</blockquote><blockquote>In 2020, Ontology MainNet version 2.0 was officially launched;</blockquote><blockquote>In 2021, Ontology started developing Ontology&nbsp;EVM;</blockquote><blockquote>In 2022, Ontology EVM was officially launched.</blockquote><p>In the background of these major milestones, Ontology has developed the Triones consensus system and introduced a new consensus mechanism, the VBFT algorithm, to optimize network TPS while ensuring security. Ontology MainNet version 2.0 integrates Layer 2 technology, based on Optimistic Rollup methods, provides scalability for the network to further increase network&nbsp;speed.</p><p>Today, Ontology’s mature construction of the underlying public chain has reached maturity. It has successfully built itself into a high-performance, low-cost blockchain platform that continues to provide a building platform for decentralized applications (dApps).</p> Building the Identity&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ontology’s original intention and vision has always been to build the infrastructure and tools for Web3 based on decentralized identity and data solutions. Therefore, the construction of identity and data-related protocols has been a central theme throughout. The OWN (Ontology’s Web3 Network) Infrastructure represents the corresponding protocol layers around this identity and data&nbsp;core.</p><p>In 2017, Ontology joined DIF (Global Decentralized Identity Alliance), an authoritative organization in the field of decentralized identity&nbsp;(DID).</p><p>In 2018, the Ontology DID specification was incorporated into the specification group by the Internet authority W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).</p><p>In 2019, two Ontology standard proposals were approved by the well-known technical society IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers).</p><p>In 2020, Ontology launched the on-chain self-management credit scoring system&nbsp;OScore.</p><p>In 2021, Ontology launched the <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a> identity framework suite, ONT Login and ONT&nbsp;TAG.</p><p>In 2022, the Ontology OWN Infrastructure further optimized the identity protocol layer and continues to provide a full set of protocols and tools based on ONT ID, including but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Ontology VC SDK series DID tools, which includes 2 categories in 2 development languages ​​and a total of 4 sets of&nbsp;tools;  <a href="https://mercury.ont.id/">Mercury</a>, a secure, trustless, communication protocol for Web3 applications;  <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>, a trustless universal authenticator for websites and applications;  <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a>, the decentralized solution for online identity verification.  <p>At present, these can be smoothly connected to various blockchain networks and Web2/Web3 applications, saving the time and cost of identity system development for developers.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that in addition to building its own decentralized identity specification, Ontology also continues to build suitable identity solutions for other public chain projects, such as Ethereum, NEAR, NEO, Tron, Klaytn, BNB Chain and Polkadot, deploying cross-chain decentralized identity solutions to further expand the decentralized identity ecosystem.</p> Applications Land on&nbsp;Ontology <p>Nothing represents Web3 better than the applications that are built on it. When designing Web3 infrastructure it is essential to remove barriers for developers and users alike, ensuring accessibility. The OWN Infrastructure has been designed, built, and continuously improved to make the building of applications as easy as possible.</p><p>In 2018, Ontology built <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a> to provide users with a multi-chain digital asset management tool, whilst integrated Web3 dApps to provide users with a comprehensive, and barrier-free, the experience of the blossoming Web3 environment.</p><p>In 2019, the Web3 Gateway ONTO Wallet integrated the ONT ID to provide users with decentralized identity registration. Ontology also provided the <a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a> reputation system for <a href="http://wing.finance">Wing Finance</a>, the first cross-chain DeFi project integrating credit elements, assisting them in successfully creating an undercollateralized lending function, and provided strong support for credit products on the platform through the credit evaluation module.</p><p>In 2020, Ontology and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler Mobility reached a partnership to jointly develop MoveX, the first blockchain-based platform for the automotive and transportation industry, and successfully released the “Welcome Home”&nbsp;app.</p><p>2021 was Ontology’s “harvest year”. Following years of sowing the seeds of success, Ontology reached cooperation with multiple web application platforms, both Web2 and Web3 native, including the global freelance market leader MicroWorkers and the next-generation music streaming platform ROCKI, using the ONT ID identity framework for users, providing secure and trusted decentralized login.</p><p>At the same time, Ontology ONT ID provided the Web3 reputation protocol <a href="https://www.orangeprotocol.io/">Orange</a> with trusted identity data based on self-sovereignty, and based on this provided accurate reputation reports and more solutions for Web3 individual users, communities and projects.</p><p>In 2022, in order to realize the large-scale application of network and decentralized identity solutions, Ontology set up a special fund of tens of millions of dollars, and jointly held a hackathon with DoraHacks, the largest developer community in Web3, bringing more developers to work on applications built on the Ontology infrastructure.</p><p>As of today, the number of ONT ID users has exceeded 1.6 million, making it one of the most widely used decentralized identity solutions in the Web3&nbsp;field.</p> Compatible, Interoperable, and Symbiotic <p>Web3 is heading towards the interconnection of a plethora of chains. Compatibility and interoperability are the inevitable choices of decentralization, and the same is true for OWN Infrastructure. To achieve&nbsp;this:</p><p>In 2019, Ontology launched the first cross-chain TestNet — Wasm&nbsp;TestNet;</p><p>In 2020, Ontology launched multiple virtual machines and supported three smart contracts: native, Neo, and&nbsp;Wasm;</p><p>In 2021, Ontology started to develop EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and launched the&nbsp;TestNet;</p><p>In 2022, the EVM virtual machine officially launched on the Ontology&nbsp;MainNet.</p><p>So far, the Ontology public chain has become the public chain platform that supports most types of smart contracts and has achieved seamless interoperability with the Ethereum platform, providing developers with a more familiar and friendly development environment.</p><p>At the same time, the decentralized identity solution built by Ontology can be seamlessly integrated into different applications and platforms. User identity and behavior data can be stored on the local client or trusted cloud platform and can be logged into and migrated from different platforms with the ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Based on this, Ontology OWN Infrastructure will realize the seamless flow of users, applications, and data between different platforms, and meet the necessary conditions for the interconnection of Web3&nbsp;chains.</p> Continuing Moving&nbsp;Forward <p>Taking “decentralized identity” as an edge and supporting it with technical strength, Ontology is building its own world in the turbulent Web3 universe and also building a performance stage for a group of enthusiasts who love decentralized identity and pursue network security and privacy protection.</p><p>Five years have passed, and Ontology has completed the module construction and combination of OWN Infrastructure. Today, the stage is quite large, and there will be further performances of wonderful things that belong to Web3. However, we cannot stop there. Ontology will still stick to its original vision and mission, continue to provide infrastructure and landing applications for the Web3 trust ecosystem, and finally achieve a trustless and credible decentralized world.</p><p>The future of Web3 is bright, and the required building of a trust ecosystem is inevitable.</p><p>For the next five years, we look forward to being with you in the ever-improving and prosperous Web3.</p> About <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/building-decentralized-society-own-your-value-c5be7088ac95">OWN Infrastructure</a> <p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of blockchain protocols and products that provides the much-needed tools to create an interconnected, interoperable global blockchain ecosystem.

  The Annual ‘No Money for Terror Conference” was held in New Delhi, India, on the 18th and 19th of November, 2022.  Nearly 450 delegates from across the world, including Ministers and Heads of Multilateral organizations, such as the FATF President, participated in the conference to discuss ways of enhancing global cooperation to deny finances to terrorists.  Special importance was given to discussing the use of crypto assets in terror financing as the Union Home Minister of the Organizing Country pointed towards the transformation of Terrorism from Dynamite to Metaverse.  <p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global anti-money laundering watchdog, has been raising concerns about the illicit use of virtual assets, such as terrorist financing and money laundering, for quite some&nbsp;time.</p><p>The all-powerful G20, too, expanded its support to FATF when it issued globally binding standards to prevent the misuse of virtual assets and terrorist financing.</p><p>For instance, in June 2019, it was decided in the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting that there is a pressing need to remain vigilant to the issues of “consumer and investor protection, anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism” through crypto assets. And NMFT, or the “No Money for Terror Conference,” has been a concrete step taken towards that vigilance mechanism.</p><p>This year, too, FATF President Raja Kumar urged countries to strengthen their anti-illicit finance measures and tackle this menace on a priority basis, citing the increasing use of shell companies and crypto assets for activities detrimental to the&nbsp;world.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/FATFNews/status/1591505094960373760?s=20&amp;t=H98v9FGtqAH1jhq4-cZFXg">Image Source</a>) No Money for&nbsp;Terror <p>Started as an initiative of the French Government in 2018 to strengthen cooperation between countries to stop terror funding, the “No Money for Terror” conference completed its third year in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The first such conference happened in Paris in 2018, and the second was in Melbourne, Australia, in 2019. Then, it got postponed for the next two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The third conference happened in New Delhi, India, in the third week of November 2022, and delegates from 72 countries and 15 international organizations attended the “No Money for Terror” conference in New&nbsp;Delhi.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/industry-reps-propose-decentralized-vasp-discovery-system-at-v20-summit">Industry Reps Propose Decentralized VASP Discovery System at V20&nbsp;Summit</a></p> Core Discussion Areas <p>Although the organizing country, India, was hoping to build “understanding and cooperation amongst nations” on the issue of international terrorism and its zero-tolerance policy against it, the discussion themes covered a lot more&nbsp;ground.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/FATFNews/status/1593664931936849921?s=20&amp;t=1Sv_21s65SNEu_yN34iYng">Image Source</a>)<p>A total of four sessions took place during the conference, which included discussions on global trends in terrorism and terrorist funding, the use of formal and informal channels to fund terrorism, the role of emerging technologies in terrorism financing, and the need for international cooperation to address and combat these challenges.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/sec-undertakes-significant-enforcement-actions-in-the-crypto-space">SEC undertakes “Significant Enforcement Actions” in the Crypto&nbsp;Space</a></p> The Role of Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>The conference held a special meeting of the UN Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee to discuss the financing of terrorist activities through cryptocurrency.</p><p>India’s National Investigation Agency expressed suspision that the UN-sanctioned terrorist organization D-Company has been using the darknet and cryptocurrencies to deploy the proceeds of the money it has criminally laundered.</p><p>The Union Home Minister of India, Mr. Amit Shah pointed towards the curious transformation of terrorism from “dynamite to metaverse” and “AK 47 to virtual&nbsp;assets.”</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/AmitShah/status/1593917810320629761?s=20&amp;t=e5BJ6hg0lXrMKPN-LCgidw">Image Source</a>)<p>“There is an increase in the use of virtual assets like cryptocurrency, and we need to understand the patterns of these darknet activities and find their solutions,” highlighted Mr&nbsp;Shah.</p><p>However, the reports published by Chainalysis do not paint such a grim picture.

After all, without it, malicious actors can exploit the loopholes created by the lack of unity on Travel Rule adoption and circumvent whatever measures individual countries have implemented against the illicit use of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>And once the Travel Rule is in force in a majority of countries, Travel Rule Solutions, such as Shyft Veriscope, will play a key role in keeping sanctioned entities and malicious actors out of the global crypto ecosystem. With this, we will finally put an end to the fears that cryptocurrencies today have become the most-probable means to launder illicit funds throughout the&nbsp;world.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Paul Fisher</a></p>Organizations that fail to secure access to resources are at risk of suffering from cyberattacks, data loss or compliance failure. As the market grows and business demands become more acute, vendors are innovating to provide secure authentication for dynamic access to resources in the cloud and elsewhere. Traditional IAM platforms rely on password technologies for authentication, but these are now challenged by the demands of rapid delivery, high velocity IT environments. Beyond Identity was founded in 2019 and offers identity and authentication solutions in three critical operational areas: workforce ID management, customer ID management and DevOps ID management. This paper analyzes its software platform for managing identities within DevOps and other rapid coding environments - some of the most exciting yet difficult parts of modern digital organizations to secure.

			  Sefa Kotancılar is a Front-end developer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>I am Sefa, Front-end Developer for Tokeny. I was born and raised in Bursa and graduated from Turkish Military Academy as an army aviation officer. I started my professional life as a helicopter pilot and later pursued my career in web development. I am also a devoted husband and father of one adorable baby boy.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny? 
<p>I worked as a pilot for five years but chose to switch to web development as I have always been interested in programming. I took courses and tutorials about web development. After studying intensively for several months, I became a freelance web developer for small and medium-sized local enterprises. Nonetheless, I was on the lookout for a more exciting full-time job opportunity, and a friend of mine referred me to Tokeny.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It has been a dream working for Tokeny as it is an environment where each member is being cooperative and respected. Usually, thinking about work makes me sick, but working here is an absolute pleasure as I have amazing colleagues. It’s like a second home to me.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Well, I can’t pinpoint anything. I want to make sure to be a better person, travel and explore around and always find new ways to learn, never losing the sense of curiosity.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>What I can dream of is to end greed and corruption around the world, making this world a better place for future generations. I know it’s kind of a far-fetched idea, but let’s see.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>Tokeny has already established itself as a leading company. I know it has many more exciting projects coming ahead.</p>

 Getting social — together. <p>Social communication is one of the main ways that different subjects transmit and feedback social information. From pigeon post in the ancient times, letters in modern times, to social App essentials on our mobile phones today, people’s needs and realization methods of social communication are constantly updated and&nbsp;changed.</p><p>The Web2 social track has been around for many years and as such has matured. In order to attract more traffic and improve user engagement, hard work and development may have become a way for major applications to stand out in an ocean of social apps, such as adding various value-added functions to form their own ecological closed-loop.</p><p>However, with the rise of Web3, social apps seem to be optimizing in another direction.</p><p>On October 27, 2022, Elon Musk successfully completed the acquisition of Twitter, and began a series of radical changes. Due to his view of “building Twitter into a decentralized social application” before the acquisition, the public, especially in Web3 circles, have paid special attention to the subsequent transformation of Twitter, which has also triggered various discussions on the future development direction of Web2 social products.</p><p>Previously, Twitter has tried many things on linked to Web3, such&nbsp;as:</p><p>· In January 2022, it announced its support for using NFT as a profile&nbsp;picture</p><p>· In February 2022, it announced its support for BTC and ETH for tipping&nbsp;creators</p><p>· In November 2022, a trailer announced plans to develop an encrypted wallet.</p><p>Also this year, social media site Reddit tried its hand at NFT, releasing its first official avatar NFT in April 2022, and a second batch in October, which quickly sold out within 24&nbsp;hours.</p><p>In order to expand the buying group and optimize the buying process, Reddit specifically avoided using Web3 proper terms such as “NFT”, “key” and “address” when designing its own NFT series purchasing process, and chose to use the familiar “account password registration” method for users to create and purchase, greatly reducing the barrier to purchase.</p><p>Other social media outlets have also launched NFT exploration programs, such as Instagram, which launched the combined NFT function internal testing in May this&nbsp;year.</p><p>However, despite this process of Web2 social products embracing Web3, we find that due to the limitations of product architecture, these social tools can only stay at the compatible level of profile picture display and payment methods, and cannot solve one of the biggest problems existing in the current social software, that is, the risk of users’ privacy data being infringed.</p><p>From this perspective, perhaps new Web3 social products may be able to build and improve trusted social relationships on the basis of protecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Lens Protocol is a decentralized, underlying protocol for building Web3 social relationships. It records the relationship between addresses, such as following, forwarding, and liking, in the form of NFT, ensuring the ownership of data and greatly enhancing the feasibility of connecting subsequent products to Lens ecology. For&nbsp;example:</p>  Lenster, the “Twitter” of the Lens ecosystem, based on the existing functions of Twitter, supports decentralized data client login, ENS domain name authentication, encrypted private message chat backed by XMTP protocol, music type NFT identification, and other deep blockchain technical functions.  Lenstube, the “Youtube” and “TikTok” of the Lens ecosystem, focuses on video social networking, supporting personalized operations such as uploading videos, limiting the objects and number of people to collect videos, etc. The project also announced the development of live-streaming and music social products in the&nbsp;future.  <p>Farcaster defines itself as an “adequate” decentralized product for the underlying protocols of social networking, designed to build a portable social identity. While a user’s identity is stored on the Ethereum chain, other data, such as private messages, are stored in Farcaster Hubs, a server under the chain that allows users to fully control their identity, social connections and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Like Lens Ecosystem, Farcaster users currently have to be invited to use it. And because of its open protocol nature, the Farcaster ecosystem is expanding rapidly — dozens of projects have been built on the Farcaster network.</p><p>The DeBox project is more like the Web3 version of “enterprise wechat”, because it also has enterprise community management, moments and wallet payment functions. Community managers must hold the designated NFT issued by DeBox to create communities and review content. This not only improves the practicability of NFTs, but also raises the threshold of community management to ensure the professionalism of communities.</p><p>Web2 social products are well developed, and have successfully cultivated deep user habits. This also presents a dilemma for Web3 social products: how to break through the user’s inherent thinking and accept certain product innovation?</p><p>In reference to the current product development of the Web3 social track, the author believes that the following two points should be paid attention to in the future development:</p>  “Backward compatibility”, that is to support all functions of the current Web2 social products and transplant the social data of traditional users.  Avoid “formalism”, which means decentralization for decentralization’s sake, such as storing all data on the chain at no cost, and forcing a large number of blockchain professional processes (such as mnemonic verification) that make it more difficult for users to&nbsp;operate.  <p>In an ideal situation, Web3 social applications should be able to carry the accumulated data of users in Web2 to realize identity verification compatible with both Web2 and Web3, so as to ensure that the ownership of data is returned to users in the case of the authenticity of the account, and realize the core characteristics of independent data ownership, friendly process use, and reasonable product&nbsp;design.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-tech-viewpoint-web2-vs-web3-what-will-happen-with-the-development-of-social-tools-14feab87f166">Ontology Tech Viewpoint | Web2 vs. Web3: What will happen with the development of social tools?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is the first of a series of blogs exploring the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>In the 19th century, the medical profession was united in its belief that to maintain health, it was necessary to balance ‘humours’ such as blood and other bodily fluids. If someone got ill, the doctor’s first port of call was bloodletting by, for example, applying leeches to suck blood out of the person’s&nbsp;body.</p><p>Whatever the disease, bloodletting provided a universal answer. One British medical text recommended it for acne, asthma, cancer, cholera, coma, convulsions, diabetes, epilepsy, gangrene, gout, herpes, indigestion, insanity, jaundice, leprosy, ophthalmia, plague, pneumonia, scurvy, smallpox, stroke, tetanus, tuberculosis, and for some one hundred other diseases.</p><p>Many doctors believed that the real benefits of bloodletting only kicked in when the patient neared fainting point. George Washington turned to bloodletting to cure a sore throat. He died after losing 3.75 litres of&nbsp;blood.</p><p>Today we look back to those times with shocked disbelief. How could they be so deluded? Yet at the time, few people even thought of challenging the received wisdom. ‘Everyone’ just ‘knew’ this was the right thing to do. Who were they to question the combined wisdom and experience of the medical establishment? After all, weren’t these demonstrably sober, intelligent, respected, well-meaning people committed to finding the best ways to ensure our&nbsp;health?</p> What’s at&nbsp;stake <p>We think we are better and wiser now. But are&nbsp;we?</p><p>This week we publish a new White Paper called <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>. Its core message is this: the economic theories and practices currently used to explain the potential of personal data have about as much validity as the received wisdoms of 19th century doctors. No matter how sober, intelligent, respected and well-meaning today’s data experts may be, they are working to the wrong mental model, looking for the wrong solutions in the wrong places. Now, we urgently need to break free from their mind-fogging dogmas.</p><p>A huge amount is at stake. Data is now the pivotal resource of modern economies. Like energy, it’s an input into virtually every economic activity you can think of. Personal data is key to the delivery of around 80% of all economic activities — services that deal with individuals (e.g. public administration, finance, health, education, retail&nbsp;etc).</p><p>So whether personal data’s potential is unleashed or suffocated matters to every single one of us and to the future of our economy as a whole. We know from experience the pain and trauma that’s caused when the price of a universal input such as energy rises&nbsp;rapidly.</p><p>If this design flaw could be fixed, the costs of another universal input — data — could be reduced by amounts similar to the cost increases currently being experienced in&nbsp;energy.</p><p>Today, huge personal, social and economic opportunities are being blocked, and immense amounts of cost and waste are being generated, daily, by a design flaw that sits at the very heart of how our society collects and uses personal data. This design flaw is the organisation-centric database: a design flaw that concentrates power in the hands of a few large organisations, which excludes citizens from participating in the workings of the data economy, and which creates the blockages and costs we’ve just mentioned.</p> Data delusions <p>Our <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">White Paper</a> shows how and why this is possible. It also show how current mental models about personal data are rendering this opportunity invisible.</p><p>If you believe a person’s health rests on the balance of their (non-existent) humours, you won’t give a moment’s thought to protecting them from germs. You’ll waste inordinate amounts of time, money and effort doing the wrong, useless things while not doing anything that actually achieves positive results. That, unfortunately, is where we are right now with the economics of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Current wild goose chases include a misguided love affair with artificial intelligence and ‘Big Data’, an absurd fixation on the ‘insights’ they are supposed to generate, the futile quest to find a non-existent ‘balance’ between privacy and the uses of data for innovation, and an equally futile quest to put a money value on personal data and to create markets so that it can be traded like any other commodity.</p><p>They are modern equivalents of bloodletting. All of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Our Paper asks two simple questions:</p>  Why is personal data economically valuable and where does this value come&nbsp;from?  How best to unleash this&nbsp;value?  <p>For most people, we suspect the answers will be completely unexpected, because they come from a completely unexpected quarter — empowering citizens with their&nbsp;data.</p><p>You wouldn’t think that empowering citizens with their data could unleash an economic transformation as big and far-reaching as that unleashed by mass production and national electricity grids in the first decades of the 20th century. But it can, delivering a once-in-a-century cost-reducing, productivity, quality and innovation revolution — if, that is, we can see the opportunity for what it&nbsp;is.</p> Wild goose&nbsp;chases <p>This revolution will:</p>  NOT be led or driven by huge big tech organisations but by citizens being empowered with their own data, initially in public services.  NOT come from ever larger agglomerations of ‘Big Data’ but from exactly the opposite direction: the ability to access and use exactly the right (and usually small) amounts of small data at the right times — to fit the right tasks. (Data logistics, in other&nbsp;words.)  NOT come from grandiose schemes for artificial intelligence, but from the humble practical know-how of millions of people dealing with their everyday lives, as citizens running households and as workers delivering front line services.  NOT come from ‘markets’ where firms seek to make profits, but from changes in the unglamorous but universal and essential tasks of administration — where no money changes hands and no profits are made, but where huge amounts of unnecessary friction, effort, risk and cost can be eliminated.  <p>In short, it will not come from all the places that current conventional wisdom tells us to look. Instead, it will come from another place entirely.</p><p>This blog series will explore these surprising findings. It starts by asking a crucial, fundamental question: what is it about data that makes it valuable&nbsp;anyway?</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-personal-data-economically-valuable-927e8c7cd51">2.

<p>Il 23 e il 24 di Novembre 2022 , Associazione Sloweb ritorna con la quarta edizione del <a href="https://www.digitalethicsforum.com/">Digital Ethics Forum</a>, due giorni con panel di conferenze ed eventi speciali per approfondire alcuni dei temi più urgenti riguardanti l’etica nella progettazione, nella produzione, nella distribuzione e nell’uso delle tecnologie digitali.</p>



<p>Nell’epoca attuale, tutte le organizzazioni sono impegnate a riorientare le proprie attività verso modelli più sostenibili, la sfida del secolo è rendere la tecnologia alla portata di tutti, garantendo equità, accessibilità e sostenibilità.</p>



<p>Il focus che questa edizione si propone di percorrere è il “Che fare”, più nello specifico su cosa si stia facendo nelle imprese e nelle istituzioni e per accettare, adottare e includere il digitale in maniera etica e sostenibile rendendolo parte integrante della quotidianità.</p>



 Giovedì 24 novembre alle ore 10:40 segui l’intervento di Danilo Cattaneo sulla cittadinanza digitale – iscriviti all’evento 



<p>A questo scopo Danilo Cattaneo – CEO di InfoCert, avrà il ruolo di relatore con uno speech dal titolo “Il Digital Trust come base per una cittadinanza digitale più sicura, inclusiva e sostenibile”; una discussione che avverrà durante un panel dedicato all’impresa con un focus su sostenibilità, identità, fiducia, e qualità dei dati, che cercherà di fornire delle risposte su cosa succede e succederà nelle aziende.</p>



<p>L’evento, introdotto, come per l’edizione 2020 da una lezione speciale di Luciano Floridi, sarà composto da uno schema concettuale per cui il “campo da gioco” dell’etica digitale coinvolge tre soggetti principali: istituzioni, aziende, cittadini.</p>

Ocean and peaq’s upcoming direct collaboration will involve leveraging Ocean’s data monetisation technology to power a vast array of mobility-related opportunities such as the monetisation of road condition data. Ocean’s Compute-to-Data and data-pricing mechanisms will power system architecture for a seamless exchange of information between providers and customers of mobility applications. d<a href="https://www.delta-dao.com/imprint">eltaDAO</a> will support the project by implementing the Ocean tech stack to the moveID infrastructure. For the project, peaq will also extend its core functions including peaq ID — <a href="https://www.peaq.network/blog/introducing-peaq-id-self-sovereign-identity-for-machines">Self-Sovereign Machine Identities</a> (SSMIs), peaq access, and peaq&nbsp;pay.</p><blockquote>Till Wender, co-founder of peaq, commented: “Data is a crucial resource for most of today’s businesses, but the centralized approach to its collection and distribution opens up a trove of socio-political plights. Ocean Protocol’s impressive toolset for a Web3 data economy offers a welcome alternative to the status quo, giving individual users back control over their data. Together, we will unlock the full potential of data generated through our everyday activities in a way that empowers communities, not centralized platforms.”</blockquote><p>Further down the line, peaq and Ocean have plans to expand the collaboration beyond the moveID framework for a wider integration unlocking new ways for peaq ecosystem members. For this purpose, future integrations will be designed to ensure that all machines running on peaq are able to seamlessly link with Ocean’s data marketplace and trade a vast array of data types in a secure peer-to-peer manner.</p><p>Read more about peaq and Ocean’s collaboration for the moveID project in the initial<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-joins-leading-web3-projects-on-the-20m-gaia-x-moveid-initiative-to-advance-72e4675d12d7"> announcement.</a></p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on Twitter, Telegram, LinkedIn, GitHub &amp; Newsletter for project updates and announcements.

<p>InfoCert, Tinexta Group, insieme a Wallife Spa per l’inedito set di servizi dedicato ai clienti InfoCert ID.</p>



<p>Roma, 23 novembre 2022 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, lancia InfoCert Care, un pacchetto di servizi per proteggere l’identità digitale SPID dalle minacce del mondo digitale.</p>



<p>InfoCert Care è un pacchetto di servizi per proteggere l’Identità SPID dei cittadini e per prevenire e mitigare i rischi connessi all’eventuale furto di credenziali e al loro uso fraudolento da parte di criminali informatici, ad esempio per l’utilizzo illecito di servizi erogati dalle PA, la sottrazione di denaro mediante il cambio dell’IBAN associato alla riscossione di prestazioni sociali o il furto della firma digitale creata con SPID. InfoCert Care può essere immediatamente attivato a tutela sia dell’identità digitale personale che dell’identità uso professionale e, a brevissimo, anche dell’identità SPID per i minori, lo SPID dedicato a una fascia della popolazione tra le più esposte ai rischi del mondo cyber.</p>



<p>“La crescita esponenziale di SPID ha inevitabilmente attirato su questo formidabile acceleratore di innovazione le mire dei criminali informatici, con sempre più frequenti episodi di attacchi che sfruttano l’ingegneria sociale e la buona fede degli utenti meno esperti per carpire a fini fraudolenti le loro credenziali d’accesso SPID – commenta Carmine Auletta, Chief Security &amp; Innovation Officer di InfoCert – Tinexta Group. InfoCert è da sempre impegnata nel rafforzare la sicurezza e la tutela dei propri clienti rispetto alle minacce del mondo digitale. Le minacce cambiano quotidianamente e diventano sempre più sofisticate e non tutti i cittadini hanno gli strumenti per poterle riconoscere ed evitare. InfoCert Care permette di tutelare i clienti che hanno la malaugurata vicissitudine di cadere vittima di un cybercrime, siano essi professionisti o semplici cittadini. InfoCert Care nasce dalla collaborazione con Wallife Insurance, una innovativa Insurtech specializzata in prodotti assicurativi per la protezione da rischi derivanti dall’utilizzo di nuove tecnologie”.</p>



<p>InfoCert Care include, tra le altre cose, molteplici servizi offerti dal gruppo Wallife, tra cui la polizza assicurativa distribuita da Wallife Insurance s.r.l. agenzia unica sul mercato, che garantisce- entro specifici massimali – il rimborso delle somme illecitamente sottratte e la copertura di eventuali spese di assistenza legale.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Il furto di identità digitale è un fenomeno sempre più in crescita che richiede oggi maggiore attenzione e una più accurata protezione – commenta Maria Enrica Angelone, CEO di Wallife – “Per questo motivo Wallife ha ideato insieme a InfoCert il prodotto InfoCert Care che, grazie all’integrazione della protezione assicurativa SPID Care, permette di offrire a tutti gli account SPID InfoCert un servizio di protezione avanzata e tutela legale dello SPID.”</p>

<p>Holochain’s features and performance have matured enough that we’ve set the date for our Beta release and will publish a release candidate for Holochain Beta by December 15, 2022.</p><p>Given the large risks that come with releasing crypto projects prematurely, or failing to ensure sound underlying fundamentals, Holochain has taken a more conservative and methodical approach. At this point, we have five years of development, during which we’ve built, tested, refined, explored new territory, learned a lot, and occasionally gone back to the drawing board. And we’re excited to finally have a solid enough platform to announce that we’ve crossed the maturity threshold for release.</p><p>To confirm our software and technology is sound, Holochain has been undergoing a security audit of its cryptography, codebase, and integrity model. We've engaged &nbsp;<a href="https://leastauthority.com/">Least Authority</a>, the same firm that audited Ethereum, Ethereum 2.0, Filecoin and many other projects with sophisticated decentralized architectures. We look forward to sharing the results once the audit is complete.</p><p>In addition to hired auditors, our community of developers have worked tirelessly on building and releasing apps built on Holochain, and have provided critical feedback which has helped us address feature requirements, reliability challenges, and usability hurdles such that we are assured Holochain now has all the vital elements for building real Web3 apps.</p><p>In December we will deliver a release candidate to our community so they can hammer against it with their applications and automated testing to confirm the January release of a full Holochain Beta.</p><p>Holochain is a scalable peer-to-peer application framework which provides secure validation while still offering near real-time coordination capabilities at large scales. It does not suffer from the scalability constraints of blockchain and global consensus. As such, it provides exactly the solutions needed today: the data integrity and performance required to support Web3’s goal to leave centralized corporate servers behind.</p> Basic Features of Holochain Alpha   Private cryptographically signed chains where each agent records their immutable history of actions  Publishing to a distributed hash table (DHT) for shared visibility of state  Data integrity guarantees enforced by randomized validators  Linking of data to utilize the DHT as a graph database  Strong eventual consistency and guaranteed data liveness through rapid publishing and self-healing gossip on the DHT  Fully peer-to-peer networking leveraging an agent’s public key to enable self-validating network addresses  Enabling custom P2P applications, with your choice of UI approach  Scaling by isolating each application into its own DHT and P2P network   Advanced Features included in Holochain Beta   Cross-Platform launcher for Holochain with built-in app store for installing and running new decentralized apps  Breaking of DHT storage and validation into shards so large-scale apps only incur a small workload  Mutual countersigning of actions to enable atomic state changes across multiple agent chains  M of N countersigning to enable apps to implement lightweight consensus for selected data elements  Innovative data compression to accelerate node-to-node gossip via quantized chunks of space and time  Apps can now spawn new child applets with private workspaces  Stable validation and data structures with flexible accessors and runtime functions  Enable delayed or recurring tasks with scheduler  External hash references to integrate data and logic across apps, DHTs and even other chains and frameworks  Full Web3 feature set, enabling replacement of all those Web2 surveillance apps  <p>Request to our Dev Community: Now is the time to make sure you have automated testing to put our release candidate through its paces. We need to uncover any final reliability issues or performance barriers. Please build more automated tests!</p><p>Resources for testing your apps:</p>  Tryorama: Holochain’s full-featured, JavaScript-based, scenario testing framework for your apps. <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">GitHub</a> | <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/tryorama">NPM</a> | <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/main/README.md">Documentation</a> | <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/main/docs/tryorama.md">API reference</a>  Sweetest: a Rust-based integration testing package used to test Holochain itself but is also popular for app scenario testing.

We know many of you have followed our project for a long time. In light of the chaos of more recent collapses and failures in the crypto market, we hope you understand why we’ve taken special care in our build process before releasing.</p> What This Announcement Means &amp; What it Does Not Mean   Holochain is not the Holo hosting network. This message is not about HOT.  This announcement does not relate to HoloFuel nor the Holo Token.  Holo will use this Beta release to build and launch the Holo hosting platform.  We will continue to optimize performance and add planned features to Holochain even after Beta launch.   Holochain and Holo are Hiring <p>We are hiring developers and are specifically looking for coders who love to dig deep into the low level code, troubleshoot, and debug. Great communication skills are a must.

<p>Enabling biometrics with FIDO can help create more security for your logins and reduces the risk of login attacks from succeeding.</p>
<p>What is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/1kosmos-fido2/">FIDO biometrics</a>? FIDO biometrics are a way to authenticate a user via their face, fingers, or voice; this lends itself to a user having a passwordless experience with their login.</p>
 What Are FIDO <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless</a> Standards? 
<p>One of the more significant cybersecurity threats today is the inherent weakness of passwords. In the earliest days of computing, having a simple username and password or PIN combinations proved suitable for security.</p>
<p>In modern cybersecurity and authentication, however, the “always on” nature of the Internet and the proliferation of cloud-based apps and mobile devices have shown us that password authentication is weak against several common attacks like phishing or other social engineering approaches.</p>
<p>There has been a massive shift in authentication from common password systems towards <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> and passwordless solutions. But, as with many innovations, this move introduced several new issues, namely the fragmentation of the implementation and maintenance of these standards.</p>
<p>The Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) alliance was formed to address two key issues related to strong authentication and adoption:</p>
 
 Passwordless Authentication: The stated mission of the FIDO alliance is to reduce our reliance on passwords by shifting technology toward passwordless systems. 
 Interoperability: While passwordless authentication is a step towards strong authentication, it won’t provide much benefit if it isn’t used. Therefore, FIDO promotes a shared and open industry standard for adopting passwordless authentication. 
 
<p>To provide the required interoperability sufficient for an industry standard, FIDO developed several specifications on their own and in conjunction with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C):</p>
 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-uaf-v1.1-id-20170202/fido-uaf-overview-v1.1-id-20170202.html">Universal Authentication Framework (UAF):</a> This is the passwordless standard for FIDO. UAF architecture provides a framework through which users can authenticate themselves, without a password, through the exchange of asymmetric encrypted key pairs between a FIDO server and a client application or device with the user (most commonly a phone or tablet). 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/u2f-specs-master/fido-u2f-overview.html">Universal 2nd Factor (U2F):</a> U2F is a narrower authentication implementation that allows developers to include a second (or more) factor for authentication. U2F allows MFA over UAF passwordless verification, password systems, or USB verification devices. 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>: The <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/fido2-authentication/">FIDO2 project</a> results from the FIDO Alliance’s work with the W3C. It combines the Web Authentication API, or WebAuthn (a standardized, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/secure-authentication">secure authentication</a> interface for web applications using public-key cryptography) and the Client to Authenticator Protocol, or CTAP2 (a protocol that allows cryptographic authenticators like USB keys or smartphones with other devices). 
 
<p>While this combination of technologies might overlap, they all serve the primary function of bringing secure, passwordless security to hardware devices and web applications.</p>
 What Are FIDO-Certified Biometrics? 
<p>Simply put, FIDO biometrics are just FIDO-certified biometric devices and technologies that can function on top of FIDO authentication. These biometrics devices are built to conform to FIDO (thus, open) standards to provide strong authentication security that can complement several kinds of identity verification and management requirements.</p>
<p>The benefit of FIDO, and this FIDO biometrics, are that they are open and certified by the Alliance, meaning that they will operate under common standards and share interoperability with other FIDO protocols.</p>
<p>Some of the FIDO-certified types of biometrics include:</p>
 
 Fingerprints 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-voice-authentication/">Voice</a> 
 Facial Recognition 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-iris-biometrics/">Iris Scans</a> 
 
 Biometric Component Certification Program 
<p>To ensure the interoperability of the FIDO biometric component technology, the FIDO Alliance uses a certification process that’s independent of its other programs. This means that the creators of biometric components can apply for FIDO certification for that component without having a fully-functional, FIDO-certified authentication application or platform.</p>
<p>There are, however, rules for component integration–that is, if a biometric component is certified, there are still essential rules around how other authentication platforms can integrate that component if they seek FIDO certification.</p>
<p>Additionally, these certification requirements will depend on the type of FIDO certification. Authenticators seeking certification at FIDO levels 1 or 2 only have the option, not the requirement, to integrate biometrics. Levels 3 or higher, however, require certified biometrics.</p>
<p>In either case, FIDO provides a concrete process by which biometrics components are certified:</p>
 
 Application: Developers seeking certification must apply for a FIDO Alliance account to access the Biometric Dashboard. This Dashboard allows them to navigate the certification process, including initiating their application. 
 
<p>The FIDO Alliance <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/biometric-authentication/biometric-password">biometric</a> component certification secretariat will review this application, accept it, reject it, or ask for further documentation.</p>
 
 Biometric Testing: The developer submits the component to a FIDO-accredited laboratory for testing. The laboratory will combine online and offline testing with live subjects. The laboratory will also provide an Allowed Integration Document that outlines the changes necessary for authenticators to integrate the biometric component properly. 
 Laboratory Reports: Once the testing is complete, the laboratory will provide a laboratory report to the developer and to the certification secretariat, including the Allowed Integration Document. 
 Certification Requests: After the report is approved, the developer completes a certification request. This step also calls for the developer to provide metadata that describes the component. This metadata must include the Biometric Certification level, the Self-Attested False Accept Rate, and the Self-Attested False Reject Rate. 
 Certification Issuance: If the FIDO Alliance approves the certification, then the certificate is issued to the developer. The developer may submit their metadata to the FIDO Metadata Service. They will also pay their certification fee ($10,000 for members and $13,000 for non-members). 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Moving to FIDO Biometrics? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Standardized Passwordless Authentication: Passwordless authentication is a critical step in identity and access security. FIDO provides a robust and maintained way to implement passwordless authentication without having to lock into a single vendor or service provider. 
 Flexible Hardware-Based Authentication: A strength of FIDO standards is that it supports hardware-based token authentication, including using USB keys, keycard authentication, and hardware tokens. 
 
<p>With FIDO biometrics, you’ll also get the benefits of stronger security using physical traits (for example, including a fingerprint scan in a USB security key or leveraging FIDO-compliant facial recognition in a Windows laptop.</p>
 
 Regulatory Compliance: Biometrics, hardware-based authentication, and MFA are all components of most regulatory frameworks. 
 
<p>Furthermore, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, governs almost every federal and defense cybersecurity standard and is a member of the FIDO Alliance. Working with FIDO-compliant technology will go a long way to aligning your infrastructure with security standards.</p>
 
 Interoperability: FIDO biometrics won’t require you to lock in with a single provider or vendor. Additionally, the FIDO Metadata Service provides an extensive directory of compliant technology so you can trust any component or solution you adopt.

<p>The hard truth for the decentralized asset industry is that regulations are coming. Lawmakers can no longer ignore anonymous financial activity, despite the arguments coming from the cryptocurrency community. However, there is technology available already that can rectify the need for verification with the desire to protect privacy. Utilizing the latest in cryptographic proofs, a new type of ID has been created that actually stands to make players on all sides of this debate satisfied after&nbsp;all.</p><p>In the wake of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/10/ftx-cryptocurrency-collapse-investigation">devastating collapse</a> of FTX just recently, there’s no doubt that stricter, more comprehensive regulations will be coming into the digital asset industry. As demonstrated by the previous blacklisting of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/17/tornado-cash-fallout-can-ethereum-be-censored/">Tornado Cash</a>, lawmakers simply aren’t going to tolerate anonymity in crypto continuing. There need to be mechanisms in place to bring decentralized finance (DeFi) in line with legislation like the <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-and-regulations/bank-secrecy-act">Bank Secrecy Act</a> and organizations like the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/">Financial Action Task Force</a> without comprising user privacy and their fundamental human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>However, this notion has many in the cryptocurrency community concerned. Anonymity is a principle that the field is built upon, and most can’t ignore the years of abuse that individuals have endured from big tech companies <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/04/how-social-media-mine-data-sell-personal-information-for-profit">harvesting and profiting</a> off of their data. If that wasn’t enough, then there’s the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/21/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal-everything-you-need-to-know.html">well-documented</a> security failings that have exposed the sensitive information of millions of innocent people. For these reasons, it is hard for many to accept the idea of similar Know Your Customer (KYC) verifications coming into the DeFi space. Individuals and institutions are often encouraged to hold all their assets themselves in non-custodial wallets, as this protects them from the fallout when events like FTX occur. However, for casual users and newcomers, private custody can be a bit tricky. Fortunately, all of these issues can be addressed with a single&nbsp;product.</p> A Private, Provable&nbsp;Identity <p>DeFi is built out of technology like blockchain and smart contracts, which are what form the basis for anonymous financial services. However, another technology known as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) provides the means to bring true identity verification to decentralized networks, all while preserving user privacy and giving them more control over their data than ever&nbsp;before.</p><p>By utilizing existing credentials or an individual’s biometrics, ZKPs can be generated that confirm the veracity of the data without having to reveal it. These proofs then serve as the basis for a verified Self-Sovereign Decentralized Identity (SSI) that no external entity can access or alter without permission from the user. Using the SSI, anyone can provide W3C Verifiable Credentials and ZKPs to confirm who they are across any platform in a private and secure&nbsp;manner.</p><p>This system can bring decentralized, private KYC that can still stay in line with the regulator’s needs for verification. It also satisfies the philosophy of the decentralized community, and in fact, solves many of the issues that major tech companies have created over the last decade. This ID can also act as an asset wallet, allowing users to manage their funds from one single interface that they have full control over, eliminating the need for third-party custody of funds. SSIs can be implemented across any DeFi service, but can also be used for verification with traditional platforms and even physical access to locations. All of this can be done while still concealing a user’s image, financial history, or even&nbsp;name.</p> SSIs In&nbsp;Practice <p>Take the use case of applying for a credit facility&nbsp;. Using ZKPs, the person applying could prove that they had a minimum amount of capital qualifying them for the facility, but wouldn’t have to reveal their actual balance or assets. The bank would still be safe to lend the funds, and the user’s financial dealings would remain&nbsp;private.</p><p>Of course, there will still be times where some personal information will need to be accessed. For example, SSIs can also be encoded with a person’s medical history. Obviously, medical professionals will usually need to see the actual information, not just a proof. In such a case, the user can grant access to the specific information needed, and for only as long as it is needed. Their profile isn’t an “open book,” and only the individual or designated loved one can access&nbsp;it.</p><p>Implementing ZKPs for SSIs opens the door to a decentralized future that satisfies governments, businesses, and even consumers. There’s no longer a need to allow unfiltered access to user data, all while companies remain confident that they are dealing with validated customers. This isn’t just some grand vision of tomorrow, either. All of the technology needed to bring it to life is available, and being deployed&nbsp;today.</p><p>If you or your team are looking to comply with <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/bank-secrecy-act/#:~:text=BSA%20is%20the%20common%20name,and%20the%20financing%20of%20terrorism.">BSA</a> or the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps.html#:~:text=In%20particular%2C%20FATF's%20Travel%20Rule,prevent%20criminal%20and%20terrorist%20misuse.">FATF Travel rule</a> and enable KYC and AML, there’s now a way to comply without compromising DeFi.</p><p>Get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:partners@nuggets.life">partners@nuggets.life</a>.

             <p>Last week, INNOPAY’s Maarten Bakker presented highlights from the Open Banking Monitor 2022 during the Dutch Payments Association’s Open Banking event for its member organisations.</p>

<p>Maarten’s presentation on 17 November highlighted a number of key findings from this year’s INNOPAY Open Banking Monitor. Each edition of the monitor assesses the gateways – better known as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) – that banks provide for Open Banking. Banks are scored based on the breadth of their API offering and the experiences of third-party developers using the APIs. Dutch banks performed well in this year’s edition of the Open Banking Monitor.</p>

<p>During his presentation, Maarten explained that there has been a shift from Open Banking to Open Finance in recent years. Besides access to payment accounts, financial institutions (including banks) are increasingly offering a wider range of services and products, such as mortgages, insurance and investments. According to INNOPAY, embedded lending could grow into a billion-dollar industry in the coming years.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.network/proposal/17">proposal</a> has been made on KILT to change staking rewards from an automatic distribution to a timeframe selected by recipients. Collators and delegators could choose a time that best suits them to claim (such as once a week, once a month, once a quarter, once a year), which will significantly simplify tax reporting.</p><p>Under the current&nbsp;setup:</p>  Rewards for collators and delegators are issued every time a block is built, adding to the load on the blockchain.  Each reward payout is an income event for collators and delegators, potentially creating thousands of taxable income entries for each account during one&nbsp;year.  <p>To address these issues, a new proposal was submitted for community vote to change reward distribution from an automatic to a pull-based function. This would reduce the computation needed for each block, and make tax reporting easier for delegators and collators.</p><p>There would be no change anticipated for those staking KILT Coins on exchanges.</p><p>All KILT Coin holders can vote on the proposal and you can even use your staked coins for voting. Join the discussion on the proposal <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.network/proposal/17">here</a>. It is anticipated that the proposal would go to referendum on Wednesday November 23, with voting open for 7 days until November 30. If approved, the changes would be enacted automatically on December&nbsp;1st.</p><p>The change to staking would be carried out as a runtime upgrade, allowing services to run normally on KILT except for a few minutes of maintenance on Stakeboard.</p> How to Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>If the proposed upgrade is approved and enacted, rewards will be continually counted but no longer automatically paid out to the wallet. The rewards will be visible on Stakeboard as “unclaimed rewards”.</p><p>Clicking “Claim” on Stakeboard uses the counter to calculate the reward and move it from the blockchain into the wallet it was staked from. Since this process is recorded on the blockchain it requires a small transaction fee (around 0.0002 KILT&nbsp;total).</p><p>Collators and more tech-minded users can also check their rewards and claim via Polkadot JS Apps.

<p>SSI, Web5, IDtech, Reusable Identity, Authentic Data — Which Should You&nbsp;Use?</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@siora18?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Siora Photography</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>Two years ago, I authored a piece called <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/ssi-has-an-identity-problem-10b6f0617597">SSI has an Identity Problem</a> where I outlined a somewhat ironic problem. “SSI” stands for “self-sovereign identity” — a new kind of standardized, user-controlled digital identity. But a host of other terms are used to describe the same thing — like “decentralized identity” and “self-managed identity,” and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rileyparkerhughes_a-year-ago-i-wrote-a-blog-post-link-in-activity-6864046138027331584-i5rE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">none have emerged victorious</a>. This isn’t ideal because usage of a variety of terms confuses the market — not to mention the irony of an identity technology with such an identity&nbsp;crisis!</p><p>It’s been two years since writing my original post, and it’s time for a follow-up. Terminology matters because it’s related to adoption; the easier to understand, the more the concept will spread, and the faster digital identity will&nbsp;improve.</p>Despite technology affecting every aspect of our lives, identity is still surprisingly bad. SSI promises to change&nbsp;that.<p>By this post’s conclusion, you’ll understand why I use the terminology I do. If I’m successful, you’ll have insight on how you can adjust the way you communicate about SSI to help your business, product, or analysis be more successful.</p> Quick framing&nbsp;note: <p>Throughout this post, I’ll use “SSI” as a broad umbrella term to refer to the full set of technologies, philosophies, and products that are improving how digital identity is done for both consumers and organizations.</p><blockquote>‘Self-sovereign identity’ was the first category-defining term to catch on, and therefore the most widely used today. But the first terms to catch on are not always the best nor the longest-lasting.</blockquote><p>My use of “SSI” is not an endorsement. In fact, the purpose of this post is to propose more fit-for-purpose terminology than SSI. Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> The terms gaining popularity over the last 2&nbsp;years  IDtech <p>IDtech refers to products that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they need. In contrast to other terms that describe a concept, movement, philosophy, or technology, the term IDtech describes the real-world applications built using those building blocks. If a fintech product helps you manage your money, an IDtech product helps you manage your identity and data. And, like the move to open banking before it, the popularization of interoperable identity primitives such as verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers are catalyzing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/19/idtech-is-the-new-fintech/?sh=39a0458a3a88">IDtech as the new&nbsp;fintech</a>.</p><p>Terminology is important — people <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/what-is-blue-and-how-do-we-see-color-2015-2">couldn’t see the color blue</a> until there was a name for it. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/windley/">Phil Windley</a>, original leader at <a href="http://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a> + <a href="http://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a> cofounder, shared with me how his 1994 startup iMall struggled until the term “e-commerce” came about. It enabled him to instantly communicate its value in a single, concise statement.</p><p>When I say blue, people see the color of the sky. So, what do people “see” when they hear “self-sovereign identity” or “decentralized identity”? Based on the number of times I’ve seen a “deer in the headlights” look, I’d guess… headlights? On the other hand, when someone mentions they’re building an EdTech, BioTech, AgTech, PropTech, RegTech, FinTech, FoodTech, MedTech, etc. product, people know something about it instantly. An investor can specialize in MedTech. Customers can attend an EdTech conference. And so&nbsp;on.</p><p>The term IDtech is the first term to refer exclusively to SSI’s applications/products. It will lead to faster adoption of user-centric identity solutions to the extent it helps developers, investors, analysts, and end-users quickly understand how the SSI rubber meets the&nbsp;road.</p><p>For more on IDtech, feel free to review both the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/19/idtech-is-the-new-fintech/?sh=678fc25d3a88">massive business opportunity it represents</a> and <a href="https://rileyparkerhughes.medium.com/intro-to-idtech-how-decentralized-identity-will-be-adopted-2a3fb9abf6bb">how it will drive SSI adoption</a>.</p> Web5 <p>Web5 is a new term — but much has been said about it already. On the <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/">homepage</a> of TBD, they describe it as “an extra decentralized web that puts you in control of your data and identity.” Timothy Ruff, SSI entrepreneur, added to that definition by <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/what-is-web5-fb34f48d0b1b">asserting</a> web5 is “The autonomous control of authentic data and relationships.” Definitions materialize from how words are used, not what’s said about them — and I see “web5” mostly used to describe a technology paradigm.</p><p>For example, if someone says they’re building a web3 product, what do you think of? Likely blockchains, tokens, NFTs, DAOs, and private keys (crypto wallets). They’re using web3 as shorthand to describe the architecture of their solution — the paradigm or technical philosophy they ascribe&nbsp;to.</p><p>Web5 is a terrific candidate to describe the general technology architecture/approach that enables SSI to exist. In this way, web5 acts as shorthand for verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers &amp; PKI, identity wallets &amp; personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>In my original post, I predicted:</p><blockquote>The name that will emerge [to describe the category] will likely not be the first one, but the one with the least negative baggage that balances being specific to the technology but broad enough to encompass all its variations.</blockquote><p>Web5 is the quintessential answer to this conundrum. Web5 leaves behind the <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/">baggage of web3</a>, while still promising a bright future. It avoids the problems with terms like self-sovereign identity, decentralized identity, and trust over IP (which I outlined in my post a few years ago). Web5 is also broad enough to encompass the various approaches to solve the problem — from blockchain-based DIDs to self-asserting KERI identifiers. I’m looking forward to seeing how this term is used more in the&nbsp;wild.</p> Reusable identity <p>Today, financial institutions, e-commerce sites, gig economy services, and most other digital services operate with dozens of data aggregators and middleware services verifying people in the background. Everywhere you go, you’re re-verified. Reusable identity refers to people holding “interoperable identity credentials” (<a href="https://liminal.co/reports/market-opportunity-for-reusable-identity/">source</a>) that are broadly accepted and authenticate-able in real time, reducing the need to re-verify people and resulting in easier-to-access and lower-cost services.</p><p>This is a great conceptual term, especially for identity professionals who are familiar with how the world works today. Because the term is unopinionated about the application of the concept and the technical approach with which it is executed, it can be applied to solutions that diverge from the ideals of SSI (like interoperability and privacy). It can also be confusing for people who are new to the identity space, who may misinterpret “reusable” for “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack">replayable</a>.”</p><p>What this term gives up in completeness (e.g. doesn’t consider privacy) it makes up for in accessibility. It is especially helpful in a business context because it emphasizes the value of SSI in plain English. While the term is relatively new, it has already proven to be a promising contender for conceptualizing SSI.</p> Authentic data or verifiable data <p>Digital trust is a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/why-digital-trust-truly-matters?cid=soc-web">major problem</a>, and terms like authentic/verifiable data strike at the heart of the issue. SSI produces data that is authentic (meaning “of undisputed origin; genuine”) which is slightly more accurate than verifiable (meaning “able to be checked or demonstrated to be true, accurate, or justified”). To most, they’re equivalent.</p><p>These terms are useful when one wishes to distinguish between regular, raw data and cryptographically signed data. They’re especially useful to describe the end result of a verifiable credential. However, I don’t think the term is suited well to describe the whole SSI category. Authentic and verifiable are very vague terms, especially to the layperson. (Most people use authentic as in “authentic Chinese food” or “being authentic to your inner moral compass” — and how many times have you heard “verified credential” instead of “verifiable credential?”)</p> How do the terms&nbsp;relate? <p>Sometimes it’s helpful to use analogies to understand how new concepts relate. The best comparison I can conjure is with&nbsp;cinema.</p>  “Reusable” and “self-sovereign” are ideologies, ideals, or ambitions identity developers can ascribe to, just like directors can aspire to produce artistic vs entertaining films.  Web2, web3, and web5, as paradigms or architectures, are akin to the style used to shoot, which is determined in part by the types of cameras, lenses, and other technologies used.  Categorical terms such as IDtech, fintech, medtech, etc. are like genres of movies (e.g. superhero, horror, romance+comedy, etc).  A movie is but the organizing of plot points, dialogue, and other sequences that tell a story — much like how bits of authentic data — multiple sources of credentials and presentations — make up an IDtech&nbsp;product.  A given IDtech product is like a specific movie. It is the sum of all the aforementioned bits, packaged up into something someone can actually&nbsp;consume.   The words I use&nbsp;today <p>Our goal at Trinsic is to make the world more accessible by empowering teams to build amazing identity products. IDtech is the term to describe the product/application layer that is emerging on top of the concepts, technologies, and paradigms we’ve spoken about&nbsp;herein.</p><p>When talking about the technology or architecture of a product, I’ll continue to use web5, web3, or web2 as shorthand, despite not loving the “webX” framing. And I’ll use reusable identity, decentralized identity, and self-sovereign identity as high-level terms to describe the ideology driving the change in the identity market, depending on the audience I’m speaking to. And when I’m talking about the end result, or the component parts of an IDtech solution, particularly for relying parties, I’ll speak to authentic/verifiable data.</p> Conclusion <p>As I’ve stated before, IDtech is the new Fintech. And the winning IDtech products over the next decade will be ones built using the principles of self sovereignty and reusability. I’d love to hear your feedback on this article. And if you’re building an IDtech product, I’d love to learn about what you’re building and explore whether Trinsic can help. Feel free to find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rileyparkerhughes/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">Twitter</a> and let me know the terms you prefer to use to describe better digital&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Thanks to Gabe Cohen, Kim Hamilton-Duffy, Zack Jones, Anna Johnson, and Timothy Ruff for giving feedback on this&nbsp;article.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/has-ssis-identity-problem-been-solved-2d33490315ae">Has SSI’s Identity Problem been Solved?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic">Trinsic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is the second post in a series about IDtech, a category of products that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they need. The first post, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/19/idtech-is-the-new-fintech/?sh=3553171a3a88">IDtech is the New Fintech</a> is available to read on&nbsp;Forbes.</p><p>If a tree falls without anyone around to hear it, did it really&nbsp;happen?</p><p>An ever-increasing number of people have caught the vision of the future that <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) promises. It’s a world where people possess a universally-accepted, user-centric digital identity so that everything they’re eligible for or entitled to is one tap away, while remaining in control of their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>But if decentralized identity technologies are developed without achieving widespread end-user adoption, did it actually accomplish anything?</p><p>The way to achieve adoption is simple (albeit challenging to execute): the key is lots of well-executing teams building useful products. “IDtech” is a term to talk about that very&nbsp;thing.</p> Adoption is the&nbsp;Goal <p>I’ve <a href="https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-ssi-orbit-podcast-self-sovereign-identity-dece/-10-building-digital-trust-ecosystems-with-riley-h/">spoken</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/4-keys-to-self-sovereign-identity-adoption-ad269b208569">written</a> at length about the gnarly <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Start-Problem-Andrew-Chen-ebook/dp/B08HZ5XY7X">cold start</a> (or, “chicken and egg”) problem that threatens the realization of self-sovereign identity. The utility of a digital identity is a function of the useful applications it has. Like a Visa card, a digital ID is really valuable when a broad marketplace of organizations are willing to accept it — and basically worthless in isolation.</p><p>That’s why adoption must be the paramount objective of the identity community. That’s why I’ve said that I believe that <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497">the least interesting things</a> to talk about are blockchain, data standards, serialization &amp; communication protocols, signature schemes, decentralized PKI, and the other technology components that collectively make up “web5”. Adoption is the north-star of <a href="http://www.trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>, the decentralized identity infrastructure startup I co-founded that hundreds of developers use to build products.</p><p>But exactly how will adoption occur? The answer isn’t obvious, but it is&nbsp;simple.</p> Four Possible Ways SSI Could be&nbsp;Adopted <p>I’ve spoken to hundreds of people about SSI adoption — including those among the most qualified in the world to opine on the subject. Their ideas all boil down to one of the options in the below matrix — that adoption will be driven by either organizations or people, and that it will be bottom-up or top-down*.</p>The 4 ways SSI could be&nbsp;adopted<p>Influencers: People-driven, top-down&nbsp;adoption</p><p>The least popular of the four quadrants, influencers represent an opportunity to create demand with hundreds of millions of people. However, it’s an extremely expensive strategy to execute and it’s unclear how initial utility would be built. That said, it could have massive payoff if someone can pull it&nbsp;off.</p><p>Communities: People-driven, bottoms-up adoption</p><p>The most “in vogue” quadrant, community-driven adoption is the idea that SSI could take off by individuals spreading SSI to other individuals like they did with Bitcoin and DAOs. Organic growth without centralized organizations capturing the community is a captivating idea, but the pragmatist in me immediately questions where the incentives lie. Identity requires trust to function — something that’s hard to crowd-source and straightforward for reputable organizations to&nbsp;provide.</p><p>Queen bees: Organization-driven, top-down&nbsp;adoption</p><p>The “queen bee” strategy describes influential organizations (governments, financial institutions, big tech, etc.) mandate (or provide) verifiable credentials to their existing users. Example: a utility company begins issuing “verified address” credentials to customers in their municipality, enabling solar installers, telcos, and retailers to easily verify&nbsp;people.</p><p>When I hear businesspeople talk about the opportunity in SSI, they’re talking about this quadrant 99% of the time. The challenge is that — surprise! — governments &amp; other incumbents move slowly and adopt new technology carefully. Because verifiable credentials need to be trustworthy to be useful, top-down adoption is important — but it’s not the solution. If our industry keeps focusing exclusively on queen bees I’ll have grey hair before we see meaningful adoption.</p><p>Innovators: Organization-driven, bottoms-up adoption</p><p>This quadrant is the golden quadrant. Bottoms-up adoption by organizations refers to innovative teams solving a new problem or launching a new product. Innovators can exist within startups, R&amp;D departments at large corporations, or product teams within growth-stage companies.</p><p>Despite this being, in my opinion, the most exciting quadrant, few understand or discuss it. I believe this is because our lexicon lacks a way to express it. The goal of this series of posts is to change&nbsp;that.</p> Adoption is Driven by Great&nbsp;Products <p>The decentralized identity ecosystem will be adopted the same way that basically every other mature ecosystem has developed.</p><p>Think about the internet. After a quick glance of the <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranking-the-top-100-websites-in-the-world/">top 100 websites</a>, I count maybe 10 belonging to companies that existed prior to 1995 (CNN, BBC, etc). These dominant websites weren’t launched by incumbents. Netflix wasn’t built by Blockbuster or DirecTV. PayPal wasn’t built by Visa or Western Union. Amazon wasn’t built by Sears or Walmart. Even a decade after the internet took off, it’s the good products that win. Airbnb wasn’t built by couchsurfer.com or VRBO, and Robinhood wasn’t built by Fidelity or&nbsp;Shwab.</p>Image credit: <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranking-the-top-100-websites-in-the-world/">visual capitalist</a><p>From the recent wave of FinTech successes to the centuries-old world of retail and everything in between, successful ecosystems are built by innovative teams who build better products than their predecessors. Despite people’s love for making things complicated, the answer is really that&nbsp;simple.</p><p>While well-intentioned, all the academic analysis, decentralized governance, value chain mapping, or market sizing in the world won’t get us any closer to SSI adoption. Solid product work is what will get us there–researching low-friction UIs, building sustainable business models, baking interoperability in, and iterating quickly are all examples of good product work. And this needs to be done by lots of people in lots of industries and lots of use cases. 1,000 nimble teams taking products to market will teach us so much more than 10 “queen bee” companies ever&nbsp;would.</p> IDtech Products will Unlock SSI&nbsp;adoption <p>IDtech is the name we’ve begun using to describe the organization-driven, bottom-up adoption motion. It gives us a term to describe products instead of philosophies, initiatives, concepts, or technologies. If a fintech product helps you manage your money, an IDtech product helps you manage your identity and&nbsp;data.</p><p>IDtech products can deliver the convenience, optionality, and accessibility that fintechs bring to money into the archaic, paper-based world of personal and organizational identity. It can make brand new product experiences possible for the first time — and building an IDtech product is easier now than it’s ever been thanks to infrastructure like <a href="http://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a> and the commoditization of ID proofing. Identity today is where financial services was 15 years ago — and therefore represents one of the largest opportunities of this generation.</p><p>Self-sovereign identity will be adopted as hundreds thousands of innovators launch IDtech products that solve real problems for users. Queen bees will continue their trajectory as well and the convergence of the two will accelerate the value users get from their digital identity.</p><p>These ideas continue to develop. If you have feedback for me, or if you’re building an IDtech product, I’d love to hear from you — my DMs are open on <a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rileyparkerhughes/">LinkedIn</a>.

<p>Spherity is ISO 27001 certified–what does that bring to the table? Why does it matter for business?</p>Spherity is ISO 27001 certified.<p>To easily break down the concept, let’s use our day-to-day business tasks as examples. We communicate with our partners and clients using e-mails. Back then, the fax was also commonly used to ease document sharing from one person to another. Cheques, stamps, and signatures are international standards used in businesses worldwide. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to commit to a standard among many other standards. The same thing applies to being ISO-certified. To understand us and the certifications, we will guide you through our six&nbsp;Q&amp;As.</p>  What is ISO Certification?  <p>ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is an independent, non-governmental, international organization that develops standards to ensure the quality, safety, and efficiency of products, services, and systems. ISO compliance is achieved when an organization meets the requirements outlined in a specific standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The standards are in place to ensure consistency. Each certification has separate standards and criteria which are classified numerically.</p><p>2. What is ISO Certification According to ISO/IEC&nbsp;27001?</p><p>To understand Spherity and our certification, we must know what ISO/IEC 27001 is. Being ISO 27001 (Information Security and IT) certified and compliant, organizations create and maintain an information security management system (ISMS) that will strengthen their defenses against cyber threats. ISO 27001 compliance means an organization has clear IT security controls in place to protect operations, hardware, employees, customers, and partners from cyber attacks. It further provides organizations of all sizes with a framework for planning, implementing, monitoring, and improving their information security.</p><p>3. Why would a company want to be ISO Certified and what are the advantages of ISO/IEC&nbsp;27001?</p><p>All your business processes work with data/information. An information security management system (ISMS) aims to increase the organization’s security level by identifying and making delivering the respective priorities via risk management. With an ISO/IEC 27001 certified ISMS, you actively protect your company and lay the foundation for business success. These are the benefits:</p><p>Continuous information security: your information security management system undergoes constant optimization and adaptation to new circumstances.</p><p>Risk minimization: The ISO/IEC 27001 standard gives structure to your information security management which minimizes security&nbsp;gaps.</p><p>Information security: You lower the impact of possible hacker attacks, data loss and&nbsp;misuse.</p><p>Security as part of the corporate culture: ISO/IEC 27001 looks at your organization as a whole. At Spherity, it involves all hierarchical levels and departments in the protection of data and information. An ISMS is led by the top management and it demands frequent employee training and&nbsp;audits.</p><p>Implementation of external requirements: An ISMS in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001 takes into account the five most important characteristics of information: Availability, Confidentiality, Integrity, Authenticity and Accountability. One aspect of the ISO norm is to ensure that data is both optimally used and securely&nbsp;stored.</p><p>A certified ISMS creates trust: That a company handles information conscientiously is a key criteria for many customers and partners when deciding with whom to share their&nbsp;data.</p><p>4. How did Spherity Achieve the ISO 27001 Certification?</p>(Photo from Envato&nbsp;Element)<p>In 2020, the Management started the process of getting ISO 27001 compliant as well as striving to get ourselves certified. Our main goal was to establish a solid system to protect the interests of our customers, investors, employees, and partners. Knowing that cyber threats are increasing, the management decided to identify information as an essential value of Spherity’s main business operations. Under this spirit we have then decided to build an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in accordance with ISO/IEC&nbsp;27001.</p><p>To increase security and credibility, Spherity needed to implement the ISO standard throughout the entire organization. Now certified in one of the highest information and data security standards, Spherity’s ISMS is thus applicable to all business areas, processes, assets, technologies, facilities, organizational units and people. The ISMS provides the framework for protection of all information assets, which are collected, stored, processed and transferred in digital or paper-based format.</p><p>With the introduction of an ISMS according to ISO 27001, Spherity has made a clear commitment towards security and incorporated it into its business goals and the corporate philosophy–being the first digital identity company that is ISO 27001 certified.</p><p>5. What are the steps in achieving such certifications?</p><p>To start the journey, an internal ISO task force from different departments of the organization was created. We hired <a href="https://mabs40.de.com/">Mabs4.0</a> information security consultancy to support building a new&nbsp;ISMS.</p><p>From our team, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marius-goebel/">Marius Goebel</a> was appointed as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to first lead the certification project, and secondly to maintain the system after the certification. Marius received several training in terms of Information Security and Data Protection, along with a certification as Information Security Officer by the German&nbsp;TÜV.</p><p>Later in the same year, Spherity successfully received the ISO 27001 certification issued by the German TÜV Rheinland, marking the project as a success. Since then, Spherity has trained staff with regular Information Security Awareness training, fostering the organization’s Information Security philosophy. Being ISO 27001 certified helped us to also receive the <a href="https://learning.sap.com/certification">SAP Cloud Certification</a> for our U.S. pharma market SaaS offering (our Credentialing Service, <a href="http://www.caro.vc">CARO</a>). This achievement is due to our processes and application requirements which are of a high standard (according to ISO&nbsp;27001).</p><p>“Our ISO compliance has been recognized by our customers like <a href="https://www.novartis.com/">Novartis</a> or <a href="https://www.jnj.com/">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a>. It significantly simplified our onboarding as a supplier.” says Marius Goebel, CISO at Spherity.</p><p>Currently, our infrastructure is running through a Well-Architected Review with our partner <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/free/?trk=6d6043e7-7411-4256-9ef3-97d3b516ace6&amp;sc_channel=ps&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!444351556521!e!!g!!aws&amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966B4cUArpIWXKpjHUWUlAS54OxtX0SR_zz32DOkH6lfuSENz_D5ECXUaAg7fEALw_wcB:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!444351556521!e!!g!!aws">AWS</a> to increase infrastructure resilience and security. In addition, we are also looking forward to receiving the AWS certification in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>6. How did Spherity keep the risks&nbsp;low?</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/niclas-mietz-794053115/">Niclas Mietz</a> joined Spherity in 2021 as Senior DevOps Engineer and was appointed as Deputy CISO. The team analyzed the entire organization to find weak points and implemented several security measures throughout the organization. Our team is continuously implementing measures that aim to increase the organization’s security, performance, and resilience at every corner. Aside from the external audits conducted by the German TÜV, we perform frequent internal audits alongside regular calls with AWS. In addition, we also have successfully conducted penetration testing for infrastructure and our applications. In order to monitor the organization’s security performance, the Information Security team has implemented a comprehensive KPI system. Once a year, the management and the security team evaluate the system’s performance frequently. To further improve the organization’s security and to support the organization’s business goals, we also define security objectives for the upcoming 12&nbsp;months.</p><p>You can find more information about our <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/spherity-achieves-iso-27001-certification-f687ee42c40e">ISO 27001 certification</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/spherity-successfully-achieves-sap-certified-cloud-solution-status-19e144e35672">SAP certification</a> on our <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">medium</a>.

<p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! This week, we have covered the Biden administration’s push for tougher crypto regulations to the US Treasury red flagging abuse of crypto mixing services by malicious actors. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Biden Administration Calls for Stronger Crypto Regulation (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3490248-karine-jean-pierre-makes-debut-as-white-house-press-secretary/">Image Source</a>)<p>In the aftermath of the much-debated FTX collapse, US President Joe Biden’s administration has underlined the need for stronger regulatory controls over&nbsp;crypto.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1594396130544173059?s=20&amp;t=etwmTkA1garq6QzWsbuFKw">Image Source</a>)<p>Recently, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre highlighted the risks of the lack of crypto asset regulation.</p><blockquote>She said, “without proper oversight, crypto risks harming everyday Americans, so this is something that we see as an important issue, but the most recent issues further underscore and prove why prudent oversight of cryptocurrencies is indeed&nbsp;needed.”</blockquote><p>The statement comes just after the recently concluded G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, where leadership called for proactive regulation of digital assets. They also called for enhancing public awareness of risks, reinforcing regulatory results, and ensuring a fair playing field while leveraging innovation advantages, per the G20 leaders’ statement released on the White House&nbsp;website.</p><p>The leaders of the G20 member nations have also welcomed FSB’s approach of creating a comprehensive global framework for regulating crypto based on the ‘same activity, same risk, same regulation’ principle.</p> Unregulated Crypto Threat to Global Financial Stability — FSB&nbsp;Official (<a href="https://money.com/bitcoin-bottom-how-low-crypto-prices-drop/">Image Source</a>)<p>The ongoing turmoil in the crypto market is a much-needed catalyst for the Financial Stability Board (FSB). As such, it is giving “all the more reason” to the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to develop a globally consistent regulatory framework, said Steven Maijoor, head of the agency’s working group on crypto&nbsp;assets.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/turbolamer1/status/1593216864527720450?s=20&amp;t=etwmTkA1garq6QzWsbuFKw">Image Source</a>)<p>The unbelievable growth of cryptocurrencies, coupled with a lack of regulations and structural vulnerabilities, means these nascent ascent class will “soon reach a point where they represent a threat to the stability of the global financial system,” said Maijoor at the Institutional Digital Assets and Crypto Regulation Symposium last week in&nbsp;London.</p><p>He further said that such a high level of information asymmetry is very-much in characteristics of cryptocurrencies, so it “cannot simply be considered a&nbsp;fad.”</p><p>Moreover, the cross-border nature of crypto assets is particularly a “challenge for national supervisors,” requiring a coordinated cross-border response, which is “exactly what the FSB is working on,” Maijoor&nbsp;said.</p><blockquote>“Crypto activities in many ways resemble the activities of traditional finance,” and as such, these activities should be regulated on the “same activity, same risk” principle, he&nbsp;said.</blockquote> ISDA to Publish Standards for Crypto Derivatives (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isda.asp">Image Source</a>)<p>The ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) chief executive says they are planning to publish its standardized documentation for the OTC crypto market by the end of the&nbsp;year.</p><blockquote>“The recent extreme volatility in this asset class has brought some important questions to the fore,” said ISDA chief Scott O’Malia at the Japan Derivatives Forum. “Among the most important is what rights investors have in the event of a bankruptcy of a crypto exchange or wallet provider. At the moment, the answer is not always entirely&nbsp;clear.”</blockquote><p>O’Malia wants to have the same legal certainty in the OTC crypto derivatives asset class that exists in other derivatives markets. The new standards, according to him, “will reflect the specific characteristics of the crypto&nbsp;market.”</p><p>O’Malia said at the event that they are not only focusing on legal and documentation issues but also a risk-appropriate capital framework.</p><p>ISDA will also consider developing collateral documentation for OTC crypto derivatives markets along with standard contracts for swaps and physically-settled transactions.</p> US Treasury Wants Crypto Industry to Prevent Mixers’ Abuse by Illicit&nbsp;Actors (<a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/revolver-spotlight-elizabeth-rosenberg/">Image Source</a>)<p>“I recognize that (the crypto) industry has unique insight into illicit finance threats,” remarked Elizabeth Rosenberg, Treasury Assistant Secretary, on the feedback received from crypto market participants on the Biden Administration’s Executive Order on Digital&nbsp;Assets.</p><p>Stronger two-way dialogue, according to her, can “strengthen the US government’s understanding of technological innovations and changes, as well as create greater opportunities for industry to identify areas where these innovations may result in regulatory uncertainty.”</p><p>Public blockchains can be used to support AML/CFT compliance, said Rosenberg while acknowledging that crypto users may prefer privacy while engaging in crypto transactions.</p><p>While the White House wants to ensure that “safeguards are in place to promote the responsible development of virtual assets to maintain privacy and shield against arbitrary or unlawful surveillance,” the challenge is with mixers that illicit actors abuse to launder funds, Rosenberg said.</p><p>To prevent this, the White House needs the crypto industry to take clear steps aligned with AML regulations and sanctions obligations, she&nbsp;added.</p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer! (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1562430776326508544?s=20&amp;t=r5jER9JyQxGazRPmVlv5mQ">Image Source</a>)<p>After Shyft DAO approved the Veriscope VASP grant proposal, an aggregate of 10,000 SHFT has been granted for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that integrate to the Veriscope mainnet by September 30, 2022. The fund will enable VASPs to pay the Shyft Network gas fees while using Veriscope. This offer will remain valid until December 31, 2022, or till the VASP exhausts its SHFT&nbsp;grant.</p> Interesting Reads: <p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-council-at-ukraines-securities-watchdog-to-draft-crypto-taxation-regulations/">New Council at Ukraine’s Securities Watchdog to Draft Crypto Taxation Regulations</a></p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cftc-commissioner-mersinger-says-the-time-has-come-for-action-on-crypto-regulation">CFTC Commissioner Mersinger says the time has come for action on crypto regulation</a></p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/aussie-treasurer-promises-crypto-regulation-next-year-amid-ftx-debacle">Aussie treasurer promises crypto regulation next year amid FTX&nbsp;debacle</a></p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

				  Our regular review of recent news from around the decentralized identity community. In this edition, advice for financial institutions, how more global equality can be achieved through digital identity, and how following regulations does not always mean your data is secure.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202211/digital-identity-and-social-media-the-big-picture">Digital Identity and Social Media – the Big Picture</a><br>As Ingo Rube, founder of KILT Protocol, a decentralized identity blockchain network, explains, “Digital identity on the internet is fundamentally broken.” He describes the difference between identity — everything that makes you who you are as a person, your name, education, job, hair color, family, etc — and a credential, something that tells people or systems who you are, and which is usually issued by an organization or government in the form of an ID card, passport etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credentials like ID cards work because we control them: we use them to access things in the real world; and if someone else tried to use one belonging to us, it would likely not work as the photo wouldn’t match. There is, in other words, something in a physical credential that signifies unique ownership and, as with passports, features that signify the credential is authentic and not fake. These don’t always work but they represent an identity layer that the internet, for historical reasons, lacks. Instead, third-party platforms like Facebook function through user profiles so that you can log in to, and have a presence, both on Facebook and affiliated websites. This is known as federated identity. The trade off is that Facebook and other federated identity providers are able to track your activity and sell the data you generate online to other parties. At the same time, your profile data is stored in centralized databases that become prime targets for attackers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rube ends by calling for a decentralized identity solution using verifiable credentials that could be stored on our local devices – such as a mobile phone. We agree!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aba.com/news-research/research-analysis/The-Growing-Significance-of-Trusted-Digital-Identities-in-US-Financial-Services">The Growing Significance of Trusted Digital Identities in U.S. Financial Services</a><br>A new report by the American Bankers Association takes a look at the increasing reliance on digital identities by the financial sector and what the sector can do to take advantage of developments in digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three major customer-facing areas where strong digital identity solutions can mitigate fraud – which according to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-2021">Consumer Sentinel Network Data Book 2021</a> by the Federal Trade Commission increased by 120% during the pandemic. These three areas are:</p>
<p>KYC — Is this identity valid? Is this the customer’s identity?<br>Authentication — does the system recognize these credentials?&nbsp;<br>Transaction authorization — what is the risk of the transaction? Should this transaction be allowed to go through?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weaknesses in any of these areas can result in fraudulent activity. To prevent this, the most important thing is to strengthen up-front verification of credentials. This is because attempting to suppress fraud at the transaction stage of a purchase or money withdrawal is more difficult, especially as transactions become faster and the system only has so much time to infer if there has been fraud or not. Stronger checks upstream lead to less fraudulent identities and less fraud over all</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/28/digital-identity-verification-can-lead-to-a-more-equitable-future/?sh=2f9ddb5d5ab3">Digital Identity Verification Can Lead To A More Equitable Future</a><br>Blake Hall, CEO of ID.me, discusses the increased need for digital identity online and specifically addresses the growing demand for virtual access to government benefits and medical documents. Demand has been rising not only due to the recent global pandemic, but also as governments take interest in the technology as they realize the financial incentive, with a recent report from the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-identification-a-key-to-inclusive-growth">McKinsey Global Institute</a> showing that countries that implement a digital identity system could increase their GDP by 3-13%. The UN also recognizes the benefits of more portable and secure digital identity in itsSustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 16.9 (“<a href="https://unstats.un.org/legal-identity-agenda/">legal identity for all, including birth registration, by 2030</a>“). Hall points out how an increase in access to digital identity will lead to a more equitable future as certain demographics, including people without banks, homes, or non-English speakers, typically have a harder time meeting the identity verification requirements that are currently in place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/11/02/when-regulations-dont-do-enough-to-protect-critical-infrastructure-digital-identity-can-help/?sh=710da3c37bcf">When Regulations Don’t Do Enough To Protect Critical Infrastructure, Digital Identity Can Help</a><br>This article contributed to Forbes by Wes Wright, CTO at Imprivita, highlights the current cyber threats to healthcare, manufacturing, and the supply chain. Wright notes that while the government has been issuing regulations for the past 20 years, it has failed to keep personal data safe. Technology is advancing fast, and even compliance with the strictest regulations does not ensure that an organization’s “attack surface” is protected. The traditional “perimeter” or “wall” around most organizations is obsolete, as Chase Cunningham explained in a <a href="https://indicio.tech/decentralization-and-the-future-of-enterprise-security/">recent Indicio article</a>, and too many people from all around the organization need remote access to too much data. The only realistic way to ensure that the right people have access to sensitive information is through a strong digital identity solution.

<p>1) Two of the primary issues that <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>currently faces are bots and a lack of a proper check for recognizing real users and business brands from these bots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Both these problems can be solved with a single solution - By issuing credentials to individuals and brands. Users can pay for the check, and the issued credential can be used on <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>as well as is interoperable and can function anywhere on the web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) The credentials should work on the Web3 standard and could be integrated by <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter</a>’s team tomorrow. Moreover, new products and services can be launched from this starting point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Decentralized Identities (DIDs)/credentials can enable payments (SelfKey uses DID:ETH as a starting point), so <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>can try new business models - like <a href="https://t.co/6VR3M0tkkV">http://earn.com</a>, started by <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">@balajis</a>, which allows users to pay to message certain people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Imagine being able to message all verified crypto CEOs and ensure the message lands in their DM. That’s cool, but it’s somewhat transactional. <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>needs to go public again - but public investors love recurring revenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) How can we get a recurring revenue model to maximize shareholder value? Imagine a ‘closed circle’ on <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>where you could connect pseudonymously with other verified business owners (who perhaps have submitted proof of ownership over a company/organization).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) Furthermore, the same ‘closed circle’ of crypto CEOs (a userbase with discretionary spending, who, by and large, respect and admire <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">@elonmusk</a>) require a monthly access fee.<br>
8) Use this exact same <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>codebase but with a paywall, and facilitate occasional ‘masterminds’ (exclusive <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces">@TwitterSpaces</a>) again based on credentials. This will unlock value for users by connecting them to like-minded individuals to help each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9) Even further, <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>feeds could be filtered/customized to show posts from users that have a certain credential (republican, millionaire, business owner), which allows users to find and subscribe to new closed circles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10) TL;DR </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter</a> can solve the identity issue, become an integral provider of decentralized identity for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hashtag_click">#Web3</a> (or <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/web5?src=hashtag_click">#web5</a>? whatever <a href="https://twitter.com/jack">@jack</a> calls it nowadays), and find new recurring revenue streams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11)<a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter</a> can start by rolling this internally or opening up APIs so external companies can do it. <a href="https://twitter.com/SelfKey">@SelfKey</a> has a decentralized identity protocol founded by <a href="https://t.co/YfWDhaC7nu">http://KYC-Chain.com</a> (a b2b KYC SAAS tool) and can enable what’s described above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12) We’ve barely scratched the surface in this - there are much more, starting with the POI/Sybil attack prevention mechanisms discussed in the <a href="https://bit.ly/3ES1YgN">latest whitepaper</a>, composable NFTs, new revenue for <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter</a> avatars, monetization of TwitterUsernames/DIDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">@elonmusk</a> Contact <a href="https://twitter.com/SelfKey">@SelfKey</a>, the future of <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter</a> and free speech - depends on it. And our devs won’t walk out on you!</p>

</p><p>On the 22nd of Oct, 2022, we integrated <a href="https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/">Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF)</a> into the AutoBET lucky draw ecosystem on Polygon mainnet to help increase the transparency of game operations. By doing so, we were able to improve upon traditional lucky draw game platforms and bring unparalleled transparency to players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In support of the continued growth and maturation of our decentralized infrastructure, we have now expanded our Chainlink service integration to include <a href="http://automation.chain.link">Chainlink Automation</a>—the leading smart contract automation service in Web3. By integrating Chainlink Automation, we were able to build automatic time-based triggers that help execute result announcements and player payouts.</p>



<p>The combination of Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Automation enables a new era of transparent, tamper-proof, and end-to-end automated AutoBET processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key Results&nbsp;</p>



<p>● Unbiased result declaration&nbsp;<br>● Many engineering hours saved&nbsp;<br>● Decreased gas fees&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Creating Unparalleled Lucky Draw Game Transparency With Chainlink VRF&nbsp;</p>



<p>For decades, traditional lucky draw game systems have been opaque, requiring players to implicitly put their faith in game operators to act honestly. AutoBET lucky draw games are different.<br><br>With the help of Chainlink VRF, AutoBET games are underpinned by a tamper-proof and verifiably random number generator. These provably fair random numbers are then used to determine game outcomes, giving all players sky-high assurances—Web3 assurances—of fair gameplay.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Triggering Smart Contract Execution With Chainlink Automation&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decentralized automation through the Chainlink Automation service accomplishes key goals. Time-based triggers give AutoBET the ability to preschedule lucky draw games on specific future dates. Chainlink Automation Nodes will trigger Chainlink VRF to receive a random number—used to determine the winner—and subsequently execute an automatic payout of the winning amount to the winner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a nutshell, Chainlink Automation helps further decentralize AutoBET’s lucky draw game platform by enabling end-to-end execution of our games.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Looking Ahead: Becoming a Leading Player in Web3 Gaming&nbsp;</p>

 What the burgeoning sector could learn from the grown-up incumbent banks. 



 



<p>Day-to-day operations for fintechs may vary, but the ethos is often the same: disrupt, break things, and seek forgiveness instead of permission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there comes a point where a small business, if it wants to become a big business, must mature. The price of entry to the blue-chip club is cast iron systems and controls, and with billions of dollars in revenue and reputational value at stake there can be no margin for error.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technology will always outstrip the pace of regulation, and so every company in a heavily supervised industry such as financial services will eventually face questions of how to proceed through uncertainty. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we see time and time again how compliance is an afterthought, particularly for start-ups who can grow at an incredible pace. Putting systems in after-the-fact rarely ends well, as regulators increasingly take a dim view of any business that ignores risk or puts customers in jeopardy for any period.</p>



<blockquote><p>Having cast iron KYC controls baked in from the outset is the only way to prevent problems and massive fines occurring.</p>Mike Kiely, Sales Director, Financial Services at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>The new breed of challenger and digital banks has experienced both the good and bad rub of incredible growth. The speed at which they can onboard customers and provide access to services, often in minutes despite having no physical branches, has left the incumbent high street stalwarts in the dust. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It has also changed customer expectations. Mobile channels, chatbots, instant help, instant access 24/7/365 are all a far cry from the days of business banking, where entrepreneurs would have to work around bank opening hours, and often wait weeks for accounts to be opened.&nbsp;</p>



 Under pressure. 



<p>“Money laundering enforcement and regulation have been in the spotlight in many regions around the world,” said Abi Hollinger, AML and due diligence expert at law firm Miller &amp; Chevalier. “Signs point to this trend continuing and we are likely to see money laundering prosecutions employed for specific US policy aims as well, including in the context of efforts against Russia and Belarus in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) continues to be an active global regulator, most notably regarding the implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act and Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA). Cryptocurrency businesses are also likely to face <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-interview-brandi-reynolds/">extended pressure</a> and an increased focus from enforcement officials on their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a>, Hollinger said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s the same story across Europe, where the most recent updates to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> added a renewed focus on sources of finance, including<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identification-requirement-for-prepaid-cards/"> pre-paid cards</a> and cryptocurrencies. Prior regulations introduced the concept of beneficial ownership, where the ultimate owners of legal entities are recorded centrally. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A global leader in financial regulation, Britain recently enacted tougher economic crime laws that will force companies to improve their identity verification processes or risk criminal prosecution for failure.</p>

 Blurred lines and flashing red lights. 



<p>The incredible speed at which fintechs are growing, with valuations to match, has already caught the eye of enforcement teams. In April, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned of <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/multi-firm-reviews/financial-crime-controls-at-challenger-banks#lf-chapter-id-key-findings">inadequate due diligence procedures</a> evident in the customer acquisition and identity screening departments of digital banks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where these challenger banks promote the ability to open accounts very quickly to attract customers, there is a risk that information gathered at the account opening stage is insufficient to identify higher risk customers,” the FCA said in a note to money-laundering officers. &nbsp;</p>



<p>After conducting a sweep of the sector, the regulator found most of the firms hadn’t obtained customer income and occupation details, “resulting in an incomplete assessment of the purpose and intended nature of a customer’s relationship with the bank.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The regulator <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/dear-ceo-letter-common-control-failings-identified-in-anti-money-laundering-frameworks.pdf">warned digital bank CEOs</a> that there were too many examples of lines becoming blurred across compliance departments, as individuals took on too many jobs, or tasks that could be executed faster and more accurately with technology. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“The implications of this are that first line employees often do not own or fully understand the financial crime risk faced by the firm, impacting their ability to identify and tackle potentially suspicious activity,” the FCA said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The reliance on manual processes also restricts the ability of compliance personnel to independently monitor and test the control framework, which can lead to gaps in the understanding of risk exposure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond the smaller, more nimble digital challengers, many of these deficiencies have plagued the systemically important global banking sector for many years. <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/natwest-fined-264.8million-anti-money-laundering-failures">NatWest</a> and <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-hsbc-bank-plc-deficient-transaction-monitoring-controls">HSBC</a> have both endured heavy enforcement action from the FCA, while Credit Suisse was found <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61957774">guilty in a Swiss court</a> of laundering a Bulgarian drug dealers’ cash. &nbsp;</p>



<p>UK regulators handed down a record level of AML penalties to banks in 2021, and experts expect this trend to continue as the FCA increasingly pursues criminal prosecutions. Cases inflated UK anti-money laundering fines to $672 million in 2021, more than tripling from $206 million in 2020, <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/uk-anti-money-laundering-fines-hit-record-as-watchdog-seeks-criminal-convictions-68630335">according to research</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The times of quiet warnings or small penalties are well and truly over. It is simply not worth the risk to have inadequate KYC controls in place. Firms may be unaware of the actual risk they’re managing, but without that understanding they cannot apply appropriate controls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Next generation financial crime controls.&nbsp; 



<p>KYC is one of the most important regulatory and compliance obligations a fintech must meet. Key steps in the process involve establishing and validating customer identity, understanding the nature of customers’ activities, and where funds originated. With this information, a firm can assess potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For traditional banks, this process would have been undertaken by accounts managers, and would involve the customer handing over various forms of ID and other bits of proof, usually in person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the weaknesses in the financial crime controls identified by regulators begin with KYC data failures, and how high-risk customer due diligence is managed manually. These slow, error-strewn processes are hindering efforts to protect data and keep customers safe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulators have been keen to stress that weaknesses in the onboarding stage will undermine everything else that follows. Some firms previously relied on their transaction monitoring capabilities to spot red flags and high-risk customers, until enforcement officials stepped in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No matter how good a transaction monitoring system is, firms must still comply with the relevant customer due diligence [CDD] requirements,” the FCA said. “Moreover, inadequate CDD will mean a less effective transaction monitoring system.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another industry problem is the reliance on siloed data and other manual processes, which is a hangover from the pre-cloud computing days of legacy technology. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We often identify instances where CDD measures are not adequately performed or recorded. This includes seeking information on the purpose and intended nature of a customer relationship (where appropriate) and assessments of that information,” the FCA <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/dear-ceo-letter-common-control-failings-identified-in-anti-money-laundering-frameworks.pdf">said in 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As remote verification processes have historically been easier to bypass with fake documents, a business must tackle the problem by implementing technology that uses additional layers of authentication like NFC chip authentication and/or hologram detection and biometric verification, such as facial recognition or video verification to their onboarding process.&nbsp;</p>



 The future of KYC.&nbsp; 



<p>A reliance on spreadsheets to track clients for AML and KYC purposes is setting the business, whether fintech or incumbent, up to fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last decade, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uae-fintech-challenges-opportunities/">financial technology</a> has turned this process on its head. Identify verification has become a digitized process that can be executed in minutes, via a smartphone, using artificial intelligence and machine learning tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Automated, intelligent and API-based solutions are creating new opportunities to dramatically streamline and enhance KYC monitoring and compliance.</p>



<blockquote><p>As technology and analytics capabilities grow, regulators are challenging the traditional cyclical periodic-based view of the frequency of KYC updates.</p>Scott Mandell, EY Financial Crime Compliance Leader.</blockquote>



<p>Regulated firms that are serious about compliance need to be aware of the risk certain customers may carry, and many financial institutions have been fined for not completing periodic high-risk customer (or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">politically exposed person</a>) reviews. High-risk customers are typically reviewed every year, compared to medium-risk customers reviewed every three years, and low-risk customers every five years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With such pressure on financial institutions to do more, the traditional periodic reviews process is making way for a more dynamic, continuous KYC approach.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Automating aspects of the process, such as around customer profiles or risk ratings, reduce the burden on legacy systems and can pinpoint problems faster, thereby reducing the window for criminals to attempt to launder funds. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We expect to see more firms adopt continuous KYC and move away from static one, three, and five-year review cycles,” said Mandell.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fintech firms looking to streamline their identity verification process can now implement fully digitized and AML-compliant software underpinned by a global network of identity and fraud specialists to identify users. This digital onboarding process can be used across a variety of formats, from opening a bank account to mortgage loan agreements or onboarding gamers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When combined with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML screening and monitoring</a>, it can slash implementation time alongside efficiency gains in the onboarding process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Intelligent solutions such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> meet these KYC and data collection requirements head on, without risk of human error creeping into the process. AI-powered solutions also offer multijurisdictional coverage, which will crucially enable UK-based companies to continue operating in the EU without concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow provides the most powerful, configurable, and secure platform for identity proofing. Whether automated or expert-assisted, our identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversions or the consumer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is vital for UK fintech firms to invest in the right AML/ KYC technology in order to protect themselves and their customers from fraud, thereby saving potentially billions in fines and reputational damage,” added Kiely.</p>



<p>2022 has witnessed record growth for fintechs, but wherever there are opportunities, there is increased competition, and greater scrutiny from regulators. Read more in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fraud-fines-fintechs/">Fintechs, fraud, fines</a>.</p>

 Un appuntamento annuale unico nel panorama HR in Italia, dove i più grandi esperti nel settore si sono confrontati per individuare insieme soluzioni per il mondo del lavoro.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Dal 18 al 20 Novembre, Anna Maria Testa – HR Director in InfoCert ha partecipato a Firenze all’evento “<a href="https://www.officinarisorseumane.it/">Officina delle risorse umane”</a>, organizzato da HR Link con gli Stati Generali del mondo del lavoro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nel corso dell’evento, una rosa di professionisti Top HR è entrata in contatto con referenti istituzionali, opinion leader ed esperti con l’obiettivo di dare forma al futuro del lavoro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ogni tavolo dell’evento aveva un focus su una tematica attuale specifica ed è stato strutturato secondo una dinamica capace di facilitare la discussione e favorire il confronto, così da definire un documento di proposta che sarà poi indirizzato al Ministero del Lavoro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anna Maria Testa ha partecipato al tavolo di lavoro dedicato a tematiche inerenti l’ambito di Diversity &amp; Inclusion, un ecosistema variegato che richiede un forte investimento da parte di tutti gli stakeholder e una gestione in ottica integrata&nbsp;</p>

Dal 2009, ad esempio, collaboriamo con cooperativa Giotto, una cooperativa che ha la missione di creare opportunità di lavoro con alti standard qualitativi, di sostenere le persone, anche se in situazioni di svantaggio. Ad oggi contiamo complessivamente su&nbsp;110 operatori della cooperativa.&nbsp;Molti di loro sono detenuti del carcere di Padova che attraverso il lavoro facilitano il loro percorso di reinserimenti in società.” <br><br>Anna Maria Testa – HR Director InfoCert&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p>A SIM swapping scam can not only take over your phone but can also become detrimental to your financial health as scammers can steal bank logins or data.</p>
<p>What does SIM swapping do? SIM swapping can cause scammers to have control over your phone number. They do this by tricking your phone carrier into activating a SIM card under your phone number, so the scammer now has control over your phone communications, not you.</p>
 How Do SIM Cards Work? 
<p>If you have a cell phone, you know that subscriber identity module (SIM) cards exist and that they are part of linking that cell phone to your carrier. This card contains a chip containing critical identifying information that allows your device to connect securely to a wireless network. This card must use a device to make calls or exchange data on that network.</p>
<p>Each card contains specific information for identification purposes. This information will usually include:</p>
 
 Advice of Charge (AoC): This information helps estimate charges based on calls and data usage for display on the device, for information to end users about their upcoming bill. 
 Mobile Country Code (MCC): As the name suggests, this code denotes the country you’re calling from. 
 Local Area Identity: This number combines the MCC and your telephone number as an identifier on the mobile network. 
 Service Dialing Number: Service dialing numbers are provider-specific numbers that a user can call to get specific information–for example, dialing a three-digit number to connect directly to customer service or to get your balance. 
 Service Provider Name: The name of your mobile provider (T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, etc.). 
 Short Message Service Center (SMCC): This information includes recent SMS texts received and sent by the device. 
 Integrated circuit card identifier (ICCID): This is the unique ID number of the card itself, containing (like a credit card number) a significant industry identifier (MII), individual account identification numbers, and a check digit. 
 International mobile subscriber identity (IMSI): This number uses the MCC and other information to identify the user on the network. If the ICCID is the unique ID of the SIM card itself, the IMSI is the user’s unique ID. 
 Authentication Key: The encrypted key (typically 128 bits) used to authenticate the device on the mobile networks. 
 
<p>As you might have noticed, the SIM card is an essential part of cellular communication and serves as a critical piece of hardware to keep the use of mobile networks secure. Likewise, these cards (and their information) are a dangerous attack surface in the realm of cybersecurity and identity fraud.</p>
 What Is SIM Swapping? 
<p>If a phone number is linked to a SIM card, then the device using that SIM card controls that number. So, for example, if someone were to take your SIM card and put it into their phone, they’d be able to interact with your mobile account and phone number–regardless of whether or not they have your physical phone.</p>
<p>This is SIM swapping. A hacker uses some form of attack to trick your carrier into switching your phone number from your current SIM card to one in their possession. Once they’ve done this, they control that number, meaning they can send and receive calls, text messages, and other information using that number.</p>
<p>This seems like a tall order, however–even for sophisticated hackers. But with the glut of information available publicly and through peripheral hacks, cybercriminals can construct profiles they can use to steal SIM access.</p>
<p>These avenues of attack include:</p>
 
 Uncoordinated Breaches: As hackers make attacks against centralized data targets (like those held by major corporations or political agencies and nonprofits), they sell or disseminate your data on dark web networks. 
 
<p>Over time, intelligent hacker groups will compile massive databases where they can connect a user’s information across multiple accounts and platforms.</p>
 
 Data Scraping: Outside of illegal hacking, many organizations use software to scrape entire websites’ contents. While this data is often public, it can fill in gaps in stolen data sets to help attacks build complex profiles of victims, connecting login credentials, authentication and identity information, and user behaviors across hundreds of systems. 
 Social Engineering: Social engineering is still one of the most common forms of attack. A hacker can use information gained elsewhere to trick users and mobile companies to give over information or perform actions against the will of that end user. 
 
<p>And this is how SIM swapping works. A hacker or group of hackers gathers and collates data across public website scraping and data breaches, creating profiles of users across platforms. With enough information, these hackers can begin attempts to contact mobile carriers.</p>
<p>While these carriers will almost always ask security and verification questions to vet their contacts, a hacker with enough information can quickly respond to these challenges. At this point, they can claim that they lost or damaged their SIM card and, having purchased a new one, need to connect a new (the user’s) phone number to that SIM.</p>
<p>With their success, the hacker can essentially circumvent SMS-based MFA measures. If the user connects their email to SMS MFA, the hacker can gain access, lock the account, and use that as a platform for identity fraud and theft.</p>
 Protecting Against SIM Swapping Online 
<p>With that breakdown, it might seem like protecting yourself against SIM swapping is completely out of your hands. Like any other type of fraud, however, solid approaches to cyber hygiene can minimize this threat.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
 
 Use Carrier-Specific Protections: Many mobile providers will offer programs that help prevent SIM swapping. These security measures will include additional features in your online account or full-fledged security services added to your accounts. These are good to know and better to implement. 
 Adopt MFA Without SMS: If your multi-factor authentication is tied to your SMS (through a one-time password) and your SIM is stolen, then the hacker can use that access to compromise those accounts. It’s better to move to software-based MFA or even passwordless authentication. 
 Restrict Usage of Personal Data: It’s understandable to confuse social media with secure media, but in today’s data-driven crime, posting personal data anywhere offers hackers an attack surface. 
 
<p>This isn’t a call for paranoia but a call for responsibility… try to keep personal information, like phone numbers, addresses, banking institutions, or other platforms you use.</p>
 
 Stay Aware of Social Engineering: When it comes down to it, it’s most likely that if your SIM card is compromised, then it’s probably because they were able to get information from you or your provider. 
 
<p>On your part, stay away from suspicious texts and emails, and if anyone calls representing themselves as your mobile provider, do not believe them. Only trust direct calls to your provider initiated by you using contact information gathered from their website.</p>
 Bolster Your Defense Against SIM Swapping with 1Kosmos 
<p>So, SIM swapping seems dangerous and complicated to get around. If someone grabs your info and initiates a swap, it seems like the game is up. But this isn’t the case.</p>
<p>Strong authentication built into decentralized apps that avoid SMS and email MFA can ensure that, even if a SIM is compromised, every connected account doesn’t immediately fall. Passwordless authentication can also go a long way toward separating strong authentication from compromised mobile devices without compromising usability.</p>

  The SEC filed 760 total enforcement actions &amp; recovered a record $6.4 billion in 2022 across all sectors, including cryptocurrency.  In its report, the agency listed actions against crypto lender BlockFi, insider trading charges against Coinbase employees, fraudulent Ponzi scheme Forsage, &amp; NVIDIA Corporation for inadequate disclosures.  This year, the commission also almost doubled its “Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit” staff, a decision in line with the agency’s plan to reign in the crypto&nbsp;sector.  <p>In its Enforcement Results for the fiscal year 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reported that the agency continues focusing on the rapidly evolving crypto-asset securities space.</p><p>The SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-206">report</a> mentioned crypto as a separate section, also noting that the agency would be adding 20 new positions to its Cyber Unit, renamed into Crypto Assets and Cyber&nbsp;Unit.</p><p>The nearly doubled division continued to investigate potential misconduct in the cryptocurrency space. This led to significant enforcement actions, including charges against BlockFi Lending LLC for failing to register the offers and sales of its retail crypto lending&nbsp;product.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/winsontang/status/1493271079921467393?s=20&amp;t=zukrN8rPHJk5SflccTZjBA">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>The case against BlockFi was the first-of-its-kind action against crypto lending platforms for violating the registration requirements.</blockquote><p>Charges were also brought against 11 individuals for their alleged roles in creating and promoting a fraudulent crypto pyramid and Ponzi scheme called&nbsp;Forsage.</p><p>Another case included insider trading charges against Ishan Wahi, the former product manager at Coinbase, and his associates. The report said Wahi allegedly obtained material non-public information in his former role at the crypto trading platform and tipped his associates ahead of the announcements regarding crypto asset listings.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p>The journey towards digital identity in Germany has been fraught with optimism, failure, and continued persistence. It is currently at a crossroads – consumer and private sector behavior indicate a readiness to embrace digital identity, while the public sector may be vulnerable to path dependency and repeating past mistakes. However, the overall trend is that the new era for digital identity in Germany is arriving: the invitation is sent by the public sector, the solutions being developed by the public sector and in public/private partnerships, and behavior among consumers shifting to accept digital flows. It is up to businesses and service providers to take an active role in leveraging the opportunity of digital identity in Germany by solving concrete use cases through the right technology mix.

<p>These questions originally appeared in an “Ask Me Anything” session in the P2B Exchange Telegram group, in which NuID CEO &amp; Founder Locke Brown answered users' questions about the token Kii, the Nu Identity Ecosystem, and what's on our development roadmap. NuID &amp; The Kii Foundation held a Launchpad Session of Kii on the P2B Exchange from November 3rd-14th, so the AMA provided participants the chance to find out more about the project. Some answers have been modified for formatting.</p><p></p><p>P2B: Our today’s guest is Locke Brown. Thank you very much for joining us, we hope to know more about the idea behind KII and shed light on your future plans. Welcome! <br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>Thanks Jack! Hi everyone. Excited to be here. <br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>Before we start answering questions from our community. &nbsp;Do you want to tell us about you and your project?<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>Absolutely.. I’m Locke Brown – CEO and founder of NuID, which is the tech company behind The Kii Foundation and the token Kii. <br></p><p>I started mining bitcoin in 2013 – had one of the first asic miners from butterfly labs (too bad I didn’t just buy btc instead of mining gear)… Published a paper in 2014 on btc pricing models. I worked briefly for Google and then spent a few years working for Bill Gates' family office before having to jump ship and start NuID in early 2017. <br></p><p>NuID was founded in 2017, launched a trustless authentication solution in 2019, and is VC backed. Our core belief is that the future of the internet belongs to the user. Right now with the current digital identity model, individuals are limited in their ability to own and control their identities. We’ve set the foundation for a portable, user-owned identity platform with our authentication solution, and now we’re bringing it to the world through the Nu Identity Ecosystem and our token Kii. We have 57 claims patented now <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/10880089">https://patents.justia.com/patent/10880089</a> &nbsp;:) <br></p><p>The Kii Foundation is a separate entity that was created to aid with the development and support of Kii and the KiiChain, which is a ledger we’re building to uphold identity-related data.<br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>Thank you! Let's begin:<br></p><p>"What is the role of $KII token in your ecosystem? Could you tell us a bit about the tokenomics of your project?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>It’s worth first noting that while Kii is an erc20 token initially, it will migrate to be the native token for the KiiChain - The KiiChain is an optimized ledger (build super light so full nodes can be run by anyone) for upholding authentication public parameters (public keys). This will incorporate what we call here Proof of Identity consensus. More on that to come!<br></p><p>So Kii is foundational in the Nu Identity Ecosystem and will be behind all transactions interacting with identities on the network. It will be used to register credentials, issue attestations (initially verified identity attestations for KYC, etc). Ultimately, users within the ecosystem will be empowered to decide what identifying data they want to provision, and to whom, and when they share that data, they’ll be using Kii to initiate those transactions.<br><br></p><p>For further tokenomics details, here’s the token allocation breakdown:</p><p>Development &amp; Operations 20%</p><p>Verification Incentive 10%</p><p>Presale 10%</p><p>Public Sale 20%</p><p>Team &amp; Early Contributors 5%</p><p>KiiChain Support 25%</p><p>Development Fund 10%<br></p><p>We conceptualized Kii in 2017 but waited til now to launch once everything was fully live with our ZK auth protocol.<br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>We can warm up with an easy question, namely:<br></p><p>"A common problem is that nowadays most investors are only interested in initial profits and ignore long-term benefits! So can you give them some reasons why they should buy and hold $KII tokens in the long term?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>The best reason is that Kii will have useful utility that generates demand for it early on - We have over 1000 accounts that have API keys using the authentication service - and every business or app that uses NuID Auth, their users inherently create and have NuID credentials. We will be evolving the authentication service to consume Kii for every registered credential. <br></p><p>Kii also will be used for issuing verified identity attestations and much much more.<br></p><p>I'll also add… Short term profits aren't necessarily bad either! When people trade (buy or sell) it only adds liquidity to the markets making trade costs lower in general and adding to the growth and number of Kii holders :)<br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>Sounds exciting, thank you 🤗<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>I'll add to above answers: Fundamentally, we’ve built the infrastructure for a new model of authentication and digital identity, which ends the centralized model of service-owned, service-controlled user data. As we build out core ecosystem services and expand the use-cases, demand for Kii will increase as its use increases with more folks using NuID and registering credentials for web2 login and web3 apps.<br><br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>We’re also excited to hear your answer about:<br></p><p>"What are KII plans for global expansion, what are you currently focusing on, expanding or listing more exchanges, or building your ecosystem or marketing and partnerships?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>Sure! Firstly, I'll say that we are building a critical part of the infrastructure for the future of the internet generally - and that requires doing things absolutely right... No cutting corners. That's why we spent the first three years carefully building out the trustless authentication protocol before launching the foundational authentication solution. We are building a foundation for giants to stand on, and that means it has to be reliable- always. So now is the exciting time where we are really gearing up to bring it to the world. We launched the auth service 2 years ago and have used the time to iterate it to be ready for scale now. And launching Kii is a huge part of the expansion....<br></p><p>One event / incentive we’re excited to bring to life is the 10% allocation of Kii to the Verification Reward Incentive, which means that the first 10 million people to register credentials and receive an identity attestation issued to an authentication credential will be minted 10 free Kii! Not only do we believe the verification incentive is a good strategy, the rollout of the token itself is a way to get NuID into the hands of individuals globally.<br></p><p>After the new year, we also will be increasing focus on developing channel partners with development agencies and such to help get more and more orgs using the auth solution in web2 - and every user of all of those org's users will have registered a NuID credential.<br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>Amazing! Thanks for such detailed answers☺️<br></p><p>"Does #KII have the intent to make its project globally known especially in the regions of the world where crypto is very known and prominent? Or will your project stick as a local project?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>Global absolutely. The idea is that users will be able to use their zk credentials to authenticate across any platform - and can decide to use the same credentials at multiple, or if they want, can spin up new credentials that would not be correlatable to their others (whereas today email addresses let stolen data get correlated which is a big part of why we have so many hacks constantly these days across the web). And what's super cool - is that NuID credentials are based on public key infrastructure and can serve as keys for crypto assets. And since the zk public parameter is registered on the blockchain, you can authenticate from any device anywhere without having to trust anyone or any device to store or secure the private key :). This is all in our Tech whitepaper if interested: <a href="https://nuid.io/pdf/nuid-white-paper.pdf">https://nuid.io/pdf/nuid-white-paper.pdf</a>. <br></p><p>Also! The auth service is open core and completely free to deploy into any app/website etc - it completely replaces the user's authentication workflow with a simple API integration and we have many pre-baked client libraries and language integrations off the shelf. Check it out on our portal <a href="https://portal.nuid.io">https://portal.nuid.io</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>We’re also excited to hear your answer about:<br></p><p>"When we read the whitepaper, the KII token seems to be integrated into the whole process, but for the time being, I think it is not the value it deserves. Will you have events that will expand the use of KII tokens?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>Absolutely. The first two big releases that will organically lead to demand for the token will be 1) making the auth service transact in Kii for credential registrations and 2) the launch of the Verified Identity attestation model for portable VERIFIED identities. In fact, I'm meeting tomorrow with an alcohol delivery app company about using NuID for users' identity verification - so the uses aren't just in the web3 world... they are for everyday services as well.</p><p>It can be hard to demo underlying tech but as we become more and more used and as people see how what we are building over time improves security and reduces friction in the data security and login process and digital asset custody process etc, we think it will become self-evident. But I have to say: THIS IS A LONG PROCESS and global proliferation doesn't happen overnight. <br></p><p>I have said since the beginning that “we play the long game and we play to win.” And I am stubborn on vision but flexible on the journey. <br><br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>That's fascinating! What can you say about this question:<br></p><p>"How is #KII planning to attract users and show that #KII is a tool with better underlying technology and easier, more intuitive development experience? What are the challenges you are trying to solve in the next 6-12 months ?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>The foundational auth solution is built for seamless integration into today's most common tech stacks and frameworks in the web2 world. It's a beautiful bridge to web3. <br></p><p>And you don't even have to be a crypto-native to use it. Kii is the transactional token on the backend so non-crypto folks and companies won't have to know about crypto to use it, even though the system itself consumes the token. <br></p><p><a href="https://kiichain.org">https://kiichain.org</a> has links to both our Kii Whitepaper and the NuID Tech Whitepaper.<br><br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>Nice to hear 😉 Our community also wondered:<br></p><p>"What are the key milestones on your roadmap - both things you have already achieved and things that we can look forward to? &nbsp;Any partnerships and short/long term technical milestones that you want to talk about or bring some attention to?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>After the AMA I can circle back and share more detailed roadmaps if folks would like for both technical and non technical milestones. But the vision is large and there are many so this is not going to be a complete answer right this second, but I will say that my original roadmap slide in 2017 had "Token launch" as the "far out" milestone on the future items. So it is pretty wild to be now checking off the last of that 5 year roadmap we set then. But the two big ones we look forward to in the nearish term after Kii is live are the KYC attestation / verified portable ID rollout and the auth protocol / Kii integration. Two big ones coming as well are then the NuWallet for users to manage their auth credentials for both logins and crypto asset management. And the launch of the KiiChain and migration of Kii to be the native coin there will be a very exciting one too. <br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>Can you share more about:<br></p><p>"The size of the community has an impact on the success of a project. Do you plan to educate both crypto and non-crypto individuals all over the world? Is it possible that countries that do not speak English may be denied access to your Project?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>We have already had someone translate some of our auth protocol documentation into Portuguese and our press release about Kii was syndicated in 150 media channels in over 80 countries and 6 languages. NuID is for everyone and we will strive to ensure inclusion can't be obstructed :)<br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>Thank you for the answer👍</p><p>One more question<br></p><p>"Do you have a telegram channel, Twitter or YouTube channel to promote your project and know the details of your project? Can we learn anything there? can you share this link"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>We have all 3!</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/_NuID">https://twitter.com/_NuID</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/NuID_Kii">https://t.me/NuID_Kii</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRhpPGsKQIydXVEP1XTBloQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRhpPGsKQIydXVEP1XTBloQ</a> <br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>The next question:<br></p><p>"I think the success of a blockchain project needs three essential parts: technology, business adoption(2B), and marketing(2C). I believe in the technology, so I'd like to know more about your business adoption and marketing plan."<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>Well a lot of the answers to previous questions touch on much of this. But more organized and detailed info can be found in the whitepapers.<br></p><p>Specifically B2B adoption: we'll be scaling enterprise rollout of the auth service early next year both directly and via partnerships with development companies. We also plan to launch a web3 initiative to provide secure user-owned auth credentials for the DEX and p2p crypto markets. <br></p><p>Here's links to whitepapers:</p><p>The token sale paper can be read here: <a href="https://docsend.com/view/6nbp4wxqkmvtemfa">https://docsend.com/view/6nbp4wxqkmvtemfa</a></p><p>Our tech white paper can be read here: <a href="https://nuid.io/pdf/nuid-white-paper.pdf">https://nuid.io/pdf/nuid-white-paper.pdf</a> <br></p><p>And Twitter should use NuID for the blue checkmark identity verification haha :) That may help fix the debacle that they just faced. These have all been great questions! We're very excited about where we are at and everything to come!<br></p><p>P2B:<br></p><p>"What are the problems your project is solving that other projects aren't capable of solving?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>Portable user-owned digital identity and a lot of related exciting features. Follow us to stay tuned as we continue building and read prior answers and our resources for a far more complete answer :)<br><br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>We have a few more questions. So we continue:<br></p><p>"Can you tell us what is the main role of your token in the ecosystem? What are the real world utilities &amp; use cases?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>It is at the heart of all transactions. Initially, the biggest use there is to facilitate credential registration and attestation issuance and later, Kii will migrate to be the native coin for the KiiChain - an optimized ledger for public credential parameters and identity related data index whereby Kii will be the baked in “Kii” to register user public keys. <br><br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>"Do you have tutorial videos so we can get to know your project more clearly or do you have a YouTube channel or something? Can you share it with us?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pjraPbKUsCs">https://youtu.be/pjraPbKUsCs</a> <br></p><p>P2B:<br></p><p>"Trust is very important in business. So, what makes investors, customers and users feel safe when working with Your project? And how will you get the trust of many users that have negative thoughts about Blockchain and DeFi?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>Trust is earned over a lifetime and can be lost in a second. We are doing what we set out to do and the last 6 years shows that. Separately, this is a special question because Trust is such a core concept related to what we are doing - which is minimizing the trust you have to put into so many different parts of the entire process of transacting online. As an example, our existing Trustless authentication service (see the portal.nuid.io) completely eliminates the need to trust a service to store and protect your login data when you use their service because we eliminate the need for passwords and such to be stored.<br></p><p>And the best part… you don't have to trust us with the private data either. It never gets shared. And because of our open model, if we disappeared tomorrow, your credential would persist.<br></p><p>But ultimately the only way I'll get the trust to continue building this ecosystem will be by doing it - and that's what we're doing. <br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>We also want to hear the answer on this question:<br></p><p>"What competitive advantages does the zero knowledge protocol leveraged by KII offer over existing solely device-based identity approaches that are widely used in the industry?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>Great Question<br></p><p>1) it's not tied to a device so could authenticate from any device using knowledge-based secrets. But a device-based biometric can also be registered as a NuID zk credential and users will have the ability to compose multi factor auth requirements as desired. <br></p><p>A really cool benefit of all of this is authenticating in the real world on stationary devices. We have discussed with certain partners ideas around zero knowledge biometrics and view that as a large R&amp;D space in the future, particularly since biometric data is so, so important that it is secure (you can change a password but not your fingerprint - easily anyway).<br></p><p>But right now, device agnosticism is the biggest benefit - and the fact that device-based approaches are also fully supported by the NuID zk approach too.<br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>Time for the last question:<br></p><p>"Is your project only for elite investors, what about others with small funds, is it open to everyone?"<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>Its core purpose is to be a tool to help make interacting with the digital world both more secure and simpler for every single person. And so therefore anyone can use Kii. In fact, after the launch, we will launch the Verification Reward program where first 10,000,000 people who have a verified identity attestation issued to their zk auth credentials will be granted 10 Kii. free (this is one of the allocations &nbsp;shown in the token allocation). <br></p><p>P2B:</p><p>Thanks for the amazing AMA!<br></p><p>Locke Brown:</p><p>You're welcome! I appreciate the engagement and questions. AMA anytime - find us on our Telegram, <a href="https://t.me/NuID_Kii">https://t.me/NuID_Kii</a>!</p>

<p>Spending a few days at the Internet Identity Workshop 35 in San Francisco provided a great opportunity to catch up on some reading.</p>
<p>I was especially curious about one of the recent items that was published by the Trust Over IP Foundation, the first public review draft of the Technology Architecture V1.0 Specification.</p>
<p><a href="https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/11/14/toip-tech-arch-first-public-review/">https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/11/14/toip-tech-arch-first-public-review/</a></p>
<p>Those familiar with the Trust Over IP are likely familiar with the Dual Stack Architecture Model, a framework that adds a governance layer across the technology side of things. The practical governance and policy questions that must be answered in order to drive business, legal, and social acceptance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p> <p>With its combination of technology and governance, is seen in the two-sided, four-layer stack that we call the Trust Over IP Stack.</p> <p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The new Technology Architecture Specification now changes the way we look at what is required to attain digital trust.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hourglass model is perhaps the most widely recognized hallmark of the Internet protocol suite. The “hourglass” metaphor is evident from looking at a diagram of the TCP/IP stack such as Figure 5 from <a href="https://www.iab.org/wp-content/IAB-uploads/2010/11/hourglass-london-ietf.pdf">a presentation by Steve Deering of Cisco</a> given at the IETF 51 meeting in London in August 2001.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p> <p>The Internet protocol suite forms the shape of an hourglass</p> <p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The single “spanning layer” at the “waist” of the hourglass is the IPv4 protocol. However, the components that lie above the distinguished layer cannot directly access the services that lie below it. The rest of Mr. Deering’s presentation delves into various efforts to “fatten” the “waist” of the hourglass by “squeezing other protocols into the middle”. He strongly recommends resisting this.</p>
<p>Much of the success of the Internet is attributed to this “hourglass” design in which the spanning layer protocol Maximizes interoperability by providing a common way for all the higher level layers to communicate with all the lower levels. This is why the design of the trust spanning layer should be “as simple as possible but no simpler”.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The new ToIP Technology Architecture V1.0 Specification has applied this same hourglass design to the four ToIP layers.</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This new design makes it much simpler to start seeing how a multi-protocol approach can work. One of the more interesting conversations for myself at IIW 35 was about how OpenID4VC will be able to work within this model. I’ve tried to summarize some thoughts in some Tweets and will try to write some more about it in the weeks to come.</p>
<p></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://t.co/wO0QaybPF6">https://t.co/wO0QaybPF6</a><br><br>DIDComm and OpenID4VC are apples and oranges and can both work in conjunction within the new ToIP Technology Architecture proposal.</p>— Mathieu Glaude (@mathieu_glaude) <a href="https://twitter.com/mathieu_glaude/status/1593046348332269569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2022</a></blockquote><p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a list of 18 requirements in the specification that relate to the Trust Spanning layer of the hourglass model, and DIDComm is proving to be a good candidate for this layer.</p>
<p>How does the existing ToIP Dual Stack Architecture Model transition towards the new hourglass model?</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the way I’m looking at it now, but I welcome any feedback.</p>
<p>Just like the Trust over IP welcomes feedback to the new public review draft of the Technology Architecture V1.0 Specification. So please go check it out and provide your thoughts as well.</p>

  Award-winning management book ‘Alles Transaktion’ launched at TRX 22

17 November 2022 - 17:51

                    
      
    
      
             <p>INNOPAY has launched the German version of its award-winning management book ‘Everything Transaction’ (‘Alles Transaktion’ in German) during the Transactions (TRX) event today. The book is co-written by Shikko Nijland, Douwe Lycklama and Chiel Liezenberg, three partners at the international consulting firm that is specialised in digital transactions.</p>

<p>In an increasingly digital world, every interaction is becoming a transaction. These transactions go beyond the exchange of money in return for a product or service. Exchanges based on data are rapidly becoming the norm in the digital world. Data-driven transactions are becoming relevant across industries, and especially in the financial services industry in the shape of ‘Open Finance’.</p>

<p>Financial institutions have reached a strategic crossroads and now need to answer several fundamental questions, including: How will transactions evolve in the context of financial services? What role should entities like financial institutions and service providers play? And which commercial opportunities and risks are involved? These and many more questions are answered in ‘Alles Transaktion’.</p>

<p>Mounaim Cortet, Country Manager for INNOPAY in the DACH region, explains: “Our book offers numerous up-to-date insights and concepts for players operating in an increasingly data-driven economy. As a result, it helps executives to better navigate the digital world and supports their strategic decision-making in the context of Open Finance.”</p>

<p>In 2019, the Dutch version of ‘Alles Transaktion’ was named Best Management Book of the Year by the online book platform Managementboek.nl.</p>

 TRX 22 

<p>TRX is Germany’s pioneering event for payment, banking, tech, digitalisation and the platform economy. It is organised by Payment &amp; Banking, a leading association of the key driving forces in the German fintech industry and operator of Paymentandbanking.com, one of the most important finance blogs in Germany. Each year, thought leaders from the national and international digital business gather at TRX to provide an outlook on the most important industry trends.</p>

 Book presentation 

<p>On Friday 25 November, INNOPAY will present the book ‘Alles Transaktion’ in conjunction with Payment &amp; Banking at TechQuartier in Frankfurt. Jochen Siegert, co-founder of Payment &amp; Banking, will chair a discussion with the authors of the book as well as Mounaim Cortet.</p>

			<p>Cryptocurrency markets have been adversely affected by FTX’s collapse. As a technology provider, at Tokeny, we were unaffected by this catastrophe. As securities issuers, our customers were not either.&nbsp;Taking a broader view of the tokenization market, this event could have a positive impact, as investors are looking for less volatile, real-value backed assets such as tokenized securities. The increasing need for DeFi services that eliminate investor deposit abuse could also lead to the rapid development of institutional DeFi to bring transparency, stability, and security to a wounded market.</p>
 A rundown on FTX’s collapse&nbsp; 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>On 2nd November, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/">CoinDesk reported</a> that FTX’s sister hedge fund Alameda was dangerously holding $5.8B FTT at that time, which was about 40% of its total assets, $14.6B, to back their loans, raising liquidity concerns.</p>
<p>As rumors spread, Binance CEO CZ announced they would sell their $2.1B FTT on 6th November. The market meltdown kicked off. People panicked to sell their FTT as prices continued to fall, while withdrawing their funds from FTX over fears about whether they had sufficient capital. Within 72 hours, FTX saw roughly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/crypto-exchange-ftx-saw-6-bln-withdrawals-72-hours-ceo-message-staff-2022-11-08/">$6B withdrawal requests</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fears turned out to be true, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftx-tapped-into-customer-accounts-to-fund-risky-bets-setting-up-its-downfall-11668093732">FTX has lent about $10B</a> of funds out of $16B to Alameda with the use of customer deposits. Consequently, it struggled to meet the enormous withdrawal demand and had frozen withdrawals on 8th November. On 11 November, the company declared bankruptcy after <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-bankman-fried-seeks-94-bln-package-ftx-rescue-sources-2022-11-10/">failing to find a bailout package of $9.4 billion</a>.</p>
 Turning into decentralized exchanges&nbsp; 
<p>Investors are moving into decentralized exchanges. Within a week since 8th November, about $48B worth of volume has been traded in decentralized exchanges, up 267% from $18B the week before, according to <a href="https://defillama.com/dexs">DeFiLlama</a>.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Unlike centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges do not require deposits to begin trading, instead, users simply swap assets directly in liquidity pools. Liquidity pools are funded by liquidity providers, or yield farmers, whose deposits are governed by smart contracts and cannot be touched, preventing any misconduct with the funds.</p>
 Tokenized securities as the ideal alternative&nbsp; 
<p>Due to events like FTX, the cryptocurrency market has become more volatile and riskier. People are seeking alternatives that are more stable. One of the best options is tokenized real-world assets and securities for the following reasons:</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 
 
 
 Real-value backed: Unlike cryptocurrencies that are created out of thin air, tokenized securities are backed by real assets.&nbsp; 
 Highly regulated: Since tokenized assets fall within the scope of securities, they are strictly regulated like their traditional equivalents. Investors, therefore, benefit from the highest level of protection from unforeseen events under the supervision of the authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Transparency: Operations performed by asset issuers following governance decisions are visible on the blockchain and can be tracked. Fund reserves and usages can be audited frequently by trusted third parties, providing immutable and real-time data to improve transparency and enhance trust. 
 Recoverability: They say: “not your keys, not your tokens.” People started asking for self-custody of their digital assets. With tokenized securities, as required by law, tokens are tied to the identity of the holder, even allowing recovery of tokens in the event of wallet loss, enhancing the security of self-storage of digital securities.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 Push institutional DeFi to develop 
<p>Bank runs occur not only in the cryptocurrency world, but are seen in traditional capital markets as well. DeFi holds the answer to solve this problem by providing transparency for market participants. Instead of relying on a centralized entity, everything is ruled by smart contracts which automatically and strictly follow predetermined rules to execute. E.g. the loan will be automatically liquidated when the collateral backing it falls below a preset threshold; In the event that the loan is not repaid on time, liquidation will occur, automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The demand for better security and transparency will drive both retail and traditional investors into DeFi. Institutional DeFi or permissioned DeFi will be required as investors, especially institutional investors, do not want to deal with sources of funds associated with money laundering, terrorism and other illegal acts. The development of <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenization-is-the-first-step-for-real-world-assets-in-defi/">permissioned DeFi will ultimately bridge tokenized real-world assets with DeFi</a>.</p>
<p>There is always a positive outcome to any disaster, leading to innovation and maturing the market, cleaning up the bad players, and allowing solid solutions and problem-solving applications to emerge and thrive. We believe this one will be no different.</p>

<p>The explanation of the Ethereum Merge clearly states that upgrading via “The Merge” mainly brings about a change in the network consensus mechanism. The highly anticipated expansion was completed by the close collaboration between Ethereum and the various Layer2 solutions.</p><p>All of a sudden, all the major events in the Layer2 arena were put back on the agenda. Meanwhile, zkSync, one of the most famous Layer2 projects, once again became the focus of the market by launching its version 2.0 MainNet on October&nbsp;28.</p><p>This article will be based on the possibilities of Ethereum scalability to help you further understand the ZK-Rollup solutions in&nbsp;Layer2.</p><p>Capacity expansion scheme</p><p>All of you have heard about the expansion of Ethereum, whether you are a new employee or a veteran practitioner. Words like Rollup and Layer2 should be familiar to&nbsp;you.</p><p>As decentralized applications (dApp) deployed on Ethereum gradually increase, congested networks and high gas fees make Ethereum expansion imperative.</p><p>However, due to the impossible trilemma of the blockchain (only two from expansion, decentralization, and security can coexist), it is difficult to expand capacity at the Layer1 level, so Layer2 takes advantage of the challenge. The core idea is to put a large number of actual interactions off the chain for execution and calculation, and then finally finish validity verification through a very small number of interactions on Ethereum.</p><p>In the Layer2 expansion scheme, the more mainstream and popular ones are Optimistic Rollup and ZK-Rollup, the former is the largest ecological solution in Layer2 projects for now, while the latter is considered by Vitalik as the ultimate solution to the expansion problem.</p><p>Rollup</p><p>So, what is a Rollup? It is a scalable solution that bundles interactions, presses, and sends them to the consensus layer for validation, verifying multiple interaction behaviors at a&nbsp;time.</p><p>In essence, instead of sending the interactions to the node in L1, the user sends them to the Rollup server that verifies that these interactions are valid, in other words, these validations are performed outside of Ethereum’s MainNet. After verification, the Rollup server publishes the data to Ethereum’s MainNet, which records the interaction and verification status, so that they will inherit the security of&nbsp;L1.</p><p>A simple&nbsp;example:</p><p>Richard got a meal card in the canteen downstairs and loaded it with 1,000 USD. Every time he eats, Richard only needs to swipe his meal card without having to pay the money again with his bank card. A month later, Richard did not intend to continue eating in the canteen and had 200 USD in balance when he canceled the card, so he withdrew the balance back to his bank&nbsp;card.</p><p>In this process, Richard’s bank card and the canteen account only interacted twice, despite the fact that during that time there was countless buying of meals using the system inside the&nbsp;canteen.</p><p>Here is also a key step: when extracting the balance, Richard needs the canteen to provide details to verify that the balance settlement is not wrong, and the detail needs to be submitted to the bank card system for preservation and verification.</p><p>Why is detail verification the critical&nbsp;step?</p><p>Before Rollup was proposed, there was a capacity expansion scheme called Plasma, which does not send the data occurring on the chain to the main chain for storage and verification, but will only submit a final status result. This makes the results unverifiable, just like the canteen is only giving you the final balance, but not the&nbsp;details.</p><p>The Rollup scheme submits the data to the main chain, but it compresses the data as much as possible through smart coding methods, while appropriately deleting and reducing some of the data based on the characteristics of the Rollup itself, as long as the final submission can be verified by&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>ZK-Rollup optimizes security and accuracy around validation.</p><p>ZK-Rollup</p><p>ZK-Rollup packages a large number of transactions into one Rollup block and generates a concise proof for the block off the chain. Smart contracts on Layer1 can simply verify the certificate, without re-executing these interactions.</p><p>This can not only save gas fees because the proof verification cost is well below the computational cost of re-execution; but another benefit is to save storage space through data compression (i. e., store only the smallest amount of data on the chain for verification).</p><p>A key point of ZK-Rollup lies in “questioning everything”, which contrasts with Optimistic Rollup’s “optimistic assumption that nobody does evil”. ZK-Rollup defaults that all submitted results are ok, but requires Layer2 to carry a zk-SNARK proof after submitting the data to prove the accuracy of its&nbsp;results.</p><p>Back to the&nbsp;example:</p><p>If Richardtakes the balance directly, does not check the details, but waits until something is wrong, it is similar to Optimistic Rollup; but if Xiao Ming asks the canteen to ensure the accuracy of the balance, it is similar to ZK-Rollup.</p><p>You may be wondering, why can the certification documents provided by the canteen prove that the data they give is right? This involves the ZK (proof of zero knowledge).</p><p>The simplest zero-knowledge proof is that there is a password door in the middle of a channel, if Richard needs to prove that he knows the password, he does not have to tell others what the password is, but just needs to pass the password door. Of course, the zero-knowledge proof put into practical application is much more complicated than this. For further information, refer to this article by&nbsp;Vitalik:</p><p><a href="https://link.medium.com/kTqKFY2XDub">https://link.medium.com/kTqKFY2XDub</a></p><p>After reading it, you will see why ZK-Rollup was proposed very early and praised by Vitalik, but it made little progress compared to Optimistic Rollups: the difficulty and principle of ZK is still being solved and much more complicated than imagined.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-tech-viewpoint-whos-optimistic-about-zk-rollups-f4f1483fef86">Ontology Tech Viewpoint | Who’s Optimistic about ZK-Rollups</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Gartner researchers did the heavy lifting for you — read their analysis of 13 critical capabilities and how 9 vendors stack up.</p>

<p>The 2022 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/gartner-critical-capabilities-access-management-2022">Gartner® Critical Capabilities for Access Managemen</a>t (AM) report is a companion to the company’s Magic Quadrant™ for AM. While the Magic Quadrant provides an overall view of a vendor, including its market share, Critical Capabilities is purely a technical analysis of a vendor’s products and services. The researchers evaluated 13 capabilities Gartner believes are critical to the three major Use Cases for Access Management: External Access Management, (CIAM), Internal Access Management (workforce), and Application Development Use Case (for custom-developed applications or services).</p>

<p>In its key findings, Gartner says that Internal Access Management Use Cases have become mainstream, and that vendors are now focused on External Access Management Use Cases, specifically business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), and government-to-constituent. This year,ForgeRock ranked highest in Application Development and External Access Management Use Case and second highest in Internal Access Management Use Case.</p>

<p>During this past year, we have introduced significant enhancements to our<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration/capabilities"> orchestration</a> capabilities. In addition to the largest library of pre-built journey orchestration nodes, we provide a visual interface that makes building AM journeys as simple as dragging and dropping nodes into place, and measuring and adapting them, without writing a line of code.</p>

<p>&nbsp;ForgeRock’s strong software development kit (SDK) offering goes beyond authentication to include registration and self-service journeys, token management, device integrity, device context and Web Authentication (WebAuthn) support. All this functionality is available to developers via APIs with documentation praised by Gartner.</p>

<p>For years, ForgeRock has been committing the bulk of its resources to innovative product development, and I believe the results of our efforts have become apparent in the Gartner Critical Capabilities report, the Magic Quadrant, as well as other recent studies by industry analysts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I’m immensely proud of the work of our engineers, product management, customer success, documentation, and many other teams. And I’m grateful to our customers who constantly inspire us to expand on the possibilities that an identity and access management solution with governance capabilities can bring to an organization. Our focus will remain on developing products and services that simplify our customers’ incredibly complex challenges in today’s digital landscape.</p>

<p>I invite you to download the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/gartner-critical-capabilities-access-management-2022">Gartner Critical Capabilities</a> report to compare the effectiveness of the recognized access management solutions and how they can impact your organization’s digital identity priorities.</p>

I’ll keep things short and to the&nbsp;point.</p> Verus Desktop v0.9.5&nbsp;Update <p>⏰ Update your Verus Desktop wallet before 19 November 11 PM UTC. This release updates the Komodo notaries to season 6 and you must update to reliably stay synchronized to the Verus mainnet (activation height of block 2,291,830).</p><p>v0.9.5 introduces 2 new APIs and CLI commands, signdata and verifysignature, that encompass all of the capabilities of previous signing and verification APIs and add new capabilities for advanced signatures and verification — a more powerful and flexible framework for NFTs and ID-bound legal rights and agreements.</p><p>In addition to digital signing of documents or information using an ID, the new APIs enable easily binding together multiple sources of content, documents, identities, and VDXF keys together into one verifiable signature and then being able to verify that signature, including all of its specific bindings.</p><p>🔗 <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">Download Verus Desktop&nbsp;v0.9.5</a></p> Verus PBaaS &amp; DeFi&nbsp;Updates <p>In anticipation of the Verus PBaaS mainnet upgrade — delivering no-programming needed blockchain and currency launches, MEV-free DeFi, non-custodial Ethereum bridging and so much more — community developers introduce a protocol improvement designed to make the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol even more resistant than what we believe was already the leading algorithm to multi-block attempts at&nbsp;MEV.</p><p>The protocol improvement makes the following adjustments:</p>  Conversions and cross-chain transfers still roll-up into exports that are collected from one or more blocks of transfer transactions, but to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next requires a random bit pulled from later&nbsp;blocks.  The last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions, once the rollup is processed as an import. This reward used to go to the miner or staker who processes the export, which is no longer the&nbsp;case.  Import transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency.  <p>These changes together serve to disincentivize any miner or staker from attempting to exclude a large set of transactions from a block and front run all of them, as they will have an even chance of having all of those excluded transactions put back in with their transaction, turning potential gain into potential loss. They would be better off saving their working capital to arbitrage imports by joining transactions, bringing them close to market, and earning money without risk of loss. In addition, if they do end up putting more value of transactions in a block that caps the export rollup, they will reliably earn meaningful rewards without risk of loss in that way as&nbsp;well.</p> Bug Bounties&nbsp;💰 <p>While we don’t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended.</p><p>If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000&nbsp;VRSC.</p><p>🗒️ <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.5-2">See PBaaS-Testnet Release&nbsp;Notes</a></p><p>🛎️ <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Join Discord and report&nbsp;bounties</a></p> Introducing VerusID to Verus&nbsp;Mobile <p>This version of Verus Mobile takes a major leap forward, enabling support for VerusID, including sending and receiving funds and use of your VerusID as a password-free, secure and self-sovereign web or mobile app sign-in, made possible with the VerusID authentication protocol.</p><p>Verus Mobile v0.3.0–24 supports the version 1.0 of the VerusID authentication protocol, which prepares for the PBaaS upgrade and supports application provisioning of IDs, an important way applications can onboard users, give them a verified self-sovereign ID and funds address, enable sending and receiving payments, and make applications more secure by design with an easy, password-free sign-in.</p><p>In addition to its new support for VerusID and the Verus Authentication Protocol, this version of Verus Mobile continues to include Wyre as a fiat on-ramp and maintains support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a variety of popular coins and&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>If you are an app developer who wants to benefit from and help pioneer a better, more user-centric, inherently commerce-enabled, verifiable application model for a true Internet of Value, this is the release that enables you!

<p>Spruce’s mission is to build a future where users control their identity across all their digital interactions. Instead of having users log into platforms, we think platforms should log into users’ data vaults with users in full control.</p><p>In pursuing this, we’re happy to announce the release of our new product, SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything.</p><a href="https://docs.ssx.id/">  SSX - SSX  Self-Sovereign Anything  SSX  </a><p>With a few lines of code, developers can use SSX to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, build a direct relationship with their users, and access the entire universe of decentralized identity patterns. This all starts with basic authentication and grows into data-enriched sessions, performant bring-your-own databases, and user-originated content. SSX jumpstarts development, allowing you to quickly and securely upgrade your applications with decentralized identity for anyone with an EVM-compatible wallet.</p><p>Identity is far too important to develop behind closed doors, thus we are strong believers in free and open-source software, and SSX is dual-licensed under MIT and Apache 2.0. We take security seriously as well, so we are proud to share that SSX has already completed a security audit, with full details soon to follow.</p> The Easiest Way to Install Sign-In with Ethereum <p><a href="https://login.xyz">Sign-In with Ethereum</a> (SIWE, pronounced “see-we”) has become the dominant standard for wallet-based login in web3. It empowers any user to begin the journey to control their own identity and enter a world that doesn’t rely on being locked to centralized identity providers.</p><p>As Spruce, we’ve authored the Sign-In with Ethereum standard, <a href="https://docs.login.xyz">released multiple reference libraries as public goods</a>, and implemented integrations possible through our efforts in collaboration with the community. </p><p>Our support of Sign-In with Ethereum only grows larger with SSX. </p><p>One of the largest points of feedback that we heard from developers was that they wanted even easier ways to integrate beyond just the core reference libraries – and we listened. </p><p>SSX makes Sign-In with Ethereum even easier to implement in your application on both your frontend and backend. Out of the box, SSX already has support for many types of servers and backend configurations, with more to come. We’ve shipped it with examples for developers to get started and a quickstart tutorial that walks you through building a decentralized identity-enabled dapp using SSX.</p><p>The fastest way to get started with SSX is here:</p><a href="https://docs.ssx.id/ssx-quickstart">  SSX Quickstart - SSX  This guide will help you bootstrap an SSX application, or help add SSX to your existing setup  SSX  </a> DAO Login: Powered By Gnosis Safe <p>When DAOs or multisig-enabled organizations need to log into apps or services, it’s typically an individual representative taking action on behalf of that DAO. Until now, there was no frictionless way to do this, and multiple transactions and signers are necessary across the many steps in the process. </p><p>With SSX and Safe, there’s now a standard way for representatives to log in on behalf of DAOs, and for DAOs to then update those representatives through their own governance systems.</p><p>You can enable DAO login for your dapp by toggling a single config flag in SSX. Once enabled, users of your dapp who are DAO delegates can now either log in as themselves or on behalf of the DAO or multisig they represent. DAOs or multisigs can easily add or remove delegates in the <a href="https://app.safe.global/share/safe-app?appUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.gnosis-safe.io%2Fsiwe-delegate-manager&amp;chain=eth">Safe Delegate Registry Manager application</a>.</p><p>We are currently collaborating with the Safe team on further scoping access for delegates (e.g. a social media manager can only access social media dapps). This feature also extends beyond DAOs, empowering users who manage their own multisigs to prove asset ownership for dapps or delegate certain privileges to another account.</p><a href="https://docs.ssx.id/appendix/dao-login-workflow">  DAO Login Workflow - SSX  DAO Logins enabled by SSX  SSX  </a> The SSX Dashboard: The Ultimate Dapp Companion <p>Developers asked us for a way to visualize their relationships with their users to get a better sense of their dapp’s metrics and success. </p><p>Towards this, we’ve created an <a href="https://app.ssx.id">optional dashboard</a> that can be used in conjunction with SSX installations. This feature uses no third-party cookies, and simply provides dapps with ways of visualizing existing information that is already known by the service when users Sign-In with Ethereum. Today, this includes login events and on-chain information that is already public.</p>Creating a project with the SSX dashboard<p>We are committed to keeping SSX an open-source library not requiring any third-party service, so as the features evolve, we want to ensure that we are using open protocols for logging and other interconnectivity, and this will actively inform the product roadmap.</p> The Future of SSX <p>The following features are already on the way for the next versions of SSX:</p>  Credential issuance and presentation workflows via user-controlled storage  Optimizations for different web3 wallet providers  SSX signing for token-gated access  Multichain login support  Additional SSX Dashboard insights   <p>If there’s a decentralized identity feature you’d like to see SSX support, check and use our <a href="https://feedback.ssx.id/ssx-feature-requests">feedback</a> forum. </p><p>Alternatively, we also welcome all open-source contributions to <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx">SSX</a> from developers.</p> <p>Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

<p>The Launchpad is a regular series highlighting updates to the GlobaliD product ecosystem.</p><p>After recently releasing our <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/launchpad-the-all-new-globalid-wallet-768cd26357c0">all new GlobaliD Wallet,</a> we’re excited to keep the momentum going and announce that Selective Share is now available in the GlobaliD&nbsp;app.</p><p>The reality is that we share way more than we need to when trying to establish trust. You shouldn’t have to share your driver’s license and all of its associated information in order to purchase a bottle of wine. You shouldn’t have to send a photo of your ID to an Airbnb host just so they can have peace of mind. As we all know, it’s risky to have your personal information out in the&nbsp;wild.</p><p>That’s where Selective Share comes in — where you only need to share the minimum amount of information in order to do the things you need to&nbsp;do.</p><p>In the future, that could mean having a credential that proves that you’re over 21 years old. That way, you should be able to make age verified purchases without having to share anything else about yourself. This concept is already gaining traction. JPMorgan’s Onyx unit <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/jpmorgan-exploring-applications-of-digital-identity/">recently announced a solution</a> that could allow you to access Buy Now Pay Later services with only your credit score — and nothing&nbsp;else.</p><p>You can learn more about <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-selective-sharing-d0a0ab7ad1d6">the concept of Selective Share with our 101&nbsp;series</a>.</p><p>With Selective Share from GlobaliD, when someone (such as an Airbnb host) asks for your ID, you can send only the relevant fields they need — photo, name, address, etc. — instead of the entire document. The GlobaliD app will automatically generate a digital file with only those fields that you can send to the Airbnb&nbsp;host.</p> More ways to&nbsp;share <p>While this feature introduces a new way to control and protect your information, not everybody might be willing to accept this form of identity yet. Your ID Wallet also allows you&nbsp;to:</p>  Share your entire digital&nbsp;ID  Share a photo of your&nbsp;ID  <p>In this case, our goal is to meet users where they are and provide the ease and convenience of a versatile identity wallet as the rest of the world progresses toward a more private and secure&nbsp;future.</p>Screenshots of the Selective Share feature in the GlobaliD&nbsp;app. New features and improvements   Selectively share attributes from any of your credentials with external parties. Click on the fields that you want to send and conveniently share them with who you need to. The recipient will see only what they need to rather than having access to all of your personal information.  Share a digital version of your entire ID. Select this option to send a digital document containing all of the fields from your ID. The recipient will have access to all of the information they requested, but not an actual photo copy of your&nbsp;ID.  Share the front of your physical ID. Select this option to send a photo of the front of your ID card. The GlobaliD app will generate a JPG image of your ID that you keep stored securely within the app. You will no longer have to take a picture of your ID every time someone requests it, or risk keeping it stored on your smartphone.  <p>Visit the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/globalid-portable-identity/id1439340119">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.globalid">Google Play Store</a> to download the latest version of the GlobaliD app&nbsp;today.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about GlobaliD, <a href="https://www.global.id/">visit our website</a> or follow us on <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/_globalid">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-id-inc">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMJDT8IXrg4Y5RDP4W0aOw">YouTube</a>.

<p>Un’importante novità nel mondo digitale: grazie a InfoCert ID Young anche i minorenni possono finalmente avere e utilizzare la propria identità digitale per accedere ai servizi online a loro riservati.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dopo che, nel mese di marzo, <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/it/agenzia/stampa-e-comunicazione/notizie/2022/03/07/agid-adotta-linee-guida-spid-minori">AgID ha reso pubbliche le linee guida</a> per l’erogazione dell’identità digitale anche a tutti coloro che hanno tra i 5 e i 18 anni, InfoCert si è messa al lavoro per rendere questa possibilità concreta.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ogni genitore o tutore legale già titolare di uno SPID InfoCert potrà attivare InfoCert ID Young per i suoi figli in maniera semplice e intuitiva.&nbsp;</p>



 Come funziona SPID per minori&nbsp; 



<p>Il genitore o tutore legale, già in possesso di credenziali SPID InfoCert ID, potrà richiedere SPID per minorenni direttamente da casa dal <a href="https://www.identitadigitale.infocert.it/prodotti/spid-infocert-id-young">portale InfoCert</a> grazie al video riconoscimento. Una volta rilasciate le credenziali il minorenne potrà utilizzare il suo SPID per accedere a servizi che verranno presto resi disponibili dagli istituti scolastici (es. registro elettronico) e dalla PA (come la richiesta del patentino).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Il tutto si svolge sempre garantendo massima sicurezza e tutela grazie all’App My InfoCert e al <a href="https://infocert.digital/it/online-il-nuovo-selfcare-infocert-id-un-nuovo-look-per-gestire-al-meglio-lo-spid-targato-infocert/?_ga=2.6146618.882741852.1668519418-284858583.1657612356&amp;_gac=1.23925064.1667146062.Cj0KCQjwwfiaBhC7ARIsAGvcPe40tAnNqF9MfLZukSBV3DNIh_vOEmLuNhLMTQtdYTS-1pLDjbBMXMoaAkTHEALw_wcB">nuovo Selfcare.</a> Infatti, i minori di 14 anni potranno accedere esclusivamente ai servizi online degli istituti scolastici solo previa autorizzazione del genitore/tutore. I maggiori di 14 anni invece potranno usufruire anche di altri servizi della PA e gestire in autonomia le proprie credenziali.&nbsp;</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Viky Manaila, Trust Services Director at Intesi Group. 
<p>In episode 79 Oscar and Viky discuss eIDAS 2.0 and EU digital identity wallets – what eIDAS 2.0 is and why it was created, what lessons were learnt from eIDAS and how have these helped to build eIDAS 2.0, and how the EU digital wallets relate to eIDAS 2.0.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>
<blockquote><p>“So, the aim of eIDAS 2.0 is to achieve the targets set in Europe’s path to digital decade. Eighty percent of EU citizens being able to use a digital ID by 2030…”</p></blockquote>
<p>Viky Manaila is an international expert in the field of electronic signatures, digital identity and digital transformation processes, who has successfully promoted the electronic business globally.</p>
<p>She has been technical expert to the European Commission for instituting Regulation 910/2014 (eIDAS) on electronic identity assurance and the design and roll-out of European, cross-nation e-procurement platforms and operations. She is member of different high level working groups set up by the European Commission, <a href="http://www.etsi.org">ETSI </a>and the US Government aimed at aligning policy and operations around trust identity, digital signatures and cross-recognition.</p>
<p>Viky has successfully contributed to standardisation work for the global acceptance of European Trust Services, as an expert in ETSI ESI Specialist Task Force 560. Global Acceptance of EU Trust Services is a study of existing trust services that operate in different regions of the world and their possible mutual recognition or global acceptance.&nbsp; The eIDAS Regulation and corresponding standards go beyond EU boundaries, proving that interoperability and cross-border legal recognition are the keys for global electronic commerce and transactions.</p>

<p>Oscar: Exactly. We’re talking about what is happening in Europe. Yeah, fantastic. Nice hearing you. Nice meeting you, Viky. So, let’s get started.</p>
<p>Viky: Thank you for inviting me to your show.</p>
<p>Oscar: My pleasure. So, Viky, let’s talk about digital identity. So, let’s start by hearing a bit more about yourself in your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Viky: Well, my journey into digital services and identity space started back in 2002 when I was preparing my master’s thesis in electronic signatures and cryptography. That time I came across the famous cartoon of New Yorker drawn by Peter Steiner with the two dogs in front of the computer, the old one telling to the smallest one, “On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” So, that cartoon impressed me very much. And we are now almost 30 years after trying to solve the dog on the internet problem. So, this is in a nutshell.</p>
<p>So, I continuously worked to improve the way we are conducting digital transactions, the way we are signing digitally, we are exchanging information and now proofing who we are on the internet with the trustworthy way, in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, cartoons are amazing, right?</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, that one I hope we can solve it soon once the eIDAS 2.0 will go into force.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. And hopefully someone makes a cartoon for that, that also becomes a legend. So please tell us what is eIDAS 2.0 and why it was created?</p>
<p>Viky: Well, eIDAS 2.0 is the proposal, it’s a proposal to amend the eIDAS, the Regulation number 910 from 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. With eIDAS, the European Union lay down the foundations and a common legal framework across all member states for citizens, companies, public administrations to carry out transactions online with legal value.</p>
<p>eIDAS regulation has two parts: one, related to electronic identification and electronic identity. And one related to trust services such as electronic signature, timestamp, electronic seal, preservation of electronic signatures, certificates for website authentication. Now, as part of the legislative process of a regulation, after several years is coming and assessment to see how and what delivered, what needs to be changed or improved. Is it appropriate to modify its scope and specific provisions taking into consideration the technological development, the market evolution, the citizens expectations.</p>
<p>So, during 2020, during the pandemic, an extensive impact assessment has been carried out by a group of experts, which I was part of, analysing every detail of eIDAS including costs and benefits expected for relevant group of stakeholders affect this such as public authorities, trust service providers, conformity assessment bodies, electronic identity providers, supervisory bodies, the entire eIDAS ecosystem. Based on the evidence collected during this assessment, we drew conclusions and provided options for the legislative integration, integration, and a substantial input for the introduction of the EU framework for digital identity, the EU Digital Identity wallet concept.</p>
<p>So, the aim of eIDAS 2.0 is to achieve the targets set in Europe’s path to digital decade. Eighty percent of EU citizens being able to use a digital ID by 2030, so in less than 10 years, to be able to prove who they are cross-border, to be able to give the explicit consent for sharing pieces of their personal information, to know exactly with whom they’ve shared personal information and for what purpose. A technology where we can control ourselves, what data and how data is used, in a nutshell about eIDAS 2.0.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And it’s definitely very ambitious goal, absolutely attainable, and we need it for sure.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, we need to solve the dog on the internet problem.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, from the experience of eIDAS, the first version eIDAS, so what are the lessons that have been learned from that experience, the good and the bad, if you can say?</p>
<p>Viky: Yes. So, I will start with concrete facts. Since the entering into force of eIDAS, we have only 14 European member states having in place a notified electronic ID schemes covering 59% of citizens. From this fourteen notified eID schemes only seven are mobile. Very few public services are available cross-border even for those citizens with an electronic identification mean. So, six years after the adoption of eIDAS, 41% of citizens are left without the possibility to use any trusted and secure eID across borders.</p>
<p>There are several pain points or problems identified during the impact assessment. Number one, an increased demand by public and private services for trusted identification and exchange of attributes. The current electronic ID framework is limited to the public sector services. There are no rules or conditions to allow the private sector services to get access to the national eID systems. In particular, the complexity and diversity of such systems, insufficient availability in all member states, the lack of flexibility to support a variety of use cases are significant in limiting the expanding of eID means. There is a huge market demand for credentials digitally proving attributes, such as professional qualifications, residency, medical certificate, and those are not covered by the current eIDAS.</p>
<p>The second problem identified is related to the current user expectations for seamless and trusted solutions to identify and share attributes across borders, and those expectations are not met. We are all expecting today a seamless online journey. Single sign-on solutions, mobile applications, covering all use cases for identification from electronic banking or e-health secure identification to anonymous log-on to an online platform or website. The ability to identify digitally will become an important factor of social inclusion and the provision of digital identity a strategic asset. Some member states moved already into this direction adopting new technological solution. But if this is not regulated at EU level, will further increase the disparity between national systems.</p>
<p>Alternative digital identification solutions by private providers and I can mention here the cases from Nordic countries where the banks are providing electronic identity solutions, those are not recognised by government outside of Nordic countries, for instance. However, they only address some private use cases not requiring high level of security. Other more secure solutions offered by private providers lack the common frameworks or standards as regards, for example, the level of assurance that they provide. So, they cannot scale up and be recognised across borders for access to public services or private services which require a certain level of trust.</p>
<p>The third problem identified is related to data control and security concerns that are not sufficiently addressed by available digital identity solutions. The security risks involved in providing personal data online or information system for authentication purposes are significant as more citizens conduct transactions online on a very frequent basis. However, neither public nor private offers fully respond to this demand. Existing electronic identities under eIDAS are not sufficiently widely usable for identification in the private sector to represent a viable alternative and has also inherent limitations to discretional data disclosure for the user.</p>
<p>So, despite offering high level of security, they show limitations as regards the principle of data minimisation. For example, eIDAS does not support so called zero knowledge claims. In addition, identification provided by large online platforms, often does not allow for the effective protection of personnel data. We have noticed that more and more platforms are allowing us to identify with our Google account or with our Facebook account or other providers account. But those platforms does not guarantee us the protection of personal data. And this has been evidenced by major data breaches and enforcement actions over the last period of time.</p>
<p>So, the general shift towards a more comprehensive identity ecosystem that integrates attributes and credentials, some of them carrying sensitive data, such as in the health sector, makes it necessary to develop an electronic identity ecosystem that is able to effectively protect personal data and offer full user control. And the last and the fourth major problem identified is related to unequal conditions for the provision of trust services.</p>
<p>Also, the evaluation of the eIDAS regulation concludes that the regulatory framework has successfully established legal certainty on liability, burden of proof, legal effect and international aspects of trust services. It also shows that there is room for improvement regarding a harmonised application of supervisory procedures and especially for processes for identity proofing that are the very basis for several other digital services, in particular, when these processes are carried out remotely.</p>
<p>There is also need for improvement concerning the efficiency of a particular trust service, the provision of Qualified Website Authentication Certificates, so called QWACs. What is happening despite the introduction of the certificates by the eIDAS regulation, web browsers refused to include them in their root stores and to display them clearly, which makes these certificates unusable for traders and consumers. For websites run by intermediaries or trading companies only, QWACs can guarantee the identity of the entity behind the website with a high level of assurance.</p>
<p>So, I’m a consumer, I want to buy something online, I go on a website that is claiming to sell clothes made in Italy or Italian brands. But if I look careful on that website, I can notice that is not an Italian website. It’s hosted in China. It’s a Chinese website. So, what is happening when I buy something, and I want to return because the quality is not the one expected or the one shown in the picture? We know a lot of problems related to this aspect. So, you cannot send back your purchase, you cannot get back your money. So, the lack of recognition of QWACs by web browsers may also conflict with the protection of fundamental rights of consumers that are enshrined in the treaty of the functioning of the European Union and with the EU consumer protection legislation. So, these are the most important problems issues identified related to the eIDAS regulation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, I think that were so exhausted explanation of those several problems. Of course, it feels like they are, how to say, incomplete solutions, right? So, there are some solutions, but they don’t completely fulfil, yeah, what they were meant to do. So, what do you think are the drivers of these problems?</p>
<p>Viky: Well, first of all, the member states are not obliged by the current eIDAS regulation to notify or to provide an electronic identity scheme or electronic identity mechanism. It is voluntary, and the process of notification is long and complex. Not all member states that have notified national electronic identities open those systems to the private sector for domestic reasons or for lack of incentives.</p>
<p>Private providers of digital identity attributes are not subject to a harmonised regulatory framework, ensuring trust and security across border. Then we have diverse and ineffective conditions for private online service providers that cannot rely on trusted and secure eID cross borders. Then the set of identity data provided by eIDAS is too limited and rigid. And last but not least inconsistent interpretation, divergent application and lack of acceptance of the eIDAS regulation in relation to QWACs certificate.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. So, every country does things quite different.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, quite different and not that the same beat and not at the same rate. And then we have discrepancy. And even if we have those electronic identification means we cannot use them cross-borders. For instance, I have the Italian SPID which is the notified electronic identification mean, but I cannot use it to open bank account in my country of origin, Romania, for instance, because it’s not possible yet to check cross-border this information.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. What solutions could be done I guess some of those are being now cooked on in eIDAS, right? So, what are the solutions to these issues?</p>
<p>Viky: I just wanted to mention that not all in eIDAS is bad that how the listeners or the audience could interpret the part related to trust services provisioning delivered exceptionally, so the regulation became recognised and globally approach to trust services provisioning and supervision. The term of qualified as the highest assurance level for a service has been adopted widely, and many countries transposed this definition into national legislation.</p>
<p>So, you will find the term of qualified electronic signature, which is essentially an European term introduced by eIDAS regulation, also outside the European Union, or trust service supervision, or trust service provisioning in other countries as well. So, the supervision and accreditation, the standards for trust services provisioning are a benchmark now.</p>
<p>Oscar: That’s great to hear that, yeah. That inspire other…</p>
<p>Viky: Yes. I am very proud of that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. And inspire all the legislation…</p>
<p>Viky: Because we manage – yes, we manage to deliver a very good model. Coming back to your question, what is introducing new eIDAS 2.0, what are the new services? There are several new trust services such as electronic archiving, or distributed ledgers, or electronic attestation of attributes, which I would like to just talk a bit on.</p>
<p>What means electronic attestation of attributes? We are familiar with verifiable credentials term from self-sovereign identity space. So, the electronic attestation of attributes such as proof of age, for instance, for accessing age-restricted social media platforms, professional qualifications, I’m a lawyer, I’m a student, I’m a doctor, I’m… I don’t know professional digital space, digital driving licenses, vaccination certificates. We have seen the recent use case where we should came up with solutions in a very short time, with the possibility to check this information across border.</p>
<p>So, in this new ecosystem, identity data and attributes would, whenever required, be securely linked to the legal electronic identity of the user, making the data trustworthy and legally enforceable across border. These new service, electronic attestation of attributes, could be used to enable EU-wide authentication to access a variety of online services in the financial sector offer today at national level only. But in the future, we will have the possibility to use cross-border, and also would allow for the identification and authentication of IoT devices.</p>
<p>The aim with the new services introduced by eIDAS 2.0 is to achieve a shift from the reliance on national digital identity solutions only, to the provision of electronic attestation of attributes valid at European level. Providers of electronic attestation of attributes should benefit as a consequence of the eIDAS 2.0 from a clear and uniform set of rules. And public administrations should be able to rely on electronic documents in a given format, no matter what is the country that issued those documents.</p>
<p>So, these are the new services, of course, followed by the validation of electronic archiving, validation of electronic attestation of attributes. And last but not least, the most famous electronic digital identity wallet. But I think we need a month to discuss on only this aspect related to the wallet. It’s a very debated topic in the making.</p>
<p>Oscar: So that will be a debate interview, a marathon debate interview.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, exactly a marathon, we should organise a marathon for EUDI wallet, everything you wanted to know and never asked before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Maybe we can do it.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes. We’d be happy to participate.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Yeah, I know that the lack of these trust services was one of the reasons why the first eIDAS was, yeah, it was difficult to implement in different countries because each country, which service should we build, right? So that’s great that eIDAS 2.0 already has a framework for that. Could you now share some concrete examples, if possible, from different countries about these trust services?</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, sure. I will take the most common, most known and used trust service, which is the provisioning of digital certificates for electronic signature. What I would like to mention, we arrived at eIDAS regulation after the European directive on electronic signature from 1999, where we had disparate solutions, each country transposed into their own legislation differently, the terms and the conditions for electronic signatures, they were not available with the same legal effect cross-border. So eIDAS regulation fixed this problem.</p>
<p>We have a common market, we have a common approach for the provisioning of digital certificates, for electronic signature accepted in all European countries with the same legal effect. And we have all flavours and forms of electronic signature, simple electronic signature, advanced qualified electronic signature, issued on secure cryptographic devices, or cloud-based with the cryptographic keys stored on a secure HSM.</p>
<p>I would like to mention for anyone interested in adopting a solution that allow users to sign from whatever device, be that mobile or desktop, the standardisation effort of Cloud Signature Consortium, which delivered common technical specification for cloud-based digital signatures adopted widely, not only in EU. So, Cloud Signature Consortium, as I mentioned, at the beginning, is a non-profit association with 68 members from 41 countries. Those members implemented the specifications from CSC into their solution, providing signature services with global interoperability not only within the EU boundaries. So, we have an open market for uniform adoption of solutions with legal effect. Everyone should have access to secure digital signature, which must be a commodity now, across a full range of cloud applications on mobile devices and the web.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, sounds definitely, definitely good.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, indeed, indeed it’s a success story as well. And I’m very happy to be part of this brilliant team of experts working together in bringing standards on the market. And of course, we will continue with new services related to digital transformation services.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what is the current status now we are in, we’re talking now in November, I think this is going to be – probably slightly later but yeah, November 2022, we are talking November 2022, what is the current status of eIDAS 2.0?</p>
<p>Viky: Well, we should look at eIDAS 2.0 as a highway with multiple lanes. We have legislative, we have standardisation, and we have implementation lane. The eIDAS 2.0 proposal has a complex process of approval, and a very challenging timeline. Currently, the file is close to the end of revision period, by the policymakers, I mean, the Council of the European Union and the EU Parliament. Each of them will come with an amended version and is expected that in 2023, the first quarter or latest, the second quarter, will enter into a trialogue with the European Commission for the final form of the proposal. So, end of second quarter 2023, we should have the final draft of eIDAS 2.0 regulation.</p>
<p>In addition to that, there is the toolbox expert group under the European Commission guidance and in close cooperation with representatives from each member states, are working on a technical architecture and reference framework, common standards and technical specifications, common guidelines and best practices for the EUDI wallet and corresponding use cases.</p>
<p>The core actors for the toolbox group are different DG units from the European Commission, DG CONNECT, DG IT, DG MOVE, DG HOME, DG SANTE and ENISA European institution covering the security and the cybersecurity aspects. Also, the private sectors community and relevant standardisation bodies have been invited by the toolbox expert group to provide support based on their relevant expertise.</p>
<p>A first draft of their architecture reference framework was published this year in February, and by mid-November, so in a couple of – in two weeks, for instance, is expected the second version. So, everybody stay tuned, we should see the enhanced architecture reference framework publicly available. But as the timeline for the implementation is really tight, once eIDAS 2.0 will enter into force, the European Commission has already launched two separate funding calls. One for the reference, EUDI wallet development and implementation. And one for large scale projects, proposing major use cases with cross-border transactions and significant number of users to be on-boarded.</p>
<p>So, you can notice the great support of everyone in the European Union of what I personally consider the most ambitious project since the invention of the internet. eIDAS 2.0 will be a success and the benchmark for digital identity as is for trust services already.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. It’s very ambitious and – and you said, so when the citizens will be starting using, probably by 2024?</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, probably by 2024. Because the large-scale project, for instance, should start working on the implementation early next year, with two years deadline. So, by the end of 2024, we should have the first citizens on-boarded in this large-scale project. For instance, being able to show their driving license online through EUDI wallet, or to have the capability to open a bank account using their electronic identity from the wallet, or to have a very seamless digital travel experience from buying flight tickets, to the check-in, to the border control authorities, up to on-boarded on the plane.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. It sounds like a dream but that’s something that is coming already. It’s really coming. That’s good.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, it sounds like a dream but will become reality. I’m very confident.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. That’s the good thing. And I’m sure this is going to expand outside Europe in a way once this reached the success.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, we’ll expand, and we’ll have an impact outside Europe as well, because we are moving, we are moving in other countries so we can use our electronic identities to verify and to prove who we are in other countries as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Viky, final question, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Viky: eIDAS 2.0 main capital. eIDAS 2.0 is a game changer for such multifaceted concept as digital identity that will restore the trust and confidence of citizens in online interaction without forfeiting our fundamental rights and our privacy. It’s a very ambitious mission. It’s a very challenging mission. And the effort should be collaborative for its success. Policymakers, standardisation bodies, public administrators, public administrations, private sector providers, we should all work together to design and to regulate our smart devices to be tools of digital freedom, not of digital surveillance.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely. Thanks a lot, Viky, for super interesting conversation. And I can of course, commend you, all the work you and many of your colleagues across the members of the European Union have been working during this last year. It’s a fantastic job. So please let us know how people would like to get in touch with you. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Viky: Well, they can reach me out through my LinkedIn profile where I’m quite active, Viky Manaila. Or, my Twitter profile, the same Viky Manaila. And of course, by email that I suppose you will post it on the transcription notes on the episode.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot, Viky, for this conversation and all the best.</p>
<p>Viky: Thank you. Thank you and goodbye, everyone.</p>

				  The <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger Foundation</a> is a global, open source community hosted by the Linux Foundation that focuses on developing and maintaining a diverse selection of tools, libraries and frameworks for creating enterprise-grade blockchain solutions.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Char Howland</p>
<p>Why is Hyperledger important?</p>
<p>Hyperledger is a leading open source community that provides a host of benefits to the individuals and organizations building from its projects. People all over the world collaborate on Hyperledger projects resulting in continuous, sustainable innovation and interoperability.</p>
<p>The dynamic nature of open source allows the projects to advance and stay relevant as new technologies become available. Contributions can come from anyone, with organizations often encouraging their employees to take part — as is the case with Indicio — or from an individual who wants to learn and practice their skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hyperledger Foundation also plays a key role in the marketplace. It ensures that blockchain technology is not only available to those with the ability to pay large sums to proprietary sellers, but accessible to anyone with new ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I get involved?</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to get involved with Hyperledger open source projects. Developers, UX designers, technical writers, project managers, marketers — anyone with an interest in the technology can join working group calls to learn about and contribute to projects.</p>
<p>To find out which groups you may be interested in joining, check the <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings">calendar of public meetings</a>. Clicking into the calendar entries shows Zoom information and links to meeting pages. You can also join the <a href="https://discord.gg/hyperledger">Hyperledger Discord</a> to introduce yourself and ask questions on the channels of specific groups.</p>
<p>Working groups have one or more moderators who lead meetings and coordinate progress. Most of these groups support open discussion, so if you have an idea for a feature or use case you’d like to implement, bring your idea to the group for discussion and see if it is something the team can add to the roadmap.</p>
<p>Personal experience</p>
<p>Indicio strongly supports its employees contributing to the Hyperledger community, and it has been a great experience learning about and contributing to open source projects and working with people from a variety of countries and professional backgrounds to mutual benefit. There’s a great sense of community and it is rewarding to see the incredible progress the projects have made.</p>
<p>One of the perks of working in an open source community — particularly at Hyperledger — is that it is both big enough to make a real impact on the technology and the companies using it, while being small enough that individual contributions are noticeable and appreciated. This year I was <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2022/10/14/staff-corner-thanking-community-members-for-their-contributions">recognized</a> at the community’s biggest event of the year <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/hyperledger-global-forum/">Hyperledger Global Forum</a> for work in the Hyperledger Aries/Identity community and co-moderating the <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/Identity+Implementers+WG+Call">Identity Implementers Working Group</a>.</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<p>By joining a foundation like Hyperledger, you will be on the cutting edge of blockchain technology. You will have the opportunity to learn new techniques and technologies, meet new and interesting people, and see your contributions make a difference.</p>
<p>We encourage you to visit the Hyperledger website <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">here</a> and check out the groups that Indicio is involved in <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-source/">here</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Hi, everybody. This is Michael Cichon, chief marketing officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here today with Mike Engle, our chief strategy officer, to talk about synthetic identity. Mike, synthetic identity, it’s not a new problem, but a pernicious one. Can you just define what we’re talking about when we mention synthetic identities?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Sure. It’s actually not a very well understood term. We are all familiar with bad guys stealing your account data. My username, password, login, is me and steal my money. We also know about people who may steal my identity. So the first is account takeover, you stole my Chase account. The second is, I’m going to use your identity to pretend to be you and steal your credit, maybe open an account. This is a whole new category where they’re making a new identity, right? Synthetic, it’s fake. And they’re doing it in some pretty crafty ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, tell us about that. What makes up a synthetic identity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>So a couple types. One is there’s fabricated. So I am going to take the name John Smith and maybe a valid address in Austin, Texas, and I’m going to put those attributes together along with a birthdate that I know belongs to a John Smith somewhere. Which that’s pretty easy to find, right? Millions of John Smith’s birthdays are available out on the web. And the bad guys have gotten really good at feeding that information to the banks that will pass the sniff test where it says, that really could be a real person, maybe I haven’t seen them before. And so that’s a completely fabricated synthetic identity. As part of that, they even have buckets of social security numbers that they put into those algorithms to bypass those checks as well. My social belongs to me, these socials are maybe in a fuzzy state, haven’t been used before or reclaimed.</p>
<p>There’s a second type, which is manipulated, and they’ll mix their own PII or somebody else’s PII with some alternate. So it’s like maybe just a slight variation of mind. And in some of those cases, you can create a brand new credit record and start to build it up, in others you’re stealing somebody else’s credit at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Right. Okay, great. So I’ve read about this, they’re kind of Frankenstein identities, little bits and pieces of information, I guess often commonly used names, common cities where there’s large populations and different permutations of first and last name and so forth. So who’s affected by synthetic identities?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>That’s the thing, in account takeover and identity fraud, identity theft, they’re stealing it from me, and I can make a big splash about that. However, when you create a synthetic identity, it’s really just the banks that are exposed. In fact, they don’t even really know how to classify it into their fraud buckets because it’s not impacting going back to a specific individual. So, really, it’s affecting all of us because it’s making our products and services more expensive. And it also could affect us because now the banks have to make us jump through more and more hoops to prove that we’re not synthetic. So it’s a combination of effects flowing downstream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>So I guess then the origin of a synthetic identity, this thing, this person that does not exist. But I guess because the criminal trying to use it has applied for credit, they get a credit file, so now it’s in use, and they develop this over time. They develop a credit history for this identity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>That’s right. So, the way it’ll work. Just some industry stats, we’re going to cover these on the webinar next week, but up to 2% of all bank accounts now are created with synthetic identities. That’s 2%, that’s a lot. There’s $355 million in card debt for people who did not exist in two in 2017, so almost a half a billion dollars.</p>
<p>The way it works is I create the synthetic identity and I start to create some good behavior, I buy some stuff, I make some payments. And then I do what’s called busting out, when it’s time for me, I think I’ve got the most value out of my account, the most credit I could get for example, I’ll rack my credit card up and go over the limit because they let you go over your limit by a bit. And the bust out average loss is $90,000 across these accounts. So it’s significant dollars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>That is significant. But I mean, how do these things get created? I mean, it’s got to be embedded somewhere in the verification process. We’ve got a valid social, but it’s social security number that’s not associated with the name. I mean, what’s happening here? What’s the core? What’s the root cause of this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>The root cause is that most account openings, at least here in the US, are stuck in the nineties the way they do it. So if you go to many banks today, you’ll type in your first name, last name, address, date of birth, social, and that starts the entire account creation process. What’s wrong with that? Well, it’s not really easy to validate against a trusted source because that data’s been stolen a dozen times over from various breaches of the credit bureaus. So, because we’re using knowledge and knowledge can be slightly tweaked, it’s also known by everybody. KBA, known by anybody. That’s how the fraudsters are able to manipulate. And so I’m guessing your next question might be, what do we do differently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>I’m sorry if I rattle on this, but banks are required by the anti-terrorism legislation to do the know your customer checks. So you’re saying they’re doing them, but it doesn’t sound like they’re doing them all that well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>The laws don’t get revised that often. And so if we go back to Patriot Act, it’s 20 years old, then they’re still meeting the spirit of the law and they’re checking that box for compliance to say that we do KYC. But that doesn’t mean it’s the best way to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So what is the best way to do it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Well, I don’t know about the best, but one of the best would be to have the user provide better forms of proof about their identity at the time they sign up for a service. The technology is now in our hands to do this. Go back 20 years, really all you could do was type in a keyboard or go into a branch, and that’s what they made you do. You had to go into a branch, look the person in the face. But today, everything’s done remote. And so now we can ask the user to present government issued credentials remotely through something called document verification, and then tie in the identity verification on top of that.</p>
<p>The process around that is actually very straightforward. I type create a new account, hit the button, and I’m asked to present my government credentials, and I will take my mobile phone out or in some cases I might even be able to hold it up to a laptop or desktop camera and present that credential where it can be verified using all kinds of different technologies, optical character recognition and other fraud signals that’ll go into that check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right. So a government issued credential. So we’ve got what? The federal government in the US issues the passport, the state government’s issue the driver’s license and I guess the Social Security Administration issues the SSN number, are those the document types that are validated typically?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah they are. Driver’s license is obviously the most common and the most pervasive. As part of that, you’ll typically be asked for scan the front, the back, and then your face will be matched to the photo. And then there’ll be a few other checks, because even that could be manipulated. And so to prove that my driver’s license is valid and I didn’t buy it from a truckload of fake licenses, we can verify the authenticity of the license through the issuing authority. So there’s an organization called AAMVA, A-A-M-V-A, which is an aggregator of all the DMVs, not almost all the DMVs in the US and they’re coming into Canada. So we can do more checks besides just doing what your camera and AIML can do. We can go then make some calls out to say, on top of what they gave us, does it look good from a data perspective as well? So we’ll check AAMVA, check the SSN, make sure that their SSN address with the bureaus matches the one on the license. And we can even do some checks on the ownership of the email address or the phone number. I’ve had the same phone number for 10 years, if it says Mike Engle in the records, that’s another source of truth that brings credibility to my account signup process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, well if I’m doing this remotely, how do I do the facial match? I, how do I prevent somebody from maybe holding up a photo and showing that and then trying to match that photo against the driver’s license?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, the photo, deep fakes, or if you’ve seen the Elon Musk videos of late, they’re really getting impressive. And it’s a bit of a cat and mouse game where the bad guys will try to do certain types of fraudulent activities, and we on the kind of good guy side, will have to catch them and stop it. So a couple things are done.</p>
<p>There’s the concept of liveness. So we can pretty much tell now if you’re holding up a photo or if it’s a real face, you can tell there’s depth. And we can also even tell if the document, there’s something called document liveness, there’s person liveness, and so these technologies are continuously evolving. And there’s even another concept of where we called morphing where you take two pictures and put them together into make almost a new face that all the algorithms could point to one way or another. So yeah, it’s continuously evolving and it’s just the nature of the good guy versus bad guy. But we’re in a pretty good place right now, and it’s far better than the way that most banks are doing it today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, well, it’s a step in the right direction, but of course, we’re doing this digitally now and we’re creating all these digital artifacts. Privacy’s got to be an issue. So banks then, do they inherit a privacy concern when they start to move in this direction of the remote identity proofing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>They can. If you’re capturing people’s biometrics, for example, or maybe you’re saving a copy of a driver’s license, you need to disclose that, handle it properly. But today, banks own so much sensitive information that I’m pretty sure that they can do that well. And then there’s also newer technologies and the concept of giving the user their own encryption keys so that they’re in charge of it, yet they can share it when they need to. So yeah, a lot of options on the table there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>And at 1Kosmos, of course, our systems are privacy by design, so only the user has access and control over that PII.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>All right. That’s a little PSA from my side. All right. Well, I know that you’re doing a webinar on November 17th, 1:00 PM Eastern Time with Oliver Wyman. So if you happen to see this folks before that event, tune in. If not, the replay will be available on the 1Kosmos website.</p>
<p>Mike, as usual, thank you’ve very much for your time today. Very interesting conversation on synthetic identities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Pleasure to be here. Thank you very much.</p>

				  Indicio is demonstrating a “Governance Editor” at the Internet Identity Workshop in Mountain View, California, as the company collaborates with the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) on a specification for Decentralized Ecosystem Governance  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Mike Ebert</p>
<p>It can be jarring for people accustomed to conferences, but the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>—a biannual event at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California—is an “unconference.” This means that the agenda is created live each day by the attendees who are present at the opening of each day; this gives you, if you’re there, the opportunity to set a topic for discussion. Attendees can and do pop in and out of discussions depending on how interested they are in what’s being discussed.</p>
<p>As with all conferences, un or not, the action is in the hallways and around the demonstrations, where conversations happen and take flight. And attendees this year will have the opportunity to talk to Indicio as attending staff demonstrate its new <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">Governance Editor</a>.</p>
<p>The Governance Editor is an easy way to create and implement the governance rules for issuing and verifying digital credentials in a Trusted Digital Ecosystem. Indicio has been working with the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trust-establishment">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a> to write a specification for decentralized governance that is<a href="https://indicio.tech/decentralized-ecosystem-governance-better-more-effective-and-more-robust-than-trust-registries/"> machine-readable</a>.</p>
<p>This means that both the trust lists of trusted issuers of credentials and the rules for how the information in the credentials should be verified are written to a governance file. This file is then cached in the agent software for each issuer, holder, and verifier in a Trusted Digital Ecosystem, which means maximal speed for verification, minimal delay in updating approved issuers and changes to rules through file propagation, and, critically, the possibility of offline verification.</p>
<p>Decentralized Ecosystem Governance makes it easy to scale a Trusted Digital Ecosystem and use verifiable credentials interoperably across ecosystems and jurisdictions while observing hierarchical rules.</p>
<p>As often, it’s easier to understand the concept by seeing it in action, so if you can’t join us between Nov 15-17 in Mountain View, you can watch a video of the demonstration: <a href="https://youtu.be/8DUf7U4aKj4">https://youtu.be/8DUf7U4aKj4</a></p>
<p>We also made a webpage with more information about the demo and with lots of links that will help you implement DEGov: <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor">https://indicio.tech/governance-editor</a></p>

  With 2022 proving to be a tough year for the crypto industry due to back-to-back blows (TerraUSD crash, FTX collapse, crypto hacks, etc.), the regulatory pressure is only going to intensify from here, be it from the FATF, G20, the European Union, Financial Stability Board, or&nbsp;more.  For instance, the FATF reiterated ahead of the “No Money for Terror” meeting, which is scheduled to take place next week, that countries should enforce the Travel Rule at the earliest.  However, there are several issues that VASPs may face while complying with the Travel Rule, namely VASP discovery &amp; data security, which Shyft Veriscope successfully solves across all jurisdictions.  <p>With the crypto market gaining mainstream attention in the 2017 bull market, as observed in terms of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/730876/cryptocurrency-maket-value/">sharp growth in the crypto market cap</a>, policymakers, regulators, and other national and international authorities started being increasingly concerned about the potential use of virtual assets to illicitly move funds across the ecosystem. However, they adopted a wait &amp; watch approach towards the virtual assets industry.</p><p>Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global anti-money laundering watchdog, was one such international body. Cryptocurrencies entered the FATF’s consciousness back in 2014 amid increasing concerns that malicious actors are abusing this emerging asset class for illicit activities, such as human trafficking, drug trafficking, terrorist fundraising, sanctions evasion, states being able to enrich nuclear weapons, and so&nbsp;forth.</p><blockquote>As such, the global anti-money laundering watchdog published guidelines on cryptocurrencies in 2019, directing countries to register virtual asset service providers and requiring such firms to monitor crypto transactions and report any suspicious activity to authorities.</blockquote><p>Yet, to date, only a few countries have enforced the FATF Travel Rule. However, with India assuming the G20 presidency, crypto regulations, including the FATF Travel Rule, will continue to be a hotly debated topic globally, <a href="https://news.abplive.com/business/crypto/2022-g20-summit-india-presidency-objective-plan-agenda-cryptocurrency-regulation-cbfc-digital-rupee-rbi-1563295">as reiterated multiple times</a> by the country’s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Indian Prime minister Narendra Modi, too, has demanded several times for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-seeks-decision-on-crypto-rule-at-g20/articleshow/95496890.cms?from=mdr">global cooperation on crypto regulations</a>, noting that it’s not enough for one country to regulate cryptocurrencies.</p><p>On top of this, 2022 hasn’t been too kind to the crypto market shaken by the TerraUSD crash, Celsius, or FTX collapse, to mention a few. The decade-or-so-long ecosystem has experienced unprecedented setbacks this year. Moreover, crypto hacks in 2022, which amount to <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-hackers-steal-3-billion-in-2022-set-to-be-biggest-year-for-digital-asset-heists-9347301.html">$3 billion</a> so far, have surpassed the numbers from previous years by a considerably large&nbsp;margin.</p><p>All these instances have added to the resolve of authorities, compelling them to adopt crypto regulations at the earliest. Travel Rule is now widely recognised as a disruptor to illicit finance from using cryptocurrency.</p><p>The FATF, too, reiterated ahead of the “No Money for Terror” meeting, which is scheduled to take place next week, that countries must enforce the Travel Rule at the earliest. All countries are being urged to comply with the Travel Rule as a matter of international priority, and to that point, Travel Rule compliance will be mandatory for all VASPS, no matter the location.</p><blockquote>However, there is a critical issue that VASPs face whilst attempting to comply with the Travel Rule: no way to automatically discover and verify the counterparty VASP to an entity level which would automatically provide information on the entity’s location, regulated status, Travel Rule reporting threshold, supported Travel Rule protocols, and contact&nbsp;details.</blockquote><p>The combination of Shyft Discover and Shyft Veriscope Share solves this issue without friction for end-users, in real time, securely, and while maintaining the decentralized nature of&nbsp;crypto.</p> Shyft Discover: Auto-detection of the counterparty VASP <p>When complying with the Travel Rule, originator VASPs should accurately verify who owns the beneficiary wallet address, which is crucial as user data is sensitive information. It’s a critical step as otherwise, user personal information may be sent to the incorrect counterparty VASP, causing a breach of data privacy obligations.</p><p>This is where Shyft Discover excels, as it enables VASPs to auto-detect counterparty VASPs just by using the crypto wallet address, without requiring users to input additional information themselves and without the VASP having to publicly publish its own wallet addresses.</p><p>A further step of automated address proofing ensures that the VASP actually controls the wallet address they claim to. Once verified, a payload of information about the VASP is shared, including the regulated status, travel rule threshold, and travel rule protocols supported.</p><p>Shyft Discover automates VASP discovery and enables originator VASPs to reliably identify counterparty VASPs at a legal entity/jurisdiction level. Moreover, it further empowers VASPs with the ability to choose which counterparties they are prepared to share data with and which ones to exclude, depending on the VASP’s own risk-based approach.</p><p>Shyft Discover is essentially providing a decentralized, verified phone book for VASPs on a global basis. The information on a VASP is owned by the VASP but becomes available to counterparties on-demand in real-time. As the only solution to provide this, and as a public utility, this forms the first layer of critical infrastructure in solving the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>However, once VASP discovery &amp; proofing is successfully completed through Shyft Discover, it’s time for Shyft’s Veriscope Share, the second part of the critical Travel Rule compliance infrastructure framework, to resolve the user data sharing&nbsp;problem.</p> Veriscope Share: Enabling VASPs to Share Critical User Data Securely&nbsp;P2P <p>Under the Travel Rule, VASPs must share critical user data along with the crypto transaction with their counterparty VASPs. However, just as there is no globally-agreed framework to solve the VASP discovery problem while complying with the Travel Rule, there is also no framework to standardize the mechanism for secure data transfers between&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>Although some Travel Rule Solutions exist in the market that can help solve the sharing, VASPs should be aware that the user data they share with their counterparty VASPs may be passing through the Travel Rule solution’s own servers. And there are significant risks in this approach, particularly in relation to unauthorized access, monitoring, and liability.</p><blockquote>This is where <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a> Share proves to be a true game-changer. In contrast to a majority of Travel Rule Solutions that are available, Veriscope Share enables VASPs to exchange user data in a fully secured manner without storing it on third-party servers. Transfers are peer-to-peer, VASP to VASP, with no intermediary steps.</blockquote><p>When using Veriscope Share, VASPs mitigate risks of rogue employees of a Travel Rule Solution accessing their user data for dubious purposes and also removes the potential for wide-scale data breaches.</p><p>Veriscope Share complies with all major data privacy laws, such as GDPR, while ensuring 100% VASP-to-VASP data transfers.</p><p>Overall, Shyft has reinvented Travel Rule compliance by considering all angles of the requirements, from AML to data privacy, and building privacy, security, AML, and compliance from the&nbsp;outset.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Identity Server 2022.2 is released today, including SSO 9.1 and CustomerID 6.1&nbsp; 
<p>During the shorter release cycle we have continued core structural updates for SSO and added in more Risk-Based Authentication (RBA) capabilities. For all the details, please head over to review our <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20222/pages/8963424357/Identity+Server+2022.2+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 Features&nbsp; 
<p>Risk-Based Authentication (RBA): Continuing our development of risk-based authentication, we have extended the ability to require MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) to directory mapped users. These are external organisations, such as your partners or a company you are acquiring, whose users (external directory users) need access to any of your integrated applications. The applications can be integrated with either OIDC (OpenID Connect) &nbsp;or SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) &nbsp;and the external user management of these external directory users can be left in the hands of your partner company, while the user credentials will be mapped into your SSO Ubilogin Directory. Now these external users will be able to utilise SMS OTP, SMTP OTP or most importantly TOTP (i.e. with Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator) to easily and strongly assure their identity during the login session. Users can elect to use SMS or SMTP, their credentials will be queried via the integrated IdP or they can elect to use TOTP (Time-based One Time Password), where a secret key pair is generated by SSO and given to the user in the form of a QR code that you generate and they scan with their smartphone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a Zero Trust principle, you will be able to require all classes of users internal (found in Ubilogin Directory), external (found in your partners directory, but mapped into Ubilogin Directory) or unregistered (located in an integrated external IDP) to be multi-factor authenticated during each login session. From this starting zero trust point, we will continue our risk-based authentication development over the next several release cycles. We are excited to expand our Identity Platform into this dynamic security space and believe we will deliver many useful enhancements to the platform. Ask your Sales Team/Account Manager for more information on upcoming development plans.&nbsp;</p>
 Improved Security&nbsp; 
<p>Ongoing security is key – as we maintain the Identity Platform, we continue to improve both its functionality and security.  During this release cycle we’ve updated the third-party libraries used for logging throughout our SSO application. We have fully removed Log4j and replaced it with SLF4j and Logback. Logback replaces the Log4j libraries that SSO has utilised since the beginning of our service offering. While SLF4j is a logging facade – which is an API driven framework that permits us to update and modify the underlying logging application without making service impacting changes. Restated – we can update and improve our codebase without making any future alterations to the log files you utilise from Identity Platform. One caveat of course, where there is additional features created (like risk-based authentication features) your log files will contain additional information, but will remain in the same format and location. You can find highlights of the changes on the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20222/pages/8963424357/Identity+Server+2022.2+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> along with a link to the detailed example of the logging changes found on our Developer Portal.&nbsp;</p>
 Looking Forward&nbsp; 
<p>Continuing into the autumn and winter, we will be continuing our risk-based authentication development – with a focus on account suspension when abuse is being detected by an upstream security device within your environment. The abuse could be protection from brute force password cracking, or phishing attempts or could be more benign like time-of-day access violations (or limits) or limiting the maximum number of times a single user account can log onto a service simultaneously. Naturally we will continue the improvements on security, starting with updating Wildfly – the underlying web server used for CustomerID. There will also be additional improvements throughout the platform. If you have any questions over the features and security improvements offered in this release or over our upcoming development items please feel free to engage with us via the Operations team or your account team – we are always happy for your input to help shape our future developments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard of KYC (Know Your Customer), or experienced it first hand when you signed up for an account at a financial institution. It’s the process in which a bank, for instance, verifies that you are who you say you are — typically by asking for identifying documents and other relevant personal information.</p><p>KYC is a subset of anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) obligations that many firms must deal with. Originally, these regulations were designed for financial institutions but over time, the scope has expanded to other industries as well such as healthcare, fintech, and even the nonprofit world.</p><p>International standards are set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) but local rules can vary by jurisdiction.</p><p>The purpose of KYC (and AML and CFT) is straightforward. It’s about keeping real customers safe and keeping the bad guys out of the system. These are good&nbsp;things!</p><p>In practice, however, traditional approaches to KYC create a host of&nbsp;issues:</p>  They’re exclusive. People who don’t have access to traditional identifying documentation will have trouble accessing basic financial services. Migrant workers, for instance, might not even have a home address. According to the World Bank, 1.7 billion people still lack access to a bank&nbsp;account.  They’re expensive. KYC and compliance represents a huge barrier of entry for new companies who not only need to implement systems for identity verification but must also now manage all of that user data in a private and secure way. Which leads us to the next&nbsp;point.  They create honeypots for hackers. It’s no secret that data breaches have risen astronomically over the last ten years as more and more industries have gone digital. Each time you are asked to verify your identity, your personal data and information is now stored in yet another server somewhere, which becomes a target for criminals. Many of these companies don’t specialize in data security.  They’re ineffective. This is the saddest part. Despite the best intentions, KYC is often ineffective at catching or deterring the bad guys. This is inherent to how the system operates today. Data is siloed because institutions hold data in their own proprietary system, and these systems don’t talk to each other. A criminal could try to infiltrate one institution with a synthetic identity. If that doesn’t work out, they still have all the other ones to try. Those other institutions would be none the&nbsp;wiser.  <p>These are major issues! The cold hard truth is that we won’t be able to even begin addressing them without fundamentally rethinking how our identity systems work from the ground&nbsp;up.</p><p>But if you’re reading this blog post, you likely already know that new approaches already exist. These approaches were designed from the ground up with the digital world in mind — versus the legacy and often paper-based systems that they will ultimately replace.</p><p>By leveraging portable and reusable digital identities, financial institutions and other organizations can cover more people around the world, reduce their costs, and create a more seamless and convenient onboarding experience for their&nbsp;users.</p><p>These solutions were designed with privacy and security in mind. And because the user owns their data and no longer has to redundantly share it each time they want to sign up for a new service, there’s less targets for&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>Reusable identities also drastically reduce the barriers to entry for new companies. Which means that companies can focus on what they do best: building great products and services.</p><p>Best of all? They’ll be much more effective at keeping the bad guys&nbsp;out.</p><p>That’s the point, anyway, isn’t&nbsp;it?</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about GlobaliD, <a href="https://www.global.id/">visit our website</a>, <a href="https://www.global.id/demo/">contact our sales team</a> or follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_GlobaliD">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-id-inc/">LinkedIn</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMJDT8IXrg4Y5RDP4W0aOw">YouTube</a>.</p><p>You might also&nbsp;like:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">Part 1:</a> What a smart and humanistic approach to digital identity would&nbsp;like  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-what-is-the-trust-triangle-260e85e1c640">Part 2:</a> The Trust Triangle — the system of issuers, holders, and verifiers that illustrates how identity works (and how it’s broken,&nbsp;today)  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-id-wallets-68fa77e6d0d7">Part 3:</a> Why the ID Wallet is the first step toward achieving a new vision for digital&nbsp;identity  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-every-company-is-an-identity-company-a851beed999d">Part 4:</a> Why every company is an identity&nbsp;company  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-bring-your-own-identity-5b9927008190">Part 5:</a> What is Bring Your Own Identity?  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-reusable-identity-9dc6a1860e8">Part 6:</a> Reusable&nbsp;Identity  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-device-based-identity-c6096a5b0890">Part 7:</a> Device-based identity  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-selective-sharing-d0a0ab7ad1d6">Part 8:</a> Selective sharing  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-non-custodial-wallets-2376db1e1791">Part 9:</a> Non-custodial wallets   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-know-your-customer-989722b55891">GlobaliD 101: Know your customer</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT), 28th Plenary meeting, 11 October&nbsp;2022</p><p>I had the great honor of being invited to speak last month at the 28th Plenary meeting of the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business. My focus was to describe the top three challenges preventing digitization within global trade, and how modern technologies are stacking up to overcome&nbsp;them.</p><p>This blog post is adapted directly from my presentation at the UN, capturing the hopeful message that emerging technical standards constitute a promising solution on the horizon. My slides are available <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/Nis%20Jespersen%20-%20Solving%20International%20Trade%20ChallengeswithEmerging%20Web%20Technologies.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>By means of introduction, the following challenges have obstructed trade and supply chain digitization on a global&nbsp;scale:</p>  Mutual understanding and common semantics  Global identification of trade&nbsp;parties  Establishing and maintaining trust at the&nbsp;distance  <p>The corresponding solution is a technology stack based on cryptography and international W3C web standardization:</p>  JSON Linked&nbsp;Data  Decentralized Identifiers  Verifiable Credentials  <p>These three technologies individually address the particular challenges listed. And as we shall see, in combination they shape an exciting path towards global trade digitization.</p>Preparing to address the&nbsp;UN. Establishing a Common Interpretation of&nbsp;Data <p>The heterogeneous environment of international trade makes it particularly difficult to ensure that the meaning of data is understood. When I say “x”, might it be understood as “歪”, or perhaps&nbsp;“ζ”?</p><p>UN/CEFACT’s Buy-Ship-Pay model is the undisputed global semantic dictionary for terms in trade, broadly adopted and recognized by WCO, WTO, EU and essentially all other relevant organizations.</p><p>However, due to methodology and the way which UN/CEFACT has traditionally been published, making use of the BSP terminology has still entailed certain challenges:</p>  Out-of-bounds vocabulary agreement; the sender must somehow tell the receiver “I am encoding data with UN/CEFACT, so you should interpret it accordingly”.  Human interpretation, mapping source data into UN/CEFACT terms, making decisions such as “Shipping Container means Transport Equipment”.  Another human’s interpretation, mapping UN/CEFACT terms to a target model, for example “Transport Equipment means ตู้คอนเทนเนอร์”.  Breaking legacy API agreements; if a vendor’s API uses shippingContainer, then changing it to transportEquipment is a breaking change, adversely affecting all dependent customers.  Resolving a term URI to its documentation.<p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-tech-school-101-linked-data-enables-integration-across-systems-b751ba4eed6">JSON Linked Data</a> is a standard for overlaying normal API JSON with semantic meaning in a non-breaking manner. This is done by literally adding a context to the data message. The context defines the types and identifiers of the data by use of web URIs. For example, a “consignment” attribute would be defined as <a href="https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/Consignment">https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/Consignment</a>. Such URIs are easily interpretable by computers; and humans too, as it resolves directly to the appropriate documentation of the&nbsp;term.</p><p>JSON-LD enables the data sender to be explicit about the meaning of data such that no further interpretation is needed downstream. Interpret once, understand everywhere.</p><p>Further, JSON-LD is in fact an implementation of a first-order logic data model known as RDF. This allows computers to automatically consume data without the need of human interpretation. JSON-LD data is directly machine readable, <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-united-nations-trust-graph-d65af7b0b678">building knowledge graphs</a> which enables <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/neo4j-graph-data-science-with-verifiable-credential-data-98b806f2ad78">advanced data analysis</a>.</p><p><a href="https://v.jsld.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">Here</a> you can see an example of a JSON-LD file and its expanded machine knowledge interpretation.</p> Identification of Global Trade&nbsp;Parties <p>Digital identity today is largely based on the concept of identity federation. Federation was a step up from the 1st generation online identity which required establishing identity for every single online service. However, while large commercial Identity Providers dominate the personal identity space, the realm of global trade poses a number of specific challenges which has prevented federation-based adoption on a global scale. It is certainly not for lack of a golden business opportunity — the potential of establishing The Identity Provider for Global Trade is a mighty pot of honey. If a federation-based solution was possible, it would exist&nbsp;already.</p>Common Identity Providers.<p>Commercial organization identifier registries do exist, but are not used for federated authentication. The same is true for other identifiable things; GS1 and BIC are noteworthy successful identifier registries. But again these offer identifiers, not authentication.</p><p>State-governed Identity Providers do exist, also for businesses. But these are almost entirely recognized within that country, international federation is basically non-existent.</p><p>Also, the federation approach logically does not scale well: everyone recognizing everyone else’s Identity Providers is an exponentially complex&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Even assuming all of these problems could be overcome, Identity Provider model would be unattractive:</p>  The 3rd party Identity Provider gains trade secret insights. Such insights are the main business model of today’s Identity Providers. While already questionable for personal usage, it is definitely unacceptable for businesses.  An identity provider for global trade would effectively be granting a monopoly to a vendor; monopolies tend to not benefit&nbsp;users.  Centralization entails a single point of failure. The honey pot is equally tempting for malicious exploitation — a classic argument for decentralization.  <p>Decentralized Identifiers are based on a model where the controller of an identity keeps a private key which is used for authentication, assertions and other use cases where proving identity control is required.</p><p>All DIDs resolve to a DID Document, which include the corresponding public key. This way, anyone can verify that an entity claiming to control a given identifier indeed holds its private key. This removes the need to map between multiple identity provider representations; each DID is essentially its own Identity Provider.</p><p>This is an example of a DID: did:web:transmute.industries. You can try resolving this DID and explore its corresponding DID Document&nbsp;<a href="https://lucid.did.cards/identifiers/did:web:transmute.industries">here</a>.</p> Establishing Trusted Relationships Establishing trust remains an analogue endeavor.<p>Global trade spans cultures, political environments and jurisdictions almost by definition. This makes it hard to establish and maintain trusted business relationships. Trust today in large part rides on costly and fragile personal relationships.</p><p>Even assuming a trusted relationship, how can you be sure that a set of claims are in fact representing the business partner’s intention? The traditional way is based on signed paper documents, backed by law. The intuitive digital equivalent is PDFs with scanned signatures as a means to “digitization”. But while a digital picture can be transmitted over the internet, it does not enable automation; and data security is also brittle and based on human judgment.</p><p>Commercial platforms typically approach this challenge by signing into a walled-off contractual environment which. This has several shortcomings:</p>  It is limited to a particular business&nbsp;process.  Disincentive for cross-platform interoperability, passing the problem to&nbsp;users.  Trust is lost when data leaves the platform.  <p>A Verifiable Credential essentially ties a data message to an issuer with a cryptographic signature. At any later point in time, it can be verified that this cryptographic linkage is unbroken. As simple as that sounds, it is an incredibly powerful way to enable&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Structured data can be transmitted from a trusted party, and the receiver can be confident that the data is untampered and corresponds to the issuer’s intent. The Verifiable Credential may change hands many times over, just like physical and digital documents always have been passed around. At any point throughout the supply chain, its content can be verified.</p><p>Further, if a trusted organization has issued a Verifiable Credential about an unknown organization, that becomes a trust enabler. For example, it can be challenging to trust ethical manufacturing from a supplier manufacturing on a different continent. Trust can be bootstrapped by a locally present certificate issuer. This way, cryptographic chains linking back to relevant and trusted organizations can form entire supply chain trust&nbsp;graphs.</p><p>You can try verifying a Verifiable Credential <a href="https://api.did.actor/v/eJztV91y2jgUfhWP9zYm_sEGfFUKCaUbCNQhbdLZ2RHyAdTYkiPJEOj0YfYZ-gh9sT0yJCFtmmm7e7WbOyR9_nTOd84npI_2Cyq4hhttx-_thdaFig8PV6tVbRXUhJwf-q7XPKQSUuCakUwdLj374B4YsLSCaUkokCnLmF4byB8HNkvt2C4lj8uSpXEI9XDmhaFDW_WWU3fd0CENCB0_4ixsTiMStggS63UBJpJzkGzGyDSDzt3euNwReQ6S4qDPl4LR_VXckpMcv95DWTuY1QGpkZASDUiTgqKSFZoJjvCuoGWOJJYEKmTK-NwiFibEFaEGYk1BrwA4zirIMpAW4SkOpuUaJLIxpUrCKXQNeWz7ru87ru_4wZnnxWEYu-7lDoXw-ONdjqdyTjjbkCqMW8FS1OoK1vEmGlxplmyuj1tX16t00jy_Sl_-fhNGRxebd7NizoejSbu34QWjQ_Z2xu277AfkhlltClJYA7jBlLn4JuXjUrEvn7m1tmZkKhFDq2EKFqk-VF8-Zyw132WCbgPcC3yUIcpEPAexP98D0RGVgqiEMoAMv9VlWskS1qKmHwTNZiNyozByGxU7n98CHM-tBV7QCBrNpufWXb9pfzqwSZpKUOrB9kJpkrV3C7iL0hJA307EdnsJnKXE6hCZCWV5rmvfEZ1gPqZJEfYKJP_yVwobk_eASHKPegPzrVDDEpbCOgFhBC6qjTuiCjfw_X3ejii5loa2El3YnzB4yAnLcIrxmXgBNyQvMqhx0IZrITgMy3xqesIO0Rie33AaTS8wWd8bLimnH4Dq_fx3PW0yL4TUp7Oj7c6PFKjkmO823kly0ntpuLETtKkQJrgX9DsTUynpgqi9RvaqRjaO33b-U-373H7_mfbbnmxP1PrJsvyIZrtm6QHHg55aA6GFVJaYWe3cTBgtvpbV862v4F35qLBd0FIw_YicA0YXbE7YN2rWsTV8J_Qaj0o6SdqoJ-rCNOQqWbCiADyr39_ndyZJCieMQx8RlTGlSMuHth3tpnA1J7yc4Z9LKZ8t9T-x1MNqTYaJlQQoiWvRhRQ5K3OHM3oFmYUBMZ7h_vgLcCxFlqka8q-AzRcPOmqM1w6sBlZkCeckK3dHPtO7hLKpwu-W1Qr6Jwoxvds2rrKz4xBLLoVSb3-M_Jar6YeVVF9thtzZzgRnAoUdSfM_9cADOJEUQLd3sV2bF1tYiPLvBp1SSuB0a76uCfrZa89e-zWv9UiGbUs4B5JBarWTs4HVdqIwsDaMU4dJvOGTLBNrhwpUPt35Ti1QlZ8x3p3P_Kj5mDceGs93f815fhhE_7716vXvWw9R2jD-ZKBBEHnfCbSiG5G1eXR1yx-PshU9cUCYY0DM7rnso9QPQ6-VsDkaCt1vXrJ2dbU2Vb59qHl4xW2ceX4ctGKveqgtq6fndvMB6IX4J8-y337hHVclMiolGsbkQZQyj9e7YA7sDyvjU1i_Xkx7lJ2y18eXR2_Oxklf9fO-P-z0o8v8WFF_guPhmrwbs9NMsYsPF24_81q12nVRd_TFa6fudU5I0ihfndKX_uRmfqx6yneSTdppnOvuG_8VgFyQxSmo8nownozb0Z-Xw-n572MGvfnJxj8O6sUon3aT62XaHWMR_gb5v3BZ">here</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>Cultural, language and other contextual obstacles can be overcome by overlaying common data messages with Linked Data.

   ForgeRock's new cloud-native governance is purpose-built to help solve security and compliance challenges for large enterprises at scale. 

 Delivering the Future of Workforce Governance 

<p>Today we <a href="https://investors.forgerock.com/press-releases/detail/359/forgerock-introduces-new-cloud-native-governance-solution">announced</a> the newest offering in our cloud lineup, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">ForgeRock Identity Governance</a>. This new solution is a significant advancement in our vision to empower enterprises with self-driving identity where humans remain in control with the aid of AI and machine learning. The aim is to give your organization the ability to stay ahead of the volume and velocity of access changes your IT teams face every day.</p>

<p>The accelerated growth of the hybrid workforce, employee job changes, and increasing adoption of cloud-based applications and services have evolved to a point where today's governance solutions simply can't keep up. But ForgeRock’s new cloud-native identity governance is purpose-built for global enterprise scale.</p>

<p>ForgeRock Identity Governance is part of a comprehensive workforce solution that combines cloud, governance, access management, and powerful machine learning into a converged security and compliance solution. The new offering will combine three primary components: Access Certifications to accelerate manager access decision-making with AI-informed recommendations; Access Requests to provide users with a 24/7 self-service portal and to automate application access; and Segregation of Duties to ensure regulatory compliance when and where you need it.</p>

 Full-Suite Governance Meets Extreme Scale 

<p>A lot of claims are made about scale, but our solution delivers real results. A global financial services organization with 100K+ workforce identities and 3,500+ applications, was able to process 230 million entitlement assignments in less than an hour using ForgeRock Identity Governance.</p>

<p>Performance like this is made possible by our unique cloud architecture that provides fully isolated compute, network, and storage resources in a modern, multi-tenant cloud environment. This means you get the horsepower to process millions of permissions per minute without worrying about a noisy cloud neighbor obstructing your workload.</p>

 Together at Last: Governance + Identity and Access Management 

<p>Today's large enterprises are seeking converged identity solutions as they recognize the business value of consolidating critical pieces of the identity perimeter. According to Gartner, by 2025, 70% of new access management, governance, administration and privileged access deployments will be converged identity and access management platforms<a>1</a>.</p>

<p>To achieve the full benefits of identity-driven security and compliance, you need the ability to manage the identity lifecycle, secure runtime access to resources (authentication and authorization), and continuously govern that access. By converging ForgeRock Identity Governance with our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-named-leader-access-management-2022">industry-leading identity and access management</a> capabilities, you can gain efficiencies and cost savings with the ability to manage, secure, and govern identities throughout their entire lifecycle — all from a single platform.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Benefiting from Our AI investments 

<p>In May, when we <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/identity-perimeter-just-got-smarter">released Autonomous Access</a>, the ForgeRock Identity Platform became the industry's first to infuse AI into the entire identity lifecycle. Our new governance solution leverages these capabilities by applying AI and machine learning to help you determine whether your employees, contractors, partners, and suppliers should or shouldn't have access to applications and data. Security decisions become immediately actionable for IT teams — excessive access can be automatically removed, and low-risk access can automatically be granted — without the need to integrate additional products.</p>

 Connecting the IAM and Governance Dots 

<p>Today's large enterprise needs it all: full-suite governance features that scale to process hundreds of millions of permissions for all identities, combined with comprehensive identity and access management, all powered by AI and delivered from the cloud. We're excited to bring all these requirements together, starting with Access Certifications. ForgeRock Identity Governance will be available in the beginning of 2023. We’d love the opportunity to start a conversation about how ForgeRock can help your organization.</p>

<p>Oceaners!</p><p>We have important updates for&nbsp;you.</p><p>The Energy Efficiency data challenge is officially over and here are the top 3 winners revealed.</p><p>Launched in October 2022, the initiative was designed to incentivise data-driven understandings and innovations to improve energy efficiency for domestic buildings in Scotland. Out of a total prize pool of $6000, rewards for this challenge are as follows: 1st place: $3000, 2nd place: $2000, 3rd place: $1,000 (in OCEAN). All valid entries submitted will also receive an award of 500 OCEAN&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Let’s explore&nbsp;more!</p><p>The <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-10-21-ocean-protocol-energy-efficiency-data-challenge">Energy Efficiency Data</a> challenge is part of the broader <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-the-ocean-data-bounty-7eb1e3bf3c0a">Ocean Data Challenge</a> program that is driven by the vision to spearhead the shift into a New Data Economy by incentivising data-driven insights and the building of algorithms to solve complex business challenges. The idea behind its launch was to harness the power of energy data, build algorithms that facilitate innovation and spearhead the shift towards smarter, greener, more efficient buildings for global&nbsp;change.</p><p>As part of the challenge, participants were presented with an energy performance dataset originating from the <a href="http://www.scottishepcregister.org.uk/">Scottish Energy Performance Certificate Register</a>. The challenge was to create context around the data by generating rankings and visualizations that illustrated how and why the presented data is valuable. Participants were required to build algorithms that could run on the provided data, identify correlations between given attributes and generate specific output/ input. They were also asked to draft a concluding report that presented findings along with quantitative and qualitative analysis and recommendations.</p><p>A panel of evaluators from Ocean reviewed all the submissions and offered the award for 1st place ($3,000) to Andrey Bessalov, 2nd place ($2000) to Viviene Siew and 3rd place ($1,000) to Hoe Jun Leong for their reports. The winners were selected for identifying key insights into the cities and towns with higher energy performance resulting in reduced energy costs and CO2 emissions. Their entries also proposed machine learning models for outputting energy-efficiency improvement suggestions. Further, they also analyzed which building factors contribute to the total cost of energy and what changes can be made to reduce costs by using different building materials.</p><p>Congratulations to all the winners and thank you to all the participants for the entries! Enjoy your&nbsp;rewards!</p><p>Our next challenge, the 2nd ETH Prediction challenge is now live!

<p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! We are back with exciting news from the world of crypto regulations this week, from US Treasury Chief and Indian Finance Minister discussing crypto regulations to FATF’s push for Travel Rule implementation before the “No Money For Terror” meeting on November&nbsp;18–19.</p><p>Shyft’s Veriscope also rolled out a new feature, “<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscopes-address-proofs-enable-vasps-to-protect-critical-data">Address Proofs</a>,” last week, enabling beneficiary VASPs to prove they control the respective crypto wallet address. This, in turn, would ensure that Originator VASPs share critical user data with only the right counterparty VASP for Travel Rule compliance. So, let’s dive straight into it without further&nbsp;ado.</p> Shyft Network: A “Vital Balancer” Between CeFi &amp; DeFi Amid Upcoming Regulatory Blitzkrieg <p>The FTX fiasco has got everyone in the crypto space on their toes, compelling virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to come out clean on their exposure to the erstwhile 3rd largest crypto exchange and its native&nbsp;token.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/josephweinberg/status/1591569280914661376?s=20&amp;t=H5nDcC59oczltbDhQrk_1A">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>Speaking of the impact of FTX’s meltdown, it will be multifold. On the one hand, the expectation for sound crypto regulations has also been blown away. And now, instead of regulations that could have spurred crypto innovation, we will get “knee-jerk reactionary” regulation, as per Shyft Network co-founder Joseph Weinberg.</blockquote><p>On the other hand, the losses that major institutional investors like Ontario Teacher’s Pension Fund and sequoia Capital experienced with FTX’s collapse will impact the institutional activity within the crypto&nbsp;space.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/josephweinberg/status/1591589684299563008?s=20&amp;t=H5nDcC59oczltbDhQrk_1A">Image Source</a>)<p>However, amid accelerating regulations, Shyft Network will prove itself as a “Vital Balancer” between centralized and decentralized finance. Wishing for the demise of either of these options can strain the crypto industry, as both are required to prevent the upcoming regulatory onslaught.</p> US Treasury Chief &amp; India Finance Minister Discussed Crypto Regulation <p>US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to discuss crypto regulation at the 9th India-U.S. Economic and Financial Partnership meeting.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1099">joint statemen</a>t by Yellen and Sitharaman after the meeting, the US and India look forward to discussing… digital assets, payment system modernization, and sustainable finance.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/FinMinIndia/status/1591033855884296194?s=20&amp;t=7Y0Kr3Fci0I4K-b8491X5A">Image Source</a>)<p>Both promised to strengthen their cooperation in AML/CFT efforts through increased information sharing and coordination, including expediting digital evidence and information sharing for ML/TF investigations.</p><blockquote>Following the meeting, Yellen noted that crypto regulation had been a “tremendous focus” of the Biden administration, and while “a good deal of progress” has been made, there’s still some way to go. She also called on taking steps to reduce the cost of cross-border payments.</blockquote> Indonesia to Tighten Crypto Oversight <p>According to the latest media reports, Indonesia plans to grant crypto regulatory oversight to the Financial Service Authority (OJK) from Trade Ministry and the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency to better protect investors.</p><p>The new plan, which would regulate and supervise all digital asset-related activities in Indonesia, was presented by Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the country’s finance minister, as part of financial sector legislation currently being debated in parliament.</p><blockquote>“We need to build a mechanism of supervision and investor protection that is quite strong and reliable, especially for investment instruments that are high risk,” she told a parliamentary hearing.</blockquote><p>The bill was submitted in September and will be enacted into law once greenlighted by the legislative and executive branches.</p> FTX Collapse could be “Catalyst” for Regulation: SEC Commissioner (<a href="https://www.techinasia.com/retail-investors-barred-borrowing-crypto-mas-draws-tentative-measures">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>The much-publicized collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX and the subsequent filing of bankruptcy may be the wake-up call US lawmakers need, said SEC commissioner Hester M.&nbsp;Peirce.</blockquote><blockquote>While the incident has brought much negative attention to the crypto industry, this act as a “catalyst” that will compel government agencies to “sit down” and create clear and “more comprehensive” regulations, she&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>According to her, if the SEC and CFTC work together, the difficulty of regulating crypto can be solved more efficiently as “having one regulator devoted to crypto could be problematic.”</p><p>Peirce suggested that crypto and the underlying blockchain technology could be “integrated into the back end of the financial system,” which requires SEC jurisdiction.</p><p>“The SEC would be a good regulator for spot crypto markets if we got our act together,” she&nbsp;said.</p> FATF Push for “Travel Rule” Implementation (<a href="https://twitter.com/fatfnews/status/1229327843932430336">Image Source</a>)<p>With India ready to host the “No Money For Terror” meeting on November 18–19, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is urging countries to implement the crypto Travel Rule to prevent the misuse of virtual assets by terrorist groups.</p><p>The upcoming meeting will focus on the misuse of virtual assets and crowd-funding platforms, as well as encourage strong cooperation between financial intelligence units (FIUs) to improve the sharing of information.</p><p>The Paris-based financial watchdog recently warned that the implementation of its standard is “going far too slowly.” Out of over 200 countries, only 60 have started to regulate and supervise crypto, while more than 50% “have not even started the process,” said FATF vice president Elisa de Anda Madrazo during the CTC meeting in New&nbsp;Delhi.</p><blockquote>“This is very concerning because while standards take time to be implemented, there is a sense of urgency here. Until most countries implement these new rules, it will not be possible to start implementing the travel rule,” she&nbsp;said.</blockquote> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer! (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1562430776326508544?s=20&amp;t=r5jER9JyQxGazRPmVlv5mQ">Image Source</a>)<p>After Shyft DAO approved the Veriscope VASP grant proposal, an aggregate of 10,000 SHFT has been granted for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that integrate to the Veriscope mainnet by September 30, 2022. The fund will enable VASPs to pay the Shyft Network gas fees while using Veriscope. This offer will remain valid until December 31, 2022, or till the VASP exhausts its SHFT&nbsp;grant.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>SAML and SSO work together to create a more accessible and more secure login for users. But how, exactly, do these methods work?</p>
<p>What is SAML SSO? SAML is an overarching standard that includes single sign-on (SSO). SAML can activate SSO.</p>
 What Is Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)? 
<p>SAML is an open, XML-based protocol that uses a token exchange system to support organizations’ single sign-on (SSO) capabilities. The goal is to provide a secure and flexible foundation for enterprise business applications to <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authenticate</a> users across different platforms and user portals.</p>
<p>The depth of the SAML protocol, particularly with the advent of SAML 2.0 in 2015, provides several ways for developers and administrators to leverage secure communication protocols to share these tokens. However, the core model of the SAML SSO system is relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>The entire solution creates an authentication relationship between the user and two entities:</p>
 
 Service Provider: The application or platform to which the user tries to gain access. 
 Identity Provider: The organization managing identities and credentials for service providers and users. 
 
<p>An example is an employee attempting to log into an HR application (the service provider) using a connected Google Workspace ID (the identity provider). The identity provider manages authentication across several service providers to support full federated authentication and identity management.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the structured communication between service and identity providers is supported by SAML “assertions” or XML tokens. Thus there is a general flow of operations between stakeholders:</p>
 
 User Interaction: A user engages a login page from the service provider. The provider page generates a SAML request, which is given to the browser in the form of an XML token which then redirects the browser to the identity provider. This request can come from an authentication query, an attribute query, or an authorization query. 
 SAML Request to Identity Provider: The user provides their authentication credentials to the provider (which may include single- or <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a>). 
 Authentication with Identity Provider: Upon successful identity verification, the provider returns an XML authentication token to the user’s browser. This token can include various information, depending on the authentication relationship with the service provider, but will at least demonstrate the user is legitimate. 
 Return to Service Provider: The browser redirects back to the service provider site or application. After the token is parsed, the service provider gives the user access to their system. 
 
<p>SAML is typically used for authentication, whereas other protocols (like 0Auth) handle authorization within the system. However, SAML information can and is often used as a way to define user privileges.</p>
 Benefits of SAML SSO 
<p>SAML is one of the most deployed SSO technologies on the market due in no small part to its ease of deployment and robust feature set.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of SAML SSO include:</p>
 
 Stronger Authentication Security: SAML SSO provides a single point of authentication for multiple systems. This reduces the attack surface of multiple systems by centralizing authentication security and minimizing human factors to vulnerabilities (such as reusing passwords or using simple passwords). 
 Improved User Experience: Speaking of the user experience… On average, users have about 100 passwords they keep at any given time. SSO is a critical technology in providing a simpler and more intuitive authentication experience for enterprise users, and it can navigate the variety of cloud applications typically used. 
 
<p>Additionally, it reduces the chances that shared passwords between enterprise and consumer accounts open your systems to attack.</p>
 
 Efficient Credential Management: Having a centralized method of managing identities and authentication, particularly one managed by experts as a service, can reduce costs in terms of security, compliance, and infrastructure management. 
 Open Standardization: SAML has wide adoption because it is an open standard, meaning that many providers and authentication applications will integrate it with their systems. 
 
 What Is SAML 2.0? 
<p>The first version of SAML (1.0) was somewhat limited in scope and application, but the next incremental upgrade (version 1.1) became an industry-standard in 2003 and provided several critical updates. Soon after (in 2005), version 2.0 was ratified by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS).</p>
<p>For most business and private users, the details of SAML 2.0 are quite technical. However, the specification made a few key advances that have impacted how it is deployed. These include:</p>
 
 Workflow: In the SAML 2.0 model described above, the service provider-initiated authentication for the user. In SAML 1.1, this process is reversed, with the identity provider sending the request. 
 Binding: In SAML terminology, “binding” is the process of mapping SAML assertions and messages to standard protocols, namely HTTP. This allows applications, like a web browsers, to pass SAML assertions between sites or apps. SAML 2.0 made binding much more flexible to empower the robust use of SAML across programs. 
 Identity Federation: The Liberty Alliance (a now-defunct group dedicated to internet standards) developed the Identity Federation Framework (ID-FF) to support authentication from different devices using the service provider/identity provider model. The Liberty Alliance donated the ID-FF standard to OASIS to serve as the foundation for SAML 2.0.

<p>Mydex CIC is delighted to say the company has now been awarded a Framework Contract by the UK’s Crown Commercial Services for its G-Cloud public services procurement platform.</p> What is&nbsp;G-Cloud? <p>G-Cloud is a framework by which public and third sector organisations can quickly and easily procure pre-vetted, pre-certified cloud-based solutions. It addresses a fundamental problem facing public and third sector organisations: the extremely high cost and complexity of finding and sourcing technology=based solutions that fit their&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Current procurement processes create huge amounts of friction, effort, risk and cost. (We call it FERC). An organisation wanting to procure a tech-based solution has to invest much time and effort writing a specification. They then have a lengthy process by which the spec is published, bidders send their bids in, and where the organisation has to invest more time and effort assessing the merits and pitfalls of each&nbsp;bid.</p><p>Once a potential supplier has been chosen, lengthy negotiations can follow, including about price and associated legal terms and conditions.</p><p>Sometimes the costs of going through the procurement process are as big as the size of the contract that’s been awarded. Overall, the process can result in an absurd amount of wasted time, money and&nbsp;effort.</p><p>G-Cloud strips much of this FERC away. Thousands of suppliers are listed on the platform and their services are searchable. Services are broken down into modules with fixed, public, pre-set prices, and the procuring organisation can mix and match the modules they need to address their particular problem or requirement. All suppliers are pre-vetted and pre-certified, with standardised legal contracts.</p><p>Out go the laborious tasks of spec writing, bid assessments and bespoke contract negotiation. What previously took many months (and huge amounts of time and effort) can now be successfully completed in&nbsp;weeks.</p> Mydex’s G-Cloud solutions <p>All of the Mydex solutions listed on the latest G-Cloud framework continue the theme of FERC busting — of taking friction, effort, risk and cost out of the collection, sharing and use of data to deliver better services and lower cost. Each solution can be procured separately, on a modular&nbsp;basis.</p><p>Organisations interested in seeing and sourcing these solutions need to register on the Public Procurement Gateway, but what follows is a brief description of what is now available to procure ‘off the&nbsp;shelf’.</p> Personal data or attribute store <p>At the heart lies the Mydex personal data or attribute store which provides the citizen with a secure vault to store their information. It is the individual’s secure digital filing cabinet, designed to support them in any aspect of their life, for their entire life. Its data schema are infinitely extensive and it supports self-asserted, self-collected and verified data, including certified copies of proofs issued by third party authorities, in any data format. It provides the citizen with unique encryption with a private key that remains under the sole control of the&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>Data can be delivered to this vault via APIs or entered directly, making it portable and exportable under control of the&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>Left alone, the personal data or attribute store is a purely private digital filing cabinet. Only the individual can look into it or use it, for example, to bring different data points together and to view them in different ways to provide insights and different perspectives on their&nbsp;lives.</p> Secure attribute exchange&nbsp;platform <p>But coupled with the secure attribute exchange platform it transforms the ways in which service providers and citizens do business with each other. With it, service providers can safely, easily and efficiently deposit data into the individual’s personal data store (via secure APIs), and individuals can share data held in their personal data store with service providers (automatically translating data from one format to another as necessary).</p><p>By enabling citizens to provide pre-verified proofs-of-claims e.g. age, benefits, right to work, identity it helps eliminate form filling and strips out multiple costs for service providers in collecting and checking data. It operates very much like a line rental on a phone network. Subscribers pay a connection fee to access the service, and there are no transaction fees on&nbsp;top.</p> Identity as a&nbsp;service <p>Mydex’s identity as a service gives individuals a unique identifier, which remains under their control, by which they can verify their identity and access services.</p><p>Two key benefits of the Mydex approach are that it avoids the fragmentation that occurs when multiple different service providers each try to provide individuals with their own separate identities (the Mydex ID works for all subscribers), while also avoiding the privacy bleed that takes place when individuals use single sign-on tools provided by commercial digital platforms. It meets all Government and security standards, and provides the citizen with an identity for&nbsp;life.</p><p>It can be integrated into any environment supporting open standards and protocols and can support a range of multi-factor authentication mechanisms, profile management, identity assurance and age verification to meet diverse needs. Service providers control the end to end journey of registration and authentication and can elect to extend the scope of a service to include profile sharing and passing of personal data into online transactions.</p><p>Mydex provides a range of additional modules that address many other service&nbsp;needs.</p> Inclued platform <p>Inclued is a citizen and community engagement platform which turns traditional engagement processes on their heads. Under the traditional approach, organisations offering a service seek to publicise this service to potential users in multiple ways, by publishing information about the service on their website, for example. Potential users then have to go searching for the services they need and, if (at last) a fit is found, they then have to go through the often-laborious process of making an application, providing eligibility, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>With Inclued citizens can publish an anonymised profile providing details about themselves. Service providers can search these profiles, and send messages, including offers and incentives to join or take part and notifications, via a web app. This greatly reduces service providers’ costs of ‘going to market’ while citizens can sit back and let the right services come to them. The same platform can be used to recruit communities to take part in projects.</p> Web app generator as a&nbsp;service <p>The Inclued interface is an intuitive, easy-to-use web app that can be accessed from anywhere, via which citizens receive invites to any services from subscribers. Web apps are like the apps made available by digital platforms like Apple or Google, except that they are not dependent on these platforms for access, and can be accessed by anyone able to use a web&nbsp;browser.</p><p>Unfortunately few public or third sector services currently use web apps because of the cost and complexity of building them. As a result, many services still rely on paper or online forms, which means the ‘last mile’ of service provision remains undigitised, and therefore costly and inefficient.</p><p>Mydex’s Web app generator as a service lets non-technical front line service providing teams to define the service they are trying to deliver, including the information they need to collect and provide and to use the resulting requirements and service ‘map’ to automatically generate a web app at a fraction of the cost of traditional approaches.</p><p>The web app generator has built-in compliance to all UK Government service design manual guidelines and Digital First Service Standards and allows different roles for different team members e.g. story mapper, journey builder, administrator, content editor and deployment manager. All data required and generated by the resulting web app automatically flows into (and comes out of) the individual’s personal data, thereby protecting their privacy and keeping them in&nbsp;control.</p> Cluster Collaboration Platform <p>The Cluster Collaboration Platform meanwhile enables front line service teams that need to work with others from different organisations to safely and easily share the data they need to share in order to provide the best possible service to the&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>People have spent many years and huge amounts of time, money and effort trying to solve the governance conundrums of the inter-organisation sharing of personal data. Every time, it has resulted in a complexity catastrophe. By putting citizens’ personal data stores at the heart of the data sharing process, the Cluster Collaboration Platform sidesteps these complexities, enabling organisations across varying sectors and regulatory environments to work together to deliver joined-up services to individual citizens, with GDPR compliance and ethical governance of data&nbsp;assured.</p><p>Services operate via secure API’s with the service providers back end systems sending and receiving personal data. Service providers may create specific web applications or native applications for citizens to use that to provide an integrated view of a&nbsp;service.</p><p>As a collaboration platform, it enables multiple low-cost community based, community driven, local services.</p> Consent Management and GDPR Compliance Service <p>Mydex’s Consent Management and GDPR Compliance Service gives service providers a set of tools and utilities that enables them to meet their legal data protection obligations and to use this process to both cut the costs of compliance and build better working relationships with service users. An important part of the service is efficient mechanisms for when individuals assert their legal rights, for the right to be forgotten or for subject access requests, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>Service providers may create defined use cases for data usage sharing to support one or more services, these are added to the platform. When a citizen signs up for a service they formally approve the data usage and sharing. Consent Management enables organisations to integrate seamless consent journeys into existing services, with consents being formally recorded for both the citizen and the service provider. Individuals are equipped with a consent management dashboard for the use of personal data across any&nbsp;sector.</p> Master Reference Data&nbsp;Service <p>But not all services need to access and use only personal data. Very often, the most value is created when an individual’s personal data is linked to other non-personal data such as a directory of services that may be relevant to that individual. Mydex’s Master Reference Data Service addresses a long standing problem that all public/third sector organisations are faced with: how to access accurate and timely reference data — look-up tables that they can rely on, whether it is postcodes or directories of service providers.</p><p>At the moment they do this by accessing downloadable files or visiting websites. But they then have to integrate this information manually into any apps or services that they build. Often, they pay multiple times to access the same reference data because it is being used for different services.</p><p>The Mydex Master Reference data service provides a set of canonical lists that are drawn from authoritative sources and maintained by Mydex which manages all the updates behind the scenes. This greatly reduces the friction, effort, risk and cost of accessing accurate authoritative reference tables.</p> Orientation, planning and implementation services <p>Organisations using these services may need some help in terms of orientation, planning and implementation, so there are also specific G-Cloud modules for both the Mydex and Inclued platforms.</p><p>Key elements of these services include discovery and scoping (e.g. use cases, data requirements, stakeholder analysis etc), provisioning, configuration, sandbox testing and live operational deployment.</p> Conclusion <p>New, better citizen-empowering ways of collecting and using personal data are making dramatic improvements in service productivity and quality possible, aiding citizen access and inclusion and resulting in greatly improved outcomes.</p><p>But it has often been hard for service providers to implement these solutions. Traditional public and third sector procurement and project management processes were so complex and time consuming that many were put off even trying. It’s as if, instead of being able to pop out to a local shop to buy a pint of milk, if we wanted a pint of milk we had to tend the cows and venture into fields to milk them ourselves.</p><p>Complexity and effort is a barrier to getting things done. Procuring services like those offered by Mydex should be as quick, easy and simple as buying a pint of milk. G-Cloud is a great step forward towards this goal. We look forward to see how it evolves over the coming&nbsp;years.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/making-better-easier-bc8690ca77d0">Making ‘better’ easier</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			 5 years of hard work pays off as the tokenization wave begins 
<p>In October, we celebrated our 5th birthday in Luxembourg. Since our inception, we have progressed from a startup to a global leading tokenization solution provider, recognized and trusted by institutions. It was important to us to acknowledge the great work the team has done, so we took three days to meet and celebrate in person with teammates and partners. Let me share with you how we started and where we are heading to.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 🥚 Born out of the ICO boom, with compliance and real world assets in mind 
<p>2017 was the first crypto boom. It demonstrated that public blockchain had the potential to change the financial world. We had the vision to bring real world assets and financial securities to this shared IT infrastructure to make finance more transparent, real-time, and accessible. Tokeny was founded the same year and started to propose solutions for projects raising funds on blockchain.</p>
<p>We successfully provided software tools to onboard thousands of investors within minutes and to automatically reconcile their payments on the blockchain in order to mint their utility tokens. This demonstrated the power of smart contracts and that a good UX for investors was possible. In 2019, we’ve secured fundraising from Euronext, the largest stock exchange group in Europe, allowing us to develop a complete set of tools for financial actors to easily adopt the technology.</p>
 ⛓ Creating the open-source security token standard ERC3643 
<p>Tokenization relies on smart contracts to represent assets on blockchain. Upon reviewing all existing smart contract standards, we realized that no existing token standard was ensuring compliance properly for tokenized securities. Compliance validations were relying only on wallet addresses or on the software database. In addition, key features for agents were missing (recovery of assets, batch operations, etc.).</p>
<p>To this end, we created the open-source security token standard, <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643/">ERC3643</a>, using an identity-based compliance approach to ensure on-chain compliance. Also, more than 120 functions of control were added. Now, ERC3643 is becoming the market standard for digital securities as it is adopted by large financial institutions and governments.</p>
 🎛 5 years of investment to build solutions covering the whole value chain 
<p>ERC3643 is open-source, anyone can freely use it. However, managing smart contracts can be very cumbersome. Issuers and their agents need a robust operating platform to manage their tokens and investors in a secure and efficient way.</p>
<p>The platform needs to scan the blockchain in real time, reconcile blockchain and investors’ data, and allow smooth blockchain-based operations via user-friendly interfaces. In addition, it needs to include more sophisticated functionality such as token recovery, permission delegation, cross-chain capability, and more. After years of development and optimizations, we now offer our customers with complete, compliant and <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9q9VB-Z_GLmcek1_W2j5i6HH9yCdsSSie6y30XwGCXcW5Rd3W-55eiiVwCAcOLTNSFQPE8">white-label solutions</a>, covering the entire tokenization value chain.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Our hard work is paying off as we are signing large institutions and riding the wave of tokenization. Institutions are realizing that building a platform takes time, is costly, risky, and could prevent them from accessing an interoperable ecosystem of applications and providers. The time to market is the main element to consider for institutions, and our suite of tools allows them to quickly adopt the proven standard to offer blockchain-based services for their investors.</p>
 🌐 Growing the ecosystem and preparing for institutional DeFi 
<p>Asset issuers and service providers (custodians, KYC providers, data oracles, liquidity providers, DeFi protocols, etc.) are now joining the ERC3643 ecosystem. Issuers immediately access hundreds of service providers, while service providers can offer services to any issuer in the ecosystem. We act as an ecosystem facilitator, ensuring that the technology stack remains interoperable and compatible with all major players of the market.</p>
<p>As the ecosystem grows, all the elements needed for institutional DeFi are coming together: higher quality of tokenized assets, valuation oracles, compliant DeFi protocols, DINO distribution networks for liquidity providers, etc. Our team is ready to assist any players in accessing institutional DeFi, and we expect it to be the next big thing in the tokenization industry.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of our journey, stay tuned for more exciting updates.</p>

 Updating Onfido’s ID capture experience to help people submit high-quality photos of their identity documents  Overview  Context <p>At <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a>, we help protect businesses against fraud by verifying their customers’ identities. This process requires users to take a photo of their identity document and a selfie. Once submitted, machine learning algorithms check both are genuine and match the selfie to the photo ID to verify them. To do this, most users provide their photos using our <a href="https://onfido.com/solutions/smart-capture-sdk/">Smart Capture SDK</a>, a drop-in set of screens customers integrate into their&nbsp;app.</p> Problem <p>Users frequently submit low-quality photos of their IDs. Low-quality photos make it harder for us to verify their identity, which often means they can’t access our customer’s services. These failed verification attempts cost our customers time and money as their would-be users must try again or give up and drop off entirely.</p> Goals <p>Our goals for this project were&nbsp;to:</p>  Help people provide high-quality photos of their IDs using our iOS and Android&nbsp;SDKs.  Increase the number of people who get verified on their first&nbsp;attempt.  Decrease the number of verifications that fail due to ID-related image quality&nbsp;issues.   Team <p>I led the design process and was responsible for running usability testing. My team included:</p>  1 x Product Designer&nbsp;(myself)  1 x Product&nbsp;Manager  1 x Engineering Lead  3 x Engineers (1 iOS, 1 Android, 1&nbsp;Backend)  1 x User Researcher  1 x Applied Scientist  1 x Data&nbsp;Analyst   Process  Discovery <p>Through our data and user research, we discovered that:</p>  Despite the SDKs already having blur detection, blurry photos were still getting submitted.  The most common image quality issues responsible for failed verifications were blur, glare or essential parts of the ID getting cut off (such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable_passport">MRZ</a> on a passport photo&nbsp;page).  When reviewing a photo, ‘submit photo’ was always the primary button. Because of this, people often submitted photos inattentively, even when their details weren’t clear. They expected the SDK to tell them to retake their photo if it wasn’t good&nbsp;enough.  Due to the personal nature of identity documents, most users wanted to review their photos before they submitted them.   Exploration <p>I explored a number of different ways to prevent users from submitting low-quality photos, from automating the review step to capturing a video and using machine learning to select and enhance the best&nbsp;frames.</p><p>After discussing the pros and cons of each with the team, we decided on a dual approach. We’d use machine learning algorithms to detect the most common image quality issues and provide instant feedback to users during a smarter review step. With this approach, we’d be able to let users know if there’s an issue with their photo and how to fix it in real-time before submission.</p> Technical approach <p>Introducing these new algorithms meant choosing whether to have them as part of the SDK or Onfido’s backend. We decided the backend would be best as we’d be able&nbsp;to:</p>  Use the same solution across platforms instead of needing to create different algorithms for iOS and&nbsp;Android.  Improve existing algorithms and introduce new ones to detect other issues (e.g. expired documents) without having to release a new version of the SDK each&nbsp;time.  Use more powerful algorithms and not be constrained by the SDK’s file&nbsp;size.  Build on top of the Web SDK’s existing Image Quality Service&nbsp;(IQS).  <p>To accommodate this approach, I updated the user flow. Photos are now uploaded to the backend before users review them so that the algorithms can flag any issues&nbsp;first.</p> Validating our&nbsp;approach <p>I created some prototypes and ran two rounds of usability testing on the review step, each with ten participants. By changing the primary button to ‘retake photo’ when an issue is detected, users found the review step “makes more sense as it advises you what do&nbsp;to”.</p><p>We also ran an A/B test to measure the effectiveness of the new algorithms. The results showed a 16% decrease in identity checks that failed due to image quality issues. We also saw a 2% increase in the number of people successfully verified.</p> Solution <p>With the new algorithms, the SDKs give users feedback during the review step if there’s a problem with their photo. If an issue such as a blur is detected, ‘retake photo’ is the primary button. If the photo is ok, then ‘submit photo’ is. This change steers users to retake their photo when needed whilst still allowing them to review it themselves, providing more clarity without compromising control. To prevent users from submitting photos we know aren’t good enough, we also now hide the submit option if an issue gets detected on their first&nbsp;attempt.</p> Impact <p>This project was a success on multiple&nbsp;fronts:</p>  We released a new version of the SDK with the changes on iOS and Android. They’re now used by millions of people each month to submit photos of their&nbsp;IDs.  We’ve seen a decrease in the number of verifications that fail due to ID-related image quality issues and an increase in the number of people verified on their first attempt since this change. Both have helped contribute to improved customer conversion rates.  We put the foundation in place for the team to improve existing algorithms and introduce new ones without having to release a new version of the SDK each&nbsp;time.  <p>Since finishing this project in late 2021, the team have made several improvements, including releasing an improved glare detection algorithm. The foundation we put in place meant we could deliver these improvements to users and start seeing results without relying on customers to adopt the latest SDK&nbsp;version.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/helping-people-verify-their-identity-first-time-bc27587907b">Helping people verify their identity first time</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Product and Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Passwords have been around since the dawn of the digital age and today are a part of our daily routines. Surveys have shown that the <a href="https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person">average person has 100+ passwords</a>, and it’s only logical that the number will increase as more applications and services emerge. But who really wants more passwords?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passwords are a great source of frustration for users. The rules behind them continue to get more complex and cumbersome. That in turn leads to more password resets, which require extra steps. In fact, a study of US consumers showed that on average, a <a href="https://www.iproov.com/blog/16-online-purchases-abandoned-every-year-by-the-average-consumer-due-to-password-frustration">consumer abandons 16 online purchases a year</a> due to password frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passwords are probably adding friction to your sales process and affecting your business from capturing revenue. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason passwords exist is, of course, security. However, the truth behind the effectiveness of passwords is much different. As we have seen time and time again in various high-profile breaches, passwords offer little resistance to malicious actors. Passwords are the most popular and frequent target for hackers looking to steal data or gain remote access.</p>

  Media reports were abuzz this week with news around FATF’s decision to penalize countries that haven’t yet implemented the agency’s proposed guidelines on crypto anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF).  However, it turned out to be a speculation, and nothing more, as a FATF spokesperson denied any changes to how the agency graylists countries or tracks cryptocurrencies.  Although global regulatory response towards cryptocurrencies is still evolving, authorities worldwide have started preparing to bring the nascent assets within the regulatory net.  <p>According to an <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/11/7/countries-to-face-grey-list-for-shunning-crypto-guidelines">Al Jazeera report</a> dated November 7th, the global financial watchdog, FATF, is preparing to conduct annual checks. It aims to ensure countries are enforcing the anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) rules on virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in their jurisdictions.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/mrlegendcrypto/status/1589989723644493825?s=20&amp;t=GsYvJ4BOePwDW4q00AUUWw">Image Source</a>)<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has no enforcement powers and mostly relies on governments to enforce its recommendations. However, countries that fail to comply risk serious reputational harm, which could halt investment flows and access to the global financial system.</p> Annual Reviews vs. Evaluations <p>Using annual reviews over reciprocal evaluations would allow non-compliant countries less time to implement FATF-set standards. This, in turn, will raise the risk of being added to the graylist.</p><p>The “gray” list refers to the list of countries the FATF deems as “Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring.”</p><p>This list is different from the FATF’s blacklist, which relates to countries with significant strategic weaknesses concerning money laundering, including Iran and North&nbsp;Korea.</p><p>There are currently 23 countries on that list, including Syria, South Sudan, Haiti, and&nbsp;Uganda.</p><p>Crypto hotspots such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Philippines are also on the FATF’s blacklist. Still, according to the global financial watchdog, both countries made high-level policy commitments to working with the global financial watchdog to bolster their AML and CTF&nbsp;regimes.</p> FATF’s Denial (<a href="https://jessierlewis.com/customers-subconscious-desires/thats-not-true-gif/">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>However, the report was later refuted by the agency. A FATF spokesman told Al Jazeera that the regulatory body’s discussions are confidential and do not comment on media speculation.</blockquote><p>He reiterated that the organization has not changed how it tracks virtual assets or adds countries to its graylist.</p> Slow Implementation <p>In April 2022, the global financial watchdog reported that many countries, including those that had implemented VASP licensing regime, were in noncompliance with its standards for AML and&nbsp;CFT.</p> Current Outlook on Crypto Regulations (<a href="https://www.livemint.com/brand-stories/cryptocurrency-regulation-around-the-world-how-india-compares-11636355438835.html">Image Source</a>)<p>The global regulatory response towards crypto assets varies widely, with some countries adopting the new technology while others strictly or completely limiting its legal uses. But agencies have begun to look closely at cryptocurrencies and how they can fit them into existing financial regulations.</p><p>Overall, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and it will likely take some time before there is a clear global consensus on how to deal with&nbsp;them.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

   As we enter 2023, Gartner calls for convergence, resilience, and cost-effectiveness 

<p>In its new report, the 2022 Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management, Gartner® brings attention to the increasingly critical role of access management in the enterprise — along with the fact that it has become a prime target for attackers. The crux of the report reveals that modern threats and economic constraints demand more resilient and cost-effective access management.</p>

<p>It has become clear that enterprises need to evolve their CIAM and workforce strategies to reduce risk, create efficiencies, and support all their use cases.</p>

<p>In its Magic Quadrant report, Gartner provides a distillation of all its research on access management products, vendors, and industry trends. This year's report highlighted several trends, including the need for identity threat detection and response (ITDR) to protect against breaches caused by credential misuse, which now represent 40% of all breaches. Gartner also identified journey orchestration as a way to reduce risk, cost, and complexity. Weak and compromised passwords remain a huge threat, and Gartner called attention to the need for passwordless and phishing-resistant authentication. Finally, the report emphasized the need for converged platforms, which improve security and create cost efficiencies.</p>

    
<p>We're honored to have been named a Leader in this market for the third consecutive year by Gartner Inc. in their <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-named-leader-access-management-2022">2022 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management</a>.</p>

<p>The enhancements we made to our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/CIAM">CIAM</a> solution are aimed at meeting the evolving needs of the enterprise — especially related to managing customers' identities and making personalized journeys easier with new <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">orchestration</a> capabilities.</p>

<p>We are proud of the innovation and new capabilities we've introduced to the ForgeRock Identity Platform to help our customers manage, secure, and govern all their identities, and we're excited about this year's advancements in key areas:</p>

  Expansion of our platform's <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration/capabilities">orchestration engine</a> with the broadest library of pre-built, no-code journey nodes 
	 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">AI-driven access</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">governance</a> for identity threat detection and response (ITDR) 
	 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless</a> authentication that makes access more convenient for users and eliminates the threat of compromised credentials, the most common cause of breaches 
 <p>To learn more about the access management market, I'd encourage you to read this latest version of the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™.

   by Martin Kuppinger  Zero Trust has been established as the guiding principle for cybersecurity. The “don’t trust, always verify” approach stands for methods that don’t rely only on singular security tools, such as the traditional network perimeter firewall, to keep attackers out. Instead, Zero Trust builds on layered security and repeated or &nbsp;continuous verification.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Zero Trust has been established as the guiding principle for cybersecurity. The “don’t trust, always verify” approach stands for methods that don’t rely only on singular security tools, such as the traditional network perimeter firewall, to keep attackers out. Instead, Zero Trust builds on layered security and repeated or &nbsp;continuous verification.</p>
<p>The concept of Zero Trust has evolved beyond a network perspective, restricting lateral movements of users once they have passed the firewall. It involves a broader model that looks at many different layers of access and permissions. Zero Trust spans identities, devices, networks, systems, applications, data, and software.</p>
 The Role of Identity in Zero Trust 
<p>Identities are where Zero Trust starts, with user authentication and with IGA (Identity Governance and Administration) solutions managing the user accounts and their entitlements, but also providing &nbsp;access governance capabilities, including regular review and recertification, making it a key component of a Zero Trust model. In the future, we expect – also following the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final">NIST Zero Trust concept</a> of policy-based controls – an uptake of policy-based, real-time enforcement and verification of access authorizations.</p>
<p>Zero Trust &nbsp;on ServiceNow Every IT environment must be protected against cyberattacks, and to achieve this, Zero Trust must become ubiquitous. ServiceNow, delivers a range of business applications on the platform to protect enterprises. With its capabilities &nbsp;for managing IT services and assets, as well as GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) and support for SecOps (Security Operations), it’s a smart way to start implementing Zero Trust with your existing IT Service Management (ITSM) investment.</p>
<p>The criticality of ServiceNow becomes obvious when looking at some of the use cases. CMDBs are an important repository when it comes to advanced device management in the context of Zero Trust. Device verification must build on valid information. With its ITSM capabilities supporting the management of employees, contractors, and partners and their entitlements, e.g., in manual fulfilment, ServiceNow also must be protected against fraudulent use.</p>
<p>There are various further use cases: &nbsp;</p>
 
 the role of CMDBs for delivering attributes that are used for defining entitlements, and for real-time authorization; 
 the integrated Risk Management capabilities; 
 the protection of workflows in Portfolio Management; and 
 IT and Security Operations, that is both a solution for better managing and protecting the IT infrastructure, and a potential attack target for taking control about large parts of the IT infrastructure. 
 
<p>ServiceNow &nbsp;requires &nbsp;strong identity management to govern users and their entitlements. This goes beyond the capabilities of ITSM solutions, such as ServiceNow, that are primarily focused on supporting manual fulfilment activities within IGA.</p>
 Zero Trust with ServiceNow and Clear Skye IGA 
<p>Clear Skye is an IGA solution built natively on ServiceNow. It utilizes a wide range of platform capabilities, such as the data model and database, workflows, and the ServiceNow user interface. While supporting a wide range of applications, a particular strength of Clear Skye derives from being native to the ServiceNow platform and the ability to manage identities and their access in this environment.</p>
<p>With that, Clear Skye provides an essential building block for enhancing Zero Trust to ServiceNow environments and beyond. It can protect both the various applications within the ServiceNow environment and other, external systems and applications via connectors.</p>

He also gives insights into his session, “<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/webinars/authenticate-2022-session-how-web-3-0-will-reshape-authentication/">How Web 3.0 Will Reshape Authentication</a>“.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>All right. Hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, Chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here today with Robert MacDonald, our VP of Product Marketing. Robert, you recently went to the FIDO Authenticate conference. I want to chat with you about that. How was the event?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>It was great. It was very well attended. It was in Seattle, so got a chance to go out west and attend the event. About 500 people or so. Very well organized, lots of really good presentations and met a lot of really good people while I was there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. Well, let’s take a half step backwards. I’m familiar with FIDO and you probably are, but for folks who are not familiar with the FIDO Alliance, can you talk about what it is?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Sure. FIDO Alliance, it stands for Fast Identity Online. They’re a consortium that works at delivering a passwordless experience primarily for consumers. There is a workforce integration with them as well, but they’re trying to get customers secure access to things online is really their focus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, and step away from passwords. That makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Your presentation was interesting. The title was what? Web 3.0? What was the title of your session?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, it was How Web 3.0 Will Reshape Authentication was the presentation. Funny enough, like I said earlier, there was lots of presentations. Every presentation that I sat in on talked about passwords and talked about the timeline of passwords that the industry has gone through and how FIDO is going to help reshape that, which aligned very well into what my presentation got into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right, so let’s take this one step a time. Web 3.0. Just set the baseline. What is Web 3.0 or Web three?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, it’s known as either of those things and it’s the next iteration of what the web is going to look like. Web one, back when you and I were less gray Michael, was static read only webpages. That was kind of 1900’s into the 2000’s. Then Web two came along, which is kind of what we’re really used to these days. That had a centralized information centric content way about it. That’s your Facebook’s, your LinkedIn’s, YouTube, TikTok, all those kinds of things. Now, Web three is the next iteration of how the web is going to work and that promises more user-centric, decentralized, secure, and funny enough, private engagement online. Now we know that privacy in general online is a bit of an issue as it stands currently, but all of that’s going to change with Web three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right, so how does Web three affect the future of authentication?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yes, that’s a good question. There’s a couple of things. From an authentication standpoint, what’s going to happen is that people are going to be more identifiable online. What I mean by that is that we’re going to have known identities as we’re engaging with people online. There’s going to be steps or processes involved where people will have a digital wallet and that digital wallet will hold their identity. That identity in that digital wallet will be used to authenticate people as we go forward in this new world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Let’s just be clear about something here. The web is still a place where people can behave anonymously. I mean, kind of like walking through a crowded stadium. You’re not declaring yourself to everybody you pass by, but in certain instances, people want to declare their identity when they access their bank account, for example. They don’t want other folks declaring an identity that will give them access to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>You’re talking about the digital identity for authentication or for logging in, correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>That’s right. The digital identification for logging in and also just knowing who somebody is. If you look at the way in which identity is managed online now, all of these organizations own your identity. Facebook has an identity of you, Google has one, your bank has one, the government has one. Anywhere you’ve put in a username and password to some degree has a version of your identity, whatever that might be. That’s why you can log into things with your Facebook account or your Google account or your LinkedIn account as example, but they own your identity there and they monetize it in a lot of cases. That’s where the privacy concerns kind of come into play.</p>
<p>What’s going to happen now is that you are going to then own that identity and you’re going to choose to allow maybe Facebook or Google or somebody else to have access to it when you are authenticating. Instead of using the identity they’ve given you to log in, you’ll use your identity to log in where they’ve added, how would I say that? A debit card into your wallet. When you use your debit card to log into an ATM, that’s your identity to get that money out so they would put something into your wallet for you to be able to authenticate with your identity. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, kind of, but we use the word identity a lot and I’m wondering why do I need an identity? I had passwords before. I’ll just use a biometric. Why do I need an identity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, so I mean, identity, the way it stands now, it’s proof of possession. You have a username or yeah, proof of possession. You have something you know, you know the username and the password. Maybe you might get a one time password that goes along with that, but at the end of the day, it doesn’t really prove who you are when you authenticate into something.</p>
<p>What Web three is promising is that every time you now authenticate, I know that it’s Michael. It’s not somebody else using Michael’s username and password, it can only be Michael and I don’t want to say the seismic shift, but that’s the significant shift in all of this. It can only be the owner of that wallet which is cryptographically locked down. It has private and public. We won’t get into the background behind all of it, but at the end of the day, it can only be that person that owns the wallet that can authenticate and that’s really the big shift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, so if it’s a biometric, then it’s tied to the person or to the identity, so to speak I guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>That’s correct. Absolutely, yep, that’s exactly right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, did you have a chance to sit in on other presentations at the event?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>I did. I got a chance to see a couple. I got a chance to see a bunch of them actually. It’s funny, almost every presentation had some sort of, I mentioned earlier a timeline of passwords and how passwords have been used over time and what we’ve done to try to mask or secure that password because as I mentioned earlier, all a password does is just it’s a proof that you know the password, it’s not a proof of who you actually are. The way in which that discussion was formulated was kind of fun to watch, especially based on what we do here at 1Kosmos. Everybody kind of started with that and where the future of FIDO and this identification online is going is exactly in our wheelhouse here at 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. Well, I mean the password has worked for 60 some years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>60 years. Yeah, absolutely, 60 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>When you start to have 100, 150, 200 of these things, a little bit unwildly to private and-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>That was, not to interrupt you, but that was an interesting stat. There was, a CISO got on stage and said on average people have 140 credentials for digital assets that they need access to. Whether that be things that you do at work, things that you do in your personal life, all of the different apps you have on your phone that require a username and password, all the websites that you want to have access to, all the things you have access to at work. There’s a lot of credentials out there that really don’t prove identity of anybody at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, well, what were maybe one or two of the top questions that you were being asked when you were running through your Web 3.0 Presentation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, the one question I got asked was how does that wallet transfer itself as we go through different use cases? That was a great question. Specifically workforce and customer. How does that, is there two or do you just use the one? The reply to that is just like your wallet that you carry around in your pocket, it’s used the same way.</p>
<p>When you go and start at a new job, they’re going to ask for your identification so you can share that identification with a new employer to fill out your I9, I think you guys have in the US. We have similar things here in Canada as well, but you’re going to use that digital wallet for that. You’re also going to use it for when you go to apply for a new mortgage or a new loan for a car or just trying to get access to government services. That wallet’s going to be the digital format of what you use today in a real life format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Isn’t Apple doing things with a wallet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, so there’s lots of talk around the new passkey which is coming. Which is Google’s and Microsoft’s and Apple’s version of this kind of digital identity wallet. There’s lots of discussion around that. It’s still really early on. You’re going to have a public and private key that you can identify yourself in the Apple environment or the Google environment or the Microsoft environment. The issue as it stands right now because it’s so early on, is that that’s not interoperable. There’s a bit of a hurdle there where it works within their own ecosystem, but as soon as you step outside of that, well now I need new wallets again. That kind of defeats the purpose. That’s still early on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. Was there any talk about the [inaudible 00:11:06] standards at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, there was. Being able to prove identity with a high assurance, there was some discussion around that and how organizations are going to go about trying to implement that in a digital first environment. Again, still early on from a FIDO perspective in terms of how they’re going to integrate with that. We know here at 1Kosmos, we have certified ways of doing that right out of the gate.</p>
<p>By the looks of it, Michael, everybody’s starting to turn in that direction, but they’re still trying to figure out how it’s going to work, even though we already have a solution that will more than get people there. That’s why I had such a high, I did have a very high turnout for my talk, just as an aside, which was great. A lot of people came to listen to a marketing guy talk which was pretty surprising. At the end of the day, there were a lot of questions afterwards around how do I verify identity and what’s that process look like and how are you going to store the identities and things along those lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. Well, we’re going to put that presentation on our website here with a full transcript shortly. I know FIDO has been at this for quite a while, at least 10 years or so, evolving along this journey. I’m sure we’ll be participating next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>We will be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Looking forward to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, thanks for having me today. It was a great presentation. Lots of great feedback on it and go check it out on our website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>At ForgeRock, we have great respect for the Forrester Wave report due to its deep analysis, and we are thrilled to have been named a leader in their report, The<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-named-leader-access-management-2022"> Forrester Wave™: Customer Identity and Access Management, Q4 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Forrester researched, analyzed, and scored customer identity and access management (CIAM) vendors based on a range of 22 criteria that represent important capabilities for enterprises evaluating CIAM for themselves. The research is intensive, including a detailed questionnaire, hours of live demos, multiple briefings, and customer interviews.</p>

<p>Because of the depth of the Forrester analysis, we are particularly proud to have earned the highest scores in both the current offering and strategy categories. The current offering category includes criteria such as data orchestration, users and roles, customer identity verification and registration, authentication methods, customer self-service, and reporting and dashboarding. The strategy category includes the criteria of product vision, execution roadmap, market approach, planned enhancements, supporting products and services, partner ecosystem, delivery model and commercial model.</p>

<p>About ForgeRock CIAM, the report noted, "The solution is a match for organizations that need to map complex-to-very-complex customer registration, authentication, and self-service workflows to a CIAM solution and have internal CIAM administrator expertise and staffing."</p>

<p>For us this description encapsulates exactly what we've aimed to do over the years with our CIAM solution — and it just continues to get better, with more robust orchestration, broad integrations, a range of authentication methods, and more.</p>

<p>This year, we introduced significant enhancements to our orchestration engine that make it easier to create user personalization and self-service. We also simplified authentication by extending the FIDO2 WebAuthn standard to enable passwordless and usernameless login, and we introduced behavioral analytics for authentication and authorization that enable customers to make smart, fast access decisions powered by AI.</p>

<p>As consumers spend more time carrying out digital interactions with brands, government entities, financial institutions, healthcare providers, and others, they have become far more sophisticated and they expect a personalized and secure online experience. Our focus has been to make it as easy as possible for our customers to deliver those experiences.</p>

<p>One customer, Partners Health Management, is using ForgeRock CIAM to create a 360-degree view of member information in order to offer more personalized care. They're using our single sign-on to bolster security and improve the experience for members and providers. Tracy Styles, Partners' IT Support Services Manager, wrote: "A primary advantage of ForgeRock is its ease of use. We considered several solutions on the market, but we found that ForgeRock was definitely the easiest to work with."</p>

<p>We know that large brands face stiff competition as they become increasingly digital, and user experience is a huge factor in their ability to acquire, engage, and retain customers. We've focused on delivering CIAM capabilities that provide highly personalized and secure digital experiences that increase customer satisfaction and build loyalty.</p>

<p>I encourage you to<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-named-leader-access-management-2022"> download the report</a> to understand the criteria for which Forrester evaluated the 15 CIAM vendors. The report distills many months of research into an easily consumable format with specific recommendations for availability, scale, and risk-based authorization, as well as the capabilities you may want to evaluate as you select a CIAM partner.</p>

<p>This interview is originally posted <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/interview-with-locke-brown-nuid/">on the PIA website.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/">PIA </a>sat down with Locke Brown, Co-founder and CEO of NuID. We spoke about the importance of Trustless Authentication, the issues surrounding the traditional online password, the future of NuID, and he gave some tips for staying secure online.</p> Private Internet Access: Hi Locke, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and how you got into cryptocurrency? <p>Locke Brown: I’m originally from Birmingham, Alabama. Then I went to school just outside of Los Angeles at Claremont McKenna College. I studied math and econ. I was the lunatic running around campus in 2013 talking about Bitcoin.</p><p>I’ve always been into computers, gaming, tech, not coding so much, although I have built a lot of websites when I was younger. Math, science, and econ are kind of my jam. I’ve always been into investing. In fact I also got my master’s in finance while I was at Claremont McKenna.</p><p>During college I did an internship at Google, and decided I wanted to go into finance following school. So I went and worked up in Seattle after I graduated in 2014, for Bill Gates’ private Investment office. It was pretty wild; I was a trader there for a couple years and then moved over to the private investment side.</p><p>The last year and a half or so that I was there, around 2016, myself and the COO started an internal blockchain working group because blockchain was kind of getting hot again. At that point, I had lost way too many Bitcoin, like online gambling and random stuff. Of course, it wasn’t worth as much as it is today. It’s worth noting that I mined Bitcoin back in my college dorm. I had one of the first ASIC miners, so I’ve always been into this space, and it was good to get back into the space and follow it more closely. It was also around that time that I started using PrivateInternetAccess, I had a dedicated IP back in 2016, so I thought it was cool when you guys reached out.</p> PIA: What motivated you to start NuID? <p>LB: I was thinking about digitizing things like real estate assets and car titles. Then I happened to meet this guy Nolan Smith through a mutual friend. He was a data scientist at Microsoft at the time. We met on a hike outside of Seattle, and we hit it off immediately. We ended up getting dinner and going down the rabbit hole. We spent a lot of 2016 in my basement, called it the cave. Just exploring a lot of stuff in the cryptography and blockchain world and stumbled into zero knowledge proof cryptography, which ended up becoming a large part of what we do in our core technology.</p><p>We had a lot of ideas, but for them to work we needed a certain type of distributed system. We also needed identity to be trusted, right? A better version of identity than what we have today, which is just create a username and password with every service you use and let it get hacked.</p><p>So we’re like, okay, authentication is the layer there that needs to be fixed really, because if you can authenticate yourself as me, then how can you ever trust the digital identity representation of me if someone else is going to authenticate that.</p><p>We had fortunate timing, pairing these two technologies that were relatively unheard of, or new at the time: distributed ledgers and zero knowledge proofs, and devised a protocol to what we said at the time was abstracting identity from the device to the individual. In January of 2017, we got connected with Professor Matthew Franklin at UC Davis. He’s a professor in cryptography, known for the Boneh-Franklin scheme of identity based encryption, and a ton of other stuff in public key infrastructure that we use today. In fact, PIA uses some of the technologies that he helped invent back in the day. So he ended up vetting and validating the kind of protocol we had devised. Later in January that same year, I think it was a Sunday night, I decided I had to go all in. I quit my job and filed the initial patent applications, and then founded the company NuID. A month later, I raised a small seed round, and the rest of his history. So that’s the abridged version.</p> PIA: What is NuID’s flagship product? <p>LB: One thing you might hear in Silicon Valley is fail fast, you know, break it and iterate. That does not work for authentication and identity. So, we were super meticulous and thorough, and it was all about doing it right, not quick. Despite what some people were pushing. Because, if authentication fails it’s over. You can’t fail once, right?</p><p>So, we released our product, Trustless Authentication, NuID’s authentication solution, which is a B2B SaaS product. It was and is a monthly subscription API plugin for companies to completely replace their authentication workflow.</p><p>In the current user login experience, you can imagine you build an app or a website or what have you, that has users that need to log in. In today’s paradigm, the status quo is that you have the user put in a username, or an email address, and a password. Then that goes from their device to the server. Then if they’re decent, they would hash the password and/or encrypt it at the source and store it on a database. This way, the next time the user signs in and enters their credentials, it goes over their server, where it’s compared and if the passwords are the same, it checks out and logs you in, creating a session.</p><p>So that is, as we are all realizing, a huge problem for a number of reasons. Each of the servers have to store this big database of credentials. Now you have a huge target for hackers and people that compromise systems. And it can create this cascading snowball effect, because when that server is breached, 9 times out of 10, it’s a compromised credential that’s used to actually execute the breach, or hack it. For instance, with a big hack like LinkedIn, Twitter, or any of these big sites, other subsequent hacks are done because someone’s credential was found, and some admin was using the same password for his email or this or that site, and people reuse passwords.</p><p>NuID’s authentication system is designed to eliminate that workflow, and we have 57 claims patented on this in the US. It’s free to use, up to a point, and can be installed in under 30 minutes. It sits behind the log-in box, so as far the user is concerned, there’s no added friction, and their login experience doesn’t change. What happens on the backend is that when the user creates an account, they enter a username, password on their device. On that user’s device, that password is used to generate what’s called a zero knowledge proof. So, you can think about that as magic – I’m kidding, or half kidding. It’s basically a lot of math is done to it, right?</p><p>The password entered on the user’s device is deleted. It’s never transmitted over the internet to any server, and it’s not stored locally. The public reference parameter output from that then gets stored on a distributed ledger. We default to Ethereum, but it’s ledger agnostic and in the future we’re going to be coming out with the KiiChain ledger. We are actually launching the token Kii that underpins that. I won’t go into that right now. But the idea there is that this public reference parameter is decentralized and immutably stored. So that, you know, there’s no single party holding it.</p> PIA: Is NuID just for businesses or do you have a consumer product? <p>LB: We launched the beginning of the Nu Identity Ecosystem recently, and we’re gearing up for that. We’ll be launching our consumer products next year. It’ll be a credential wallet that allows users to manage their own credentials.</p><p>I like to say what we’re doing is making cryptography accessible to everyone. Right now, managing keys is difficult, right? I mean, if we use public key infrastructure, public private keys, for login, which we should, it’s a nightmare for people to manage and use that. For example, with a Bitcoin wallet it gives you that seed phrase that basically says if you lose your private key, you’re done, you’re X-ed out. Right?</p><p>That’s public key infrastructure for you. It’s not very forgiving. There needs to be a good way and a good interface for people, and that is what NuID is doing. We needed the enterprise solution first because, if I went out on the street three, four years ago, and said, “Hey, I’ve got this great new authentication solution, do you want to try it,” and you’re like, great, where can I use it, and the answer was nowhere, it’s not going to help you very much.</p><p>So, getting our protocol ingrained and used by services was step one. So we launched that a few years ago. And now like I was saying, we have a self-service developer portal for anyone who’s building an app or website, and they can go implement it for free, and play around with it.</p> PIA: Do you have any tips for the average person to protect their password? To increase their online privacy? <p>LB: The longer the better. A lot of times the websites will say, use a number, use uppercase, lowercase, and symbols, whatever. But the truth is, length is the biggest thing on your side.</p><p>Use different passwords for more important things. I’m not going to tell somebody to use different passwords for every account, because people have 50, 60, 70 different accounts, maybe even more now. I will also say this with a little asterisk, but use Password Managers like LastPass or 1pass. These are a godsend, we require everyone at NuID to use them. However, they perpetuate the problem, for sure, and they don’t solve anything real. So it can be pretty scary to have to trust them. That being said, they are a step in the right direction. The convenience you get is worthwhile, if you use it correctly, which means you use their auto secure password generator. You can use it to generate a random string of numbers, characters, and symbols that’s 32 digits long and they’re all different. So, if you’re going to use something like that, take advantage of the capabilities of the secure password generator.</p><p>Lastly, make sure you always have two factor authentication on that if that’s an option. So those are the biggest things. Otherwise, stay tuned to NuID and get a verified credential when we launch it in a few months.</p> PIA: Are you still involved in cryptocurrency? <p>LB: Yeah, in fact, we are about to be launching, five years in the making, our token Kii.</p><p>I still follow cryptocurrency. I’ve traded it a bit. I go in waves on how into it I am, depending on how busy I am. But ya know, I definitely follow it, I definitely stay abreast because it’s so relevant to cryptography. It’s worth noting as well that NuID credentials, because crypto is built on public key infrastructure, can serve as your private key to crypto assets.</p><p>So the NuWallet that we are going to be launching this next year will serve as not only a credential wallet, but your crypto wallet as well. Because your authentication credentials can secure any crypto asset. This is huge in cryptocurrency because you are your identity. You should have your assets follow you around, and only you should be able to authenticate those things.</p>

<p>At Spruce, we recently ran a survey to learn more about the type of applications web3 developers are building and what technology stacks they’re using. Our objective was to collect insights directly from the community to help inform some of our own building decisions we make at Spruce. </p><p>We received responses from over 40 individual developers building applications across various use cases. While we recognize this sample size is unlikely to be a representative sample of the overall web3 ecosystem, we found the results insightful from a high level and wanted to share some takeaways from the survey with the broader community. </p><p>To start, we looked to gather information about what developers are building and the core building blocks they are using to do so. We asked what type of apps developers are building and found the majority of applications being built are web apps, at 81%. </p>Note: some answers were directly user-provided<p>Next, we asked about the predominant languages used while building applications. Javascript and TypeScript took the lead, which makes sense as both are widely popular for web application development. These are followed by Python, Go, and Rust.</p><p>For quick bootstrapping of applications, we found that developers largely prefer React and Express as their frameworks of choice.</p><p>We also asked what chain developers are focusing their development efforts, finding the majority are building on Ethereum/EVM. Only 14% are building an application with multi-chain use cases. It’s important to note here, however, that we have close ties to the Ethereum community, so the participants who opted into this survey might not be representative of the entire broader ecosystem. <br></p><p>So far, we know that the majority of applications are web-based, using JavaScript/TypeScript, and built on Ethereum/EVM. </p><p>Next, we were curious - what are developers building? Web3 technology has the potential to disrupt many different industries, ranging from gaming to finance. We found that, according to our survey participants, most builders are creating applications for DeFi and NFT use cases.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how this distribution evolves as Web3 use cases for various industries mature.</p><p>Next, we asked how many of these applications required users to create accounts or sign-in in some way. We found that the overwhelming majority of applications do - over 90% require a sign-in. This is a powerful metric to inform our work in improving the experience of installing Sign-In with Ethereum into applications.</p><p>One of the powers of web3 yet to be unlocked in a meaningful way is the opportunity to bridge on-chain and off-chain data for customization and personalization of experiences. </p><p>While roughly ¼ of applications solely focus on on-chain data, the remaining ¾ have either solely off-chain or a mixture of off-chain and on-chain data that they need to manage. </p><p><br></p><p>We appreciate all the developers who participated in this survey and shared insights with us. We hope these high-level takeaways are insightful for other builders thinking about tooling and web3 developer experiences. </p><p>Furthering this work, we’re conducting additional research to gather feedback from developers who have either successfully installed Sign-In with Ethereum or have considered installing Sign-In with Ethereum into their application. If this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you!</p><p>You can find the survey for feedback on SIWE <a href="https://bit.ly/siwe-survey">here.</a></p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

				 <p>Six years ago, Darrell posted the tweet below, and it’s still just as relevant today. If anything, it’s even more relevant now as organizations undergo digital transformations.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote><p>Control only what you must. Influence the rest.</p> — Darrell O'Donnell (ʎpoɹɐd) (@darrello) <a href="https://twitter.com/darrello/status/792496888444575744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Most companies now realize they need to digitize to remain competitive, but the question is how to do that. There’s no magic formula, and every organization is different, so it’s essential to focus on what you can control and influence the rest; rather than trying to control everything. This may mean working with other companies or institutions to advance their digital transformation goals. But ultimately, everyone must be moving in the right direction if these efforts are to be successful.</p>
<p>After all, you can’t force people or other organizations to change, but you can try to influence them.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Learn to Influence Others 
<p>Many believe controlling everything around them is the only way to success. However, this is only sometimes possible and is often not the most effective approach. Instead, focus on honing your ability to influence those around you. When you learn to influence others, you can achieve your goals without controlling everyone and everything around you.&nbsp;</p>

 “Control leads to compliance; autonomy leads to engagement.” ― Daniel H. Pink 
</blockquote> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>It is natural to desire a particular outcome and then work to achieve it. Control can be advantageous, but it comes with a price tag that can eventually surpass justification. Trying to exert control over too much can cause one to lose control entirely; the amount of effort required to maintain control grows to exceed the ability to improve the situation.</p>
 Control Leads to Problems 
<p>The misplaced need for control leads to various problems, for instance:</p>
 
 Stifling Growth. Some environments need to be uncontrolled to grow. When a community expands, costs associated with maintaining control will eventually hinder further growth. 
 Community Suppression. When an individual place demands on an ecosystem, other community members will either step back to let them do things or back away from conflicting ideas. 
 Lack of Resilience. Rigidly controlled systems may be robust but will fail when conditions change, or control points are not fully understood. 
 
<p>The challenge with influence is that it is far less predictable than control. As a result, the rewards that come through influence can be incredible.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
 “Leadership is not about a title or a designation. It’s about impact, influence and inspiration. Impact involves getting results, influence is about spreading the passion you have for your work, and you have to inspire teammates and customers.” — Robin S. Sharma 
</blockquote> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Control vs. Influence Example 




<p>Twitter is an excellent example of the effective use of influence and poor use of control.</p>
<p>Successful Influence – Twitter has exercised limited control while allowing the community to create new features. Retweets (RT) and direct messages emerged from the community – they merely made tools that helped users do what they already were doing. Arguably where Twitter acts to influence its community lightly, it grows.</p>
<p>Control Failure – In the early days of Twitter, the community expanded rapidly. Thus tools and apps were created and made Twitter grow faster. Then Twitter exerted control on an ecosystem and nearly died. Twitter was inconsistent and destroyed successful partners by limiting access and developing competitive features. This failure still impacts the Twitter community. Twitter’s CEO, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/21/9586084/jack-dorsey-twitter-ceo-apology-developers">Jack Dorsey, apologized in 2015</a>, and they continue to struggle to rebuild the developer community.</p>




 A Power Function 
<p>Influence is a power function – we can influence far more than we can control. It can help you to achieve your goals, build better relationships, and more. In many ways, Darrell’s philosophy is what guides successful digital transformations. By focusing on what you can control and influence, you can make changes that will ultimately benefit your organization. So if you’re embarking on a digital transformation, keep Darrell’s words in mind and focus on what you can control and influence the rest. It might just be the key to success.</p>

<p>In the digital age being able to prove who we determine our opportunities to establish trust with each other and carry out meaningful interactions. But the reality is that the existing models of exchanging information are inadequate in the context of this new era – one can reasonably say archaic, insecure, insufficient privacy protection, adds friction into interactions, and are largely inaccessible for over a billion people.</p>



<p>We need a system that will allow us to own and control our identity, reputation, capabilities, achievements, ownerships, and connections; securely and selectively disclose context-driven information to counterparties; access digital services; digitally sign transactions and documents, and prove who we are with any provider – online, on the phone or in-person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the frictionless future Dhiway aims to enable – an environment in which data can be easily shared across systems where trust in data is not brokered by intermediaries —as has been the case until now— but is embodied algorithmically in the data itself. Individuals and organisations can take back ownership of their information and control the flow as regards — who sees it, what they see, and when.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We all want to be in control of our data and manage who has access to specific information about us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The CORD blockchain project from Dhiway combines distributed ledger technology with the themes of privacy, trust frameworks, governance, unique persistent data identifiers, and information management protocols using cryptographic models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CORD is a Layer 1 blockchain designed to simplify information management, making it easier for owners to control; agencies and businesses to discover, access and use data to deliver networked public services. It provides a transparent history of information and protects it from unauthorised tampering from within or without the system. CORD creates new possibilities for addressing trust gaps, managing the authenticity of transactions, and exchanging value at scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CORD shifts the lens from the information a siloed application holds to the cross-entity history of transactions backed by the information. Transaction details are shared and updated in near real-time across the network. CORD does not store personally identifiable information (PII) or the business data linked to the transaction on the chain. Digital transformation initiatives are augmented through the combination of verifiable digital identities linked with verifiable credentials. The individuals who are the holders of the data records can now receive, manage and share the records based on requests from verifiable sources and determine when and how to fulfil the request.</p>



<p>Enterprises can now use an existing <a href="https://cord.network/">utility network</a> built using CORD or create a new network to integrate applications or services that complement and upgrade current practices. The utility network model of CORD supports the potential to catalyse exceptional levels of innovation in both existing and emerging industries, from conducting transactions and maintaining records across many sectors of the economy such as finance, trade, health, energy, water, agriculture, education and many more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CORD is an essential building block of Web 3.0 with its ability to reimagine real-world interactions that best fit a particular purpose, balancing security and control with the convenience and opportunity of sharing data between institutions and individuals. The potential this creates for new business models is endless.</p>



 



 The technology will continue to evolve over the coming years, and for that reason, this overview should be considered as the start of the conversation on how we can all work together to reimagine industries, rebuild financial processes, and build markets once considered improbable or unprofitable. Together, we can drive the long-term development and adoption of the technology and capitalise on the economic and social opportunities it offers.

<p>Recently, the concept of Web3 has become almost ubiquitous, as a variety of organizations have gone out of their way to promote it. When it comes to Web3, we have to talk about DID (decentralized identity). There has been a lot of discussion and analysis about the definition of DID and identity in general, and the techniques involved in establishing on-chain identity, and we don’t do too much more development here. Today, we will show you a different way of describing your identity in terms of identity&nbsp;use.</p><p>First, when it comes to identity, we mainly focus on two&nbsp;issues:</p><p>·How do you establish or describe your identity?</p><p>·How do you prove that the identity that you describe is&nbsp;you?</p><p>In the real world and Web2, we describe identity in roughly the same&nbsp;way.</p> Describing identity in the real world and in&nbsp;Web2 <p>In real life, the way you describe your identity may be to introduce yourself when you meet new people, it may also be a business card, a resume, or a more formal way to show your ID card or passport.</p><p>Identity in Web2 is easy to understand, and your google ID, twitter tag, and the KYC that you provide when signing up for an App account are all part of your identity. The way to describe your identity becomes the display page of your account, the self-introduction written on your home page, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>You can see that both in real life and Web2, the way to describe identity is mainly subjective.</p><p>For example, when looking for a job, you need to edit a resume that includes your name, age, contact information, and, most importantly, your past experience, learn to “polish” and express selectively, and use data to know you more positively. In addition to authenticity, you also need to “polish,” use selective expression, and use data to make recruiters think more about&nbsp;you.</p><p>As a result, recruiters now often need to do background checks on candidates to check the authenticity of their resumes, giving rise to a thriving industry called back-checking.</p><p>Whether in real life or in Web2, the same problem exists when describing and proving your identity — when you’re describing yourself, writing a resume, or trying to introduce yourself, you’re trying to figure out how to demonstrate your “best” self; After you describe your identity, others will have to verify your identity through a background check or by looking at supporting documents, adding costs to society and businesses.</p><p>But all this will be different in the Web3 era, and the way we describe identity will be completely reconstructed by the advent of decentralized technology.</p> Describing identity in&nbsp;Web3 <p>Due to the existence of blockchain and the application of the distributed ledger, in Web3, the behaviors of participants will be permanently and truly recorded, whose authenticity cannot be tampered&nbsp;with.</p><p>So when looking for a job, you won’t need to write your own resume — your on-chain identity is a trusted collection of past on-chain behavior. Simply by sending a few of your usual decentralized data client addresses to recruiters, they can easily learn about your past on-chain behavior and extrapolate from that to your capabilities and experience.</p><p>In recent years, there is a growing trend for blockchain industry applicants who describe their identity in this way, and blockchain enterprise recruitment also prefers such a “resume” — — “when they have their own identity in the most popular platforms and data clients on a blockchain, and they use it frequently, their understanding of the industry will be deeper than the average person”, a blockchain enterprise HR&nbsp;said.</p><p>However, at the moment the advantages of this identity description are only known within the industry, and if you want to “get out”, appropriate tools to simplify data analysis are necessary. Below, we list several similar on-chain behavior analysis&nbsp;DApps.</p> Ape Board <p>Ape Board is a digital asset display product. If you input the address of the decentralized data client on Ape Board, you can see the past interactions of the address, the digital assets, and even the Profit &amp;&nbsp;Loss.</p><p>Investment is one of the best ways to realize personal cognition. Your investment income and the direction of the investment target reflect your personal cognition level of the industry and recent research efforts you have made. Of course, investment returns are influenced by many factors, and more information is needed to understand you more&nbsp;fully.</p> Cyberconnect HQ <p>In this project, you can see which NFT the target address holds, which POAP badges it has earned, and which articles it has posted on the Mirror. The accomplishments you have and the opinions you put out will become part of your identity, and people will be able to see you through those&nbsp;things.</p> Degenscore <p>Enter the centralized data client address into Degenscore, and Degen will generate a Degenscore based on on-chain behavior. The higher the score, the more involved and experienced you are in the blockchain field.</p><p>If you want to show that you are a blockchain industry veteran, your Degenscore will be the best proof, it will be far more persuasive than your subjective statement. People will be able to get a sense of who you are through intuitive scores.</p> OScore <p>OScore, the Ontology credit scoring system, is an on-chain credit score designed for programmable credit. Through the use of a variety of different on-chain interaction data calculations, it can show the user’s past credit status in the form of a&nbsp;score.</p><p>OScore provides a comprehensive picture of a user’s on-chain credit status, and also helps to predict a user’s potential credit risk. OScore analyzes your credit score for all your on-chain behaviors, making on-chain identity descriptions more diverse and&nbsp;rich.</p><p>Through the analysis of the above sites, the employer can intuitively understand how much energy and what kind of behavior the candidate has invested in the industry. Words and subjective descriptions can be deceptive, but actions do&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Of course, since Web3 is still in its early stage, the on-chain information is mainly the interactive on-chain data, and the on-chain behavior that can be analyzed is not enough. The above way of describing identity can only be limited to the blockchain industry at&nbsp;present.</p><p>But as the Web3 infrastructure builds and spreads, it’s reasonable to believe that the future will be an era where everything is connected, where all of your actions will become valuable, and your identity will be aggregated from all of your past on-chain&nbsp;actions.</p><p>When introducing yourself, you no longer need to use a resume, all of your past experience will be portrayed and represented by your on-chain behavior, and your identity requester(such as the recruiter) will no longer need to do a background check on you, because the traceability and Immutability of the blockchain is the best endorsement of your identity.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-tech-viewpoint-in-web3-the-way-of-describing-identity-will-be-completely-reconstructed-1d1d0fff8cc3">Ontology Tech Viewpoint | In Web3, the Way of Describing Identity will be Completely Reconstructed!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				<p>At Trinsic, we prioritize building a platform that helps IDtech product builders to get significant end user adoption for their solutions. In order for any technology to reach mass adoption, it needs to be fast, cheap, and reliable. Most blockchains, at the moment, are often compromised on at least one of those characteristics, so we designed a solution that would be ledger agnostic.</p>

				<p>Keys and data are the underpinning of a decentralized identity system. While blockchains and cryptocurrency have brought more attention than ever to the idea of public/private keys, the concept of using these key pairs to prove who you are on the internet has been around since the 90s. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) used public private key pairs to encrypt and verify that an email was sent from a specific identity.&nbsp;</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Trinsic’s Approach to Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Current decentralized identity systems use decentralized identifiers, or <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids/">DIDs</a>, to establish and verify identities of the users exchanging information. Usually, a “flavor” of decentralized identity is tied to a specific DID method. For example, the Hyperledger flavor is tied to did:sov and did:indy methods. There are over 100 registered DID methods ranging from simple to extremely complex to implement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When developing the Trinsic Ecosystems platform, we wanted to use the simplest possible approach by default that would allow builders to layer in additional features and complexity as needed by use case. We use the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key</a> method which is a lightweight, ledger-less DID method allowing users to created decentralized identifiers without the need to pay ledger fees or wait for a blockchain.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Using Trust Registries and Verified Domains to Build Your Ecosystem 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Trusted issuers are often the foundation of an ecosystem, acting as the source of the data inside wallets of the holders. For example, a trusted issuer might be a professional licensing entity who wants to issue verifiable credentials to people who obtain a certification. For an IDtech company who is building a trust ecosystem, you want it to be clear to the participants in your ecosystem that the issuers are trustworthy.</p><p><br>There are two ways you can create trust in Trinsic Ecosystems. The first is by implementing a <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-is-a-trust-registry/">trust registry</a> which outlines who can issue and verify certain credentials. For example, your trust registry could specify that only the DID of the professional licensing organization is allowed to issue a certification. Second, the licensing organization can verify their domain name allowing users to see that the credentials were issued by a trusted entity. The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web</a> specification allows for this to happen in a standardized manner, creating outputs that are legible by any system abiding by the specification.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 When Might You Want to Anchor DIDs on a Blockchain?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>While Trinsic Ecosystems is ledger-less by default, we provide the option to <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/learn/concepts/dids/#upgrading-wallet-dids">upgrade DIDs</a> to a blockchain if this would be desirable for your use case. We currently support did:ion with plans to support many more DID methods in the near future. Here are a couple reasons you may want to upgrade DIDs to be anchored on a decentralized ledger:</p>
 
 If you value persistence and censorship resistance, both of which could be at risk if you tie a DID to a domain name 
 If you want to provide your users full ownership and portability of their identities<br> 
 
<p>Blockchains provide a level of censorship resistance, interoperability, and persistence that would not be possible if your identity were tied to something like a domain registrar. While upgrading a DID to a blockchain often has a small cost associated with it, the ledger fee could be a fraction of registering a domain name and paying a yearly fee.</p>
<p>In reality, most of the IDtech builders that utilize Trinsic are building products that do not require this level of persistence, censorship resistance, and ownership when they’re first starting out. Luckily, our platform was built in a modular way, so you can start building your solution quickly and simply, while maintaining the option to upgrade DIDs at any time.</p>

 	 Performance of blockchain-based solutions can be hit or miss. Depending on your choice of blockchain, you may end up with a costly or slow solution that is not ready for real-world implementation. 
 	 It might be easier to gain adoption if you’re using widely-accepted web standards instead of blockchains. This is especially true if the benefits of decentralization aren’t applicable to your use case. 
 	 Starting with a ledger-less solution allows you to have optionality down the line about how you roll out your solution. We are in the early days of seeing IDtech companies use web2, web3, and web5 technologies to solve identity problems. Building on Trinsic means you don’t have to pick a winner and can stay open as technology develops.

				<p>Using decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, you can create platforms, products, and experiences that incorporate varying levels of decentralization. The Trinsic Ecosystems platform was created in a modular way, so IDtech builders can tailor their solutions to the needs of their use case, without being locked into a particular technology stack.

  <p>Current frameworks from Cyber Essentials in the UK, to the NIST Cyber Security Framework, HIPPA, PCI-DSS and even ISO27002:2022 often take at least 18-24 months to agree by their governance bodies. The world is much faster moving that that, the fact many regulatory frameworks will take years before the kinks are ironed out demonstrate that they are good for what they were designed for at inception, but after that many of them do not keep up with the changing threats and risks enterprises face, let alone the real controls that are required to protect the enterprise. This is why they are more than often just a tick-box exercise for many enterprises. This session will demonstrate with an analysis of several standards and frameworks, that they are a great starting point if you don't know where to start, but if your really want to protect your enterprise you need to go beyond using controls checklists designed for yesteryear's threats and risks. And what organisations can do to improve security to keep in touch with current threats and risks?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-sembhi-static-frameworks"></a>

  <p>Most organizations don’t suffer from a lack of cybersecurity tools. They suffer from the cost and administrative burden of running too many of these. They suffer from the lack of integration. They suffer from the lack of skills in optimally configuring the tools and analyzing the data.</p>
<p>Couldn’t less be more? But what is the right answer? Just retiring some tools? Consolidating to new solutions such as XDR? Replacing old tools with the newest best-of-breed solutions?</p>
<p>As always, best start with a plan, and with defined methods to evaluate the contribution of the various tools you have to your targets. The plan must help you in understanding which elements you need most for protecting your IT. On the other hand, you must understand how well your existing tools landscape contributes to this.</p>
<p>In his talk, Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will unveil methodologies that can help you in assessing your cybersecurity tools portfolio, and that can help you in deciding about where to invest next.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-kuppinger-cybersecurity-tools"></a>

  <p>Cyber Security traditionally has been seen as the domain of Technology, with an expectation that the solution for cyber resilience has to be provided by IT – and we happily accepted this challenge and delivered numerous software and hardware solutions, design and development principles, policies and process controls.</p>
<p>However, as most successful cyber-attacks in recent time have started by targeting users with phishing emails or social engineering, raising awareness of their role in increasing cyber resilience is at least as important as providing “just a technical solution”.</p>
<p>This presentation will – based on example of a famous real robbery in Berlin – show how user awareness can become an important line of defence in cyber security.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-husain-social-engineering"></a>

  <p>When speaking about cybersecurity, Hollywood has made us think of hooded figures in a dark alley and real-time cyber defense while typing at the speed of light. However, proper cyber security means, above all, good, clean and clear security practices that happen before-hand and all day, everyday. This is particularly true for Identity and Access Management, which is a component of every domain within Cyber Security, and it's identified as a cause for more than 80% of data breaches. IAM is rarely about white-hat hackers counter-attacking an ongoing intrusion. It's mainly about a set of good practices, clearly defined processes and, overall, good hygiene in the way we manage our identities, our resources, our entitlements, and the way they relate to each other.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-loureiro-cyber-hygiene"></a>

  <p>Resilience has been changing over the last 15-20 years, where we now accept and acknowledge the various types of reslience an organisation should be responding to. This session will explore how security has moved from a focus on just protection to faster detection and response. It will aso explore what the fast moving technologies mean for other types of resilience that organisations will be faced with in the coming future, and what they can do about it.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-sembhi-changing-resilience"></a>

  <p>For any large company, regulated or not, it is essential to have a mechanism or process for detecting vulnerabilities. For this purpose, various scanners exist that can automatically scan the company's IT assets for known and new vulnerabilities. However, this is where the big challenge begins: most scanners tend to find a large number of vulnerabilities. This is important and good, but not every vulnerability is equally relevant for every company.</p>
<p>Typically, most organizations drown quickly with the number of vulnerabilities they have. Different specific scanners for compliance, containers, source code, operating systems and applications deliver a hardly manageable number of different potential problems per asset.</p>
<p>For vulnerability management to work, you need to build a sustainable vulnerability management, define intelligent processes and specify intelligent bundling and prioritization.</p>
<p>In this presentation, Christopher Schütze will show how this was achieved in a successful project.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-schuetze-hick-sustainable-vulnerability-management"></a>

  <p>Over simplifying, IT security means defending the IT systems from threats procured by cybercriminals. Their targets are, for example, the manipulation of systems, the extorsion or exfiltration of data, and the interruption or alteration of services. However, what happens if we have humans instead of IT systems? Given that the scope of an attacker is always the same, as aforementioned, attacking a human is an entirely different process, and the attack tactics must change. This well-known fact involves social engineering and human sciences (e.g., psychologists or behavioural sciences instead of informatics). However, from the cyber security side of the coin, what does it imply dealing with humans? What does it mean, for example, to perform convincing penetration testing or vulnerability scanning to deeply test human weaknesses: it is not merely a problem of sending a phishing email and waiting for clicks. How can be done a threat analysis or threat intelligence on humans? Moreover, how can a company calculate the cyber risk that a human represents and how many effective ways to reduce it? If we fully put humans (either as employees or IT security operators) at the centre of cybersecurity, the questions become several.</p>
<p>The problem is complex because, by its nature, it is multicultural and requires different non-technical competencies. It includes experts in philosophy, political science, cyber sociology, pedagogy, acting performance, etc., collaborating with cybersecurity experts. Facing the human element of security is a genuinely multicultural and interconnected approach. Furthermore, humans are coincidentally “human” and not machines: there are also ethical and legal issues to consider, and their reactions change during the day. The talk will explore and present a comprehensive view of what happens when there are not the IT systems but the humans at the centre of cybersecurity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-frumento-cybersecurtiy-human-element"></a>

<p>SAML SSO vs. LDAP can be challenging to parse out. Still, we go through both methods to help clear up the differences and help you decide which to use.</p>
<p>Is SSO possible with LDAP? Yes, SSO is possible with LDAP as many providers support LDAP for SSO.</p>
 What Is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)? 
<p>LDAP is an open and vendor-neutral protocol that applications can use to access directory information services. This means providing support for navigating and interacting with local network resources, like users, directories, files, apps, and other services for local enterprise users.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the protocol structures these resources like a phone directory only available through the foundational TCP/IP stack–meaning that any computer system can deploy it on top of their existing network capabilities. The directory contains several core pieces of information for each resource on the network:</p>
 
 Entry Attributes: Each resource is an entry in the directory, and each entry has a set of attributes that are used to identify it on the LDAP network. At a minimum, these attributes have names and subsequent values, the meaning of which is defined in an attribute schema. 
 Unique Identifiers: Entries each have a unique identifier called its Distinguished Name (DN). This identifier includes a Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) plus some selected attributes. 
 Operations: LDAP provides a set of acceptable operations that allows users to interact with the server itself, including modifying entries, initiating encrypted sessions, and searching for resources. On the front end, however, users interacting with applications won’t see these commands, they will just see relevant network resources. 
 
<p>Because LDAP handles resource access, it also handles authentication, a crucial part of local data security (and an overlap with Single Sign-On capabilities).</p>
 Benefits of LDAP 
<p>LDAP brings a few critical functions and benefits to enterprise users, especially in the area of managing network resources. These benefits include:</p>
 
 Lightweight: LDAP has been around since the earliest days of computing and was created to provide lean, simple, and lightweight directory management. 
 Vendor-Agnostic: LDAP can be deployed nearly anywhere, with any technology, and run relatively smoothly. This, along with its small footprint, means it can scale very easily with new technology or network segments. 
 Directory Security: LDAP provides security layers for authentication and encryption for data in transit. This security will apply to directory entries’ underlying attributes, including personally identifiable information (PII) and username/password credentials. 
 
 What Is Single Sign-On (SSO)? 
<p>SSO is a method of authentication where a central identity provider handles authentication and authorization requests for multiple system resources or applications. A form of federated identity, SSO allows enterprise organizations to streamline identity verification such that employees do not have to remember multiple passwords.</p>
<p>The term SSO refers specifically to a strategy for authentication. Several different SSO solutions are used in practice, including:</p>
 
 Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), an XML-based protocol for token-based authentication. 
 Kerberos, a ticket-based service created at MIST that relies on LAN domains to authenticate users on applications. Most often used in educational settings. 
 Shibboleth, A SAML-based SSO approach is also used in academic settings where federated identity management across institutions is ideal. 
 OpenID Connect, A JSON-based identity verification protocol focusing on web and mobile authentication. 
 OAuth, A protocol more focused on authorization for access to system resources, OAuth often works closely with authentication to provide an overall SSO solution. 
 
 Benefits of SSO 
<p>The benefits of SSO as compared to LDAP are rooted in singular authentication. While LDAP can provide authentication for users, it cannot support more web-based and portable Single Sign-On like typical SSO methods. These benefits include:</p>
 
 Simplified Authentication: Simplified authentication is a major goal for most solutions because user error or poor security practices (often tied to managing too many passwords) lead to the majority of data breaches. An SSO can minimize the attack surface and the potential for social engineering hacks. 
 Stronger Security: While centralizing authentication might seem counterintuitive, it actually provides a stronger platform for robust security. Identity providers can implement strong encryption, multi-factor authentication, and even passwordless authentication that covers several platforms rather than just one. 
 
 What Are the Differences Between LDAP and SSO? 
<p>It’s not entirely accurate to completely separate LDAP and SSO. Obviously, they aren’t the same technologies, but an organization can deploy LDAP with SAMLof OpenID Connect SSO to support more robust authentication.</p>
<p>However, there are some key differences:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">Authentication</a>: Both technologies support authentication. LDAP, however, is an underlying server through which other protocols can authenticate users for access to system directories. Other SSO technologies, like SAML, maybe more open in terms of their implementation and more applicable to cloud-based platforms and applications. 
 Features: SSO is typically focused on authentication, possibly authorization. LDAP provides several types of access controls and information cross-checks for network resources above and beyond authentication. 
 Integration: LDAP will usually be more recognizable to users across different applications. For example, using an SSO system will allow a user to access multiple platforms with web portals. LDAP, however, might be a key technology that syncs email contacts in an email client.

 Making it Easier to Sell is Just the&nbsp;Start <p>* may contain actual revolution</p><p>The Holy Grail of selling physical assets on the blockchain has always been real estate; it is the world’s most valuable asset class, but at the same time one of the trickiest to deal with because of all the legal apparatus that comes with it (more about that&nbsp;later).</p><p>Now, though, the innovative partnership between Mattereum and leading property consultants West London City Lets (WLCL) has succeeded in putting real estate on the blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/09/26/mattereum-customer-west-london-city-lets-launch-first-real-estate-physical-asset-nft-for-land-in-uk/">Mattereum Customer West London City Lets Launch First Real Estate Physical Asset NFT for Land in UK</a></p><p>The result has been the launch of the first real estate physical asset non-fungible token (NFT), for a prime beach-front property on England’s south coast by WLCL, listed on the NFT marketplace <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa6cd9f96f73015bf6b2eaac9d7da09c860b377b2/0/">OpenSea</a> for offers over £1.25M through their blockchain subsidiary <a href="https://tokenized-properties.com/">Tokenized Properties</a>. This is a first of its kind transaction and is set to revolutionise real estate deals, not just in the UK, but for customers worldwide by using Mattereum’s innovative <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1ef0jF7SltECHp40AgY13ihp_XlHvvW-XIEGLyEtRYrE/edit">Universal Bridge</a> to create a market that is both efficient and transparent.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-mattereum-universal-bridge-e86bca2db220">The Mattereum Universal Bridge</a></p><p>How does this work exactly? Well, the NFT is linked to a <a href="https://mattereum.com/mattereum-asset-passports/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> that stores relevant data for the property and is held on the blockchain. The MAP bundles together legal rights and warranties and is paired with Mattereum’s smart contract. This means that the required searches, title deed and reference media for due diligence are displayed accurately and transparently so that the NFT purchaser can sell on the property without the next purchaser needing to go through the process all over&nbsp;again.</p><p>What the NFT purchaser gets for their money is an interest in the property. If they wish to take full ownership of the property itself, they simply pay an extra pound, and full legal title is transferred to them, they can then do as they wish with the property and the NFT is burned. If they do not wish to do that and want to sell on their interest in the property instead, it can be done in moments, just like any other NFT transaction. Even if they do take full ownership of the property and burn the NFT, there is nothing to stop them coming back to Mattereum again at a future date and setting up a new NFT for the property to return it to the market. In fact, in a mature market for trading real estate on the blockchain, we’d expect that to be&nbsp;routine.</p><blockquote>Suddenly property trading becomes swift, frictionless and efficient</blockquote> Mortgages, fractionalisation and stablecoins <p>NFTs for property titles is pretty much a game changer, suddenly property trading becomes swift, frictionless and efficient instead of a three-month slog for every single transaction; but the implications of this are greater still. Once you start thinking about what this can do for DeFi, a whole bunch of further possibilities emerge — things like improving liquidity, collateralising, loans and mortgages, which may not sound all that revolutionary — you can go to a bank and get a&nbsp;loan.</p><p>But it’s not what you can get, it’s how you can get it; it’s not uncommon for real estate owners to need to talk to banks for two or three months to access liquidity, but once all the documentation is on the blockchain and there are warranties in the asset passport, it suddenly becomes possible to bypass all that and avoid the interminable delays.</p><p>The DeFi ecosystem is perfectly capable of financing mortgages and remortgages, and Mattereum expects DeFi financing of property deals to be a huge growth area in&nbsp;future.</p><p><a href="https://decrypt.co/40679/defi-meets-real-estate-as-aave-readies-crypto-mortgages">DeFi Meets Real Estate as Aave Readies Crypto Mortgages - Decrypt</a></p><p>It’s also possible to easily fractionalise properties by forming a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). You can then get a line of buyers willing to buy into these at a very advantageous price, then you can go to the liquidity provider and say, “Hey, would you lend us on those assets that you would be able to sell for those different prices?” It speeds the whole thing&nbsp;up.</p><p>When it comes to loans it’s also possible to have better competition in terms of things like rates using the blockchain, when you have real estate as collateral, with the potential for private people to offer loans within the DeFi ecosystem, as long as they can show they have the right backing in terms of money and security. It is even possible to use real estate to back a stablecoin, this is being done by <a href="https://www.tangible.store/real-estate">TangibleDAO</a> who use income-producing and tokenised residential properties as a source of both collateral and yield to back the USDR stablecoin.</p> The blockchain brings systemic transparency <p>The opacity of the real estate ecosystem has made it a source of corruption and pain for a long time. In 2008 mortgage backed securities <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/subprime-mortgage-crisis-effect-and-timeline-3305745">basically destroyed the financial system</a> because of their complete opacity — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/business/economy/25gret.html">no one could figure out who had the mortgages</a> and what the probability was that they were going to fail to repay&nbsp;them.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/business/economy/25gret.html">If Lenders Say 'The Dog Ate Your Mortgage' (Published 2009)</a></p><p>And today’s financial crisis can be seen as just the consequences of the response to that finally catching up with us. The original <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1667902707586469&amp;usg=AOvVaw3xWpjGwa46mb3ihGfTpBYe">Satoshi white paper </a>that started Bitcoin actually references the 2008 financial crisis and the bailouts. Satoshi understood that there was a problem with financial system stability in real estate right from the very beginning of the blockchain, and that what he was proposing could be a solution to all that. The blockchain brings systemic transparency, you can see who has what, and what the securities are made up of and make it possible to avoid all that mess. There are now companies like <a href="https://www.milo.io/">Milo</a> or <a href="https://www.figure.com/">Figure</a> that are willing to provide mortgages with NFTs as collateral too, and dealing with mortgages on the blockchain makes the whole thing much safer and more trustworthy.</p><blockquote>The blockchain can drive a whole new way of thinking about land ownership and our responsibilities towards the&nbsp;planet</blockquote><p>So, now all these things become possible, that adds a whole extra dimension to putting real estate on the blockchain, but it doesn’t have to end there, there is potential for using the blockchain to drive a whole new way of thinking about land ownership and our responsibilities towards the planet. To understand exactly how that could work, we need to think about what gives us real estate ownership, and I apologise in advance if this seems like a large diversion, because it is, but it is necessary, so bear with me, it’s not going to be dull though, it involves both wolves and the Holy Roman&nbsp;Emperor.</p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Top_Decoration_of_Ottoman_Title_Deed.png">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Top_Decoration_of_Ottoman_Title_Deed.png</a> Part 2: The Deeper Magic from Before the Dawn of&nbsp;Time <p>First the wolves; owning real estate can be seen as the earliest form of “ownership” there is. It predates humans. In its earliest form it’s something like a bear defending its cave, you want the cave, you fight the bear, one on one conflict to defend a patch of land; then there’s wolves. They run in packs and if you look at how packs divide the land up, you find each pack has a territory with pretty clearly defined borders and conflict only occurs when one pack crosses into another’s territory — so that’s evolved from the simple territoriality of the bear and its cave to something like an agreement between packs about who owns which patch and it works out pretty clear cut; here’s a map showing the movements of wolves tracked by radio collar in Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota where they settle out into distinct territories.</p>Wolf Pack Territories <a href="https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2019/01/voyageurs-wolf-project/">https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2019/01/voyageurs-wolf-project/</a><p>So, humans work a bit like the wolves, individuals or groups of people have a patch of real estate, and they fight each other to decide where the line between them is drawn, except humans have some form of government and that government sets property ownership laws. This means that in a property dispute, instead of the two people having a fight, they take it to the law and put their case for where they believe the property line ought to be and the government comes down on one side or the other and resolves the dispute without violence (mostly). The two party fight is now a three party fight, and one of those parties is the state. Zoom out from that and you get nation states bordered by other nation states each with national sovereignty, and when these come into conflict, there is the international community and alliances that try and provide checks and balances, and on top of all that, these days, the UN. It’s all intended to try and stabilize the borders between nations by having third parties come in on one side or the other if a dispute&nbsp;starts.</p><p>This system of national borders is, of course, the Westphalia system of nations which came out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia in 1648</a>. This was the treaty that ended the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War">30 Year’s War</a> (one of the longest and most destructive conflicts in European history) and which came up with an agreed way of defining national boundaries which did not need the Holy Roman Emperor to make the final decision (because, by 1648, there were protestant countries who weren’t inclined to listen to a Catholic Emperor). All of which is supposed to work to resolve territorial disputes and ultimately decide who owns a piece of&nbsp;land.</p>The Holy Roman Empire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Holy_Roman_Empire_1648.svg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Holy_Roman_Empire_1648.svg</a><p>Sometimes, of course it fails, and there is war, just as on a personal level, someone having a boundary dispute with their next door neighbour will go round and smack them in the&nbsp;face.</p><blockquote>Land law is ancient, gnarly, hard and&nbsp;weird</blockquote><p>Ultimately, what this means is that there’s an ancient, layered system of real estate rights in place that governs everything from the borders of your country to the fence around your back garden, and the rights people have and how disputes are resolved is based on where they live, Germans get their disputes resolved in Germany, the English in England, and the Scots in Scotland (Scotland operates on a completely different legal system to England and Wales, despite being in the UK, so property law is different there; it also explains why in England witches were hanged but in Scotland, burned, but I digress). The result of all this is that land law is about the oldest law there is, and in most countries with a degree of antiquity, elements of their land law go back 1000 years or&nbsp;more.</p><p>In England, the pattern of land ownership recorded in the Domesday Book in the late 11th century is still reflected in the division of land today, in the Netherlands, they have deeds 900 years old written on parchment in old Dutch scanned into the national property rights database. As a result, land law is incredibly site specific because each country has its own history of how it did land in antiquity and most of those land deeds still apply at some level. Buy a house in the UK dating back to the 19th century or earlier and you’ll probably find the deeds still have clauses banning you running a tannery on the premises, or boiling down horses for glue. This means land law is inherently very strange because it is very old, very local and therefore extremely diverse. It’s not like copyright law, for example, which has a lot of global harmonisation because the law is relatively young and the rights are harmonised as nations link their laws up to international treaties.</p><p>Land law is ancient, gnarly, hard and weird, and that’s what controls the world’s most valuable asset&nbsp;class.</p> Part 3: A New Global Real Estate Settlement Rail <p>So, what Mattereum have done to sell real estate as a physical asset NFT is to put the NFT on top of this stack of law that goes all the way back to those wolves and their territory, which takes this enormous ancient pre-human machinery about territoriality and gets it down to a digital token that uses brand new technology to transfer the ownership of the land. To do this we have a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that owns the land. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030515/what-most-typical-holding-spv.asp">Special Purpose Vehicles</a> are single-function companies which typically exist to own or share ownership of a single asset, usually something like real estate or a painting.</p><p>The physical asset NFT legally locks onto the SPV, and the SPV legally locks onto the real estate register and the real estate register locks onto the law, ancient and&nbsp;modern.</p><p>That law then plugs into the kind of globalized Westphalian equilibrium that was ratified when the UN formed, and all of that reflects thousands of years of disputes over real estate that the Westphalian system was set up to avoid in the future. The end result of which is a Physical Asset NFT that has the power to legally transfer the ownership of the land anywhere in the world when it is sold and the purchaser takes up the interest in it. This now works without the buyer and seller having to wade through the old, weird processes of a thousand years of property law, specific to the particular country where the land is, every time it is traded. The result is a fast and simple way of buying and selling land on the blockchain that at the same time conforms to all that property&nbsp;law.</p><p>Finally, all this ties in with one of those recent bits of globally harmonised law, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Recognition_and_Enforcement_of_Foreign_Arbitral_Awards">1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards</a>, commonly known as the New York Convention. This means that if there is any dispute relating to the property and its sale, there’s a mechanism for resolving that dispute and that the outcome is legally valid in all 170 countries that are signatories to the Convention, again without having to get entangled in hyperlocal property&nbsp;law.</p><p>We are literally driving a thousand year old (or older) global legal equilibrium institution using Ethereum!</p> Part 4: Decolonising Real&nbsp;Estate <p>Now we have an NFT through which a property can be sold; yes, it is a great way of handling all that ancient legal machinery, but it’s also laying the foundations for the next generation of property law. How is that? Looking back at all this history of property law, it does seem as if law based on land with maps, boundaries, straight lines and owners, verified by a state register is objectively real and the only way doing&nbsp;it.</p><p>But in cultures like Greece, though, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-landregistry-idUSKCN1QW23B">the state register isn’t an accurate record of who actually owns the land</a>. They don’t use the state register in the villages because many people dissemble about who owns what for tax reasons. Transferring land means paying taxes. So they make an informal agreement, where you give me 50 grand in cash, and I give you the bottom 20 acres of my farm, and nobody will write this deal down because if they do that, then they have to pay taxes. Because they have to pay taxes for the government to know that the thing happened for them to deal with any dispute, they do dispute resolution at the village level. They don’t want the government to know and they don’t want to pay the government for doing the dispute resolution. To buy land in Greece, you have to go and talk to the locals to figure out what the real ownership situation is, because if you buy it from somebody that the locals don’t consider owns it, you’re going to have real problems even if you have legal title, you will not be able to use the land, so the system kind of breaks down there, ownership is down to local knowledge, community consent and personal negotiation.</p><p>In fact, it is a quirk of fate that the world basically uses a system that is of European origin; in the Ottoman Empire, it wasn’t where you lived that defined your rights, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_law#Legal_system">it was your religion</a>. There were courts for christians who resolved matters between christians, for jews that dealt with their matters, and for muslims, which dealt with matters between muslims, or between muslims and members of the other faiths. If the Battle of Vienna in 1683 had gone the other way, the Ottoman approach to property law could have become the prevalent system.</p>The Ottoman Empire at its peak in&nbsp;1590<p>A key reason the Ottoman system was so different was that a big chunk of their empire was desert inhabited by <a href="https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9780203142851.ch1">nomads</a> who did not stay in one place and so having their legal status tied to a patch of physical real estate was pretty useless. One result being that nations within the empire were not as important as they were in the west, so after the First World War when the empire fell and western powers divided it up into countries their way, the resulting borders planted the seeds for decades of conflict as they cut across all kinds of accepted traditional territories wandered by the&nbsp;nomads.</p><p>For nomads, what was valuable about land was that there was good pasture here in the spring, water there in the height of summer, shelter over there when it snows in winter and so on, it is what the land provides that gives it its value, not where it is, and land that is valuable to nomads in summer isn’t in winter, so it made sense for the law to be about the people, not the&nbsp;place.</p><p>The Westphalian system is a horrible fit for this kind of way of looking at the land, which also makes it a horrible fit for dealing with the reality of environmental damage, climate change, overpopulation and all that. It’s hundreds of years old and pre-scientific and is fundamentally unsuited to dealing with anything like&nbsp;that.</p>The wind pushes the clouds and the clouds bring the&nbsp;rain<p>Any scientifically rigorous definition of the land has to include the ecosystem if you have valuable fertile land beside a river, then someone dams the river upstream so that everything below the dam dries up and dies, your fertile land suddenly isn’t fertile anymore and it is worth a fraction of what it was before, and that is true for a river and its irrigation channels, as it is for rainfall patterns. There’s no patch of farmland in the world that is equally valuable if it has ten times as much rain or a 10th as much rain. So, because we built this pre-scientific model of land and what makes it valuable, our data representations are inadequate for representing the scientific reality of what it is that actually makes the land valuable, for capturing the environmental dimension; it treats the ecology as an externality. Now, though, if you are selling the land using a Mattereum Physical Asset NFT, it comes with a Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP) and that really changes what you can do about documenting the ecological value of the&nbsp;land.</p><blockquote>Much of the dispute resolution could be done inside the SPV, without needing to involve the government</blockquote><p>Going back to all the stuff we were saying earlier about Westphalia, about the Greeks and the Ottomans, the one thread that links how they all deal with land is that ownership of the land is about dispute resolution, whether that is done through a government land register, local agreement or a court that is based on your religion. Whichever way you are doing things, somewhere there is a way to resolve who does what with a patch of land, whether it is where you put your garden fence or which group of nomads gets to water their flocks at a particular oasis in&nbsp;July.</p><p>Now, if the ownership of the land is linked to a Physical Asset NFT that can transfer the ownership of an SPV that is the owner of the land on a government register, the SPV can, for example, issue leases or other user rights on the land. Much of the dispute resolution between different users of the land could then be done inside the SPV, without needing to involve the government, or indeed, anyone else. Private land management arrangements, on the blockchain. But still backed by the entire international legal stack so they are fully enforceable under&nbsp;law.</p><blockquote>Land management agreements which have the full force of law that run dramatically ahead of the nation&nbsp;state</blockquote> Creating positive political change with improved land&nbsp;rights <p>So imagine we take 100,000 acres of rainforest, we have it inside of a single SPV. Everybody on that land is a contractual tenant of the SPV including being able to do things like purchase 1000 year leases or something like that, so they’re de facto owners. But then the dispute resolution for the vast majority of the stuff is contained by arbitration clauses in the contracts, and this happens within the ruleset defined by the SPV and documented in the MAP that comes with the NFT. We can’t remove existing restrictions from the nation state or the international law level on land transactions by using these kinds of rule-making SPVs, but we can add new restrictions as matters of contract&nbsp;law.</p><p>So when the environmental law for managing a patch of land is insufficient, we can add new restrictive covenants in a way that forces correct management of the land for the current tenants or the future ones. This is how we basically build the possibility of land management agreements which have the full force of law that run dramatically ahead of the nation state legislation on environmental management. We do it through the physical asset NFT and its associated MAP which governs the way the SPV functions.</p><p>The prototype for this is systems like veganism. There is a whole certification machinery to say that food is vegan, and that certification machinery largely runs outside of the nation state. Some of the vegan certification machinery has become nation state legal certifications over time. But imagine if you had a way of specifying the rules for managing land that said, right, this land is rewilded land, and we manage it with absolutely zero extractive agriculture, and you’re not allowed to sell this land to anybody that will not take on a legal obligation to maintain that, and it becomes a restrictive covenant for environmental management. And this is how we can make what effectively acts like new law for land right the way up the governance stack. We’re trashing the entire world because we don’t say that the rain is as much of the value of the land, or the river irrigation is as intrinsic to the value of the land as its physical location. As a result, we’ve got people wrecking other people’s rainfall patterns with no legal liability attached. By looking at the ownership of the land in this different way we can do something about that, and without having to make governments change the law, because there are a lot of governments and they take forever to change anything and we don’t have that long. Landowners can start to enable the world to make the change here and now by using the warranties in the MAPs to govern the&nbsp;SPVs.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison#/media/File:American_bison_k5680-1.jpg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison#/media/File:American_bison_k5680-1.jpg</a> Indigenous Land Law and the New Buffalo&nbsp;Commons <p>One revolutionary proposal of this kind is the Poppers’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Commons">Buffalo Commons</a> proposal which envisages turning the American prairies into a vast open range for buffalo. The buffalo would return to their traditional migration patterns, and a percentage of them would be culled every year. The harvest would be sold, and the profits split among the people that had put their land into the scheme. Buffalo are smart: they evolved to cope with some drought, some changing weather patterns. They evolved not to crop the grass too low and kill it. They’ve survived everything for 5 to 10 million years and might be the best chance the midwestern states of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana">Montana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico">New Mexico</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota">North Dakota</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota">South Dakota</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas">Kansas</a> have of surviving climate change. A scheme like this is exactly the kind of proposal that the blockchain could support. Track the donations of land into the system, track the animals, track the harvests each year. Run transparent markets so that the land-donors are 100% sure they are getting their due. A huge amount of the endeavour could be run on contract law and permanent blockchain records of who did what and when, aligned with satellite data and other ways of keeping&nbsp;score.</p><blockquote>We can get to sustainability by adding new restrictive covenants to land and tracking them in the property rights databases</blockquote><p>It’s not just schemes like the Buffalo Commons that blockchain-based land registries could empower. Imagine an indiginous group which owns some part of its traditional lands, but does not have all the governance powers they would wish for regarding the environmental and other management of these lands. It may be possible to implement some or all of the traditional land management norms of the culture using SPVs and contract laws, and adding these restrictions on top of the land ownership norms — a way of extending environmental protection in advance of that which is mandated by national governments.</p><p>To create this kind of structure, a group of landowners would pool their titles inside of a single company (an SPV) and then the SPV would add restrictive covenants on the land titles. The blockchain is then used for tracking who currently owns what plots, and provides a mechanism for exerting stronger local control on the land. Anyone buying land there would have to uphold the restrictive covenants, and that would hold true all the way up the governance stack — because any dispute that occurred would be handled under international arbitration law. Depending on the local legal framework, land ownership could be restricted to the traditional owners of that&nbsp;land.</p><p>This is a delicate area, and the struggles for control of land between colonists and the colonized are extremely subtle, complex and bitter, and are being fought all over the world every single day. There is no technological silver bullet for these issues, but a combination of good lawyering and good technology might put new tools into the hands of land rights activists.</p><p>Almost every aspect of land ownership can be reshaped by appropriate use of contract law, with the blockchain to keep records clear and demonstrate fair dealing on every level. Existing restrictions from nation state and international law cannot be removed but nearly all of our problems in environmental land management come from too little law not too much. Just as the vegans had to add new contractual restrictions to food (“contains no animal products”), we can get to sustainability by adding new restrictive covenants to land and tracking them in the property rights databases.</p><p>Indigenous peoples have lost entire continents to settlers, but as the world seeks new ways to manage land to protect the ecological balance of the entire planet, the traditional ways in which people managed agriculture, settlement and forestry may turn out to be the only long term sustainable models that&nbsp;exist.</p>  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/24/899422710/to-manage-wildfire-california-looks-to-what-tribes-have-known-all-along">To Manage Wildfire, California Looks To What Tribes Have Known All Along</a>  <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/fire/indigenous-fire-practices-shape-our-land.htm">Indigenous Fire Practices Shape our Land - Fire (U.S. National Park Service)</a>  <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/03/us/california-native-american-fire-practitioners-wildfires-climate/index.html">California once prohibited Native American fire practices.

				  Indicio’s Chief Technology Officer Ken Ebert on why Indicio’s open source solutions in Google Cloud will drive digital transformation  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>The world of options for actionable, verifiable data is suddenly much bigger than it was. With the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-joins-google-cloud-partner-advantage-program/">news</a> that Indicio has joined Google’s Cloud Advantage Partner Program, there is now native cloud support on a global scale for implementing verifiable credential technology and building interoperable Trusted Digital Ecosystems. And there is no vendor lock in: Indicio provides fully open-source solutions through Google Cloud.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://indicio.tech/google_cloud/">initial products</a> are Indicio Proven™, a complete open-source system for implementing verifiable credentials; Indicio Mediator, a reliable way to connect to mobile devices so that they can use verifiable credentials; and Indicio NoDe — or Node-on-Demand for Hyperledger Indy— an easy way to spin up a validator node for an Indy network.</p>
<p>With Indicio NoDe, we want to make it as simple as possible to either join a network — such as the Indicio Network — or to create one for production or testing. With Indicio Mediator, we’ve made it easy for, say, a wallet developer to test their agents and get into production quickly without having to develop their own mediator to connect to mobile devices. Indicio Mediator is also a way to manage connecting to agents that have strict firewall rules—essentially, speak to the mediator first.</p>
<p>Proven gives companies and organizations the ability to stand up an entire ecosystem on their own — or with our help. It has all the pieces needed, reduces the learning curve for the technology, which in turn reduces time to deployment, and, critically, lowers cost. And because customers fully own Proven, it provides a great foundation for customizing solutions to meet the needs of specific verticals.</p>
<p>Our goal with these solutions is to provide the shortest possible route to using verifiable credentials. Everything comes straight from the open source codebases but without customers having to master these codebases to use the technology.</p>
<p>Having a complete solution available through Google Cloud will accelerate digital transformation. Cloud availability is the path to adoption; and with fully open-source solutions, the path to continued innovation too.</p>
<p>The full power of decentralized identity is now on tap in Google Cloud Marketplace. All the privacy-preserving features are there. Making decentralized identity solutions easy to build and implement is the path to making verifiable data the new currency of business and social interaction online, bridging Web2.0 and Web3.</p>

 How Adding Context Turns Siloed API Messages into Globally Connected Data <p>In our previous Transmute Tech School article, I described the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qmW_9xxG6kl83XOTzwyo_EpUku0QL8_a?usp=share_link">basics of Linked Data</a>, the integration benefits of which are driving the accelerating adoption of Linked Data for modern, data-driven business. My aim for this post is to dig deeper and sketch how actors across supply chains stand to gain tremendously from wider adoption:</p>  Linked Data is the perfect tool for capturing the inherently networked nature of supply&nbsp;chains.  Web-based semantics function as a machine-based lingua franca, connecting data models originating from diverse cultures, languages and jurisdictions.  <p>I will go into a little bit of technical detail, but promise to keep it light weight and not lose sight of the business benefits which the technology enables.</p> From Messages to Snippets Connected Data <p>It is generally understood that APIs are the enabler of digitization and automation. The “API Economy” is upon us, and there are competing platforms for all aspects of logistics and commerce processes. Linked Data builds upon this established infrastructure.</p><p>An API is — roughly speaking — a list of operations called by a client to invoke services and manipulate resources on a server. Each operation can have a request object and a reply object which are essentially digital documents with data relevant to the given operation. Data is normally kept in systems and databases and is mapped to and from these API documents, most often represented in JSON&nbsp;format.</p><p>The same data is often used in conjunction with multiple APIs, from a multitude of providers. On one platform, my product might be mapped to offeredProduct and assigned an identifier abc, whereas on another platform it maps to vendor-product as xyz. It is cumbersome for me to map data separately to every platform individually. And you would not be able to tell that these documents in fact deal with the same&nbsp;product.</p>Context is required to understand that these documents describe the same&nbsp;product. Adding Context to Message&nbsp;Data <p>Someone receiving these two documents will require a significant amount of context and human interventions to determine a) that these are the same type of products and b) that this is in fact the same product. This is essentially the problem which Linked Data solves by providing the necessary context.</p><p>By use of the standard JSON Linked Data, web identifiers can be assigned to every type and object. This way, instead of defining and identifying data locally (within the document), they can be defined and identified globally (on the internet).</p><p>Continuing from the earlier example, here is how JSON-LD could add web identifiers “on top” of the API documents:</p>  offeredProduct and vendor-productare both of the type <a href="https://schema.org/Product">https://schema.org/Product</a>.  Although assigned abc on one platform and xyz on another, the product’s unique web identifier is https://example.com/prod/123 and are in fact the same&nbsp;product.  Linked Data adds a layer of context, pointing data elements to unique web identifiers.<p>Linked Data deals with data rather than a particular document representation of the data. JSON-LD was invented to combine these two&nbsp;aspects.</p> Non-Breaking <p>The question you should now be asking is: “does this mean we need to rebuild our APIs?” The answer is a solid: No! JSON-LD works with a small set of keywords such as @id and @type, shown in the above example. In JSON, unknown elements are simply ignored, so these can be added to the exchanged documents and freely used or ignored by API users. Adding JSON-LD is a “non-breaking” change.</p> Semantic Vocabularies <p>We have established now how it is technically possible to make data much more expressive by applying URIs to API messages. The next topic to address is which URIs? The technical linkability isn’t worth much if I use https://my-product-definition.com and you use https://your-product-definition.com.</p><p>This is where semantic web vocabularies come into play. Earlier I referenced https://schema.org/Product, and <a href="https://schema.org">https://schema.org</a> is exactly such a vocabulary, providing many of the most used terms on the internet. Proper vocabularies should:</p>  Be static and not change established URIs because data definitions depend on&nbsp;them.  Have URIs resolve to human readable explanation of the defined&nbsp;term.  <p>Other vocabularies are targeting more focus domains. Noteworthy vocabularies specialized for supply chains&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/vocabulary/uncefact/">United Nations CEFACT, which defined terms and code lists used for international trade and transport</a>.  <a href="https://ref.gs1.org/epcis/">GS1 EPCIS, for visibility of product status, location, movement and chain of&nbsp;custody</a>.  <p>Agreeing on terms used is an essential part of any standard, akin to agreeing on which language to speak. The fact that the semantic layer can be added without breaking APIs makes this conversation much easier. Agreement is easier reached when neither party risks bothering their customers.</p> Business Case <p>Let us now move to some of the business cases considerations which I expect that you would now be rightfully contemplating. Under which circumstances might Linked Data make sense for industry adoption?</p> Who Pays, Who Benefits? <p>I will first discuss how better defined data logically switches the effort of interpretation from the data consumer to the data provider.</p><p>As a data provider, Linked Data lets&nbsp;me:</p>  Communicate unambiguously, expressing my data with explicit, uniquely identified semantic&nbsp;terms.  Pre-map data to globally understood terms in a serialization format with strong tool&nbsp;support.  <p>As a data consumer, Linked Data lets&nbsp;me:</p>  Receive data in computer readable form, which can be directly used and&nbsp;stored.  Understand the data directly, without human interpretation.  <p>The burden of “understanding” is shifted from the data receiver to the data sender. The clarity of the sender obviously benefits the receiver.</p><p>For an API with only a single sender and a single receiver, this clarity can arguably be established more efficiently by traditional system integration where data models are manually mapped to each other. However, such one-to-one APIs are rare, and there isn’t much “API economy” about it. Platform and pipeline business cases are typically based on scaling business partners and/or customers. So with this in mind, let’s consider some cases where the investment in concise and expressive data pays&nbsp;off.</p> Many Data Providers <p>Let’s imagine there are 1000 providers of data to a platform. Establishing 1000 data mapping projects would be insanely expensive in consulting costs. Not to mention maintaining them. Here, requesting the data providers to be expressive and computer readable is practically a&nbsp;must.</p><p>Case</p><p>This is literally how Google search works. Search indexes are built not from interpretation of page content, but from terms expressed explicitly by the page owner, defining their own content. A Google recipe is indexed and rendered from linked data terms such as <a href="https://schema.org/recipeCuisine">https://schema.org/recipeCuisine</a> and <a href="https://schema.org/cookTime.">https://schema.org/cookTime.</a></p>How to explicitly tell Google that this page is about an Apple Pie recipe. (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/introstructured-data)<p>Comparative situations exist throughout supply chains, logistics and commerce: customs declarations to a single window, credit checks to a financial institution, shipping instructions to a carrier, purchase orders to a manufacturer or ecommerce platform. These are all examples of large groups of participants expressing data, passing it to platforms. As long as they point at, say, <a href="https://schema.org/Order,">https://schema.org/Order,</a> their differing data representation does not&nbsp;matter.</p> Many Data Receivers <p>Now let’s consider the reverse situation, 1000 receivers of data from a platform. Everyone has to learn and understand what the platform’s data&nbsp;means.</p><p>Case</p><p>EDI, which is so prevalent in supply chains, is the perfect anti-pattern. An EDI endpoint comes with an “implementation guide”, which is a document which a human is expected to read to make sense and map the codes of the EDI messages. Manual integration efforts are assumed, perceived as the solution.</p>Sample page from an EDI Implementation Guide. No human should suffer such pain. (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-C13-0d00b8dcbbecadc6e1609edf97e9a0b6/pdf/GOVPUB-C13-0d00b8dcbbecadc6e1609edf97e9a0b6.pdf)<p>A monopoly might get away with this kind of “read the spec” attitude, but most often you want to make integration as seamless as possible. Granted, modern API specs (“swaggers”) are friendlier than EDI implementation guides. But it is still based on the premise of “here is how you should interpret my language”. By overlaying the platform’s API with Linked Data, any of your customer or business partners with LD capabilities can plug the platform data stream directly into their operational environment.</p><p>Industry specific examples of this include manufacturer or ecommerce product listings, carriers’ bills of lading, and trade certifications from inspectors, chambers and other organizations.</p> Knowledge Graphs <p>Sprinkling some URIs over JSON documents may seem rather simple — and it is. Yet, it is all that is needed to reveal that data on one API is in fact the same as on another API, despite differing nomenclature.</p><p>This opens up a whole new world of data analytics. JSON-LD implements the Resource Description Framework, which is a first order logic data representation, opening up the world of Data Science. Graphs of data, so-called Knowledge Graphs, can be built from the linked data elements. These can be stored in modern graph databases and directly subjected to massively powerful graph algorithms, revealing connections, outliers, patterns, inconsistencies hidden as implicit connections within the data, turning them into explicit, actionable ones.</p><p>The downstream Machine Learning which Linked Data enables deserves dedicated attention, and I promise to follow up soon with a blog post specifically on this&nbsp;topic.</p> Conclusion <p>Linked Data is in much broader use than most people realize, but its value has not yet bubbled up to industries which are still transitioning to API-based digitization. JSON-LD extends this, with the promise of greatly simplifying API integrations, while paving the way to data graph analytics. In all but the most simple cases, there is good business justification for adopting JSON-LD to lower your or your customers’ integration complexities. Supply chains in particular stand to benefit from this, being connected networks and spanning a heterogeneous, international set of languages, jurisdictions and&nbsp;models.</p><p>Transmute holds editor roles on essential open source Linked Data projects including:</p>  <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2022-05/017_EDI-API_Linked-data-vocab.pdf">UN/CEFACT semantic vocabulary</a>  <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/">W3C Traceability Vocabulary</a>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers Specification</a>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credentials v2.0 Specification</a>   About Transmute <p>The author is editor of the United Nations CEFACT Vocabulary, which expresses the prevalent supply chain semantic model on the as referenceable web URIs.

<p>2022 is set to witness a FIFA World Cup like no other. We are less than 2 weeks away from the world-famous tournament, where 32 nations are all set to compete in the winter months of November and December for a chance to lift the famous Jules Rimet trophy. This will be the final World Cup tournament to feature 32 teams before its scheduled expansion to 48 teams in 2026.</p>



<p>Significantly, this is the first time the tournament has taken place in the Middle East and is the first time the event will be held during the winter. Although it will be held in the comparatively cooler winter months (with temperatures around 30C vs 40C+ in June and July), every stadium will have air conditioning, and there will be increased water breaks to help players stay rehydrated.</p>



<p>The competition is anticipated to be as intense off the field, as operators compete to grab the attention of bettors with the best possible customer onboarding and betting experience.</p>



<p>There are, however, a number of challenges that operators must meet before they can begin to welcome new customers.</p>



 Sustaining interest: Long run of matches in a short period. 



<p>To adjust to the World Cup’s winter scheduling, the Premier League season began a week earlier, at the beginning of August, and will break before the World Cup commences. The Premier League season will then pick up where it left off, almost immediately after the World Cup ends. That is a long stretch of football mania for fans, players, and UK gambling operators. Sustaining the bettor’s interest throughout this extended period could prove to be challenging.</p>



<p>Operators will also require a strong customer acquisition strategy since players may be distracted during the Christmas holidays.</p>



<p>Since the 2022 World Cup has a reduced timeframe of only 28 days, numerous matches will be held in a short time, however, just because a sportsbook has gained a new customer during the World Cup doesn’t mean they will place multiple bets throughout the tournament. This was demonstrated on the <a href="https://www.kambi.com/qatar-2022-what-a-winter-world-cup-means-for-sports-betting/">Kambi network during the Euro 2020 tournament</a>, when 78% of new players bet on the event when given a coupon, but only 76% returned for a second bet during the same event.</p>



<p>Customer acquisition and retention after a big tournament are crucial to successful sportsbooks. The timing of this year’s World Cup creates a real opportunity for operators to capitalize on. Indeed, when the World Cup ends on December 18, the Premier League is scheduled to resume a week later, on December 26, allowing for a much shorter window for player retention compared to Euro 2020, which had a gap of over a month.</p>



 Unique operational challenges for gambling operators. 



<p>The extreme Qatar heat, combined with the crammed football schedule before and after the Qatar World Cup is likely to lead to an increased risk of player injuries.</p>



<p>Offering a stable and scalable betting experience during an uncertain World Cup will therefore be crucial for retaining bettors and keeping their interest after the tournament ends.</p>



<p>The last thing sportsbooks need is for consumers to try their platform – whether they are solid bet builders or player props – only to lose interest and vanish when the World Cup ends.</p>



<p>On the plus side, since the Qatar 2022 World Cup is being held during the winter, sandwiched between Premier League games, and followed by Champions League knockout phases, it could be advantageous from an upselling perspective, with increased opportunities to retain customers, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/a-wintertime-world-cup-and-its-impact-on-online-betting/">increased betting activity</a>.</p>



<p>The worldwide tournament offers operators a unique opportunity to optimize their platforms and provide team and player-specific content, allowing customers to place bets on various football markets.</p>



<p>Operators that can offer a great customer onboarding experience, and a product that delivers a wide variety of markets and an outstanding level of combinability, are perfectly positioned to benefit from the opportunities at the World Cup and beyond.</p>



 Festive financial commitments may keep bettors away. 



<p>The World Cup tournament’s unique scheduling during the winter holiday season brings about increased competition for customers’ funds.</p>



<p>As most bettors may prefer to stay indoors to watch the World Cup tournament this winter, sportsbooks may experience an inflow of online players. That said, since the sporting event will happen so close to the Christmas holidays, operators may also experience a decrease in numbers. The reduction in numbers may be linked to bettors choosing to allocate their funds elsewhere due to the festive expectations of parties, gifts, and increasing heating costs, etc.</p>

 How to prepare for Qatar 2022 as a gambling operator 



<p>As sportsbooks will be focusing on new markets and a (possibly) smaller pool of customers this World Cup season, they must ensure their services are competitive, if not the best.</p>



<p>As new users in particular will not want to complete a long, arduous sign-up process, operators must make the onboarding experience as intuitive, streamlined, and safe as possible. New users tend to abandon a product because it’s either too complicated to register, they don’t understand the product, or they do not get value from it.</p>



<p>Gambling operators endure many challenges, such as risks of fraud, underage gambling, regulatory compliance, and offering a safe and smooth onboarding process for new users.</p>



<p>IDnow streamlines the onboarding process of gambling platforms. Bettors must simply scan their identity documents via a mobile device and AutoIdent automatically does the rest, processing the data and verifying identities within a matter of minutes.</p>



<p>IDnow’s AI-powered identity verification tool, AutoIdent is compliant with regulations across 195 countries and offers coverage in over 30 languages.</p>



<p>Download our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2022-fifa-world-cup-gambling-operators/">‘The Fifa World Cup 2022 is just around the corner’</a> guide to discover how identity-proofing technology enables gambling operators to offer a safe, secure and friction-less experience for bettors, new and old.</p>

Layer 2&nbsp;concept<p>Layer 2 refers to an auxiliary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain. To confirm a transaction that occurred in a specific framework/protocol, it can be defined as a Layer 2 solution by referencing the data of the existing blockchain (Layer 1) or when transaction data recording is required in Layer 1 for transaction confirmation.</p><p>The chain can solve the scalability problem by reducing the data burden given to Layer 1 because the chain records only the result value in Layer 1 after performing calculation/transaction record/transaction verification in a separate layer above the Layer 1 blockchain.</p><p>For example, in Fig 1., the user does not record their transaction (100 USDC remittance) directly in Layer 1 but performs the transaction in Layer 2, and a third aggregator communicates with other transactions. Records Layer 2 transactions in Layer 1 in compressed form (the recording method differs depending on the Layer 2 solution&nbsp;method).</p><p>Layer 2 solutions can be broadly classified into Channels, Sidechains, and Rollups. In this post, we will analyze each Layer 2 solution.</p> 2. Layer 2&nbsp;solution  2. 1&nbsp;Channel <p>A channel creates a private channel between parties carrying out transactions, conducting transactions on that channel, and recording the final transaction result value in Layer 1. In addition, a set of rules needs to be predefined for transaction reliability.</p><p>Channels can be classified into two main categories: status channels and payment channels, which are generalized versions, while payment channels are limited to payment-related applications. Figure 2 is an example of a state&nbsp;channel.</p>Fig 2. Example of&nbsp;channel<p>Assume that a channel that performs round 2 is opened. At this time, Bob sends 100 USDC in Round 1 and receives 70 FTM; in Round 2 sends 40 FTM and receives 50 USDC. Finally, 50 USDC and 30 FTM become the state values for Bob, and 50 USDC and 40 FTM become the state values for Alice. Even though two transactions have occurred, the intermediate transaction process is entrusted to the private channel, and only the final transaction result value is recorded in the Layer 1 blockchain.</p><p>Since transaction reliability is fully obtained through an agreement between the channel parties, securing transaction reliability within the channel is essential. In addition, since it is necessary to establish a private trading channel between participants, it is difficult for many participants to participate.</p> 2.1 SideChains <p>Sidechains transfer assets/states in Layer 1 to Sidechains and perform transactions within the sidechain. For example, assuming you have 100 ETH in the Ethereum chain, transfer 50 ETH to the Sidechain and complete the transaction within the Sidechain. When the transaction in Sidechain is closed, the remaining assets can be transferred back to Layer 1 after the transaction is closed. For this, a bridge is required to allow the mutual movement of assets. Fig 3. is an example of a Sidechain.</p>Fig 3. Example of SideChains<p>In Fig 3., Bob moves 100 USDC in Layer 1 to his sidechain account. The above deposit transaction is written in Layer 1, and Bob’s assets in Layer 1 decrease. Referring to Fig 3., the above-deposited USDC is sent to Alice in the sidechain, and 150 USDC is received from Alice afterward, so Bob has 50 USDC in the sidechain. After that, 50 USDC can be withdrawn to Layer&nbsp;1.</p><p>As mentioned above, moving Layer 1 assets to Layer 2 and performing transactions is called a sidechain. A sidechain is characterized by the need for trust in the sidechain, just like the state channel. The difference is that while rules agreed upon by the parties determine the state channel’s reliability, the sidechain is determined by the consensus algorithm of each&nbsp;chain.</p> 2.3 Rollup <p>Suppose the state channel and sidechain were a method of processing the intermediate process of a specific transaction at Layer 2 and recording the final result value at Layer 1. In that case, the rollup records all transactions occurring at Layer 2 in a compressed form at Layer&nbsp;1.</p><p>For example, all transactions in Layer 2 are committed to a short value (ex. SHA256 Hash function) cryptographically, and only compressed commitments and final state values are periodically recorded in Layer 1. At this time, the reliability of transaction aggregation is required to ensure that the correct Layer 2 transaction is recorded in Layer 1, which can be classified into Optimistic Rollup and zk-Rollup depending on how the above reliability is guaranteed.</p><p>Optimistic Rollup</p><p>Optimistic Rollup is a method of trusting the results of Layer 2 transaction compression and post-validating by participants for invalid rollups. Optimistic Rollup does not require much computing cost to compress transactions. However, the disadvantage is that it requires more than a week to finalize transactions because it requires time to post verification for invalid&nbsp;rollups.</p>Fig 4. Optimistic Rollup<p>Optimistic Rollup verifies the compression results afterward, so the rollup node that performed the invalid compression is penalized, and the user who finds the illegal transaction gets a certain&nbsp;reward.</p><p>zk-Rollup</p><p>Unlike Optimistic Rollup, zk-Rollup does not post-verify the Rollup results but is a method of recording after verification. Zk-Rollup uses Zero-knowledge proof technology that can prove the validity of the information without revealing the information.</p><p>A simple example of proof of knowledge is to prove that I can pay 10,000 won, but whether I have ten 1,000 won bills or two 5,000 won bills. It should be understood as a technique for proving without revealing. Replacing the proposition “I have 10,000 won” with the request “If you compress all Layer 2 transactions, you will get the A state value” is proof of&nbsp;Rollup.</p><p>Zk-Rollup is performed as follows. When a transaction first occurs at Layer 2, the Rollup node responsible for Rollup performs transaction compression and generates a zero-knowledge proof value for the entire chain of compression processes. Specifically, the input is layer 2 of a specific period, and the output is a SHA256 hash value that proves a function expression using zero-knowledge proof technology.</p><p>Rollup verification does not check all transaction results like Optimistic Rollup but verifies the attached zero-knowledge proof, so immediate transaction confirmation is possible. However, it has the disadvantage of requiring a lot of computing cost since it requires proof values for the compression process.</p><p>Figure 5 is an example of a zk-rollup.</p>Fig 5. zk-Rollup<p>Referring to Fig. 5, the Rollup server in charge of Rollup compresses Layer 2 transactions and generates zero-knowledge proofs for all compression processes. A miner who records a rollup transaction in Layer 1 can check the validity of the zero-knowledge proof and record the compression result and the zero-knowledge proof value in Layer&nbsp;1.</p><p>In this article, we have covered various Layer 2 solutions. Although each solution has advantages and disadvantages, research on Rollup is generally being actively conducted. Rollup technology differs from other solutions because it can compress and process multiple transactions into one transaction and ensure data availability. Among them, zk-Rollup is attracting more attention because it can ensure rapid transaction confirmation and expand the stage of transaction compression to the compression of the blockchain itself.</p><p>Research groups such as Polygon and Starkware are researching the modularization of blockchain and blockchain capacity compression through zk-Rollup. Modularization and capacity compression, as described above, are expected to be efficient ways to solve the scalability problem in Ethereum. Therefore, Metadium is considering R&amp;D on Layer 2 blockchain applications through close cooperation with the zk-Rollup research&nbsp;group.</p> References   <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/">Optimistic Rollups | ethereum.org</a>  <a href="https://www.web3.university/article/sidechains-vs-layer2s">Ethereum Sidechains vs Layer 2s: What's the Difference?</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/layer-2-blockchain-analysis-50270a8a4989">Layer 2 Blockchain Analysis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
