  A currency gains value from its use — call it Community Contributed Value  National currencies aggregate this contributed value and centralize the benefit to the government and adjacent&nbsp;actors  People see this, and Community Currencies have been attempted to capture this value locally, instead of sending it on to financial centers and&nbsp;capitals  Community Currency experiments have generally failed for various reasons — difficulty of creation/use, lack of transparency or auditability, moral hazard, lack of immediate convertibility, instability of value, inability to see, measure and capture Community Contributed Value  Blockchains have shown a pathway to overcome some, but not all, of these roadblocks; until now, no successful local currency projects on blockchain  A new set of blockchain protocols has emerged in the Verus Project, which is developing rent-free public blockchain infrastructure — use of these open protocols allows for low risk, low cost experiments such as Community Currencies that overcome traditional roadblocks  Without programming, a community can quickly create a made to suit local currency that is easy to use, is transparent and auditable, defeats moral hazard, allows for instant conversion into other currencies, has a stable and predictable value, and can measure and capture Community Contributed Value, to be used for the betterment of the community  Adding intelligent namespaces to Community Currencies gives the potential to experiment with additional value enhancing opportunities, creating digital goods economies attached to the Community Currency  At this time, Verus is a project where developers are focussed on the core protocols. Rolling out a Community Currency for broad use would still require some additional work on user-facing apps.   The Problem <p>Like any other good, money is ruled by the laws of supply and demand. A currency in high use requires a constant float of supply to be circulating through its system. In the case of a fiat currency, the demand for holders to hold the currency gives it its value. In other words, as users of a currency, we collectively give value to that currency by our use. For something like the United States Dollar, its value comes from use in its domestic economy, as the global reserve currency, as the petrodollar, as the primary numeraire in financial markets, as the base currency for most foreign and corporate debt, as a predominant store of value, etc. etc. If we live in the United States and we zoom in, looking at our own local community, we can see that we are providing some small fraction of value to the overall value of the USD through our community’s aggregate use and holdings. However small that might be in relation to the global forces of supply and demand, it might still be a relatively large amount of value when considered from the community’s point of view. Little work has been done in quantifying this actual value provided by a community through its demand for a prevailing currency, but new technical tools might allow us to see this more clearly through actual experience. That’s what this sample case study is about — let’s call this value created by a community, “Community Contributed Value”.</p><p>Observing this in the world today, the first thing we see is that, at the local level, we have zero control of our own Community Contributed Value, nor do we experience much, if any, local benefit from it. The aggregate of all Community Contributed Value, worldwide, is centralized in the hands of the US government. In the fiat period, as the master of the global reserve currency, the US government has proven that this aggregate value is enormous, allowing the government and country to run persistently high budget and trade deficits, and expand the money supply at will, while still maintaining a strong&nbsp;dollar.</p><p>In addition, although specific research is hard to find on this issue, it does seem as if powerful private forces that are adjacent to the United States Government, such as Wall Street and the Defense Industry, are conferred certain advantages through their proximity to the controller of the USD. Connected and powerful people and corporations may be, directly or indirectly, tapping into this Community Contributed Value.</p> Solutions — pre-Blockchain <p>All of this is obvious enough to have given rise to a long history of efforts to start local community currencies, to keep some of this contributed value in the community. Prior to the development of the blockchain, these efforts really seem to have been doomed from the start. Currency issuance in the paper money world is difficult to control and has huge security and moral hazard issues (counterfeit, over-issuance, etc). These currencies cannot easily be made transparent, or auditable. The funds can’t be reasonably saved or protected in banks. There is no plausible way to have readily available conversion at market rates between the community currency and the USD, nor is it plausible to keep a local currency at a stable and predictable value. For users, using community currency was hard, and for communities, making community currency was hard — and so, except for a handful (or less), every effort ran&nbsp;aground.</p> Solutions — in the Dawn of the Blockchain Era <p>Interest in community currencies perked up in the blockchain era, as it became clear that auditable, transparent tokens could be created at will (eg. ERC-20s), and the tokens could be securely stored and controlled through digital wallets. Bitcoin itself is an example of a type of community contributed value, where demand to use and hold gives it its value, to the benefit of a worldwide virtual community of early adopters. Ease of creation and use has been enhanced as against paper currencies, at least for the technically adept. Still, no longstanding successful cases of broad local community use have emerged. In fact some, such as CityCoins, have been notorious failures.</p><p>It seems that auditability, transparency and digital wallets are not enough. Other key issues&nbsp;are:</p>  community currencies still require some sophisticated engineering capability to implement  there is no method for easy, reliable convertibility into the prevailing fiat currency, nor can conversion rates hope to be predictable or stable, even in the short&nbsp;term  there is no easy way to safely and measurably capture the Community Contributed Value  there are no additional enhancements to community or the currency through attached digital goods and a new digital goods&nbsp;economy   New Solutions — Bancor; Verus, public blockchains as a&nbsp;service <p>It is likely that, were these problems solved, and ease of digital wallet use addressed (along with personal privacy), motivated communities would find it far easier to bootstrap use of a community currency {“CommCurr”}. Imagine being able to spend your CommCurr anywhere in the community, from the babysitter to the gas station to the bank, and have it accepted with ease because the recipient knows that they can convert it easily and immediately, and without a counterparty, at the push of a button, to the USD, on a 1:1 basis (or very near thereabouts). And if community members could measurably observe the amount of Community Contributed Value that was emerging through widespread and persistent use, CommCurr would be easy to promote, and hard to&nbsp;resist.</p><p>One of the best efforts to deal with convertibility in community currencies is the project Bancor. They pioneered onchain reserves as part of a currency’s definition, dynamically expanding and retracting supply, tied to use, and the ability to convert directly to and from other currencies, using locked onchain reserves as a fractional backing. This proof of concept has existed since the first version of Bancor, as a smart contract capability on Ethereum. For any community, each particular implementation of a smart contract would need to be designed, engineered and audited by experts, in this case Bancor developers. But Bancor is a heavily funded venture business at root, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an ICO. Development of community currencies doesn’t pay, unlike commercially-driven defi, so Bancor soon abandoned any focus in this&nbsp;area.</p><p>At about the same time as Bancor emerged, former Microsoft fellow Michael Toutonghi, and some associates, released a vision paper focused on making public blockchain infrastructure that can be used by the world. Inspired by bitcoin’s approach to re-imagining money, they aimed for the development of usable blockchain primitives that could form the basis of distributed network applications that provide people a real chance of self-sovereignty and new ways to self-organize in many areas of&nbsp;life.</p><p>They began developing software and protocols, basing off Bitcoin and Zcash, and bootstrapped a worldwide network of self-interested miners and stakers who power a network that is capable of providing public blockchain infrastructure. Fast forward five years, and a good portion of the network has been running for years, providing the first parts of the system. Now, the rest of the full vision (and more) is about to transition from testnet to mainnet, and new capabilities for blockchain are about to become publicly available, including the ability to run advanced Community Currency experiments that are virtually risk-free for communities, can be carried out at low cost, and have several elements that will make them attractive and safe for broad community use.</p><p>Two key points to note about the Verus protocols, software and network&nbsp;are:</p>  no venture capitalists or investors have been involved in its financing or development, so there is no need to extract rent or payment from users to pay back investors — it is rent-free technology, the only payments necessary are network fees to provide sufficient incentive for outsiders to provide their compute resources to power the network;&nbsp;and  Verus does not use smart contracts — it is based on more traditional and longstanding distributed computing paradigms, and users access the software for basic primitives, which they then put into use and combine however they see fit. No contract programming or special blockchain engineering skill is required to carry out sophisticated actions. Recently, on the Verus testnet, one community member (a non-programmer) implemented a powerful community currency example in less than ten minutes with a few simple commands.   Currency Reserves — Convertibility <p>Verus provides the ability to define new tokens/currencies at will, without programming. Various options are available, as tokens carry a multitude of possible uses, from voting to tickets to currencies. For community currency experiments, one of the key options is to lock in reserves that are attached to, and back the value of, the newly issued currency. And, since Verus is bridgeable to and from the Ethereum network, you could back a new currency with ethereum or USDC or any other valuable currency from that&nbsp;network.</p><p>If a CommCurr is defined with reserves backing it, then users can freely mint new currency by converting their USDC, for example, directly to CommCurr. This would build up the locked reserves of CommCurr. Or, they could go the other way around, converting CommCurr into USDC immediately by converting it into its reserves, without any need to find a counterparty. This would reduce the locked reserves. The conversion rate in these situations is driven by Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, similar to Uniswap, although providing a MEV-resistant fair conversion experience for all users at the lowest possible&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Reserve backing in the Verus protocols is user-selected upon the creation of a currency, ranging from a 5% backing to a 100% backing, Multiple currencies, with arbitrarily selected weights can be used. There is a requirement to use the Verus coin as at least one of the currencies backing CommCurr, or any currency — it needs to represent at least 5% of the backing. This is due to interoperability goals, to ensure that networks built using the Verus protocols stay connected, as a worldwide network of value, where currencies connect to each other throughout.</p><p>These few simple options make for a host of use cases, which will not all be explored here. Instead, we’ll focus on CommCurr and note that a decent implementation might have backing consisting of two currencies — USD (represented by USDC bridged from the Ethereum network), and Verus, weighted 95:5 in favor of&nbsp;USD.</p><p>As a result of having valuable reserves, CommCurr is guaranteed to be valuable, and users can instantly convert in and out of it by simply sending it to themselves, or another person, choosing a conversion option. If a user sends USD and receives CommCurr then the reserves for USD will go up, and two things will happen to CommCurr — it will issue a little bit of new supply, and its value will go up. On the other hand, if a user goes the other way, sending CommCurr for USD, then some CommCurr supply will be automatically burned, and the value of CommCurr will decrease a little. In other words, CommCurr has a dynamically expanding and retracting supply, and a floating conversion rate, depending on the demand for the currency.</p> Capturing the Contributed Value <p>When creating CommCurr the best way to capture value for the community will be to create the currency so that it is only partially backed. For this sample case study, let’s say it’s backed at 80%. A community can easily engineer this precise amount of backing (which never changes, as a percentage, through the life of the currency) by choosing an initial supply of CommCurr, say 1 million, and then contributing 760,000 USD as reserves, and 40,000 dollars worth of Verus as reserves. We’ll avoid going into detailed mechanics here but the result would be that, upon the launch of the currency, the community currency issuer would own 1,000,000 CommCurr, which is 80% backed by real value, but is convertible, as its initial price to acquire or to sell, 1:1 with the&nbsp;USD.</p><p>Now, as we described above, if the issuer just starts converting their initial holdings of CommCurr (1 million units) into USD, they’ll start depleting the reserves and driving down the value of the currency. In fact, if they just dumped it all, they’d get all their initially contributed reserves back and the currency would be rendered virtually worthless. So, instead of doing that, they’ll encourage use by the community. Perhaps they’ll simply promote its use, or maybe they’ll offer small discounts on community services, and encourage others to do so, to bootstrap use. The overall idea would be to encourage use by the community at large. If use emerges, and people start to acquire the currency (by contributing USD into the reserves), and the issuing community does not sell any of its initial holdings, the value of CommCurr will begin to creep up (provided that not all of this currency is immediately converted back by the recipients). Under these circumstances, It should be easy enough for community members to become comfortable with the value of CommCurr, as they see that it can always be acquired and disposed for USD, immediately, and at a predictable and stable price. It’s important to note that if the issuing community doesn’t sell/convert any of its holdings it is *impossible* that the value of CommCurr would fall below its initial value of 1:1 vis-a-vis the&nbsp;USD.</p><p>If regular use persists, there will be constant demand for the currency and a certain float will begin to remain in circulation. In our example, let’s say the community reaches the point where 100,000 CommCurr is more or less always outstanding, in some form of transit circulating through, or being held by, the community. This would tend to increase the value of CommCurr some amount. But, instead of allowing the currency to appreciate, the Community could begin to draw down on some of the 1,000,000 of initial supply that it holds in its reserves. In fact, in this example, they’d need to convert 100,000 of that supply into USD just to keep the price pegged 1:1 with the&nbsp;USD.</p><p>So now we would have an exact measure of Community Contributed Value — in this case it’s 20% of $100,000 = $20,000. If the demand in the community created a persistent float of $1 million, the issuer could draw down their entire supply converting it into USD, and it would still be backed at its original amount, and still be convertible 1:1 with&nbsp;USD..</p> No Free Lunch (well, maybe a free appetizer) <p>Did the issuer just make $1 million? No. Remember they had to commit $800,000 of value in the first place to set this up. And, although that investment is never at risk (they can always just convert everything into the reserves at any time to recoup them), there is a certain upfront capital cost there. However, they did clearly make $200,000, which, in this case would be a measurable amount of Community Contributed Value that they captured. There are also some minimal network costs to set this up on the Verus network, which is paid to the miners and stakers, as block rewards, for mining the Verus blockchain, and powering all the community’s transactions. At current rates, it would amount to less than $200. Overall, the cost/risk/reward matrix is attractive.</p><p>It is important to remember that all of this is transparent and auditable, being on a public blockchain. Community members would be in instant possession of all relevant information about currency supplies, reserves, spending, conversion, etc. by the CommCurr creators.</p><p>Community members would have transparency on their spending too, which is unfortunate. However, as a fork of zcash, Verus does offer private transactions on its native currency, Verus, and so there would be methods for users (or preferably, their apps) to help protect the spending privacy of community members.</p> Governance <p>There are other blockchain primitives that Verus enables which enhance CommCurr as an attractive and low-risk method to create Community Contributed Value. First, the protocols allow for virtually unlimited flexibility with respect to the governance of who is in control of the initial holdings of CommCurr. Multiple signatures could be required, up to, for example, 13 of 25, to authorize any spending or conversion activity. This would allow for fairly sophisticated approval mechanisms and safeguards for communities that are implementing this type of experiment.</p> Moral Hazard — Escrow <p>Another blockchain primitive is the ability to provably and irrevocably lock digital wallets for an arbitrary period of time (up to 21 years). In this way, a community issuer could reduce concerns about the moral hazard of dumping their holdings and crushing the value of a growing CommCurr. They can choose to stagger escrows, making, say, 10% freely spendable now, and then unlocking 10% a year after that. One aspect to consider is that, if a lock is made irrevocable, it will build in capital cost risk for a community. Ie. if the experiment is a failure and there’s no adoption, they wouldn’t have access to their original capital until the unlock period&nbsp;passes.</p> Wait, There’s More — Enhancing the Community Currency through New Capabilities for a Digital Goods Economy that Directly and Tangibly Benefits the&nbsp;Currency <p>Possibly the most forward-thinking element of a Community Currency is the ability to build a real digital goods economy around it. The Verus protocols make this possible through the issuance of what are called SubIDs. SubIDs are multi-use friendly name “identities”. Community members can register these names by paying a set amount of CommCurr, for example, 10 CommCurr per registration. This increases the value of CommCurr because any amounts paid for the “identities” are burned, thus increasing the value of the currency for all holders thereof (including the original&nbsp;issuer).</p><p>Community members might seek to register identities for many&nbsp;reasons:</p>  to signal support for the community  to have a recognizable or branded community-oriented name to receive funds, eg. “member.CommCurr@”  to create a NFT or public profile attached to the name (“identities” are capable of being expressed as nfts, artwork, public profiles, etc.)  to be a ticket for an event or a discount code for purchases, or a membership in a&nbsp;club  To be attached to a physical item, like a community landmark, where it can represent a public profile or description, fundraiser, message board,&nbsp;etc.  <p>These are just some of the virtually unlimited examples of digital goods that could be created, all of which would require CommCurr to acquire, this creating a real demand for the currency.</p> Conclusions <p>These are new blockchain capabilities. They do not currently exist on Ethereum or other smart contract blockchains because the interplay of such different elements would seem to create overwhelming complexity, requiring the use of multiple inter-operating contracts to implement. Certainly, such comprehensive and flexible solutions could not be carried out in minutes through the use of a few simple commands.</p><p>Currently, all of these capabilities exist in the Verus protocols and are in use on testnet. A mainnet activation is imminent, and communities can soon start to experiment, at the smallest initial scales they desire. It’s important to note, however, that additional software development would be required to make some of these elements easy and safe to use for the broader community. As a FOSS project, Verus encourages communities to work together, and with the Verus developer community to create open source apps that leverage the protocols, so that all communities worldwide can benefit from the resulting development.</p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discuss and explore all Verus has to offer on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/community-currencies-a-case-study-to-explore-new-technical-possibilities-ede897433b55">Community Currencies: A Case Study to Explore New Technical Possibilities</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 How <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum’s</a> cutting edge legaltech innovations solve the problems of trust and ownership on the blockchain <p>Actor and producer Seth Green has been an avid collector of NFTs and recently teased a trailer for a TV show called White Horse Tavern at the NFT conference VeeCon. This seems to be a sitcom based on the premise “What if your friendly neighbourhood bartender was Bored Ape Yacht Club #8398?” and is meant to be based on one of the Bored Apes Green owns. Or should I say “owned”; Bored Ape Yacht Club #8398 and the related IP that would have made White Horse Tavern possible are no longer owned by Green. He got caught out by a phishing scam in early May that ended up with someone swiping Bored Ape Yacht Club #8398 as well as two Mutant Apes and a Doodle, and has been reduced to pleading on Twitter with “DarkWing84”, who bought his Ape from the scammer, for its return so he can go forward with his&nbsp;plans.</p><p>This highlights intrinsic weaknesses with NFT trades; when you buy something you just have to trust the seller that what they are telling you about the thing is true; that it hasn’t been stolen and it is theirs to sell. Also, when you do have an NFT stolen, because blockchain transactions cannot be undone and there is no authority in charge, there is not much you can do to get your NFT or your money back. But what if it didn’t have to be that way? <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> have created a system that uses NFTs linked to physical objects or IP that is backed by warranties that have real legal force, allowing for disputes to be arbitrated in courts that understand the technology and whose judgements are legally enforceable in all 165 jurisdictions that are signatories to the 1958 New York Convention on Arbitration.</p><p>So, how does this actually work? There are increasing numbers of organisations starting to offer NFTs linked to physical objects, but none have done the in-depth legal groundwork that<a href="https://mattereum.com/"> Mattereum</a> has. This means that purchasers no longer have to just trust the seller of an NFT — experts, not just sellers, provide warranties around the facts in the NFT, with multiple experts combining to effectively create “mini DAOs” around the assets they warrant, maximising certainty and increasing the value of assets. When an expert provides a warranty to an asset in the <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> system, they back it with a financial stake which is legally enforceable, in other words they are saying “if what I say here proves to be wrong, I will pay the purchaser x% of the value of the asset”. The seller also warranties the item, so if it proves not to be theirs to sell, or they otherwise misrepresent it, they face financial and legal consequences. This provides a powerful incentive for everyone to tell the truth about an asset. It is even possible for an expert to come along and add an <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/adversarial-certification-how-mattereum-asset-passports-express-doubt-and-disagreement-2eb9e575a964">adversarial warranty</a> to an asset, disputing the facts put forward by other experts, so a potential purchaser can see there are doubts and make their purchasing decisions accordingly. Warranties are put together in a <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> Asset Passport (MAP) for each asset, secured cryptographically, and may be backed by insurance as&nbsp;well.</p><p>All NFT sales involve smart contracts, but a smart contract is not a legally binding agreement, it is merely a set of instructions based on what is defined in an agreement. If the underlying legal contracts are weak, the NFT could be compromised. <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> goes further and uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_contract">Ricardian Contracts</a> which provide very, very strong protections for NFT buyers. These were invented in 1995 by <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> Chief Scientist and financial crypto pioneer Ian Grigg and are a legally binding natural language smart contract. A Ricardian Contract turns law into code, which deals with the complexities of interpretation that arise from the rigidity and limitations of using code to express basic contract and relational terms. A Ricardian Contract exists in both human- and machine-readable format, requiring no coding expertise. They are electronically signed and recorded on the blockchain; cryptographic signatures bind parties, define intentions and execute instructions automatically. This means that if there is a dispute among the parties involved, the case can be resolved in court or through arbitration.</p><p>Even better, the new <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> Trustable NFT provides another layer of protection to NFT buyers. In the UK there has been a serious push on upgrading the legal provisions for handling disputes over digital assets. The UK Jurisdiction Taskforce’s new <a href="https://35z8e83m1ih83drye280o9d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lawtech_DDRR_Final.pdf">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> establish the procedures for parties to contest things like who actually owns a particular NFT. If the NFT smart contract includes special procedures for legal disputes, in the UK the arbitrator (and no other party — not even the company that issued the NFT) has legal and technical capacity to transfer the ownership of the NFT without creating any new legal liability for any party. In short: you can go to a private court, plead your case, and if the NFT is a <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> Trustable NFT, you can get your digital property back. This legal provision is enforceable under international law in 165 jurisdictions. So, if Seth’s Ape had been linked to one of these, he’d have been able to get it back, no problem. We feel this is absolutely necessary for the evolution of the NFT field as more and more valuable IP and physical assets are bound to NFTs. BAYC, if you’d like to add this feature to future drops, <a href="https://mattereum.com/contact-us/">get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p><p>As a result, if you buy an NFT that has been created through the <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> system you know the information about it is likely to be true, and if it isn’t there is a built-in path to legal redress. If someone steals your NFT you can put an <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/adversarial-certification-how-mattereum-asset-passports-express-doubt-and-disagreement-2eb9e575a964">adversarial warranty</a> on it to that effect and take legal action to have it returned to you. That way, no one can make a monkey out of you over your Ape collection.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/so-someone-stole-your-ape-4bfc32a4faeb">So, Someone Stole Your Ape….</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

You won’t be able to make a fortune, but you can definitely earn a few dozens of bucks a month to cover some of your purchases.</p><p>Below, we have listed some of the best apps to help you earn money passively if you don’t mind revealing your personal information.</p> 20 Apps That Pay You for Your&nbsp;Data  1. DataCoup — Share Your Social Media&nbsp;Data <p>Whether you believe it or not, your social network information is already out there. So, why not get compensated for&nbsp;it?</p><p><a href="https://www.datacoup.com/">DataCoup</a> bills itself as the “world’s first personal data marketplace” and the “only firm that allows you to sell your data for real, cold hard&nbsp;cash.”</p><p>It is a service that pays you for access to your social media accounts, including Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, and LinkedIn. While this might sound horrible, it’s not as bad. They’re not interested in your personal information. Instead, they’re interested in the type of content you look at and are interested in. Because this is the kind of information that businesses pay to&nbsp;learn.</p><p>You have complete control over the information you share, and the more social media profiles you connect to your Datacoup account, the more money you get to bag every&nbsp;month.</p><p>The data sources come with a certain market value attached to them. You’ll be compensated a specific amount when that data is bought. Expect to earn around $8 per month. You can withdraw your earnings once you’ve accumulated a minimum of $5 in earnings.</p><p>Because there is no set limit on how much you can earn, this app may be the most generous on the list. You can even choose who gets your information. Now, isn’t that a good&nbsp;deal?</p> 2. Monetha — Earn Rewards While&nbsp;Shopping <p>If you you are tired of waiting for discounts or searching for a deals, then <a href="https://www.monetha.io/">Monetha</a> is the app you&nbsp;need.</p><p>With Monetha, you can simply use your interest profile as a global rewards/discount card. It’s very simple and you can start getting benefits instantly. You simply download the app and use it while shopping online. Typically, the more money you spend, the more points you&nbsp;earn.</p><p>Your profile is valuable. When you share your interests with stores from our partners network they will offer you even bigger and more tailored benefits when you shop with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Perhaps, this is the most effective approach to profit from your data on the internet.</p><p>In case you are worried about your privacy, Monetha doesn’t have access to your information, all data is encrypted and you share your interests only when you decide and with the brands or stores you&nbsp;love.</p><p>If you would like to know more about getting rewards in exchange for your data, check out our article about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/sites/">reward&nbsp;sites</a>.</p> 3. UpVoice — Share Your Internet&nbsp;Activity <p>If you are a social media enthusiast, why not get paid for&nbsp;it?</p><p>A tracking app, <a href="https://www.joinupvoice.com/">UpVoice</a>, allows you to earn money without putting in any effort. All you have to do is install the app and start earning points every day. The program monitors your internet usage, particularly your social media feeds, and collects adverts anonymously.</p><p>The app is relatively safe to use, and UpVoice claims that it will not affect your device’s performance in any&nbsp;way.</p><p>By using the UpVoice app, you also get a chance to be an UpVoice panelist, whereby you can assist firms in developing brand strategies and marketing plans. What’s more, more benefits and rewards await you when you use participating sites.</p><p>UpVoice essentially compensates you for doing what you do every day while making a positive impact. Users get tokens that may be exchanged for e-gift cards. You should collect a minimum of 600 points to exchange them for a $10 gift card from a wide range of&nbsp;stores.</p><p>UpVoice also provides a variety of incentives to help you increase your earnings, such&nbsp;as:</p>  A 300-token welcome&nbsp;bonus  Ten tokens per day for accessing your social media platforms  Bonus points on reaching certain token milestones  Additional points for referrals  <p>Together, these incentives will help you earn around $175 every year or&nbsp;more.</p> 4. HoneyGain — Share Your Internet Bandwidth <p><a href="https://www.honeygain.com/">Honeygain</a> is similar to applications that allow you to rent out your unwanted items (or even space in your home). With Honeygain, you rent out your unused internet bandwidth for market research purposes.</p><p>Honeygain requires little effort on your part to earn money. Your work is finished after downloading the program and signing up using a valid email address. The Honeygain network will connect to the internet every time your gadget&nbsp;does.</p><p>The money you can earn with Honeygain varies. Generally, you can make up to $50 per month if you run it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, you can refer your friends and family to improve your chances of making more money. Use the online calculator on the Honeygain website to figure out your income potential.</p> 5. Paribus — Make Saving Money a&nbsp;Habit <p>Do you despise learning that an item you just purchased has gone on sale? Perhaps, try&nbsp;<a href="https://paribus.co/">Paribus</a>.</p><p>An interesting data collection program, its primary goal is to help you get refunds on items by keeping track of your purchases and looking for price drops. If you buy something and it goes on sale a few days later, Paribus works on your behalf to get you a&nbsp;refund.</p><p>Paribus syncs with your email to monitor your purchases. But you also have the option to upload your receipts. However, that means you will have to put in the extra&nbsp;effort.</p><p>While this appears to be a straightforward service, much like the other apps, Paribus uses the information obtained to determine your shopping habits for marketing purposes. As for what you can earn, it generally varies based on your purchase patterns and the likeliness for prices to fall. It could be an excellent app for you if you frequently notice sales events after you purchase products.</p> 6. PhonePaycheck — Share Your Phone’s Processor <p>A free app, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neocortix.phonepaycheck&amp;hl=en">PhonePaycheck</a>, helps you earn money in exchange for allowing it to use your phone’s processor when you are not using it. The app runs when you plug your phone into a charger and leave it connected to Wi-Fi. The best thing is it does not consume any of your data plan or access any of your personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>After downloading the app, you sign in using your Google account, keep track of your earnings, and cash out your winnings as a PayPal payout or a gift card once your earnings reach&nbsp;$10.</p><p>To increase your earnings with PhonePaycheck, use the same Google account to download the application onto your old phones. On a single account, you can connect up to five devices. You’ll earn money as long as the phone is plugged in and connected to&nbsp;WiFi.</p> 7. Nielsen Computer and Mobile Panel — Grab Sweepstakes Entries <p>Sharing your mobile data is a passive way to get money. Hence, having sweepstakes entries can help you boost your revenue. A company well-known for tracking the behavior of television viewers, <a href="https://computermobilepanel.nielsen.com/ui/US/en/sdp/landing">Nielsen</a> pays consumers to download its app so it can track their device and internet&nbsp;usage.</p><p>You have almost zero work to do after you download the app on your computer, phone, tablet, e-reader, or any other mobile device. You can sit back and watch your passive income grow and hopefully enter into sweepstakes that you win. The prize pool for Nielsen for sweepstake draws is up to $10,000. But other than that, expect to earn nearly $50 per year with this app for your participation in consumer research.</p> 8. Achievement — Live a Healthy&nbsp;Life <p>What if you could earn points for taking healthy actions? With <a href="https://www.myachievement.com/">Achievement</a>, you can do exactly&nbsp;this.</p><p>Use Achievement to measure your progress in walking, meditating, sleeping, and even eating by connecting it with your other health applications. The app also has surveys that allow you to earn up to 200 points by answering simple questions.</p><p>The data from the app is used to assist businesses in the health and fitness industry improve their products and services. However, it is also a terrific way to stay motivated and consistently make healthy&nbsp;choices.</p><p>Once you have 10,000 points, you can swap your points for a $10 PayPal payout. If that sounds impossible, you should know that you can rapidly start accumulating points because each type of action can earn you up to 80 points every&nbsp;day.</p> 9. Permission Research — Share Your Internet&nbsp;Activity <p>An online market research tool, <a href="https://www.permissionresearch.com/">Permission Research</a>, tries to uncover internet trends and behavior. For this reason, it is considered one of the greatest data collection apps available that pay you for your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Unlike most survey companies, Permission Research works by having members download software to their computers. The information is then gathered and sold to organizations interested in learning more about how people use the internet.</p><p>While using the app, you might be invited to participate in surveys via email, which will help you earn even more&nbsp;money.</p><p>Permission Research takes great care to keep your personal information safe. They do not store sensitive personal data and employ both digital and physical security measures to protect your&nbsp;data.</p> 10. National Consumer Panel — Share Your Purchase&nbsp;Data <p>With the <a href="https://www.ncponline.com/">National Consumer Panel</a>, you get to earn points for submitting your purchase data. You keep track of what you buy with the National Consumer Panel’s mobile app or handheld scanner, which you use to scan barcodes on everything you&nbsp;buy.</p><p>You’ll get points every time you do so, which you may exchange for prizes or sweepstakes entries worth up to $20,000. You can also boost your profits by participating in specific surveys. NCP is a collaboration between Nielsen and IRi, two research&nbsp;firms.</p><p>As you will be paid in points, you can redeem them for prizes listed in the National Consumer Panel&nbsp;catalog.</p> 11. ScreenLift — Get Rewarded for Viewing&nbsp;Ads <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.screen.lift&amp;hl=en">ScreenLift</a> displays advertisements on your lock screen and rewards you for watching them, regardless of whether or not you engage with&nbsp;them.</p><p>All you have to do is unlock your phone like you usually would to earn rewards. In fact, the site features a mechanism that recognizes if you’re attempting to make extra money by using your phone in an unusual way. You will not be rewarded if this&nbsp;happens.</p><p>Swiping your phone to unlock it will earn you “lifts”-the app’s currency. By clicking the diamond button and completing games, you get to earn extra&nbsp;lifts.</p><p>You need around 7,100 lifts to earn $5. You can withdraw the money earned either through PayPal or in the form of an Amazon gift&nbsp;card.</p> 12. Dosh — Get Paid for&nbsp;Shopping <p>Almost all of us go shopping multiple times a month. So then, why not get paid for&nbsp;it?</p><p><a href="https://www.dosh.com/">Dosh</a> is a data collection app through which you can earn cash back on eligible transactions by linking your most-used debit or credit card. It is a great way to make a passive income channel from your everyday purchases.</p><p>You will find a list of participating stores and brands on the app. Simply follow these businesses and brands, and you will be able to bag a percentage of your purchase back every time you buy something.</p><p>However, there is a catch. You should use a credit card to pay for the purchase to be eligible for your rewards. Nonetheless, this also means you can automatically collect a percentage of your cash back without having to scan receipts.</p><p>With more than 1000 participating businesses and restaurants, you can earn up to 10% of your shopping and dining expenditure. You’ll be able to cash out your winnings once you have accumulated $25 either through PayPal or direct bank transfer.</p> 13. Killi — Allow Control Over Your&nbsp;Data <p><a href="https://killi.io/">Killi</a> states that companies significantly profit from your everyday data. Hence, they want you to control the data you own and earn money by completing easy tasks within the&nbsp;app.</p><p>Killi gives you complete control over who uses your data and compensates you for sharing it. While many businesses completely profit from your data, Killi lets you have a piece of the&nbsp;pie.</p><p>Your job is simple. Download the Killi app, complete your profile, specify your criteria, and they will take care of the rest as you earn a passive income. Killi awards point every Friday that can be redeemed for rewards. Expect to earn around $10 a week. However, the more information you share, the more you can&nbsp;earn.</p><p>Shopping, location, and profile rewards are the various ways you can make passive cash using this app. If you wish to increase your profits, participate in surveys or refer&nbsp;friends.</p><p>You can use Killi worry-free. It promises that all the personal information is protected and only data that has been given permission to be purchased is purchased.</p> 14. Pei — Earn Bitcoin&nbsp;Rewards <p>Another app that rewards you for shopping at your favorite stores, what makes <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pei/id1505818791">Pei</a> stand out is that you may opt to get your incentives in&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Create an account and link it to your credit card to get started. Pei keeps track of your purchases and awards you with points when you buy from partner&nbsp;stores.</p><p>You’ll need at least $15 worth of points to redeem your profits, which you may cash out through PayPal, gift cards, or Bitcoin. Depending on the retailer you bought from, Pei will reimburse you between 1% and 15% of your purchase.</p><p>When it comes to the earning potential, your earnings will vary depending on your buying habits, with shopping from partner retailers paying&nbsp;more.</p> 15. MobileXpression — for the&nbsp;Internet <p>Another option to get paid for data collection is <a href="https://www.mobilexpression.com/">MobileXpression</a>, a market research company that strives to shape the future of the internet. They achieve this by collecting data about your internet&nbsp;usage.</p><p>The app is available for both iOS and Android devices. Right after you install the app, it will start collecting data about your online browsing patterns. It gathers information about the pages you visit, the links you access, and your calls’&nbsp;length.</p><p>You will be paid credits for every week the application remains active on your device. After the first week, MobileXpression offers its users a $5 gift card. However, expect a $5 gift card once every few weeks afterward.</p> 16. Sweatcoin — Stay&nbsp;Healthy <p><a href="https://sweatco.in/">Sweatcoin</a> motivates you to get healthier and pays you for doing so. Available for Android and iOS devices, the app automatically tracks your steps indoors and outdoors. Of course, this means you will have to carry your phone with you&nbsp;always.</p><p>For every 1,000 steps, the app pays you 0.95 Sweatcoins. Though you can’t necessarily withdraw the coins as cash, you can exchange them for goods and services. For instance, you can get one month of Netflix subscription for 300 Sweatcoins or a $10 gift card in exchange for 100 Sweatcoins.</p><p>Sweatcoin is also launching crypto soon. So, start using the app now to reap the rewards&nbsp;early.</p> 17. SavvyConnect — Get Paid to Use the&nbsp;Internet <p>With <a href="https://savvyconnect.en.aptoide.com/app">SavvyConnect</a>, you can earn around $180 per year. You install the company’s software on any device and make $5 per device per month. So, the more devices you connect to, the more you can&nbsp;earn.</p><p>This is one true passive income channel, as all you need to do is use the internet as usual after installing the software. Furthermore, you also get to access SavvyConnect’s sister company, SurveySavvy. You will be invited to take surveys, which will help you further increase your earnings.</p><p>The minimum amount you can cash out is as low as $1. You can redeem your earnings through check at any&nbsp;time.</p> 18. UBDI — Exchange Insights for&nbsp;Cash <p>UBDI, the abbreviated form of <a href="https://www.ubdi.com/">Universal Basic Data Income</a>, is a service that pays you in exchange for your data and insights. UBDI’s primary goal is to help companies enhance their offerings. The data is shared anonymously, so you don’t have to worry about your personal information landing in the wrong&nbsp;hands.</p><p>When it comes to the earning potential, the rates aren’t specified. Nevertheless, UBDI states that users could earn up to $1,000 per year just by sharing their data. You can cash out your earnings via wire transfer.</p> 19. Money SMS — Receive Test&nbsp;Messages <p>A pretty straightforward app, <a href="https://moneysmsapp.com/">Money SMS</a>, pays you to receive test text messages. Once you install the app and connect to the internet, the platform starts sending you test SMS messages. There’s nothing else you should&nbsp;do.</p><p>Money SMS helps mobile network operators and telecom providers ensure the proper delivery of their messages through such test messages. The app pays you $0.20 per test message in the form of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, or&nbsp;PayPal.</p> 20. CashMagnet — Browse the&nbsp;Internet <p><a href="https://cashmagnetapp.com/">CashMagnet</a> pays you for visiting specific websites. Once you download the app, your phone turns into a traffic network node that helps marketers boost the click numbers and traffic&nbsp;figures.</p><p>You are awarded points for your activity. For every 10 points, you get $0.01. CashMagnet has a low minimum redemption of $1, which equals 1,000 points. You can redeem your earnings in the form of Amazon gift cards, PayPal payments, Ethereum, or&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p> In a Nutshell: Do Apps Really Pay You for Your&nbsp;Data? <p>Though it is hard to believe, some apps pay you to accomplish seemingly insignificant tasks. You download apps and then give them permission to track your movements online and collect data about you. It may seem absurd, but they require the data and have to pay for the information anyway. Hence, going straight to the consumer saves them&nbsp;money.</p><p>Most of the businesses that pay you for your data are still in their infancy. Hence, it’s too early to determine whether they’ll make any profits. However, experts believe that we will be able to do so one&nbsp;day.</p><p>For those prepared to contribute their data, this is a terrific method of reclaiming some power over their data while earning money. However, it is to be kept in mind that not all data will be treated&nbsp;equally.</p><p>Those who have interesting lifestyles are perceived as influencers, have large networks, and whose data is valuable because it may influence others’ purchases will earn more than the next person. This means that not everyone’s data is equally valuable.</p><p>Lastly, before installing an app on your phone or computer, ensure it’s legitimate, and you are okay with collecting your&nbsp;data.</p><p>PS: if you’re interested in earning money from your data, you possibly should read <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/knowledge/data-ownership/">our article about data ownership</a>!

<p>Anonyome Labs became part of the Sovrin blockchain in 2019. Sovrin is a public utility blockchain for decentralized identity based on Hyperledger Indy technology. As a Founding Steward, Anonyome has run a validator node for Sovrin since its inception.</p>







<p>In 2020, Anonyome Labs was asked to help run the Indicio network. This is another Hyperledger Indy-based decentralized identity blockchain. Anonyome labs runs a validator node on the MainNet for Indicio.</p>







<p>In 2021, Anonyome Labs was approached to help run the cheqd network. This is a new decentralized identity network based on COSMOS/Tendermint. Anonyome runs validator nodes on both the MainNet and TestNet for cheqd. The most interesting aspect of the cheqd network is its introduction of a financial model and cheqd token.</p>



 



 We participate in standards groups 



<p></p>



<p>Decentralized identity is an evolving area that has a strong focus on producing standards. These standards will ensure that Anonyome Labs’ decentralized identity software is interoperable with the standardized decentralized identity software created by other vendors. At Anonyome Labs we contribute to various decentralized identity standards efforts:</p>







<p>Sovrin&nbsp;is a public foundation for looking after the Sovrin network – the only public utility for decentralized identity based on Hyperledger Indy. Anonyome Labs is a contributor to the Technical Governance Board and the Stewards Council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HyperLedger&nbsp;is part of the Linux Foundation and focuses on standards around blockchains. The decentralized identity based Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa projects are hosted at Hyperledger. Anonyome Labs contributes to the Aries Working Group.</p>



<p>Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)&nbsp;is home to many working groups that provide both standards documentation and code prototypes through GitHub:<br></p>



  identifiers and discovery  DID authentication  claims and credentials  DID communication  Sidetree  secure data storage  Keri  wallet security  applied crypto.  



<p>Anonyome Labs is co-chair of the DID Communication (i.e., DIDComm) working group and is a member of the DIF Technical Steering Committee.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP (ToIP)&nbsp;is also part of the Linux Foundation. It bring together the disparate standards into a comprehensive technical and governance model. Anonyome Labs is part of the Steering Committee and the Technology Stack Working Group.</p>



<p>W3C&nbsp;is the home of the decentralized identity identifier (DID) and verifiable credentials standards. This is probably the most-high profile of the standards groups. Anonyome Labs closely follows the work of both these groups.</p>



 We contribute to decentralized open source communities 



<p></p>



<p>Anonyome Labs contributes back to the open source community by providing source code, bug fixes, and to the core ACA-PY: Aries Cloud Agent – Python service. This is a cloud agent that provides verifiable credentials issuer and verifier capabilities, endorser (capability to write to various blockchains), and more.</p>

<p>In our continued updates on Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) support, we're pleased to announce that we've harmonized the behavior of our SIWE Core APIs across different languages, added a number of optimizations, and have released a new beta of our TypeScript library with the included changes. &nbsp;</p><p>While watching SIWE adoption we've identified multiple cases of how SIWE is typically integrated, and we decided to update our SIWE Core Packages to what we learned from our observations. We recently harmonized the behavior of our SIWE Core APIs across different languages with a focus on unifying handling for the parsing, validating, and verification of SIWE messages and all SIWE Core Packages (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/pull/76">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-rs/pull/31">Rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-go/pull/15">Go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-ruby/pull/16">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-ex/pull/22">Elixir</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-py/pull/27">Python</a>) have now been streamlined to support this.</p><p>All checks from EIP-4361 are now enforced, and we also implemented type checks for fields contained in SIWE messages stricter. One won’t be able to create a SIWE message with an Ethereum account that is not EIP-155 compliant, as required by EIP-4361. </p><p>Finally, verifiers (backend applications, APIs, cloud functions, lambdas etc.) which rely on the outcome of the verification process can now get more granular reasons in case some checks have failed and provide additional checks as needed (e.g., domain, nonce, timestamp). We've now also released a v2.0 beta version of our TypeScript library reflecting these changes: </p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/releases/tag/v2.0.3-beta">  Release SIWE 2.0 Release · spruceid/siwe  SIWE 2.0 has been released. The interfaces have been updated to allow consistent usage across languages for SIWE message parsing, creation, and verification. Message parsing has been split into its...  GitHubspruceid    </a><p>The interfaces have been updated to allow consistent usage across languages for SIWE message parsing, creation, and verification. Wallet implementers are mostly interested in SIWE message parsing, so we also now have a SIWE parser package (TypeScript) to optimize for dependency footprint. <code>siwe-parser</code> allows implementers to utilize this functionality standalone without importing larger cryptographic dependencies.</p> Additional Developer Notes for the TypeScript v2.0 Beta Release  <p>The update introduces the following breaking changes (hence the major version update) and implements stricter checks from the EIP-4361 specification:</p>  <code>validate(…)</code> was deprecated and renamed to <code>verify(…)</code> with a new API. A backwards-compatible helper function exists to allow existing implementers to upgrade without concern for changed behavior, but SIWE 1.0 users are advised to review the upgrade section below.  <code>ethers</code> has been updated to a peer dependency, allowing for more efficient builds.  EIP-55 validation of EIP-155 is now enforced, and non-EIP-155 messages are considered as invalid.  The <code>type</code> and <code>signature</code> properties have been removed from <code>SiweMessage</code>.  The <code>not-before</code> message field is now checked during <code>verify</code>.  This update introduces more granular error types returned after verification or message parsing failures: <code>EXPIRED_MESSAGE</code>, <code>INVALID_DOMAIN</code>, <code>DOMAIN_MISMATCH</code>, <code>NONCE_MISMATCH</code>, <code>INVALID_ADDRESS</code>, <code>INVALID_URI</code>, <code>INVALID_NONCE</code>, <code>NOT_YET_VALID_MESSAGE</code>, <code>INVALID_SIGNATURE</code>, <code>INVALID_TIME_FORMAT</code>, <code>INVALID_MESSAGE_VERSION</code>, and <code>UNABLE_TO_PARSE</code>.  <p>Upgrading from SIWE 1.x to 2.0<br>For most implementers, the existing code will continue to work as expected without changes, but there will be a warning message that <code>validate()</code> has been deprecated and may be removed in future versions. To get rid of this warning, you can simply update instances of <code>validate(signature)</code> to <code>verify({ signature: signature })</code>.</p><p>Instead of <code>validate(...)</code>, SIWE 2.0 uses <code>verify(params, opts)</code>. The <code>verify</code> function accepts the primary argument <code>params</code>, which satisfies the following interface:</p> <code>export interface VerifyParams {
    /** Signature of the message signed by the wallet */
    signature: string;

    /** RFC 4501 dns authority that is requesting the signing. */
    domain?: string;

    /** Randomized token used to prevent replay attacks, at least 8 alphanumeric characters. */
    nonce?: string;

    /**ISO 8601 datetime string of the current time. */
    time?: string;
}</code> <p>The <code>opts</code> argument contains the options which dictate how the verification should proceed, namely:</p> <code>export interface VerifyOpts {
    /** ethers provider to be used for EIP-1271 validation */
    provider?: providers.Provider;

    /** If the library should reject promises on errors, defaults to false */
    suppressExceptions?: boolean;
}</code> <p>With the <code>suppressExceptions</code> option above, a <code>SiweResponse</code> with a populated error will be resolved instead of the promise being rejected, allowing for normal control flow handling. However, by default, promises are rejected to ensure defensive programming practices.</p><p>Finally, the <code>verify(...)</code> function returns an object of type <code>SiweResponse</code> defined as:</p> <code>export interface SiweResponse {
    /** Boolean representing if the message was verified with success. */
    success: boolean;

    /** If present `success` MUST be false and will provide extra information on the failure reason. */
    error?: SiweError;

    /** Original message that was verified. */
    data: SiweMessage;
}</code>  <p>If you're interested in integrating Sign-In with Ethereum into your dapp, app, or service, we are more than happy to help and provide any support we can. As we continue our work supporting Sign-In with Ethereum, we especially welcome implementers who already have users relying on similar workflows, authors of related EIPs, and wallet vendors who would like to do more to support user-owned identities to join us.</p><p>If you are interested in being involved, please join our Discord server:</p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/WjvuYqvm5Y"></a>

				  Decentralized Identity moves fast, don’t let keeping up feel like trying to drink from a fire hose.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>In this rapid fire review we will take a look at, and break down, the biggest recent stories in digital identity and what they could mean for business and the average person using the internet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eic2022-centralized-decentralized-identity-converging-kuppinger/">EIC2022 Centralized &amp; Decentralized Identity converging</a></p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, the founder and principal analyst of KuppingerCole, weighed in on the recent European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) that concluded May 13. For those unfamiliar this is a conference, while the title says European, it brings together people from all over the world in the identity space, and as Martin describes, is a place where best practices and thought leadership around digital identities and IAM (Identity and Access Management) meet. He summarizes his biggest take away as the new trend of decentralized identity and traditional IAM converging, sounding extremely positive about the possibilities, and ending with the statement “It is time to explore the new possibilities and utilize DIDs to leverage your IAM to the next level.”</p>
<p>We couldn’t agree more with Martin’s assessment! EIC was an awesome event that Indicio was lucky enough to send a couple representatives to and present at, you can watch our recap video of the event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlKYLlSRQE0&amp;t=5s">here</a>. One of the biggest takeaways that our team had was how many people had decentralized identity on their radar, but were under the impression it was a few years out at least. As one of our team at the conference pointed out, this point of view was because this was the first large identity conference where decentralized identity has had a sizable showing, and it was great to see, people couldn’t wait to learn more and talk about it. This conference had a huge impact on moving decentralized identity more into the public eye, and we are hopeful that for those that thought they had more time this came as a much needed wake up call, make no mistake, the technology is here today! It’s time to start thinking of how to implement it into your identity strategy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/buenos-aires-planning-ambitious-decentralized-digital-identity-system-with-biometrics">Buenos Aires planning ambitious decentralized digital identity system with biometrics</a></p>
<p>Buenos Aires is planning to establish a non-permissioned, blockchain-based, digital identity platform that includes biometrics for public and private sector use. The platform will use <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=DIDs">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) and follow the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID-CORE</a> specification. The blockchain element is intended to maximize transparency, which is a key concern following a headline-grabbing hack of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202110/potentially-devastating-digital-id-hack-in-argentina-could-have-many-ripples">Argentina’s digital ID system</a> last year. The digital ID system could be used by Buenos Aires residents to access city services, as well as transact with financial services providers, including enabling tax payments in cryptocurrency. The launch target is late-2022 or the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>This is a massive step forward for large-scale adoption of decentralized identity technologies and highlights a key problem that blockchain can solve: transparency across the network. Blockchain creates multiple ledgers for data transactions, allowing anyone with admin access to see what has transpired across the network. This is important for many use cases, but in Argentina, specifically, the government has had issues with police accessing facial data records to essentially track the greater population, which they shouldn’t be able to do. By using blockchain other users of the network would be able to see who is misusing their access.</p>
<p>Indicio is a proponent of starting simple and scaling to expand the benefits of these types of systems—because that approach has worked time and again with our clients—so starting with one city makes sense. The fact that they are looking at ease of use is key for end user adoption, as is maximizing the number of services that citizens can access, and pay through a variety of means. The more digital credentials can be used for day-to-day purposes, the greater the value they’ll be to people and the more they will be used. This plan signals forward thinking and we will be very interested to see how it develops.</p>
<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/londons-exclusive-les-ambassadeurs-casino-114600022.html">London’s Exclusive Les Ambassadeurs Casino Bets on Blockchain to Revolutionize Gambling</a></p>
<p>Casino players at Les Ambassadeurs will soon be able to transfer their winnings by using verified identity credentials. The aim is to improve customer experience, enhance safety and compliance, and reduce costs and administration. Set to be trialed this year, this solution will provide a secure way for casino players to withdraw their funds, or transfer them to another casino within the system. “Gambling is one of the big drivers of technology. Over 20% of the world population gambles and the global industry is worth over $711 billion”— <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=l1X6HhtY-xYiBnDB2CsAXl6f0Po5JFrZ_W9hCuL_4B2uCfMRtFd6oRokLNThOeFNnd-zj4OToSqKhXKxNWUWs-yLjTRxmNFZuraL2SdHtzeBQCmfMdTGWUNjoX-qY24ru0oo8sN3vZEKnwGY_yVVYzBXq5BDsqDofiHhG7MkPXci5eXU7OeVPWeZk_C94zqJpXKUH-1Rki8IofCm0ILKXDo5DZ1BXYFReIAmISwBs4s=">Rick Schmitz</a> (LTO Network CEO)</p>
<p>With staggering numbers of players and money involved, the gambling industry will show many people how this technology can make friction disappear and both the end user and the casino’s life easier: One no longer has to deal with the process of cashing out or managing their chips, while the other reduces the risk of fraud and lowers security costs. The adoption of decentralized identity in a leisure activity is also not to be overlooked, it’s one thing to implement decentralized identity into your life grudgingly because a government says you need it to access the things you need, it’s another to take it onto yourself to make sure you have it for something you want to do.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/28/fact-sheet-united-states-and-60-global-partners-launch-declaration-for-the-future-of-the-internet/">United States and 60 Global Partners Launch Declaration for the Future of the Internet&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The United States government recently announced its vision for the Internet and digital technologies. The goals include protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms online, promoting a global Internet that advances the free flow of information, and ensuring that all people can benefit from the digital economy.</p>
<p>There is a lot to unpack in this article, and if you want a more detailed interpretation, our own James Schulte did an excellent job in a recent <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-white-houses-future-of-the-internet-is-available-today/">blog post</a>. The cliff notes summary: what the Biden administration is promising to work toward is largely delivered by decentralized identity technology. Concerns over user privacy and data protection is one of the biggest reasons many of the organizations we work with have turned to decentralized solutions. With 60 global partners signing this declaration, we see an uptick in blockchain identity solutions coming soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/us-digital-id-fraud-cost-52b-in-2021-javelin-estimates">US digital ID fraud cost $52B in 2021</a></p>
<p>This recent report by Javelin estimates that 42 million Americans were victims of digital identity fraud last year. It points the finger at pandemic-related shifts to digital services in the U.S. economy as the driver for the 109 percent jump in new-account fraud and 90 percent leap in account takeovers. The research firm ends by suggesting that banks add behavioral biometrics tools to personally identifiable information and device-based controls to shield customers.</p>
<p>This article is a great reminder of why enabling people to prove who they are online in a privacy-securing way is so important. Biometric tools and device-based controls are a good start, but keeping this information in a centralized database will always come with a level of risk. As more personally identifiable information (PII) is needed to manage user accounts for e-commerce and online financial services, the risk of fraud and data breaches is only going to keep increasing. Human nature being what it is, most people will choose frictionless convenience over time-consuming, multi-step security procedures. This is why the simplicity of verifiable credentials is the way forward: not only does it mean that PII doesn’t have to be stored to manage user authentication, the process of verification is frictionless.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/not-a-lot-to-show-for-australias-400m-digital-id-programme-says-former-government-cio/">‘Not a lot to show’ for Australia’s $400m digital ID programme, says former government CIO</a></p>
<p>A leader in the Australian government recently shared his thoughts on its digital ID program, concluding that it was over-engineered and has cost too much for what has been delivered. He said that there were many failings, a big one being that they missed their own deadline to introduce legislation designed to underpin the digital ID to Parliament in spring last year. Without the legislation people did not have a reason to adopt and the government did not have a reason to switch from legacy systems. Another problem was multiple identities for different governments causing confusion and inefficiency, with one person saying you may have up to 30 different logins for different government services.</p>
<p>This is an unfortunate situation but definitely one that everyone can learn from. Successful implementations of digital identity systems need a clear direction and multiple organizations to come together to make sure they work. At Indicio we direct customers through this roadmapping and can’t stress enough the importance of giving the end users a good user experience and a compelling reason to adopt. Buy-in from every stakeholder is critical; for example — in our successful proof of concept for Aruba it took coordination between the government, local businesses, and the airports to implement a single verifiable credential;&nbsp; a digital ID for multiple government services is absolutely doable, but arguably should be implemented incrementally, with each success becoming an opportunity to recruit new stakeholder buy in. If you’re curious about the work that went into successfully implementing that credential, you can read more <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">here.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://artifacts.ai/?post_type=post&amp;p=2606">Over the last 10 &nbsp;</a>months we’ve been busy working with our partners in the Lieberman Lab at the University of Notre Dame (UND) and their Distributed Pharmaceutical Analytical Laboratory group (DPAL) to develop a platform for conducting verification and reporting of drug APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) and safety.&nbsp; Our goal has been to develop a proof of concept and confirm that it can be deployed at scale. During this project, we <a href="https://blockchainhealthcaretoday.com/index.php/journal/article/view/230">published a paper</a> with our friends and colleagues at DPAL about this innovation. And we were also invited by the National Science Foundation to submit a proposal to <a href="https://seedfund.nsf.gov/">America’s Seed Fund</a> based on our results. Let’s take a deeper look into what all of this means.</p>
 The current landscape 
<p>When we began working with the Lieberman Lab and its DPAL network of international collaborators, we knew that they were tackling a big, global problem. This has only been made more clear as we delve further into it. An estimated 10% to 30% of essential medicines are substandard in developing regions, and this problem has been exacerbated as the effects of COVID and the war in Ukraine continue to be felt. </p>
<p>Currently, a lot of time, effort, and resources are being directed at the physical tracking of products as they move through the supply chain . While this is useful – and important – monitoring of a pill’s journey from A to C via B, it doesn’t check the drug’s contents – specifically the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). This is the critical gap we are addressing, through the combination of science and technology, by building a system that can be integrated at any and all points across the pharmaceutical supply chain.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We are supporting the scientific research our partners at UND and DPAL conduct by providing a platform for the extension of their work across many more medicines and nations. Through this work, we have confirmed unmet needs in the market for a service that uniquely combines science with technology to report trusted data on medicine quality and safety. </p>
 Achievements so far and next steps 
<p>In a short time, we’ve made huge leaps forward with our partners to improve drug verification and reporting. These include: </p>
 
 Applying rapid, iterative design-development-testing-feedback methodology to achieve impressive results enabling us to stand up a platform for live use within our ambitious timeframe. 
 Connecting participants engaged in collaborative and rigorous scientific workflow processes that span multiple laboratories, continents, and institutions including field labs, universities, and national public health regulatory authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Demonstrating success securing provenance and chain of custody of drug APIs necessary for proving the validity of scientific findings for use by regulatory authorities, and supply chain participants, and healthcare providers in rooting out substandard or falsified products from the marketplace.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Having demonstrated a successful proof of concept, our system is now being licensed and introduced for active use by the DPAL community. DPAL will expand its use further to report on a broader range of essential medicines, which include generics and biologics. </p>
 Introducing ARTiFACTS Verify  
<p>This pilot has not only proved our ability to move at scale and speed, but also confirmed a market need for a novel service which fills a significant gap in the supply chain infrastructure. We are delighted to announce our newest product, ARTiFACTS Verify – the drug verification SaaS platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verify combines innovative application of scientific processes with technology to provide an information platform that delivers trusted and actionable data for identifying and reducing the prevalence of substandard or falsified drugs in the market. Verify will sit alongside our current offering for researchers, now known as ARTiFACTS File.</p>
<p>Verify is relevant for those in your organization engaged in assuring supplies meet quality and therapeutic requirements. Verify can strengthen your safety programs wherever your teams are producing, distributing, or purchasing and administering prescription pharmaceuticals. To learn more about Verify and explore its value for you and your teams, please <a href="mailto:info@artifacts.ai">get in touch</a>. </p>

<p>As we prepare for the upcoming launch of OceanONDA V4, we are announcing new initiatives to accelerate the adoption of Ocean as the orchestration layer for web3 data sharing and monetization. Before moving forward, we need to take care of unfinished business. This blog post has two sections geared towards publishers, stakers and datatoken holders.</p>  Airdrops for Ocean&nbsp;V3  Pool Share Lock for OceanONDA V4  <p>Airdrops for Ocean&nbsp;V3</p><p>When Ocean V3 was launched in October 2020, it was immediately apparent that there were asymmetries between publishers, datatoken holders and stakers. For the past 18 months, we’ve worked to re-architect core components of the Ocean Protocol to make it safe for everyone.</p><p>We’re very happy with the involvement and support from the Ocean community. Many of you published datasets, acquired datatokens and staked them in pools. Some of you were able to make nice gains by leveraging the dynamics of the Balancer AMMs. Others weren’t so lucky and lost $OCEAN staked due to the dynamics of the AMM design. We fixed these problems in OceanONDA V4 and look forward to safe staking for everyone moving&nbsp;forward.</p><p>But we also want to make sure that everyone that participated in Ocean V3 can come out ahead, not only with learnings but also financially. So as a token of thanks, we’re going to airdrop any token address that experienced a loss while publishing, staking or acquiring datatokens as of 25.5.2022. What follows is our plan for airdrops.</p><p>Ocean V3&nbsp;Airdrops</p>  Stakers: every staker will end up with a gain of at least 100 $OCEAN. For any address that experienced a loss, you’ll get an&nbsp;airdrop.  Datatoken Acquiror: reimbursement of the current datatoken value and a 50% bonus on-top, paid in&nbsp;$OCEAN  Publisher: 1,000 $OCEAN for each&nbsp;dataset  <p>Airdrops will be deposited in your address as $mOCEAN on the Polygon&nbsp;network.</p><p>If you want to understand the methodology we used to calculate the airdrops, go to the bottom of this blog&nbsp;post.</p><p>Pool Share Lock for OceanONDA V4</p><p>Over 500 datasets were published in the Ocean Market. With the launch of OceanONDA, we are asking LPs (publishers and stakers) to lock your pool shares into the Ocean V4 migration smart contract.</p><p>Pools with greater than 500 $OCEAN&nbsp;Reserve</p><p>Given the high gas prices on Ethereum, we are asking you to lock your pool shares for each pool which has more than 500 $OCEAN in reserve. As a thank you for locking your pool shares, you will receive a 10% bonus on the locked&nbsp;amount.</p><p>There are 36 datasets that meet the minimum threshold of $OCEAN reserve (see below for the list of eligible&nbsp;assets).</p><p>For the eligible assets, we are asking LPs to lock their pool shares starting now, 25.5.2022 at 10:00 UTC. You need to lock pool shares for each pool that you might have injected liquidity into.</p><p>Please expect that locking your pool shares will cost approximately $5–15 USD in gas&nbsp;fees.</p><p>The Ocean V3 to OceanONDA V4 pool share lock process will run until 15.6.2022 at 10:00 UTC. Any LP that did not lock their pool shares by this cutoff time will still be able to withdraw their stake using the smart contract directly and will not receive any bonus. If you choose to interact with the smart contract, instructions will be provided after 15.6.2022.</p><p>Pools with less than 500 $OCEAN&nbsp;Reserve</p><p>For pools with less than 500 $OCEAN in reserve, no action is required and datatoken holders will be compensated for the amount&nbsp;staked.</p><p>Migration Day 15.6.2022</p><p>On 15.6.22, all pool shares and datatokens will be burned, and airdrops will be sent to stakers, datatoken holders and publisher addresses in the Polygon&nbsp;network.</p><p>If you published, staked or acquired datatokens, please check your addresses for any credits and bonuses on or around 15.6.2022 by using either <a href="https://polygonscan.com/">https://polygonscan.com/</a> or the wallet of your&nbsp;choice.</p><p>Snapshots of all stakers, datatoken holders and publishers were made on 25.5.2022 at 07:00&nbsp;UTC.</p><p>Any changes to the liquidity pool or datatoken value from this time forward will not be taken into consideration for the&nbsp;airdrop.</p><p>Further, Publish, Add/Remove liquidity, and Swaps are now disabled on the Ocean Market until the launch of OceanONDA V4.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who joined the Ocean V3 phase. Anyone that participated will be fully compensated for participating, learning and getting familiar with Ocean&nbsp;V3.</p><p>OceanONDAV4 is almost here. Look out for the announcements and programs that are going to be kicked off in the coming weeks to accelerate an open Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>Ocean V3 Airdrops Methodology</p><p>Airdrop for Participation in Ocean&nbsp;V3</p>  For each pool, the number of $OCEAN deposited and withdrawn per address was&nbsp;recorded  Some addresses participated in more than one pool. Thus, the $OCEAN deposited vs withdrawn for each address was calculated to get a total view of gains/losses per&nbsp;address.  In total — 2/3rds of stakers came out with less $OCEAN than they entered with. 1/3rd came out with&nbsp;more;  When gas fees were taken into consideration, an approximately 200 addresses saw net&nbsp;losses;  Anyone who had a cumulative loss or had a profit less than 100 $OCEAN will receive an airdrop. An airdrop for participation will be at least 100 $OCEAN but it could be up to the total amount $OCEAN lost plus a 10%&nbsp;bonus;  Addresses that came out with a profit greater than 100 $OCEAN, after gas fees — well-played, congratulations. You made a profit, figured out the dynamics and you won — no participation airdrop for&nbsp;you;  Approximately 2,250 addresses that are staked will get an airdrop totalling 6M&nbsp;$OCEAN.  <p>Airdrop for Locking Pool&nbsp;Shares</p>  For all stakers that lock their pool shares, an additional 10% bonus airdrop on the locked amount will be airdropped;  The amount airdropped is determined by the number and amount of pool shares locked between now and 15.6.2022.  <p>Airdrops to your addresses will show up on the Polygon network (<a href="https://polygonscan.com/">https://polygonscan.com/</a>). Be sure to check your address on or after 15.6.2022.</p><p>Datatoken Acquirors</p>  An extract of all datatoken holders was generated;  Active datasets with existing datatoken reserves and pool shares were identified;  Addresses with reimbursement amount less than 50 $OCEAN worth of datatokens were eliminated, as the gas fees needed to reimburse exceeds the amount to be reimbursed;  Active datasets with less than 500 $OCEAN as a reserve were also eliminated, as the gas fees needed to reimburse exceeds the amount to be reimbursed;  The remaining addresses, where datatokens are worth more than 50 $OCEAN and the pool has greater than 500 $OCEAN reserve, will receive an&nbsp;airdrop.  <p>In summary, 75 addresses that acquired datatokens will get an airdrop totalling around 100k&nbsp;$OCEAN.</p><p>Note: Publishers were able to mint datatokens for only the price of gas so they will not get any airdrop for minted datatokens.

Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1527355908908621825?s=20&amp;t=SGqBdu_xzxQXriK-__fBew">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “The history of blockchain development”. On May 22, 2010, a programmer bought a pizza with 10,000 bitcoins. Later, May 22 became the “pizza festival” for the blockchain industry. Ontology community members recalled the original intention of joining the blockchain industry.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion led by Benny, an Asian community Harbinger. He shared the key reasons why decentralized identity (DID) has become the underlying foundation for dApps to integrate, emphasizing the importance and necessity of protecting user identities and data security. He also discussed with community members “how Ontology promote the Web3 development team to build innovative applications based on DID technology”.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Ontology has launched the framework upgrade which saw additional enhancements to ONT ID’s product suite, as well as some important upgrades, including the upgrade of Mercury, a secure, trustless, DID based peer-to-peer communication protocol. There are also additional upgrades being made to ONT Login, the trustless universal authenticator, and ONT TAG, Ontology’s Trust Anchor Gateway, providing easier integration of decentralized identity solutions for Web2 and Web3 application developers.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Cointelegraph — “<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-loss-of-privacy-why-we-must-fight-for-a-decentralized-future">The loss of privacy: Why we must fight for a decentralized future</a>”</p><p>“With time and distance no longer problematic in the internet age, Big Tech’s drive toward centralization is less surprising. Can we be astonished by the horrific results of attention-grabbing algorithms, such as attempted genocides or political manipulation based on psychometric analysis of user data? Centralization has consequences. Distributed ledger technology provides a practical alternative. Social media, messaging, streaming, searching and data-sharing on the blockchain can be fairer, more transparent and accessible, and less centralized. Conversely, this does not mean data has to be less private.”</p><p>Decentralization is not an accident of historical development, but a necessity. Decentralized identity (DID) is an important part of this development. The mature decentralized identity framework ONT ID, built by Ontology, truly guarantees the security of privacy by returning the autonomy of identity construction and data storage to users. Users can choose to sell part of their data, or users can gain higher status and rights in society by accumulating reputation.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>Much has been written and said about Self-Sovereign Identity. SSI, in short, is an approach to giving individuals back control of their digital identities. But no matter how clear this explanation may sound, a large number of methods and approaches on the Internet can also lead to confusion and even false statements. In this article, we take a detailed look at topics and individual statements that have been discussed in the media in recent times. In doing so, we examine more closely whether SSI can increase or reduce risks for data misuse in certain cases. We conclude with the core thesis that the misuse of personal data will remain possible regardless of the digital identity used – and how one can still protect oneself against data misuse&nbsp;with the help SSI. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Data Abuse &nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom stands behind better digital identity solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First things first: SSI alone does not increase the risk of data being misused. Due to its architecture, it opens up opportunities to increase data security and privacy. The greatest risk lies in the fact that user data is passed on to an online service and then stored there. Today we all know this only too well as a user profile or account. From the moment I enter my details on a platform online, I have to trust that the service protects its database well and keeps my data safe from attacks by hackers and identity thieves. Unfortunately, experience shows that in the end, hackers are often successful and thousands of profiles and accounts fall into the hands of data thieves each day. This can become an absolute nightmare for those affected and motivates us at Jolocom to work on better digital identity solutions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So we have two options, either we don’t give the services any more data or we force them to secure the data better. Of course, it would be best to do both: to transfer less data, and at the same time to create better data security. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Login – Continuous onboarding &nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to save less data with services and still be able to fully use what they offer, there is a great possibility offered by SSI that ensures that I have my data completely under control. The concept is called continuous onboarding and means that the profile data is retransmitted every time I log in (in the case of car sharing, for example, my relevant driver’s license data, my IBAN and billing address). As soon as the user logs out (and has parked the car again), the service can delete their data and only keep an individual code for itself, with which it recognizes the user on the next visit. Admittedly, one is dependent on the service actually deleting the data, but there are many incentives to do so, because the risk of a hacking attack with serious consequences decreases enormously. And not to forget, if something changes for one user (e.g. the telephone number), the service will be notified about this change via continuous onboarding the moment the user next logs into the service. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With SSI, data can be shared with one click, without any additional effort. Today, the process of continuous onboarding described above would be practically impossible, since the data would have to be entered manually for every visit, and even the driver’s license or ID would have to be confirmed by video. This is a complex process and unattractive for both sides. With SSI, data can be shared with one click, without any additional effort. The service also saves a lot of money due to this reduced risk, which is yet another reason to work with SSI. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it will not work entirely without regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As much as we can use SSI to help services stop storing data about us, there’s no guarantee they won’t. Regulation is the only way to ensure that they do not request more data from us than is necessary. Because in the situation in which we as individual users negotiate with the services, we often have less leverage. We want to use the service and the only way to do so is accepting their terms, whether justified or not. In a digital world in which we practically cannot do without many services, this is like blackmail. We are often at the mercy of data misuse and have to watch how we are either excluded from society or how our data is used for participation in the digital life. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom positions itself against data trading and tracking. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, there already is a very promising legal situation in Europe. Because the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) sets clear limits on what can be demanded of users. Most recently, the Digital Markets Act was passed, which again strengthened the rights to services. While it’s true that SSI comes from liberal thinking, that doesn’t mean our European version of SSI should be completely unregulated. Do we just have to wait for regulation? However, such a regulation for SSI can also be implemented in very concrete terms even before the legislature acts, in that the actors involved in an SSI ecosystem give themselves common rules and determine the means to enforce them. The whole thing is called the Trust Framework. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In an SSI ecosystem, it can be restricted which data can be queried from the user and by whom. The Verifier must then clearly justify what happens to that data and is bound by the Trust Framework. We at Jolocom are also working on these trust frameworks as part of the BMWK (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klima) showcase projects and are supporting the development of eIDAS 2.0 in Brussels, a new regulation in which similar questions are addressed. In fact, eIDAS can be understood as a kind of European trust framework. The electronic identity card is already one of them today and in the near future, very likely, self-sovereign identity will be too. &nbsp;</p>



<p>To put it bluntly, one could say that with SSI you can only decide who you give your data to and by what means, but not what happens to it. However, that is a lot compared to the status quo. What happens to the data is then a new question and not a technical one. Then it is about the trust framework and the implementation of policies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, the whole thing has to be regulated via certification and approval. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While it is true that SSI comes from liberal thinking, that doesn’t mean our European version of SSI should be completely unregulated. In any case, in the medium term it can be assumed that only wallets that are also approved/certified in a trust framework and only speak to issuers and verifiers who are also approved can assert themselves on the market. The SSI system is not responsible for poorly secured databases. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Does self-sovereign identity mean that I can decide everything for myself? &nbsp;</p>



<p>The idea that as a user of SSI I have complete sovereignty over my digital identity is often misunderstood. At its core, SSI is about my digital identity being under my own control, so I can decide to whom I show my data, when, and for what. This important principle is already contained in the first article on SSI by Christopher Allen from 2016. With SSI I can also create identity data about myself and, for example, claim to be an astronaut. But at the latest when I want to board a space shuttle with this identity, I would be exposed. In reality, we construct our identity primarily from what others say about us. Our identity card is only appreciated because it was issued by the state and a sovereign authority confirms my identity. It is similar with a student ID, which is only credible if it was issued by the university. &nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello. And today, our guest is a very special guest – it’s Aaron Painter, and he is the CEO of Nametag, the company who invented “Sign in with ID” as a more secure alternative to passwords. He is the former Vice President and General Manager of Microsoft China, Hong Kong, and Brazil as well as best-selling author of LOYAL, where he describes his key to leadership: fostering a culture of listening.</p>
<p>Hello, Aaron.</p>
<p>Aaron Painter: Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s a pleasure talking with you.</p>
<p>Aaron: Thank you. It’s an honour to be here. I love the show. I learn so much from each episode so it’s really a privilege to be on.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Definitely, super interesting, the conversation we’re going to have actually about a topic we have not talked before in this show is the metaverse. So, let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. And of course, we first want to hear about our guest, so what was your journey to come to this world of identity?</p>
<p>Aaron: My journey was really growing up in technology. I spent about 14 years at Microsoft, started in Redmond near Seattle. And then the rest of my career was outside the US. I spent four years in France, two-and-a-half years in Brazil, five-and-a-half years in China, mostly doing international development, working with large customers of Microsoft’s, partnerships, helping Microsoft expand into new geographies. I loved it. I got to experience so many different people and cultures around the world.</p>
<p>I left and then went to run a cloud computing consultancy firm based in the UK called Cloudreach for a couple of years. And I left in December of 2019, just before the pandemic. That’s where it all started.</p>
<p>Oscar: Since when you started in identity, already in your work in Microsoft, you start entering, immersing yourself in this world of identity, or it came much, much more recently?</p>
<p>Aaron: Identity came to me much more recently. And it was because so many customers that I was working with at Microsoft and later at Cloudreach were fascinated with security. Increasingly, everyone had a question of how do I help protect my infrastructure? How do I make sure I’m speaking to the right customers, that I’m speaking to the right employees, that I’m hiring people, and the people that I hire are the ones accessing the network and accessing my services? But for me, the real start of it was much more personal.</p>
<p>And at the start of the pandemic, I had several friends and family members, mainly in the US at that point, who had their identity stolen. And I tried to help them recover. And I said, “Alright, let’s do this together. Let’s, you know, let’s call customer support. Let’s try and have some conversations and figure out how we can get things back on track for you.” And everyone we spoke with, to me felt like sort of the Dark Ages. It was the opposite of what I had learned and experienced in China where you could do almost anything from your mobile phone.</p>
<p>But in the context of – particularly in the US at that point – validating who you were when you’re on the phone with someone in customer support or trying to log into an account, people had no idea. They were using antiquated methods to try and validate a person. And almost every conversation resulted in “Well, why don’t you come see me in person? Or why don’t you come into the branch?” But it was the pandemic, everything was closed. There was no branch to go to. There was no office to go to. And that’s when I realised that this problem of identity was paramount in what we’re trying to solve in the world of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that makes sense – I heard some stories like the one you just said that. Personally, or someone very close, got compromised, lost their identity, how to recover was one of these realisations that yeah, this is a big problem, it is a big problem. So fantastic, knowing you are working now in the world of authentication, identity verification.</p>
<p>And I know because you just have a quick chat before this conversation that your services you are offering to companies who are entering into this, I don’t know how new we could say but a new, sounds exciting world of the metaverse. The metaverse, I guess we’ll have several metaverses, right, in the future. If you can start telling us what is the metaverse?</p>
<p>Aaron: Yeah. The metaverse has certainly grown in popularity in the last couple of years, probably most notably with Facebook rebranding their overall corporate brand as Meta has sort of a commitment from that organization that the metaverse really stands for the future. You know, other organisations like Microsoft have been very vocal and feeling like they’re able to create kind of a metaverse or a virtual community in the business world or in the enterprise.</p>
<p>And ideally, over time, it’ll be a place where people can interact in a virtual way, which oddly sounds similar to some of what we do today, right? We interact often, you might think of video game platforms as metaverse-like environments today where people spend their time, they interact, they make new friends, they play, they speak, they chat, and they build relationships with other people.</p>
<p>The metaverse ideally will provide more and more compute power, richer experiences and ways for people to build those relationships in new ways. And even richer technologies, perhaps things like holographic, 3D, augmented reality, wearing glasses, a whole bunch of richer ways to make those interactions seem more real life or more human.</p>
<p>For me, though, one of the scariest things about the metaverse is that we are inheriting a problem that we haven’t really solved in today’s world. And that’s this concept of how you trust someone online or over the phone or in a virtual or digital context. The history of identity to me gets really fascinating, because when you think about it in a physical world, you know, governments have mostly gotten pretty good at identifying their citizens.</p>
<p>I’d like to say, more so in developed markets, and… but you go to examples like India, or China and India with Aadhaar, and their digital identity programme to bring so many citizens into that realm of being recognised and identified. There’s been radical progress. But it wasn’t always that way. And if you go back hundreds of years, even in Europe, somebody would go somewhere new into a new territory, and they weren’t recognised. First, people would give them a letter or an attestation, saying, “Yes, this person is… I vouch for them.”</p>
<p>Eventually– maybe that was a king or some kind of leader. Eventually, that became a passport as we think of it in the modern form. So that when someone went somewhere new in the physical space, you could say this person can be trusted, because they have been identified, someone has gone through a process to make sure that they are who they claim to be.</p>
<p>And in the digital world, and then particularly in the metaverse, as you take that to the next level, we haven’t found a way to carry that over. In today’s online world, the closest thing we have to a passport is really a password. And a password is just not the same thing. You know, in the early days of computing, it was a smaller group. It was a more trusted community when networked computers started coming together, and you sort of knew who someone was based on the way they identified themselves, maybe it was an email address identified to an academic or a government institution, a password protected that account. But it wasn’t the same as a passport.</p>
<p>And as the ecosystem of the online world has gotten so big and encompasses so many people now, I would argue we have not as a society or as an industry come up with a solution yet that allows someone to be recognised and to keep their account protected. When you take that into the metaverse, it gets even worse.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, indeed, it’s a problem that yeah, your company, my company, many, many people are working on that. It’s a problem still being solved as you said. And how do you envision when people are already on the metaverse? So, what will be, I don’t know if the ideal or how do you think… Today there’s already some metaverse, right? But it’s based mostly on a Discord account or, yeah, whatever we have today, right? How do you think it’s going to be when the metaverse has become more popular, more people inside, how – yeah, how do you envision?</p>
<p>Aaron: What I’ve realised as I’ve dug so much into this space is that we often fall back on kind of the least secure method, particularly when things go wrong. So, if you take a parallel world and Web 3.0, separate from Metaverse slightly, but you think of NFTs, for example, you go and buy an NFT because it’s someone’s digital work of art, which is a wonderful thing. And it’s a great way to give creators the ability to express themselves through new means and to protect the ownership of what they create. But the creator in that sense is often identified by a Twitter handle, right? So, this person is selling me this NFT they created and you might go look them up on Twitter and see if their handle is the same on Twitter as it is as how they identify themselves in the NFT. And if they have a profile, and they posted some things, you say, “Oh, that must be the creator.”</p>
<p>And unfortunately, that doesn’t work. The least common denominator in that case is Twitter. And as we know in recent discussions alone, we don’t really know who people are on Twitter. Some celebrities or certain government officials might have a verified badge and maybe we trust that, but the vast majority of folks on Twitter, we don’t actually know who they are. Yet when you take that as the underlying framework of identifying someone and carry it into things like NFTs the problem gets even more challenging.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. That illustrates what you say, that the problem from the Web 2.0 is coming to the metaverse. And what do you think could be a solution for that? Have you heard from standards that will – or the same standards that are now in the Web 2.0 will come to the metaverse, what do you think is going to happen?</p>
<p>Aaron: Well, most of what we’re seeing in the metaverse today is identifying people based on their crypto wallet. You know, our wallet address, you can have as many wallets as you want. You can have them with different providers. And your wallet in a Web 3.0 or crypto-based environment is often like an email address, meaning just like a Gmail account, you can go spin up a new one and be identified by that. That’s how people typically identify themselves in this kind of Web 3.0 environment.</p>
<p>Other Metaverse communities, depending on who’s kind of running them will default back on whatever their method of authentication is. So, if you think of it in Microsoft context, let’s say, it might be your Xbox gamertag, and you take your Xbox gamertag and carry that in, or your username or handle on Roblox, or similar on kind of a gaming platform. All these concepts are sort of pseudonyms, the ability to operate by a username of some kind that recognises who you are.</p>
<p>My premise, though, is that safe communities know their members. It’s OK to operate by a pseudonym, or to have an alias when you’re in one of these environments. But I think that the platforms have a responsibility to know the authentic identity of the person behind it. Because when they do, it creates a deterrent for people to misbehave, to conduct themselves poorly, or, frankly, to be able to disappear and come back under yet another account.</p>
<p>I believe that platforms need to know the real identity of their users. A lot like, let’s say, you go to an event, and you walk into the room and there’s someone checking you before you walk in and they say, “OK, can I see your government-issued ID maybe? Can I see the invitation that you’ve got?” If so, they give you, coincidentally, a nametag that you might wear and you walk into that room, and then you know that the people in that room have all sort of been vetted. And they are who they say they are and the nametag that they’re wearing is accurate.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you board an airplane, they don’t ask you for your email address, they don’t ask you for your wallet address from your crypto account. They ask you for a government-issued ID. And with that, they allow you to come inside. And in theory, the area inside that airport is kind of a secure and a safe zone.</p>
<p>In the digital world, it’s the same thing. Platforms have a responsibility, in my opinion, to know the identity of the people that enter so that they can create a safe community where people can operate by pseudonyms or aliases or other things.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, it’s going to be, clearly, it’s going to be the platform is the one that run the metaverse’s big responsibility, as you are explaining pretty well, to have some sort of vetting or verification of the identity of people who are inside.</p>
<p>And another thing is, there will be several metaverses, right? You mentioned, I think you mentioned Microsoft as well, Facebook, there will be let’s say Disney, yeah, the gaming companies, so that there will be ultimately several metaverses who are somehow isolated, the same way Twitter is isolated from Facebook, for instance. And there might be of course a benefit that one person could go from one metaverse to another. So, what do you think– how do you envision that? Will it be possible that if I have one account in one metaverse, should I be able to come to the other one with my assets? And how do you think this could happen?</p>
<p>Aaron: Again I think is sort of a situation we haven’t fully solved well in Web 2.0, in the current environment. You can use your email address and go from place to place. And you might have a different username or an alias, let’s say on Twitter versus Reddit versus, you know, maybe even a dating platform, each of them have their own way of creating a sense of community, allowing you maybe to have a slightly different username or profile.</p>
<p>But again, the challenge we have in today’s world is that you don’t necessarily know who’s underlying that. You don’t know the real identity of the person who’s actually underneath that pseudonym, or that alias. I feel like there’s a solution from what we see in the real world and the physical world, the offline world, which is that of using someone’s government-issued ID. And some of the things as you know, we’ve talked about or you’ve spoken with others on this podcast, allow people to take their government-issued ID and put it into a digital context.</p>
<p>The most basic might be a, you know, scan your government ID, do a selfie, do we match these two things? More advanced might be new methods of using blockchain technologies to understand the raw certificate and where someone’s identity was issued, or from whom. All those things matter but I would argue there is a way to take something that’s consistent like your government-issued ID and make it pervasive so that you can use it across different platforms.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, so you think that the government-issued identities, like passports, should be part of this identity solution for the metaverse?</p>
<p>Aaron: Yes, but what’s fascinating to me is today that’s where things often break down. Again, going to kind of the lowest common denominator, because the closest that people do with that today is sort of one-time ID verification. And typically it happens in financial services, typically with some sort of financial regulatory requirement like KYC, Know Your Customer, right? Where you might say, in order to open this bank account, I need you to scan your ID so that the bank can validate that you are the person maybe that you come from a certain nationality that allows with anti-money laundering laws or other things. The bank might check the box, OK, they’ve done that.</p>
<p>But then every other time you interact with the bank, they don’t use that anymore. They default to then asking you a password or PIN code or security questions. Maybe they’ve added things like multi-factor authentication to make your PIN code more secure, your password more secure, so they send you an SMS, or they asked you to set up an authenticator app. But those processes become disconnected.</p>
<p>And what typically happens then is when someone is not able to get into their account, because let’s say they lost their phone, they were locked out, their account password was compromised, they don’t remember the complicated answer to a credit check security question. Then they’re back on the phone with customer support, trying to get back into their account. And we fall to the lowest common denominator of that poor customer service agent who was trying their best to essentially be an identity detective and ask the person all these different questions, the best they can to guess, is this person who they say they are in order to reset access to their account?</p>
<p>And that becomes the weakest line of defence. That’s where typically in today’s world, accounts get penetrated. It’s where account takeovers happen. It’s where accounts are compromised. And as we all know, if somebody can be you, if they can impersonate you, they essentially can take over access to your digital assets.</p>
<p>Oscar: Often when we talk about identity, we think of identity of people, most of them. Most of the use cases go in that direction. But of course, there’s also identity of companies, organisations, more broadly speaking. So, with someone who is on the metaverse, there will be of course company, there will be business, you can buy something, or you could be able to buy even well-known brands should be– I guess they will be in the metaverse, so you can buy a property, right, real estate. How do you deal with these businesses, how they would prove their identity in the metaverse?</p>
<p>Aaron: We’re seeing growth and you’re absolutely right, different metaverse communities, Decentraland probably being a popular example, where brands are putting up shops. They are purchasing real estate, so to speak. And they’re putting up virtual storefronts as a way to make their brand known in new environments. And that’s an exciting development, that makes a lot of sense. It’s great for brand outreach for people that are engaging in those platforms to be able to see those brands.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, we run into the same kind of know your business, or the business-to-business same identity challenges that again, you talked about with so many on this podcast, where it’s difficult to know the authenticity of the of the brand, partly because we don’t know the identity of the individuals behind the brand. And so, if we haven’t solved the way to know who people are, when they’re interacting with platforms, or in a digital way or over the internet, it makes it even harder to link those individuals to brands to be able to trust that those brands are authentic.</p>
<p>And so, I think one of the first steps in solving for business is solving for the individual. If we can identify individuals in a consistent and secure way, we can then link those identities to business entities. And we can have a greater sense of confidence, is this business the one that we think is who they’re purporting to be on a platform?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, proving the identity of the individuals first, the ones who are behind the… yeah, those businesses that we could see on the metaverse. So, have you been yourself exploring them, some metaverses already?</p>
<p>Aaron: We have. You know, they’re so interesting right now, because we have a lot of new companies that are starting up trying to build metaverses as kind of the next generation of really building online communities. And a lot of them were fascinated with this concept of building trust. In fact, some of the newer upstarts that we’ve been working with that are kind of all getting ready to launch are very focused on building trust in their community in a way that hasn’t been done in a Web 2.0 context. And they see this identity as a solution to that.</p>
<p>Now, I’ll give you one of the worst examples I think today, unfortunately, is dating. You know, the dating industry online today is kind of scary. You know, you sign up with a username. Sometimes it’s linked to a social account. I don’t personally do a lot on the dating app scene, but it is a very big area where we engage on the business side from Nametag today. Because someone shows up on a dating app, you’re starting to get to know that person, you’re going to go meet in person offline, which requires an enormous amount of trust.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, we hear these stories. You’ve seen the Netflix show on catfishing. And, you know, The Tinder Swindler, and all these sorts of activities, because we don’t authentically know, the dating platforms don’t authentically know the identity of the people that are on there. And so, it’s difficult to build trust with someone that you’re about to meet online, if you don’t really know or the platform doesn’t know who they are.</p>
<p>So in the metaverse, companies that are trying to think about building next generation experiences, have either been kind of in two camps, I would say. One, they’re extreme on anonymity. And unfortunately, their early environments have seen high cases of harassment and in many different forms and places where people don’t feel comfortable or welcome. And then we’ve seen, I think, a newer generation that we’ll see emerge more even in the coming months, where they’re putting a greater priority on knowing the identity of the people to create a safe space.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, definitely, it’s interesting hearing from your experience already talking with companies who are building the metaverse that there is interest in having proper identification of people. So that’s definitely great to hear.</p>
<p>Aaron: Identity is everywhere. It’s why this podcast is such an exciting topic for all of your listeners. It’s such a pervasive concept that we see, you know, so many of you talking about it in opening bank accounts and financial services, but it’s so much more. And when you start to think a bit in environments where people want to build trust, particularly social environments, which is what the metaverse really represents, places where people can be social, over time, be professional, but grounded in knowing who that person is, as opposed to just kind of making virtual friends that might be real. They might be human. They might be who they claim to be, or they might not be. I’m deeply optimistic that we can create this metaverse environment or the next generation of the internet or Web 3.0 with a greater sense of authenticity behind people to create safer and more trusted spaces.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. I think we will do that. Well, very interesting conversation about the Metaverse and with your special view from working on Nametag. Finally, one question we asked all our guests is that for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Aaron: I’m very focused on this concept of kind of the weakest link. And I would encourage everyone listening to understand how their organisation responds when a customer, an employee, a user is locked out of their account and in need of support. All too often, the methods of getting them back in are the weakest link in their security posture. And I think we can improve that weakest link. We can make enormous strides in using identity to improve cybersecurity more broadly, both in the current Web 2.0 world and certainly as we move forward into the metaverse.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, thank you very much, Aaron. It was fantastic having this conversation with you. So, for people who would like to continue this conversation on the metaverse or anything identity, what are the best ways to get in touch with you?</p>
<p>Aaron: Check out our website at <a href="https://www.getnametag.com/">getnametag.com</a> or feel free to visit me on LinkedIn. We post a bunch of content and love engaging in discussion with people who are passionate on these topics.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Thanks a lot. Again, thanks for this conversation, Aaron. And all the best!</p>
<p>Aaron: Thank you, Oscar.</p>

 TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJYa2pXdjMzTDRBYU1ZSzNGM... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Start a Spring Boot Java REST API 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a Spring Boot app with OAuth 2.0 support:</p>
 
 
 <code>https start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  bootVersion==2.6.7 \
  dependencies==web,oauth2-resource-server,native \
  packageName==com.okta.rest \
  name==spring-boot \
  type==maven-project \
  baseDir==spring-boot | tar -xzvf -</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Modify <code>pom.xml</code> to use <code>tomcat-embed-programmatic</code> instead of the default Tomcat.</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-web&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;exclusions&gt;
        &lt;exclusion&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.tomcat.embed&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;tomcat-embed-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/exclusion&gt;
        &lt;exclusion&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.tomcat.embed&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;tomcat-embed-websocket&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/exclusion&gt;
    &lt;/exclusions&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.tomcat.experimental&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;tomcat-embed-programmatic&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;${tomcat.version}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloController</code> class that returns the user’s information: [<code>sb-hello</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.security.Principal;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(Principal principal) {
        return "Hello, " + principal.getName() + "!";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Configure the app to be an OAuth 2.0 resource server by adding the issuer to <code>application.properties</code>.</p>
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class to configure JWT authentication: [<code>securityconfig</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest;

import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configurers.oauth2.server.resource.OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests(request -&gt; request.anyRequest().authenticated())
            .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run and test your Spring Boot REST API with HTTPie 
 
 
 
<p>Start your app from your IDE or using a terminal:</p>
 
 
 ./mvnw spring-boot:run 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test your API with an access token.</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a native Spring Boot App 
 
 
 
<p>Compile your Spring Boot app into a native executable using the <code>native</code> profile:</p>
 
 
 ./mvnw package -Pnative 
 
 
 






To build a native app and a Docker container, use the Spring Boot Maven plugin and <code>./mvnw spring-boot:build-image</code>.



 
 
 
<p>Start your Spring Boot app:</p>
 
 
 ./target/demo 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test it with HTTPie and an access token:</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Startup time comparison 
 
 
<p>I compared startup times between frameworks by running each image three times before recording the numbers. Then, I ran each app five more times and averaged the results. I gathered these numbers on a 2019 MacBook Pro with an SSD, 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor, and 64 GB of RAM.</p>
 

 

 
 
 
<p>Versions used: Quarkus 2.9.0, Micronaut 3.4.3, Helidon 2.5.0, and Spring Boot 2.6.7 with Spring Native 0.11.5.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Memory usage comparison 
 
 
<p>I tested the memory usage (in megabytes) of each app using the command below. I ran it right after I started the app, after a single authenticated request, and after five authenticated requests.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color &lt;executable&gt; | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The chart below shows the memory usage after five requests.</p>
 
 

 
 
 What about the MacBook Pro M1 Max? 
 
<p>My MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) with Apple M1 Max builds much faster, apps startup 2x faster, but they use more memory.</p>

The remaining 51.25%(512,500,000 MMUI) has been reserved for various purposes such as MetaMUI Treasury, Team, and Marketing/Operations.</p><p>Until 2021, the total supply was 1,000,000,000 MMUI, but our team had conducted a coin swap process during 2021. The migration was from the ERC20 MUI to MMUI, and there were 15,403,071.526791 MMUI coins unswapped, which were burned from the total coin sales amount(487,500,000 MMUI) eternally. Currently, the total supply is 984,596,928.473209 MMUI&nbsp;coins.</p>Total Supply of&nbsp;MMUIMetaMUI Coin&nbsp;Metrics<p>(Please click the link below if you’d like to see the article about the burning event: <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/metamui-5-0-is-now-live-coin-burn-completed-7ed96b74234a">https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/metamui-5-0-is-now-live-coin-burn-completed-7ed96b74234a</a>)</p><p>Here are charts of the reserved supply, total coin sales, and circulating supply of MMUI&nbsp;Coin.</p>Reserved Supply of&nbsp;MMUI<p>The total reserved MMUI for the company is 512,500,000 MMUI. Only 12,500,000 MMUI coins(for Marketing/Operations) are circulating among the reserved coins. The 12,500,000 MMUI coins will be used for expanding the MMUI business and its ecosystem.</p>Total Sales of&nbsp;MMUI<p>482,750,000 MMUI Coins were sold during all the sales phases; as mentioned above, 15,403,071.526791 MMUI coins have burned among all the coin sales amounts.

The MetaMUI team has met and discussed with dozens of Central Banks worldwide during many CBDC conferences and official events. We’ve received numerous proposals from the Central Banks to show our CBDC demo online and offline, and our development team will present the demo to some Central Banks this week. Our development team is also upgrading our blockchain into a new version, and many new features will be updated on the MetaMUI SSID App in a few weeks. Please join our social channels at the bottom of this article if you want to know more about MetaMUI and upcoming&nbsp;news.</p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions truly. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings. Its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. MetaMUI has created a new identity-based CBDC system by combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism. It can protect users’ privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML), and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cardea.app">Cardea Community</a> at Linux Foundation Public Health is pleased to announce the third Interop-a-thon on June 16, between 8:00am and 12:00pm MST (UTC-7:00). Anyone building a Hyperledger Aries compatible product or system can sign up <a href="https://forms.gle/CQLRFRr4NexLoCf36">here</a>.</p>
<p>So what is an Interop-a-thon? The clue is in “interop.” We all want verifiable credential solutions to be interoperable because interoperability means adoption, scale, and ultimately, a network of network effects, as credentials are used across multiple networks.</p>
<p>An Interop-a-thon is an opportunity for companies and organizations building on the Hyperledger Indy and Aries codebases to come together and test their solutions against each other and against a reference implementation (Cardea). They can even bring their own networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also the fastest way to find out if you have any bugs in your build and fix them.</p>
<p>We held the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rYj_RaK0Pi4kGEz3X2Hc0iATi1tzywDNz7SOnK0Hn6c/edit?usp=sharing">first Cardea Interop-a-thon in 2021</a>, testing the core schemas, agents, and interactions key to the Cardea workflow. Everyone who participated found it really valuable and asked us when we’d be hosting the next…</p>
<p>…And so the<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZOSIs-Ncj02hyWfo-NOLEqQDS5U9KNzBXroq09FM0PY/edit?usp=sharing"> second Interop-a-thon was held in February 2022</a>. Participants could do the same testing as in the first but also test out of band invitations and a simple version of machine readable governance, a way to manage governance rules on information flows at the agent level which provides all kinds of benefits.</p>
<p>While the first Interop-a-thon was very much focused on sharing and verifying health credentials, Interop-a-thon II was a signal that these events had much more general relevance to the developer community, the out of band protocol in particular, as it was a chance to get ahead of a significant change to the Aries codebase.</p>
<p>For Interop-a-thon III, we’ll be testing all of the above and both a basic message protocol and a Q&amp;A protocol.</p>
<p>We urge anyone developing a Hyperledger Aries solution to join. These events enable you to quickly ascertain what isn’t working, fix it, and help to accelerate development and deployment. The more interoperable solutions deployed, the more decentralized identity wins!</p>

<p>Today’s small-to-mid-sized business (SMB) is evolving alongside the wider changes sweeping across finance, society and the workforce. While it’s still possible to run a successful business using traditional methods of capital access, customer acquisition, cost management and a myriad of other considerations, digital apps and services give business owners the greatest advantage. More and more, consumers are adopting open banking tools to spend, save and manage. SMBs are increasingly embracing digital platforms, apps and services in order to create the experiences that today’s consumers expect, and to thrive in a fast-paced competitive environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The supply chain and pandemic-related inflationary pressures of the last two years have caused a host of issues for business owners. According to Mastercard’s new <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">Rise of Open Banking Small Business study</a>, rising costs and new methods of customer acquisition, talent acquisition and capital access are all front-of-mind for the SMB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has led to an encouraging trend: SMB owners have been quick to adopt digital tools to fund, manage and promote their businesses. Nine in 10 owners consider themselves heavy fintech users for both personal and business needs. Some other key findings from the research:</p>
 
 Eighty percent started using digital channels for loans in the past two years. 
 Eighty-four percent say technology makes them feel more confident when applying for a business loan.&nbsp; 
 Sixty-four percent have received a business loan through digital channels.&nbsp; 
 
<p>These digital adoption numbers are higher than consumer numbers. SMB owners are forward-thinking. They’re quicker to adopt better solutions, and they’re accustomed to adapting to market conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Digital Transformation is Meeting Small Business Challenges Head-On 
<p>The pandemic of 2020 changed how businesses operate, accelerating a trend toward digitization that was already gaining steam. Banking, finance, investing, saving and spending have all gone more digital, enhancing the convenience and functionality of mobile and online apps and services. Doing business <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/02/16/covid-19-pandemic-continues-to-reshape-work-in-america/#:~:text=Today%2C%20more%20workers%20say%20they,closed%20or%20unavailable%20to%20them.">from home</a> and “on the go” is becoming the norm, and open banking is the foundation for the next-gen innovative financial tools that both consumers and businesses use every day. Small business owners are taking advantage of this transition, leveraging heavy use of fintech innovations to raise their financial IQ.</p>
<p>While business owners are learning as they adapt and adjust to uncertain and ever-changing norms, the Rise of Open Banking study shows that there are a few concerns at the top of their minds on a daily basis.</p>
 
 Inflation. Keeping up with rising costs is the number one stressor for SMBs. With price hikes at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/11/cpi-april-2022.html">40-year highs</a>, businesses are having to find creative solutions to maintain sustainable profit margins. Forty-seven percent of owners cited rising costs as their number one problem. Consumer-facing industries like restaurants and retail face even more pressure, with over 50% of owners saying that inflation is their top issue. 
 New Customer Acquisition. Thirty-nine percent of SMB owners said that reaching new customers was their biggest pain point. Professional services businesses were more urgent about new customers, with 49% of owners saying it’s a continual concern for them.&nbsp; 
 Hiring Skilled Employees. Pandemic-related restrictions and social trends like “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/10/-the-great-resignation-has-changed-the-workplace-for-good-.html">The Great Resignation</a>” changed the employment landscape quickly and drastically. Thirty-five percent of employers are having trouble navigating the new dynamics of a workforce that has a strong preference to work-from-home. Doctors (42%) and farmers (44%) struggle even more to find the hires they need, as do many businesses that require employees to be in-store or in-office.&nbsp; 
 Managing Operations. Twenty-seven percent of owners said that efficient tools and systems to manage their businesses and business finances were a top issue. 
 
 Open Banking Innovations add Speed, Efficiency and Personalization to Banking and Financial Services 
<p>A full 85% of business owners are looking for faster, easier access to capital, creating a clear opportunity to partner with them for customized, agile funding solutions. The number one financial tool that SMBs rely on is business credit cards, but 81% are more interested in a loan that’s tailored to their business’s specific needs. Sixty-two percent of small businesses rely on loans as a lifeline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Payments are at the heart of SMB digital use cases. To streamline the customer journey, owners rely on open banking, embracing digital wallets, cryptocurrency and other new fintech tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connecting accounts to manage business finances provides the opportunity to give personalized insights. It also adds convenience for SMB owners looking for a streamlined way to tackle critical business tasks like banking, invoicing, paying bills and managing cash flow.</p>
 SMB Open Banking Adoption is Strong 
<p>Owners are using open banking innovations to improve their financial fitness. They are creating more seamless operations within their businesses by using intelligent open banking tools that manage the complexities of daily data flow for them. Linking accounts, making payments, getting paid, banking and accounting are just a few of the crucial tasks that are becoming quicker, smarter and more secure through digitization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners are linking their financial accounts to take advantage of new apps and services. Eighty-eight percent are using open banking data to better manage their operations. Eighty-five percent are looking for the customized recommendations that can come from the analytics and machine learning that can be applied to owner-permissioned data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feeding intelligent, rich data into financial management tools is giving businesses the edge they need to grow and adapt, in this era of rapid change. They’re improving their financial health and decision making, while automating tasks and saving precious time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paying and getting paid is quicker and more efficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evolution of banking and financial services is here, and SMB owners are embracing it. This is the first in a Rise of Open Banking series of blogs, where we’ll take a deep dive into some of the solutions powered by open banking for the SMB that is going digital.</p>

Explain what a Verifiable Credential is and what makes it verifiable.  Learn what Decentralized Identifiers are and how they work with Verifiable Credentials and Blockchain.  Discover the two important privacy-preserving techniques employed by Verifiable Credentials.  Understand what the blockchain is and what exactly is recorded on the blockchain when you're using it for identity management.    The 3 models of Identity Management    Transcript ⬇️   <p>To understand how decentralized identity works, it's important to look at what's currently happening and what has happened in the past so we can understand why people in this Decentralized Identity or Self-Sovereign Identity space, as it's also called, are so excited about what this new technology can bring.</p> Centralized <p>So what we have today is a centralized model where we, as users, sign up for an online service, often using something like email and password to create an account. But when we go to another online service, we have to go through the same process again, create another account, and so on. The user ends up with many passwords and credentials that they need to manage.</p><p>And as we're all told, all passwords should be different for security reasons. So that creates a bit of a user experience headache and a potential security risk. We've got all of these different passwords, and if we're not using password managers, we're probably reusing the same passwords for all these different accounts.</p> Federated <p>To try and solve this UX problem, we moved to a Federated model.&nbsp;</p><p>You might have seen this when you go to a site, and you can reuse login credentials that you've created with other companies. For example, Login with Facebook or Sign up with Google. Federated models like these remove some of the user experience headaches because they reduce the number of credentials a user needs to manage.</p><p>But a Federated model also erodes user privacy. When logging in to a website using your Google account, that service can see your behaviour online outside of their platforms. What other services are users accessing? When are they accessing them? That is eroding your Privacy. And, of course, these companies' business model is often based on knowing more about you and then selling that knowledge to advertisers. Or giving advertisers access to you based on your preferences and how you behave online.</p><p>Having companies that are highly motivated to know more about you and then can monetize that data is a very dangerous mix.</p> Decentralized Identity Management <p>Then we moved into the decentralized model. In this model, only the user manages and stores their credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>Credentials are not stored on centralized databases. They are kept with the user, typically in a digital wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>The users can then use those credentials, those digital identities, to access other systems. All the while, they are retaining control over their credentials. The users decide who gets access to their data and what parts of it they access.</p><p>The user can also attach different attestations, or what we'd also call claims, to those identities. We'll get further into this later when we discuss Verifiable Credentials.</p>    What are Verifiable Credentials?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>Verifiable Credentials are digital representations of achievements, claims, licenses, permits, university degrees, etc. They're effectively credentials, but they are verifiable. A third party can check these credentials and know with certainty who issued the Credential and to whom they issued it.</p><p>This immediate verification is very powerful and, of course, very necessary online.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, all our credentials were physical. When we went for a job interview, we would potentially take a physical copy of our achievements, passport or ID document to the meeting. This is how we used to present our credentials and prove things about ourselves.</p><p>In recent years, things have rapidly moved online, and now we need digital and highly portable credentials. We need to be able to take them with us. But with digital credentials comes the problem of forgeries and tampering.</p><p>How do you know that a digital PDF document, for example, hasn't been photoshopped with a different name, photo or achievement title?&nbsp;</p><p>The need for credentials that can be verified will increase the further our lives go into the online world.&nbsp;</p><p>That's what Verifiable Credentials are for.</p>    What makes a credential verifiable?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>Verifiable credentials are credentials that can be verified. What does that mean? With Verifiable Credentials, you take all the data you want to present as your credentials - your name, degree name, birthday, for example - and digitally sign it.</p><p>What does it mean to digitally sign something?</p><p>When a University is issuing you a Credential, they take all the information they want the Credential to contain and pass it through a very complex cryptographic algorithm. That produces a cryptographic hash. A hash is a long string of numbers and letters.</p><p>This hash is "deterministic". If you always make the same data go in, you'll always get the same hash out. But if you make any changes to the data that goes in, the hash that comes out will be different. If someone changes the name or date on a credential in the university example, the hash will be different.</p><p>Because of that, we can very quickly verify that the data in a credential hasn't been changed.&nbsp;</p><p>When someone presents a credential to a Verifier, the Verifier runs that cryptographic algorithm and can verify if the hash is the same. Verifiable Credentials allow you to start using cryptographic methods and algorithms to prove that the data hadn't changed from what it was when it was originally issued.</p><p>A Verifier can always know if the data was modified, which provides excellent protection against fraud and forgeries.</p>    What are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>A Decentralized Identifier, or DID, is an identifier that belongs to you. It's like an ID, like your employer or student ID, and you can have more than one.</p><p>But the big difference is this: the University gives you your Student ID. You generate the Decentralized Identifier for yourself. You own it, and you control it.</p><p>When you use Dock to create your DID, that DID is written on the Dock blockchain. It becomes your representation on the blockchain. It's recorded forever there and can't be changed.&nbsp;</p><p>It's important to note that this DID has no personal details about you. A DID is a string of "crazy" characters, not meaningful to anyone when they see it.</p> Cryptography and DIDs <p>With Decentralized Identifiers come keys.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two different types of keys: the Public Key and the Private Key.</p><p>Here's an analogy to explain how these two keys work: You sometimes receive a "valet key" when you buy a car. So you'll have your regular key, which gives you full access to the car, the trunk, the glove box, everything like that. But then you can also have a valet key, which is a key that you can give to the garage, a hotel that has valet service, etc.</p><p>The valet key gives them access to open the door and start the car, but it doesn't give them access to the trunk or the glove box. So they only have restricted access with that key.&nbsp;</p><p>Private and Public Keys are sort of like that. The Private Key would be like the key that gives you full access to the whole car. And the Public Key would be like the valet key that provides you partial access to things.</p><p>You never share your Private Key! You never share your master key to the car.</p><p>So what happens is when an Issuer issues you a Credential, they use their Private Key to sign that Credential. Like they could sign it with their pen and ink, they can sign it digitally using these keys. This signing process uses advanced cryptographic math to produce a hash value.</p><p>After signing the Credential with that Private Key, that master key, the Issuer sends the Credential to the Holder.</p><p>When the Holder wants to present it, whoever verifies it can know who the Issuer was. The Verifier goes to the blockchain, gets the Public Key from the Issuer's Decentralized Identifier on the blockchain, and uses that Public Key to verify that the Credential was indeed cryptographically signed by the Issuer.</p><p>This is how Decentralized Identifiers come into play with Verifiable Credentials. That signing is the proof of authenticity. Like the rubber stamp from the olden days, the wax seal on the King's letter that proves the King sent it.</p>  An example of a DID created using Dock  <br>What is a blockchain?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>The blockchain is effectively just a public ledger or a public kind of storage of all transactions between several parties.&nbsp;</p><p>All data is available publicly or through a block explorer if it's a public blockchain. You can also have private blockchains, where only entities that have been granted permission can read it or write on it.</p><p>A blockchain is also immutable, and the transactions registered on it in the past cannot be removed or changed. As a result, you have this audit trail that all the parties can trust.</p>    Who created the blockchain?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>Blockchain technology was effectively shipped in early 2009. You have probably heard of Bitcoin by now, so that was when blockchain was available. The whitepaper for Bitcoin, which was called a "peer to peer electronic cash system", was published in 2008.</p><p>As the lore goes, no one knows which people or "peoples" worked on it. It was authored by a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto, and Satoshi's identity remains unknown.</p><p>Interestingly, the original concept of something similar to what we now know as a blockchain goes back a long time. One cryptographer called David Chaum designed a blockchain-like protocol. It's not exactly how it is today, but he put the idea forward in his 1982 dissertation called "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups".&nbsp;</p><p>People have been trying to work out how to make a blockchain or a decentralized ledger system for a while, but it really came into being in 2009.</p>    Why was blockchain created?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>At the highest possible level, blockchain was trying to solve the issue of having parties process transactions without using a trusted central intermediary.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, in a bank transaction, you would have a bank in the middle who you would trust to debit and credit your account correctly. If you're transacting with a third party, you would again be trusting the bank as an intermediary to process the payments as you ask them to. What Bitcoin was solving through blockchain was the ability for peers to transact without the central intermediary.</p><p>So, for example, if we sent you some bitcoin, you would receive it pretty quickly compared to how international Swift payments are. Only we would know about it, and the transaction fees would be minimal because there's no intermediary involved. So that's the main problem that they initially set out to solve.&nbsp;</p><p>With blockchain, they were also able to solve the double-spend problem. You obviously can't double-spend physical cash. If I have a ten Euro note and pay a shopkeeper with it, he now has the ten euro note. I can't spend that twice because I can't clone it, reproduce it, and give it to someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>But with an electronic cash system that has no intermediary guaranteeing that an account is credited and the other is debited, how do you stop that digital currency from being spent twice? And so, a big problem that Bitcoin and blockchain solved was the ability for digital cash not to be spent multiple times, to only be spent once.</p>    3 actors in the ecosystem - Issuers, Holders and Verifiers    Transcript ⬇️   <p>There are three main actors involved in the Decentralized Identity ecosystem.</p>  The Issuer: someone who is sending out the credentials.  The Holder: someone who is receiving a credential.  The Verifier: someone who verifies a piece of information contained in a credential.  <p>If we use the example of a University degree, the Issuer would be the University.</p><p>The University would issue that degree, that Credential, to the second actor, which is the Holder. The Holder is essentially a student. And then you have a third actor, which is a Verifier. For example, a future employer.</p><p>Their interaction would look like this: The University has a public identity (a Decentralized Identifier and an associated Public Key) on the blockchain. They would also publish that identity (and Public Key) somewhere - their website, for example - to allow people to find out what it is. Because of cryptography, everyone knows that only the University can issue a Credential from that public identity and respective Public Key. Only the University would know the Private Key corresponding to the Public one.</p><p>The University then issues a Credential to the student, the Holder, and they can store it in their digital wallets.</p><p>When the student finishes the University course and decides that they want to seek employment, the possible employer, a Verifier, would ask the student to send them a presentation of a Credential. This presentation would prove that the student is qualified or sufficiently qualified as they claim to be for the job.&nbsp;</p><p>The employer would receive a digital presentation of the Credential, digitally signed by the Issuer and the Holder. So the Verifier can then know with certainty who issued the Credential and to whom they issued it.</p> Anchoring <p>Aside from who issued it and who it was issued to, a Verifier can also know when a credential was issued. For that to happen, the Issuer needs to Anchor the Credential.</p><p>Anchoring is like putting a timestamp on a blockchain.</p><p>Note that the Credential itself - its contents, the Holder's identity, the qualifications achieved, et cetera - are not put on the blockchain. All that personal data is only stored by the individual in their wallet. This maintains privacy and security for users while allowing Issuers and Verifiers to guarantee that this digital document has not been tampered with and has not been forged.</p><p>Anchoring merely puts a hash of the Credential on the blockchain.</p>    Benefits of using Verifiable Credentials    Transcript ⬇️   <p>The benefits of using Verifiable Credentials depend upon who you are.&nbsp;</p><p>For an issuer - a University, for example - the benefit is offering their students a new, portable, and tamper-resistant documentation of their achievements. This is not possible with the current paper-based credentials.</p><p>Verifiers also have significant benefits. Let us look into the employer example. In many cases, employers spend money hiring companies that do identity and background verification.</p><p>An employer can remove that cost with Verifiable Credentials because they can instantly verify the credentials by checking their digital signatures. They don't have to phone or email the University or contact an overworked administrator to confirm if "John Smith" did get a medical degree during a specific year.&nbsp;</p><p>An employer can "look" at the Credential and know if John did or didn't. That's a very powerful thing, and it saves a lot of time. Some of those Credential verification processes can take several days, which can really slow up recruitment. Recruitment is super fast-paced, particularly in certain industries, and losing those few days can often cost you an applicant, which can be tough.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, there's a lot of money involved in having your team manually verify credentials. Verifiable Credentials remove those processes.</p><p>On the credential holders' side, individuals are getting control over their credentials and their data. When they need to prove that they have a degree, they don't have to contact the University to get the certificate. Or request a duplicate if they lost it. Individuals will have their credentials in a convenient digital wallet on their computer or smart device, and they can quickly send this Verifiable Presentation to a Verifier. Knowing that when it's received on the other end, the person verifying that Credential can quickly confirm it's legit.</p><p>The entire experience gives much more control to the credential holder and speeds up any verification process as well.</p><p>Another significant benefit is Privacy. There's very minimal information that's actually on the blockchain. The actual contents of the Credential - whether that's a driver's licence, a degree certificate or some other form of identity - are held and stored by the holder in their digital wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>The users' data is not stored on a centralized database that serves as a honeypot for hackers.</p>    Why Verifiable Credentials are private-by-design    Transcript ⬇️   <p>You control and own Verifiable Credentials. You're the one that possesses them at all times, and you have control over who sees its contents. That's the first reason.</p><p>With Verifiable Credentials, you can also do Selective Disclosure. When you present your credential for verification, you can choose a specific part of that credential to share.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, someone wants to know how old you are. You can choose your "Birth Certificate Credential" but only share the birthdate attribute from that credential. They don't need to know anything else about you. They don't need to know where you were born or what country it was. All they need to know is that your birthdate proves your age. So you can limit how much information you share with whoever is asking you to verify things. Selective Disclosure is a great feature to increase your Privacy.</p><p>There's also a next step beyond that. You want to prove you have a certain age, but you don't want to give people your actual birthdate. You just want to say, "I am over 21, or I am over 18. Can I vote?". Whatever the situation might be. You can do that using Zero-Knowledge Proofs in what we call Anonymous Credentials. These allow you to build up a proof to say, "Yes, I have whatever you're asking for", but without revealing the data that supports that proof.</p><p>Let's use a voting example. Michael Scott needs to be 18 to vote. So when he arrives at the poll, the people managing the poll would say, "Prove to me you're over 18". Michael could give them a credential that proves it, but he doesn't want the person sitting there to know exactly how old he is, just that he's over 18.&nbsp;</p><p>Using Anonymous Credentials and Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Michael generates a cryptographic proof that verifies that he meets their standard based on whatever they asked for. In our example: that he's over 18, and he does this without showing them his age or birthday.</p><p>If he's not over 18, they will get a "failure proof" that says, "No, he's not over 18".</p>    In Identity Management, data goes on the Blockchain?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>People are often concerned about what is stored on the blockchain. This is for a good reason. Blockchains are publicly readable, so you want to be careful what information you put on there.</p><p>In the Verifiable Credentials world, we don't actually put the full Credential onto the blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>Verifiable Credentials are verifiable without storing their data on the blockchain. Verifiable Credentials are verified through their DIDs and Public Keys.</p> Schemas <p>When you're designing a Credential - for example, if you're a University - you're deciding what a degree looks like and what fields should be included. It has got a date, a name, a place, the University name, and a degree name. All that is what we call a Schema. You can think of it as a template in your Word or text processing software.</p><p>The schema defines what fields are required for the Verifiable Credential, and that definition can be stored on the blockchain.</p> Expiration and Revocation Registries <p>Many times, Verifiable Credentials are only meant to last a short amount of time.</p><p>For example, in some countries, Driver's Licenses have to be renewed every few years. So the government would issue a Driver's License Credential, and that Credential can have an expiration date. That expiration date can be built into your Credential.&nbsp;</p><p>Now let's say you got into too many car accidents or did something that made the government decide to take away your Driver's License. The government would use the Revocation Registry for that.</p><p>On the blockchain, there's a Revocation Registry, which lists all the credentials that have been revoked. So if an Issuer decides that the Credential they gave you is no longer valid, or they want to take away that Credential from you, they would write to the blockchain that "this credential is no longer valid".&nbsp;</p><p>The Revocation Registry is a registry of IDs that contains no personal information, but that is checked whenever a Verifier wants to verify a credential.&nbsp;</p><p>After verifying that a valid issuer issued the Credential and that it passed all the cryptographic tests, the Verifier goes to the Revocation Registry to check if the Credential was revoked.&nbsp;</p> Anchoring <p>An Issuer can also choose to Anchor a credential to the blockchain to effectively timestamp it.</p><p>Anchoring stores one of those cryptographic hashes on the blockchain.</p><p>As we've explained before about hashes, if you rerun the same cryptographic algorithm later with the same input data, you should get the exact string back that matches the one on the blockchain.</p><p>Note that there's nothing personally identifiable in it. None of your personal information - date of birth, address, etc. - is written to the blockchain. Just cryptographic hashes are.</p>    How to create a Decentralized Identifier and issue a Verifiable Credential  <p>Create a DID and issue a Verifiable Credential for free using <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs</a>.

 Executive Director at Germany’s Financial Authority BaFin Calls out for Innovative EU-wide DeFi&nbsp;Rules  Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority BaFin called for innovative EU-wide regulations for decentralized finance (DeFi) in <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Fachartikel/2022/Kurzkommentare_BaFinTech2022/fa_bj_2203_Kurzkommentar_Rodolphe.html">a blog post</a> that was published on BaFin’s&nbsp;website. <blockquote>Key Takeaways</blockquote><blockquote>- Birgit Rodolphe, Executive Director at German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), mentions in a recently published blog post on BaFin’s website that unregulated DeFi space is putting consumers at&nbsp;risk.</blockquote><blockquote>- She believes that EU-wide regulation for DeFi is the only way to protect European consumers from the&nbsp;risks.</blockquote><blockquote>- Citing Germany’s “Crypto Custody License” as an attractive crypto regulation, Birgit says that the EU should enact similar laws for decentralized finance.</blockquote><p>The European economic powerhouse Germany is known for its positive outlook toward digital assets due to various measures that the German authorities took to regulate virtual assets in the country. Thus, it has been topping the list of most crypto-friendly countries globally for a while now, as evidenced by the more recent report prepared by crypto exchange Kucoin which placed Germany as the first of 46 countries.</p><p>Recently, Birgit Rodolphe, Executive Director at Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority BaFin (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht), called for innovative EU-wide regulations for decentralized finance (DeFi) in <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Fachartikel/2022/Kurzkommentare_BaFinTech2022/fa_bj_2203_Kurzkommentar_Rodolphe.html">a blog post</a> that was published on BaFin’s&nbsp;website.</p><p>Citing Germany’s crypto custody license as a positive and innovative approach toward digital assets, Birgit states that the European Union must also enact similarly attractive regulations for virtual assets. She reasoned that European consumers are at risk from the unregulated, decentralized finance&nbsp;space.</p><p>Looking at the share of DeFi hacks in all the crypto hacks that took place in 2021, it’s clear that Rodolphe is right about consumers losing millions due to “technical issues, hacks, and fraudulent activity” due to unregulated DeFi space. For instance, in 2021 alone, 76% of hacks in the cryptocurrency industry were from the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p><p>Thus, Rodolphe believes that the only way to mitigate these risks is to adopt innovative yet attractive decentralized finance regulations. She explains that EU-wide rules for the decentralized finance space will also ensure the nascent DeFi isn’t fragmented.</p><p>Although Rodolphe wants the European Union to draft attractive regulations for the DeFi space, she disapproves of the notion that the DeFi industry is all virtuous. She further points out that just because decentralized finance is based on new-age technologies, it cannot absolve the industry from playing by the rules and following the law of the&nbsp;land.</p><p>We knew that sooner or later, governments around the world would regulate the digital assets market. After all, the growth that the digital assets space experienced in the last couple of years made this nascent industry too large to continue operating without regulatory oversight. Thus, Shyft Network was built to enable multiple use-cases including the secure and privacy preserving infrastructure for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to swiftly adjust to the new reality where they will have to comply with digital asset regulations.</p><p>Take the Travel Rule, for instance. Currently, it is among the hottest topics among the regulators, and we already know DeFi is next. Shyft has got you covered. The Shyft Network is ideally positioned to support the growing presence of regulation in crypto in a way that protects user privacy and prevents the centralization of critical information.</p><p>So, visit <a href="https://www.shyft.network/">our website</a> to learn how Shyft can help you comply with the Travel Rule.

 Your StarkWare Account’s Security now available on&nbsp;Web2 As the wave for self-custodiality gathers momentum, Web2 applications can now allow users to use their StarkWare identities as an authentication mechanism. About StarkWare: <p>StarkWare develops STARK-based solutions for the blockchain industry.</p><p>StarkEx, is a standalone permissioned scaling engine that already powers few of the biggest applications such as dYdX, Sorare, Immutable, DiversiFi and&nbsp;Celer.</p><p>StarkNet is a decentralized permissionless STARK-powered L2 ZK-Rollup over Ethereum, that supports general-computation based on the Cairo language.</p> What is the StarkWare Curve and why does it&nbsp;matter? <p>An account on any blockchain can be thought of as an identity that persists across applications on a blockchain. Ethereum has two account&nbsp;types:</p><p>Externally-owned accounts (EOAs) which can be controlled by anyone who holds the private&nbsp;keys</p><p>Contract — a smart contract deployed to the network, controlled by&nbsp;code.</p><p>All accounts in StarkNet are abstract accounts enabled by contracts.</p><p>Token Transfers in Abstract Accounts work as follows&nbsp;:</p><p>- If someone sends a token to your account, they interact with the token contract to change the recorded owner from their address to your&nbsp;address.</p><p>- The contract then performs a check that the identity that made the transfer is recorded as the current owner of the&nbsp;token.</p><p>With abstract accounts, the address is what matters and not the signature.</p><p>A StarkNet user will still have an address that can be shared publicly so that someone can send a token to that address. The user still has a wallet with private keys that are used to sign transactions. The difference is that the address will be a contract. The contract can contain any&nbsp;code.</p> An Account Design on StarkWare <p>- A&nbsp;owner</p><p>- Verification of ownership using a STARK signature, Ethereum Signature, or simply a key&nbsp;pair.</p><p>- The ECDSA Signature algorithm using the native StarkNet&nbsp;curve.</p><p>For higher efficiency, the Public key for StarkNet must be produced from the private key using a curve that is different from the Ethereum curve. This is where the STARK curve enters the&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Why Does the Ecosystem Need a Sign-in With StarkWare?</p><p>Almost everybody in crypto knows the importance of self-custodiality by now. To a large extent, Web3, led by behemoths such as StarkWare has managed to do what for long seemed unimaginable — shifting the dynamic of ownership from large entities to the end-user. When we say ownership, we mean ownership of your assets, your data, and even your identity. It is impossible to deny that traditional Web2 entities have done a fantastic job in making the user experience incredibly intuitive and consequently onboarding humanity onto the Web. However, it has also come at a cost — the cost of privacy and security.</p><p>Security hacks even among the biggest names in cybersecurity are increasingly and scaringly common. Of course, the ads one is exposed to on a daily basis on their device should be testimony to the fact that there is excessive tracking and monetization of the users’ activity. Today, the average user is fed-up with these compromises and has major trust issues. Do check our recent <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-the-auth-network-b8fab1b5e1f6">announcement about the Auth Network</a> and its roadmap to address this&nbsp;problem.</p><p>When the Ethereum Foundation announced Sign-in With Ethereum(SIWE), it was only a matter of time until somebody extended SIWE to other&nbsp;chains.</p> Sign-in With StarkWare — You Own Your&nbsp;Identity <p>Right since its inception, the Web3Auth team has always been committed to making self-custodiality mainstream and after a series of announcements in this direction over the last few weeks, we are happy to share another milestone — Sign-In with StarkWare.</p> What is Sign-In with StarkWare and what does it&nbsp;solve? <p>Sign-in with StarkWare brings in the trust-free security of on-chain authentication to Web 2 which means that starting today, any user can log in to a Web2 application simply using their StarkWare account.</p> What Problem Does Sign-in With StarkWare Solve? <p>Additionally, Sign-In With StarkWare solves the following:</p> For Developers: <p>Ease of use: Our <a href="https://siwst.web3auth.io/">documentation</a> will show you, step by step, how to build a Log in with StarkWare flow and also clearly outline how to get the Login with StarkWare flow working, end-to-end. Do also check our demo website&nbsp;<a href="https://demo-siwst.web3auth.io/">here</a></p><p>Web3Auth Authentication suite: With Web3Auth, you can build secure, low-friction, self-custodial authentication flows for both Web2 and Web3 users with a single authentication provider. A single integration can fully support all users whether a user wants to log in with a Social account, their FaceID, Passwordless or their crypto wallet and a wide suite of authentication tools provided by&nbsp;us.</p><p>For the User: Sign in with StarkWare allows any Web2 application to authenticate users with their Web3 identities thereby bringing the security and privacy of Web3 authentication to Web2 for the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Today, there are multiple blockchain platforms and thus naturally, there arises a need to have a standard specification for authentication with Web3 identities. This led to the birth of <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md">CAIP-74</a> which allows for creating a chain-agnostic Object Capability (CACAO), based on a signing message as an IPLD object. Sign in with StarkWare endeavours to maintain compatibility with CAIP-74, thereby adhering to a chain agnostic standard.</p> Coming Soon… <p>We are pleased to see how rapidly the entire Web3 ecosystem is developing with the launch of new protocols and dApps every day. We will continue to lead the way in servicing authentication needs for the ecosystem retaining self-custodial principles of blockchain technology.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/sign-in-with-starkware-711d48f2dbbd">Sign-in With StarkWare</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Jolocom’s role is to empower everyone and everything capable of having a self-sovereign identity to freely communicate and share information with each other. Based on this principle, our company was founded back in 2014. While a lot has changed since then, our mission still remains the same. Read the full story of why Joachim Lohkamp decided to found Jolocom as a decentralized identity company <a href="https://stories.jolocom.com/jolocom-who-owns-and-controls-your-data-effc7bc02ee8">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On our 8th birthday, we are grateful to look back on milestones, developments, and challenges that we have overcome. Beyond the tech, we believe in the importance of community and building a space for individuals and companies that are committed to the values of decentralization. We are happy to share our story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We especially and sincerely thank all of our partners, communities, advisors and individuals who have been contributing to what Jolocom is today.</p>



 2015-2016 



<p>These years saw the development of our first lightweight wallet, Little Sister (the opposite to Big Brother), the decentralized identity Wallet, library, and protocol. It was during this time (January 2016) that we joined the <a href="http://agile-iot.eu/">Agile Horizon 2020 project</a> to provide a trusted data sharing provider using SOLID and Ethereum for IoT devices. Want to learn more about our early work with Horizon 2020 and our tech of the day? <a href="https://stories.jolocom.com/trusted-data-sharing-with-social-linked-data-solid-and-ethereum-in-the-internet-of-things-iot-7dc242944624">Check here</a>.</p>



 2017 



<p>As cannot be stressed often enough, we strongly believe in the spirit of community and are thus proud to work with a bunch of partners that inspire and motivate us further. Some of those include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Deutsche Telekom, T-Labs and Riddle&amp;Code to build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCggqdNOGE">a fully decentralized emobility ecosystem</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bundesblock, of which Joachim was an intitator and founding member, and with whom we authored the first of its kind <a href="https://stories.jolocom.com/a-universal-identity-layer-we-can-only-build-together-e297ed5ae4ed">Self-Sovereign Identity Position Paper #SSIPaper</a>, with many leaders from the SSI space&nbsp;  Stad Antwerpen, the Flemish government innovation procurement department, and Digipolis to bring <a href="https://stories.jolocom.com/blockchain-on-the-move-2722b467e31e">decentralized identity services to municipal employees and citizens in Flanders</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  INATBA, the International Association of Trusted Blockchain Applications, of which Kai is a <a href="https://stories.jolocom.com/inatba-advancing-blockchain-across-europe-706417d6f5d5">Board Member</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>For more information on who we are working with, visit our<a href="https://jolocom.io/partners/"> partners page</a>.</p>



 2018 



<p>Jolocom released its <a href="https://jolocom.io/resources/">technical whitepaper</a>, a comprehensive introduction to the Jolocom Protocol for digital identity. Those principles also found their way into our next edition of the SmartWallet (replacing the alpha version from March 2017), which was released in March 2018, running on our decentralized identity protocol. </p>







<p>Furthermore, we joined <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/bringing-self-sovereign-identity-to-flemish-citizens/">the “Blockchain on the Move” Project</a>, partnering with the Flemish government, the goal being to return control over their identity data back to citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



Kai presenting Jolocom’s SSI solution at Trefdag Digitaal Vlaanderen (29.11.2018)



 2019&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>One of our principles is that of interoperability. To apply it in practice, we took part in an interoperability focused proof of concept. The scope of the project was to achieve interoperability across a multistep use case, called OSIP 2.0. In the same year, we had the pleasure of traveling to the headquarters of Deutsche Telekom in Bonn for the official launch of Xride. This fully decentralized e-mobility pilot was initiated by T-Labs and built in collaboration with Riddle &amp; Code, Bundesdruckerei, Simple Mobility, and Jolocom. Find out more about our role in this project <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/xride/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Started in 2014, the DWeb community took off in February 2019 and soon formed a thriving network of Nodes with Jolocom as the leader of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/dweb-berlin/">DWebBLN Node</a> (formerly Digital Identity Meetups Berlin).&nbsp;</p>



One of the past DWebBLN in person events.



 2020&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Starting the new decade right, Jolocom participated as SSI technology provider in 4 of 11 competing regional showcase projects developing ecosystem solutions. The Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten (SDI) innovation competition was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economics Affairs and Energy. Eventually, our projects <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/once-eidas/">ONCE</a>, <a href="https://www.sdika.de/">SDIKA</a>, and <a href="https://id-ideal.de/">ID-IDEAL</a> were selected for a three year implementation phase. The SDI projects are special because they bring a broad and diverse group of stakeholders to the table who are working together to kick-start an ecosystem for decentralized identities. Interoperability is at their core, so that the use of digital identification does not remain inefficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



The scope of SDI



<p>Furthermore, the Jolocom SmartWallet passed a GDPR compliance audit, a major milestone to becoming fully <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/production-ready-smartwallet/">production-ready</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 2021&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In spring we began the implementation phase for the project ONCE, followed by ID-Ideal in the summer of 2021. In the initial phase, the projects focused extensively on the development, implementation and integration of the technical components. Soon, however, the implementation of first use cases from the areas of public administration, mobility and tourism will come to the fore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the years, Jolocom pulled off a great number of project implementations. The focus here is of course on SSI. But Jolocom has also been able to acquire a lot of knowledge through active work in the field of technology or in networks of various bodies (e.g. W3C, DIF, INATBA) and consortia (e.g. Essif-Labs, SDI lighthouse projects). All that, in turn, helped to build out our core solution stack.&nbsp;</p>







<p>A great example is the ConDIDi project, where Jolocom built a use case for decentralized conference participant management together with the TIB Leibniz in Hannover, which can be tried out <a href="https://labs.tib.eu/condidi/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tech developments and projects with Jolocom are constantly evolving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To Jolocom the community matters, and we believe that core protocols need to be shared to enable an open infrastructure. This is why Jolocom implemented two essential building blocks for SSI <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/jolocoms-contributions-to-dif/">(DIDCommv2 and KERI) in Rust, and donated them to DIF</a> (Decentralized Identity Foundation).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, Jolocom implemented the <a href="https://github.com/jolocom/Stacks-did-method/blob/main/README.md">did:stack:v2</a> for Stacks Foundation. Jolocom’s SSI integration for Stacks addresses the issue of properly verifiable and secure information from different parties.&nbsp;</p>



 2022&nbsp; 



<p>The year has started by launching the Jolocom Agent to further compliment the full Jolocom end-to-end solution. The Agent is for creating, issuing and managing verifiable credentials and define, perform and manage verifications. The Agent provides a Graphical User Interface for ease of use and rapidly bulding out your use case. An APIs is avalilable for a seemless integration in your backend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course much more has happened. A good way of keeping track of our progress, partnerships, community and more is getting <a href="https://jolocom.io/about/#newsletter">the monthly Jolocom’s SSI Digest</a> in your inbox.&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://jolocom.io/about/#newsletter">Sign up to SSI Digest</a>



<p>What’s next: beside the launch of multiple use cases in the second half of 2022, we are also working hard to ship the Jolocom SDK 2.0 to you. Stay tuned!</p>

				  Indicio takes the stress out of managing this essential upgrade with two new integration packages  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>To learn more about the DID:Indy Method—and why you need it—we invite you to join us on May 24th for the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/">Indicio Identity Community Meetup</a> where we will have code authors to talk you through the details and answer your questions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>By James Schulte</p>
<p>The Hyperledger <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/">Indy DID Method</a> is a major step forward in interoperability. As Indicio’s CTO, Ken Ebert <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-completes-hyperledger-indy-did-method-a-milestone-in-the-evolution-of-decentralized-identity-network-interoperability/">put it</a>, “The Indy DID Method paves the way for Hyperledger Indy credentials to scale globally by allowing Indy networks to seamlessly interoperate and create a ‘network-of-networks’ effect.”</p>
<p>But this can only happen if all those currently using Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries update their operating systems, nodes, and agents to use the new Indy DID method.</p>
<p>We can’t overemphasize this enough: If you want interoperability between Indy networks, you really have to have this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These code changes build in the resolution of DIDs, schemas, and other ledger objects to the network which contains them.Without these code changes it is very difficult to support multiple networks.</p>
<p>We understand this can be a time consuming process and, in the case of upgrading agents, it could be a heavy lift. So why not let the authors of the code implement it for you?</p>
<p>Enter Indicio’s DID:Indy Integration Service Packages!</p>
<p>Two packages: One for agents and one for networks<br>Upgrading customer agents is the most complex part of the process and where you’ll benefit most from knowledgeable implementation. We’ll also provide all the training you need to use the new update.<br></p>
<p>Agent Package</p>
 
 Cloud Agent updates for issuers, verifiers, and holders 
 Mobile Agent updates for holders 
 
<p>We can also upgrade your networks if you want to save time—or you don’t have a network operations person to do this work for you.</p>
<p>Networks Package</p>
 
 Full network operating system updates 
 Node software updates for each running node 
 
<p>Again, the Indy DID Method is not an optional upgrade. It’s a major development that delivers interoperability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re here to make it simple and stress free.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks we’ve been asked about data security from places as far afield as Lithuania and Korea. As one journalist from Asia Business Daily asked us: “Security issues are paramount in MyData. How does Mydex manage customer&nbsp;privacy?</p><p>There is no single ‘magic bullet’ that can guarantee data security or customer privacy. Indeed, the belief that there is such a magic bullet (usually some techno-fix such as blockchain) is one of the biggest dangers. That’s because data security is about system-wide design, where many different elements need to fit together to create a working&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Mydex’s approach to data security is therefore multi-faceted and multi-levelled. It includes:</p>  Encryption: all data handled by Mydex is encrypted in motion and at&nbsp;rest.  Architecture: big, centralised databases holding records about millions of citizens attract hackers. With our infrastructure, each individual’s personal data store is separately encrypted. This means that to get a million records, hackers would have to conduct a million separate, successful hacks.  Operating procedures: Each individual holds their own private key to their personal data store. Mydex itself does not know or hold this key, so Mydex employees cannot see the data held by citizens in their personal data&nbsp;stores.  Business processes: We only work with known, reputable organisations that themselves work to the highest standards (e.g. government departments). To connect to our platform they have to agree to Terms and Conditions and Information Sharing Agreements with citizens designed to protect citizens’ privacy and&nbsp;data.  Citizen control: Citizens can easily see what data they are sharing with which organisations for what purposes, via their own Consent Dashboard. They can use this Dashboard to view ‘consent receipts’ that confirm their agreements with each organisation, and can change or revoke these permissions if they wish&nbsp;to.  External audit and accreditation: All our systems and processes are independently audited to international standards. We have held ISO 27001 accreditation for Information Security and Management for the last nine&nbsp;years.  <p>We don’t believe it’s possible to ensure data security without thinking through how the system as a whole works, looking at it from every angle: structure, incentives, governance, processes and, yes, technology.</p><p>With the way our current data economy works however, many necessary elements are either missing or badly designed — generating incentives that undermine rather than enhance data security for example. That’s why our current system is so insecure, and why there is so little trust in&nbsp;it.</p><p>There isn’t a magic bullet for ensuring data security and customer privacy. But there is a way of tackling the challenge so that robust, reliable ways forward are&nbsp;found.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/getting-data-security-right-36d291cac156">Getting Data Security Right</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Install a JDK with GraalVM 
 
 
<p>Use SDKMAN to install Java 17 with GraalVM</p>
 
 
 
 sdk install java 22.1.0.r17-grl 
 
 
 
 
 
 Generate an OAuth 2.0 access token 
 
 
 
 
<p>Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Run <code>okta apps create spa</code>. Set <code>oidcdebugger</code> as an app name and press Enter.</p>
 
 
<p>Use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Navigate to the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger website</a>.</p>

<p>Set the access token as a <code>TOKEN</code> environment variable in a terminal window.</p>
 
 
 TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJYa2pXdjMzTDRBYU1ZSzNGM... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Quarkus Java REST API 
 
 
 
 
<p>Use Maven to generate a new Quarkus app with JWT support:</p>
 
 
 <code>mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:2.9.0.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.okta.rest \
    -DprojectArtifactId=quarkus \
    -DclassName="com.okta.rest.quarkus.HelloResource" \
    -Dpath="/hello" \
    -Dextensions="smallrye-jwt,resteasy-reactive"</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Edit <code>src/java/com/okta/rest/quarkus/HelloResource.java</code> and add user information to the <code>hello()</code> method: [<code>qk-hello</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext;
import java.security.Principal;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    @Authenticated
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(@Context SecurityContext context) {
        Principal userPrincipal = context.getUserPrincipal();
        return "Hello, " + userPrincipal.getName() + "!";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add your Okta endpoints to <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>: [<code>qk-properties</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=/oauth2/default/v1/keys
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the <code>HelloResourceTest</code> to expect a 401 instead of a 200:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;

@QuarkusTest
public class HelloResourceTest {

    @Test
    public void testHelloEndpoint() {
        given()
            .when().get("/hello")
            .then()
            .statusCode(401);
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run and test your Quarkus REST API with HTTPie 
 
 
 
<p>Run your Quarkus app:</p>
 
 
 ./mvnw quarkus:dev 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test it from another terminal:</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test with access token:</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a Native Quarkus App 
 
 
 
<p>Compile your Quarkus app into a native binary:</p>
 
 
 ./mvnw package -Pnative 
 
 
 
 
<p>Start your Quarkus app:</p>
 
 
 ./target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test it with HTTPie and an access token:</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Startup time comparison 
 
 
<p>I compared startup times between frameworks by running each image three times before recording the numbers. Then, I ran each app five more times and averaged the results. I gathered these numbers on a 2019 MacBook Pro with an SSD, 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor, and 64 GB of RAM.</p>
 

 

 
 
 
<p>Versions used: Quarkus 2.9.0, Micronaut 3.4.3, Helidon 2.5.0, and Spring Boot 2.6.7 with Spring Native 0.11.5.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Memory usage comparison 
 
 
<p>I tested the memory usage (in megabytes) of each app using the command below. I ran it right after I started the app, after a single authenticated request, and after five authenticated requests.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color &lt;executable&gt; | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The chart below shows the memory usage after five requests.</p>
 
 

 
 
 What about the MacBook Pro M1 Max? 
 
<p>My MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) with Apple M1 Max builds much faster, apps startup 2x faster, but they use more memory.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom’s Online Gambling market is one of the best performers in the world. It dominates Europe’s Online Gambling market, <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2020/12/European-Online-Gambling-Key-Figures-2020-Edition.pdf">accounting for over 30% of total online gaming revenue in 2020</a>, and has seen constant year-over-year growth.</p>



<p>From April 2020 to March 2021, the UK’s Online Gambling market saw a gross gambling yield of £6.9bn – an increase of 18.4% from the previous year. Of this, online casinos made up the vast majority, generating £4.0bn in GGY. This is followed by sports betting and bingo, according to <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/industry-statistics-november-2021">the Gambling Commission</a>.</p>



<p>Since becoming fully regulated following the enactment of the Gambling Act 2005, Online Gambling has steadily grown in the UK, with sports betting, online casinos, and bingo each being widely available. As of 2021, it’s reported that there are over 2,439 gambling operators in the UK market, the vast majority of which offer iGaming services.</p>



<p>Like all other regulated markets, the UK experiences its share of friction between operators and regulators. Online Gambling regulations in the UK have been present for quite some time and are somewhat of a double-edged sword for operators – some regulations provide benefits, but others limit operator freedoms.</p>



<p>For example, strict anti-underaged gambling and security regulations mean operators have to invest in strong processes. However, this benefits them in the longer term, as these processes aid in deterring <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underaged gambling</a> and fraud. In parallel, there are also some regulations that don’t favor operators, such as a range of limits on advertising. This is the give and take inside a highly-regulated environment.</p>



 Why Online Gambling needs to be regulated in the UK 



<p>Regulation is crucial for the Online Gambling market in the UK. It’s beneficial to both operators and players, with the core focus of regulations being the safety of all parties. This is done through regulations that promote important points such as fraud prevention, anti-underaged gambling processes, and money muling.</p>



<p>With Online Gambling being easily accessible, each of these things – and more – are vital. The ease for underaged users to claim to be adults is quite high, so it is clear as to why we witnessed the introduction of regulations bringing in ID verification and other anti-underaged gambling tools. In the same light, using Online Gambling to ‘clean’ money is a common criminal practice, so this is why many regulations focus on anti-money laundering processes.</p>



<p>It’s also important to consider how sports events impact Online Gambling and why regulation is vital in this segment. Euro 2020 saw a huge <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ensure-player-friendly-id-verification/">increase in player verification</a>, with millions of pounds being waged throughout the tournament. It’s easy for fraudsters to attempt to slip through the cracks in such a busy period, where operators may be overwhelmed with player signups.</p>



 Online Gambling in the United Kingdom 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">Gambling Commission</a> is the key regulator of gambling in the United Kingdom, both traditional brick and mortar and online. It was created when the Gambling Act 2005 became law, and updated gambling laws and regulations to keep up with technology, particularly Online Gambling.</p>



<p>There are many different laws and regulations covering gambling in the UK. They include focus points such as fraud prevention, anti-underage gambling, know your customer requirements, anti-money laundering checks, operator advertisement limitations, and much more. Key regulations are outlined on <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/about-us/guide/gambling-related-legislation">the Gambling Commission’s website</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/19/contents">Gambling Act 2005</a>.</p>



<p>Some of the most noticeable regulations include customer identity verification requirements. They ensure that a thorough onboarding process checks customer identities before allowing them to gamble, which includes age verification checks, verification of names, addresses, and date of birth during the onboarding process.</p>



<p>The identity verification requirements come as both positive and negative for players and operators. On one hand, both are more protected, with underaged or at-risk users having a more difficult time being able to gamble. However, these requirements also lengthen the onboarding process, which is negative for both parties. Players may get bored while waiting, they may be missing required documents, or struggle with the process, thus potentially turning them away from the gambling website and a loss of customers for the operator.</p>



 The UK Gambling Commission’s new rules for September 2022 



<p>Changes are coming to the UK gambling market, with the Gambling Commission outlining new rules going into effect on 12 September 2022.</p>



<p>These rules aim to protect at-risk customers and require operators to:</p>



  Monitor a specific range of risk indicators, as a minimum, that identifies gambling harm  Flag risk indicators and place a requirement to take action in a timely manner  Implement automated processes for strong indicators of harm  Prevent marketing and the take-up of new bonuses for at-risk customers  Evaluate interactions and ensure the operator interacts with consumers at least at the level of problem gambling for the relevant activity  Provide evidence of customer interaction for high risk to the Gambling Commission  Comply with these requirements at all times, this includes ensuring the compliance of third-party providers  



<p>These changes only affect at-risk customers, so it is unlikely they will have a significant impact on the UK’s Online Gambling market. Operators will have to limit marketing and bonuses for at-risk customers, but the majority of changes will be on a technical side that won’t impact most players. All the details can be found on the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/gambling-commission-sets-new-rules-on-action-for-at-risk-customers#:~:text=The%20new%20rules%2C%20which%20come,processes%20for%20strong%20indicators%20of">official Gambling Commission update</a>.</p>



 How to get a license as a gambling operator in the UK 



<p>In order to get a license as a gambling operator in the UK, operators must apply <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/service/apply-for-an-operating-licence">via the Gambling Commission website</a>. This includes filling in a range of information, as well as paying a fee.</p>



<p>Of course, the most important part of this is being compliant with the rules and regulations, which are required to receive a license. There are many regulations and relevant information is provided when applying for a license, however, one of the most important things are no doubt the KYC requirements.</p>



<p>The requirements include verification of a customer’s name, address, and date of birth, which are generally verified through the submission of an official government document (such as a passport or driving license) and proof of address (such as a bank statement or utility bill). These documents must be verified during the onboarding process, or before a customer is allowed to deposit funds and start gambling.</p>



<p>Verification methods such as these can cause issues for customers, as mentioned previously, and its possible users will not want to wait to be verified or simply struggle with the process. This risk of operators losing potential customers is a concern, but solid industry figures such as IDnow go through remarkable efforts to address such matters.</p>

 SEC Nigeria Releases Crypto Asset Rules to Regulate Cryptocurrencies, Aims to Boost the Digital Assets Market in the&nbsp;Country  The recently published crypto asset rules outline the registration processes and related compliance required to operate in the&nbsp;country <blockquote>Key Takeaways</blockquote><blockquote>- Under the SEC Nigeria’s new crypto asset rules, virtual assets will be considered securities in the&nbsp;country.</blockquote><blockquote>- Any Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that want to operate in Nigeria or target Nigerians must obtain a VASP license from the SEC Nigeria&nbsp;first.</blockquote><blockquote>- Cryptocurrency exchanges must obtain a No Objection Certificate from the SEC Nigeria before listing any new digital assets on its platform for sale to Nigerians.</blockquote><p>The <a href="https://sec.gov.ng/#:~:text=ABOUT%20SEC-,The%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission%2C%20SEC%20is%20a%20Government%20Agency,to%20the%20Nation%27s%20Economic%20Development">Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria</a> recently <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oluwaseunadeyanju/2022/05/14/nigeria-issues-crypto-asset-rules-in-a-move-that-could-boost-adoption/?sh=773e58b312e6">published the 54-page crypto-asset rules titled “New Rules on Issuance, Offering Platforms, and Custody of Digital Assets,”</a> outlining the registration processes and related compliance required to operate as a cryptocurrency service provider and custodian in the country. It took twenty months for the Nigerian SEC to release its latest regulations after issuing a statement saying that it had decided to regulate cryptocurrencies.</p><p>With this new rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria aims to boost the crypto market in the country. Given that Nigeria is already among the top ten fastest-growing markets in terms of crypto-asset adoption, as shown in the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/new-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-user-global-map.html">Chainanalysis report</a>, the SEC’s stance will help it break into the top three markets globally.</p><p>That said, it also brings the SEC at crossroads with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which views Digital Assets as a threat to the country’s monetary system. Such is the extent of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s negative outlook towards virtual assets that it has barred Nigerian businesses from cooperating with any digital asset-based companies. That is about to change thanks to the SEC’s new rule, as it will grant the crypto businesses in Nigeria much-needed legitimacy. Thus, financial institutions in the country will be able to do business with them without worrying about legal uncertainty.</p> Things You Should&nbsp;Know <p>The new rule classifies Digital Assets as securities, and any businesses that plan to operate in Nigeria or target Nigerians will have to obtain a Virtual Asset Provider (VASP) license. To get the license, the first thing that a VASP must do is submit their white paper and an assessment form to the regulator.</p><p>As for the number of licenses that a VASP may need, well, it depends upon their business category. Take Crypto exchanges, for example, defined as Digital Assets Offering platforms (DAOP) in the rule. They require VASP and DAOP licenses to operate in Nigeria or target Nigerians.</p><p>But the compliance burden doesn’t end after obtaining a VASP license. In fact, receiving a license is just a start, and the real deal begins after it. For instance, a licensed VASP must manage all the associated risks, ensure the availability of relevant resources to maintain operations round the clock, incorporate appropriate security measures to mitigate any security-related complications, and comply with the risk management framework.</p> Trading Volume &amp; Compliance Filings <p>A licensed cryptocurrency exchange must submit weekly and monthly reports on trading volume to the SEC Nigeria. Besides this, they must also submit financial &amp; compliance reports on a quarterly &amp; yearly basis. The deadline to submit audited financial statements is three months after the financial year ends. The cryptocurrency exchanges must also provide up-to-date compliance reports on any special conditions imposed by the regulator.</p> No Objection Certificate to List Digital&nbsp;Assets <p>Virtual asset exchanges must obtain a no-objection certificate from the SEC Nigeria before listing any digital assets for sale on the platform. The NOC rule applies to all individual crypto assets that the platform plans to list for sale to Nigerians. This rule intends to ensure that the exchange has all the necessary information about the associated risks that the respective digital assets may&nbsp;present.</p> Maximum Ceiling for Funding From&nbsp;ICO <p>The SEC has set the maximum amount a crypto project can raise from an ICO at NGN 10 billion. If deemed necessary, the financial regulator may also change this&nbsp;ceiling.</p> Freedom to Choose an External Custodian or Operate on Their&nbsp;Own <p>As per the rules, the digital assets offering platform (DAOP) can either choose an independent custodian or do it internally. The only case where a DAOP must only choose an SEC-vetted custodian is when a project is conducting an&nbsp;ICO.</p><p>About Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p>Shyft Network is a public blockchain protocol designed to aggregate, embed, and leverage trust, validation, and discoverability to facilitate public and private data transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks.

				 <p>The Digital Wallet market is quickly evolving, with many providers and increasing consumer adoption. They are critical to the evolving digital landscape, yet Digital Wallets can still be poorly understood. In 2018 we published a report, <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Current-and-Future-State-of-Digital-Wallets-v1.0-FINAL.pdf">The Current and Future State of Digital Wallets</a>, providing an overview of the state of the digital wallet market and a forecast for its future growth at the time. The report defined what a Digital Wallet is, clarified the Digital Wallet industry and ecosystem, and provided guidance for organizations to move forward as the ecosystem continued to form. Fast forward to 2022, the Digital Wallet market is maturing as providers look to offer users a variety of features. From Apple to Google Pay, organizations are providing us with the ability to make payments online and in-person, store loyalty cards, and receive offers and discounts. As Darrell noted in 2018, this report would need to be revised or replaced as our understanding of Digital Wallets will evolve quickly, and it has.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Current and Future State of Digital Wallets laid down a baseline for the understanding of Digital Wallets. On the fourth anniversary of publication, we revisit this report to further define where we all need to go. We hope you will, too.</p>
<p>Whether you’re just starting to learn about digital wallets or have read it in the past, The Current and Future State of Digital Wallets is a valuable resource. As our real-world continues to mesh with our digital world, the state of the digital wallet ecosystem is an area we should be keeping a close eye on. After all, these wallets will be the holders of our identities and so much more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are always looking for feedback and input from our peers and the public. If you have any questions or comments about Digital Wallets or the report, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We value your feedback and will respond as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The State of Digital Wallets Series 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/introduction-state-of-digital-wallets/">Introduction – State of Digital Wallets.</a>The report is structured to lay down what a Digital Wallet is and what it can do then discuss where things currently stand—guiding approaches that organizations and businesses can take. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/what-is-a-digital-wallet/">What is a Digital Wallet? </a>The general idea of a Digital Wallet is pretty simple – it’s a Thing that we put our Stuff in. The hard part comes when we have to identify what is that “Thing,” what “Stuff” do we put into it, and what does it mean to put “Stuff” in it? What about getting our “Stuff” out? or Updating our “Stuff”? 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/digital-wallet-deeper-detail-digital-wallet-part-3-16/">Digital Wallet – Deeper Detail. </a>We’re beginning to sense that our Digital wallets will become more important than our physical wallets. Think about what you would rather leave at home when you go out – your phone or your physical wallet? Many of us can make it without a wallet, but we feel naked without our phones. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/detailed-capabilities-of-wallets-agents-digitalwallet-part-4-16/">Detailed Capabilities of Wallets &amp; Agents. </a>Mainstream Digital Wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay allow simple information to be “carried” inside them like credit and debit cards, plane tickets, loyalty reward cards and receipts. This section briefly describes some of the capabilities that Digital Wallets are beginning to (or will) support. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/guiding-principles-for-digital-wallets-digitalwallet-part-5-16/">Guiding Principles for Digital Wallets. </a>A few high-level guiding principles should be kept front of mind for those designing, building, and using Digital Wallets to create user experiences. This section looks at ​Consent-Driven, ​Privacy by Design, Security by Design, and ​Portable and Open by Default. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/stuff-in-a-digital-wallet/">“Stuff” In A Digital Wallet. </a>A Digital Wallet is not just a place to store your credit and debit cards. Over time more and more information will be useful in a Digital Wallet. This section provides a brief overview of some of the capabilities that Digital Wallets have or will soon have. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/enterprise-wallets-digitalwallet-part-7-16/">Enterprise Wallet. </a>Enterprises are more likely to have multiple agents – even of the same type – operating in a single Digital Wallet. Enterprise-grade Digital Wallets have requirements that are unique to managing the needs of an organization. Though some requirements may apply to People (e.g. scale), they become more critical when working at an enterprise level. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/agents-deeper-detail/">Agents – Deeper Detail. </a>Agents work on our behalf to make our Digital Wallet work for us. As the adoption of Digital Wallets increases, we will be able to deploy Agents to take care of the mundane, protect us from errors, and improve our lives. This section aims to provide a deeper view of where Agents can go. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/state-of-tech-art-of-the-possible-digitalwallet-part-9-16/">State of Tech / Art of The Possible. </a>We examine the current areas where Digital Wallets are working and discuss, at a high level, how well they are performing. There are still fundamental areas where the Digital Wallet space is facing or will face difficulties. We touch on the user experience, driving adoption and loss and theft protection as starting points to consider. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/further-research-and-effort-digitalwallet-part-10-16/">Further Research and Effort. </a>Research, Development, Education and other efforts are required to help move the Digital Wallet ecosystem forward. A few of the concepts explored here are Trust Registries, Credential Lifecycle, ​Certification, and Exclusions. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/standards-digitalwallet-part-11-16/">Standards. </a>There are few standards in the Digital Wallet ecosystem, and this lack of standards is partly due to the ecosystem still in an early stage of development. Formal standards have not been established in most areas, including self-sovereign identity stack, Wallet portability, etc. While informal standards may exist in some areas, they are not always followed. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/the-user-experience-challenge/">The User Experience Challenge. </a>Digital Wallets have been, for the most part, a miserable experience. Microsoft Passport was the first attempt over twenty years ago, and Apple and Google Pay haven’t been better. The success of Digital Wallets doesn’t feel like we are using a Digital Wallet, and they feel more like using a credit card or enhanced mobile payments. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/business-and-markets-digitalwallet-part-13-16/">Business and Markets. </a>Digital Wallet components will come from various providers, such as OS providers, hardware platform providers, and software providers. The ecosystem will evolve from discrete applications to a more plug-and-play world in the Digital Wallet business market where we can pick pieces. We discuss how the market will develop and then some early approaches that can be used to take advantage of the evolving Digital Wallet space. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/early-business-approaches-digitalwallet-part-14-16/">Early Business Approaches.</a>&nbsp;Digital Wallets should be based on clear, single-purpose use cases, and having a broad Wallet strategy is not advised at the early stages. To make progress, we should consider Single-Purpose Use Cases, ​Backup &amp; Recovery and ​Trust Hubs when building out a Digital Wallet strategy. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/influence-things-digitalwallet-part-15-16/">Influence Things. </a>Innovators and early adopters of the Digital Wallet can benefit by starting early. Three key activities will ensure the ecosystem’s success and that of the investment in this space: time, resources, and funds. We need to look at the necessary points of control and influence in the Digital Wallet space, and as we examine the various aspects, ask specific questions. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/the-upcoming-wallet-wars-digitalwallet-part-16-16/">The Upcoming Wallet Wars. </a>The Browser Wars have seen a lot of investment and changes. However, most browsers work similarly and are interchangeable. As browsers add Digital Wallet capabilities, the incompatibilities and feature mismatches will increase. The Digital Wallet realm will go through a similar process, with many players coming into play and vanishing.

 Digital wallet and credentialing service provider, Spherity, contributes to HDA’s mission of supporting U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain efficiency through technological innovation <p>Spherity has joined the <a href="https://www.hda.org/">Health Distribution Alliance (HDA)</a> as a Service Provider to support pharmaceutical supply chain efficiency and regulatory compliance. Representing the full spectrum of the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain, HDA recognizes the value of Spherity’s credentialing service solution for the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) requirement.</p>Spherity joins Health Distribution Alliance (HDA) as a Service Provider&nbsp;member.<p>HDA operates with the goal of supporting the healthcare industry on policy issues, business practices, and industry guidelines while facilitating their members’ discussions on leading topics. Considering the looming DSCSA November 2023 deadline and the demanding regulatory requirements, it is essential to align on the implementation of relevant solutions according to international standards and compliance obligations. The network of HDA members <a href="https://www.hda.org/~/media/pdfs/government-affairs/position-statements/2020-09-29-enhanced-rx-distribution-traceability-in-2023-position-statement.ashx?la=en">shares knowledge and resources</a> to comply with the electronic interoperability requirements mandated by DSCSA and provide innovative services.</p><p>Spherity provides trading partners with user-friendly digital wallets to authenticate direct and indirect Authorized Trading Partners in real-time. Leveraging decentralized technologies and open standards, <a href="https://www.caro.vc/">Spherity’s credentialing service CARO</a> has emerged as a secure, simple and affordable path to achieving DSCSA ATP compliance. This service gives companies a way to prove who they are in the digital sphere using signed, sealed, and verified data with an easy to adopt web-based solution.</p><p>“In a distributed ecosystem like the pharmaceutical supply chain, it’s hard to be certain if who you are interacting with is truly who they say they are and that they have the proper authorization. Spherity enables companies to perform such crucial checks effortlessly. Whilst our current focus is the DSCSA ATP use case, credentialing can also address many other authentication challenges.” said Georg Jürgens, Manager Industry Solutions at Spherity.</p><p>As a member of the <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)</a>, Spherity supports the use of W3C-specified Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), GS1 messaging standards and data attributes, and open standards to achieve safe and secure credentialing and information exchange between&nbsp;ATPs.</p><p>For press relations, contact <a href="mailto:communication@spherity.com">communication@spherity.com</a>.

 Upgrade sees the launch of decentralized identifier communication protocol Mercury, alongside enhancements to ONT Login and ONT&nbsp;TAG <p>With a goal to build the infrastructure and deliver the tools that will power Web3, <a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a> has been focused on the Decentralized Identity (DID) field since day one. <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a> is Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, designed to be both trustless and private, empowering users and further facilitating Ontology’s mission.</p><p>Having recently made our Verifiable Credentials Software Development Kits (<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ont-id-framework-upgraded-ontologys-verifiable-credentials-sdks-now-open-source-for-all-go-and-7f89f7585528">VC SDKs</a>) open-source for all Go and Java developers, the Ontology team is pleased to announce a new framework upgrade for ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>This framework upgrade will see additional enhancements to ONT ID’s product suite, as well as some important upgrades, including the upgrade of <a href="https://mercury.ont.id/">Mercury</a>, a secure, trustless, DID based peer-to-peer communication protocol. There are also additional upgrades being made to <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>, the trustless universal authenticator, and <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a>, Ontology’s Trust Anchor&nbsp;Gateway.</p><p>In all, this upgrade makes our decentralized identity solutions more compatible and more easy-to-use, expanding Ontology’s ecosystem collaboration and accelerating the large-scale adoption of DID solutions.</p> Upgrades to&nbsp;Mercury <p>As a trustless, peer-to-peer decentralized communication protocol that allows entities to securely transmit messages, verifiable credentials, and verifiable presentations with each other, <a href="https://github.com/ontio/mercury">Mercury</a> will play an important part in Ontology’s ecosystem. In short, Mercury makes it easier for both Web3 and Web2 application developers to complete integrations with decentralized identity solutions.</p><p>Mercury defines several decentralized identifier-based sub-protocols for building connections and transmitting messages, verifiable credentials, and verifiable presentations between entities. The sub-protocol family defined by Mercury includes a connection protocol, a general (encrypted) message exchange protocol, as well a verifiable credential and presentation transmission protocol.</p><p>In Mercury, entities talk to each other through agents. There are three kinds of agents in this&nbsp;system:</p>  User Agent: A user agent is under the control of an end entity, and it can be built as or embedded into mobile apps or other data-rich clients. It is worth noting that user agents’ most important feature is that they cannot be online 24/7. Entities can keep the corresponding secret keys and store their verifiable credentials in their respective local storage, and then use user agents to initiate communication or transmit messages securely.  Cloud Agent: In some business cases where user agents cannot be online continuously, messages and credentials need to be relayed, forwarded, and stored temporarily. The cloud agents play important roles in routing these messages. The cloud agent itself has a public decentralized identity and an attribute of service endpoint, so its corresponding secret key needs to be kept&nbsp;secure.  Service Agent: The service agent itself is also a cloud agent. In addition, it also allows for the issuance of some verifiable credentials (such as diplomas from third-party institutions). The service agent should also have a public and certified decentralized identity in order to facilitate the secure management of secret&nbsp;keys.  <p>To expand on this further, let’s take a look at some examples.</p><p>Let’s say two Web3 application users want to communicate with each other. To do so, they must first establish a communication channel using the connection protocol. Following this, they can transmit messages or verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations using the corresponding sub-protocols.</p>  Connection Protocol: Using Mercury, entities who want to communicate with others outside their own network can establish connections using the connection protocol.  General Message Exchange Protocol: Once the connection has been established, they can send messages to each other through the General Message Exchange Protocol. Messages which are sent to communication partners are encrypted and signed using cryptographic schemes ensuring the highest levels of&nbsp;privacy.  Verifiable Credential and Presentation Transmission Protocol: The Verifiable Credential and Presentation Transmission Protocol defines the methods of how the three above roles interact with each other. The three actors are the holder, the issuer, and the verifier. The issuer can issue a verifiable credential to the holder at the holder’s request. The holder can then generate verifiable presentations from their credentials for proof purposes. The verifier who obtains the verifiable presentation does so using cryptographic proofs.   Upgrades to ONT Login and ONT&nbsp;TAG <p><a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a> is a decentralized universal authentication login component that helps developers shield the details of authentication implementation. ONT Login brings a quick, seamless, and secure login experience to the developers and users of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p><a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a> is an open and decentralized authentication platform based on ONT ID. It provides KYC services for people, finances, and things, making off-chain data encapsulated within verifiable credentials trustable. Through integrations with ONT TAG, entities can obtain different kinds of verifiable credentials from applications.</p><p>In the future, these SDKs and protocols will support additional decentralized identifier methods, as well as Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and other decentralized domain naming&nbsp;systems.</p><p>ONT TAG will allow users to obtain an NFT that can be used as their credentials, while ONT Login will be able to use NFTs to verify the users’ identities. Both will form an on-chain and off-chain data collaboration mechanism and improve the decentralized identity ecosystem as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Ontology’s core focus on providing industry-leading DID tools and solutions is paving the way towards the creation of a safer Web3 for businesses, entities, and users. <a href="https://mercury.ont.id/">Mercury</a>, <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>, and <a href="https://tag.ont.id">ONT TAG</a> are three essential components of the Ontology ecosystem that will make the Web3 space easier to interact with, more compatible, and ultimately, more&nbsp;secure.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

				  SITA recently won a decentralized identity award at the KuppingerCole European Identity and Cloud Conference in Berlin for technology Indicio built; Indicio CEO Heather Dahl reflects on what it means  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>It was a magical night in Berlin, and literally so for Indicio, as we had just been thanked by SITA at the European Identity Conference for being “the magicians” behind their award-winning technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, there is magic in the technology we built, or at least, superpowers: Decentralized identity really can solve the chronic, destabilizing problems of verification, privacy, and security all at once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it only works like magic when you consider some of the other critical ingredients that went into this two-year development journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is vision.</p>
<p>SITA, the leading provider of technology to the air transport sector, saw the possibilities of digitizing the entire travel experience while preserving passenger privacy through verifiable credential technology—a vision that could be summarized in one, powerful, view of the airport of the near future: no lines, no queues.</p>
<p>The second is a challenge—or in this case, something we would all agree is better described as a crisis.</p>
<p>The vision of no airport lines was quickly realized in 2020 in the worst possible way by a global pandemic, which meant there were no passengers at all. How could travel restart under pandemic conditions—how could tourism-dependent economies reopen safely? Could decentralized identity solve this problem?</p>
<p>Yes it could, it could provide definitive proof of a person’s Covid test status without airlines having to integrate with centralized databases of health data, a path mired in complexity and legal liability. It could allow passengers to use this proof in a way that protected their privacy.</p>
<p>But where in the marketplace did such an end-to-end, decentralized identity ecosystem exist? It didn’t. There were, instead, bits and pieces of technology, some open source, some proprietary; and there were critical gaps that needed to be filled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we filled in and built out this ecosystem, step by step, something that could not have happened without the help of the government of Aruba and its openness to digital innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With each success came the renewed confidence to build further, until a technology solution that only existed in theory not only worked in practice, countries everywhere could avail of the open source codebase to deploy similar systems—thanks to SITA donating the code written to Linux Foundation Public Health (see Cardea.app).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third ingredient to this magical recipe is collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, that’s an effortless word, but in practice it requires effort. It was vital to understand what our partners in this project needed to succeed on their terms. We, as a company, weren’t just building a sell-and-forget product, we had to join our partners’ journey and make their destination our goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It fed our creative intensity through many late nights, it meant everyone pulled together to make obstacles disappear and trials happen. And together, we pushed the back of the decentralized identity envelope.</p>
<p>Yes, Covid has, hopefully, abated. But we have a powerful, privacy-preserving way to manage Covid testing and vaccination if the need again arises. And that same technology can now be applied to the entire hospitality and travel sector for any purpose where verifiable data is needed, can mitigate risk, reduce cost, and improve the customer’s experience.</p>
<p>While the Cardea project is now turning to new health data applications, the original vision of a digitalized travel experience has the working technology to take off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actionable data is within everyone’s grasp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And fewer lines.</p>

<p>“Internet governance: una questione di digital trust” è il titolo dell’articolo a firma di tre professionisti InfoCert pubblicato nell’ultima edizione della Rivista italiana di informatica e diritto (RIID 2022, 4, 10) dello scorso 12 maggio, sul tema “La Internet governance e le sfide della trasformazione digitale”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>La&nbsp;Rivista italiana di informatica e diritto&nbsp;(RIID) è un periodico scientifico telematico ad accesso aperto edito dall’Istituto di Informatica Giuridica e Sistemi Giudiziari del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IGSG-CNR), il quale si occupa di fare&nbsp;studi e analisi critiche sia sui problemi applicativi delle nuove tecnologie dell’informazione nel campo del diritto, sia sulla regolamentazione dello sviluppo dell’informatica e della telematica nelle moderne società.&nbsp;</p>



 Un nuovo ecosistema digitale per bilanciare gli interessi di cittadini e mercato&nbsp; 



<p>Una rete internet impostata su una governance affidabile e utilizzabile a livello globale ha sicuramente alla base due pilastri principali, capaci di renderla forte: regolamentazione e identità digitale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In un momento storico come questo, dove Internet ha creato una relazione molto intima con gli utenti è sempre più importante, infatti, che il regolatore prenda posizione.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nello scrivere il loro contributo “Internet governance: una questione di digital trust”, Igor Marcolongo – Head of Business &amp; Solutions Compliance, Lorenzo Piatti – Head of Trust Specialists, Business &amp; Solutions Compliance ed Alessandra Bossi Analyst, Business &amp; Solutions Compliance, si soffermano sul tema del trust digitale, analizzando più aspetti di fondamentale importanza. &nbsp;</p>



<p>L’analisi parte dal concetto di internet governance, cos’è e qual è l’impatto che essa ha avuto a livello teorico-filosofico, di conseguenza qual è il rapporto tra legge e codice, per arrivare alle evoluzioni portate avanti dai legislatori italiano ed europeo in ottica migliorativa, al fine di garantire un ecosistema in grado di bilanciare gli interessi dei cittadini e del mercato.&nbsp;</p>



 Quale ruolo ha in questo contesto l’identità digitale?&nbsp; 



<p>Nel corso del tempo sono stati&nbsp;numerosi i tentativi messi in atto da organizzazioni pubbliche e private&nbsp;per approcciare il tema dell’identità online, iniziali soluzioni centralizzate hanno lasciato spazio a proposte federate e le tendenze di democratizzazione e digital sovereignty hanno successivamente permesso il fiorire di un nuovo approccio, quello della Self Sovereign Identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Un’ultima riflessione necessaria è poi relativa alla normativa europea in vigore e sugli strumenti tecnici organizzativi che possono essere più idonei affinché il mercato digitale sia reso sicuro e affidabile. in un momento storico come questo, dove Internet ha creato una relazione molto intima con gli utenti è sempre più importante, infatti, che il regolatore prenda posizione.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have you ever dreamt of shopping where you can earn rewards and spend extra cash without doing anything? Fortunately for you, many rewards sites appeared on the market over the last few years that can save you money online when purchasing on Amazon or another favorite shopping site of&nbsp;yours.</p><p>In this article, we will see what rewards sites are, how you can benefit from them, and the best ones you can find&nbsp;today.</p> What are Rewards&nbsp;Sites? <p>Rewards sites are websites that allow their users to start earning points and win different gifts, such as free products, or take a massive discount on their next orders. In return, they should be referring friends or conducting some tasks — like filling out surveys or submitting some sort of content that can help the&nbsp;website.</p><p>But one question arises. If these sites give you freebies, how do they earn their money? Is there some gimmick? Are they scamming you? These are some of the questions we will answer&nbsp;below.</p> How do Reward Sites&nbsp;Work? <p>Rewards sites generate their revenue by partnering with companies on affiliate terms. To make it simple, these platforms operate as affiliate websites with one key difference — they are sharing the rewards with customers.</p><p>Major brands and ecommerce marketplaces are interested in co-operating with rewards sites, as the latter could drive more traffic and increase sales. As a result, such businesses have more lucrative terms.</p><p>The outcome also favors the end client — they can have a decent share of the commission earned by the websites.</p><p>Customers can earn a cash back for each dollar spent on rewards sites (learn more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/how-does-cash-back-work/">how cash back works here</a>). The good news is that users can also earn free points by taking surveys or watching videos — in other words, you’re <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/earn-money-from-your-data/">earning money by sharing your data</a>. It all depends on the campaigns that are being promoted.</p> The 7 Best Reward&nbsp;Sites <p>Аs with every single niche, we have a lot of choices but not every rewards site can be an industry leader. Let’s see some of the notable names that each customer should&nbsp;know.</p> 1. Monetha <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/">Monetha</a> has hundreds of stores in 9 categories with rewards. Users earn Monetha Rewards for each euro that has been spent on the platform. If you find a good deal, you can get up to 800 Rewards per euro spent. You can convert the Rewards in crypto, gift cards, or donate to&nbsp;charity.</p><p>While the platform is considered a newer one, it holds a lot of value, considering its expansion and better offers popping up daily. Not only that, it also has a huge focus on privacy: user profiles are fully encrypted. It might be not important for majority of users now, but soon Monetha will allow users to share their profiles with stores for additional discounts and Rewards. It’s something not every rewards site can boast&nbsp;about.</p> 2. Swagbucks <p><a href="https://www.swagbucks.com/">Swagbucks</a> is a rewards site where you are able to earn points called SB. Users can use SB to purchase various gift cards and retail items, given as cash via PayPal, or donated to charities like the World Wildlife Fund. You can earn SB by taking surveys, shopping online and in-store, watching videos, downloading apps, playing games online and offline, and doing computer-related tasks.</p><p>You can get up to 10% cashback when It’s a rewards website worth checking out. According to Swagbucks, they’ve given over 530 million dollars to their website members, and they give 7,000 gift cards per&nbsp;day.</p> 3. Rakuten (formerly known as&nbsp;Ebates) <p><a href="https://www.rakuten.com/">Rakuten</a> is most widely known as the kit sponsor for FC Barcelona. However, it owns Ebates (the previous name of the reward site) for around eight years now. It is an excellent cashback service that lets you earn while you&nbsp;shop.</p><p>It’s easy to establish and connect your accounts, and Rakuten gives you plenty of opportunities to accumulate points through the various offers available there.</p><p>You usually earn points — like 1% for the value of all Apple products, 2% of all Nikes, etc. However, there are times when you can save a lot of money with up to 35–40% of the value of the products. All you need to do is seek great&nbsp;deals.</p> 4. BeFrugal <p><a href="https://www.befrugal.com/home/">BeFrugal</a> is a cashback site that gives you cash for every online purchase you make.

  <p>Micro frontends continue to gain interest and traction in front-end development. The architecture models the same concept as micro services - as a way to decompose monolithic front-end applications. And just like with micro services, micro frontends have complexities to manage.</p>

<p>This post is part two in a series about building an e-commerce site with Angular using micro frontends. We use Webpack 5 with Module Federation to wire the micro frontends together, demonstrate sharing authenticated state between the different front ends, prepare for deployment using dynamic module loading, and deploy it all to <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>’s free hosting plan.</p>

<p>In this second post, we’re building on the site we created in part one, <a>How to Build Micro Frontends Using Module Federation in Angular</a>. Let’s add dynamic module loading to our cupcake e-commerce site, secure unprotected routes, and set up the site for deployment in Vercel, a service designed to improve the front-end development workflow. 🎉</p>

<p>In the end, you’ll have an app that looks like this publicly available through Vercel:</p>

 Review the Angular micro-frontends project using Webpack and Module Federation 

<p>Let’s start by refreshing our memories—dust off your project from the <a>first post</a>. Just like last time, we’ll need both IDE and the terminal.</p>

<p>We have the host application, <code>shell</code>, and two micro-frontend remotes, <code>mfe-basket</code> and <code>mfe-profile</code>. We’re using <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> to help facilitate the Module Federation plugin configuration. The cupcake basket functionality code resides in the shared library, and we share authenticated state using Okta’s SDKs.</p>

<p>Serve all of the Angular applications in the project by running:</p>

   <code>npm run run:all
</code>   

<p>When you run the project, you should see all the beautiful cupcakes this store sells. You’ll be able to sign in, view your profile, add items to your basket, view your cupcake basket, and sign out. All the basics for handling your sweet treat needs!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If you want to skip the first post and follow along with this tutorial, you can clone the code sample repo to get going. You will be missing quite a bit of context, though. Use the following commands in this case:</p>
     <code>git clone --branch local https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example.git
npm ci
npm run run:all
</code>     
  <p>You’ll need to follow the instructions on creating the Okta application and updating the code with your Okta domain and client ID.</p>
</blockquote>

 Dynamic loading of micro-frontend remotes 

<p>So far, we’ve been serving the cupcake micro-frontend website using the npm script <code>run:all</code>, which serves all three applications at once. Let’s see what happens if we only try serving the host application. Stop serving the site, run <code>ng serve shell</code> to serve the default application, <code>shell</code>, and open the browser.</p>

<p>When you navigate to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>, you see a blank screen and a couple of console errors. The console errors happen because <code>shell</code> can’t find the micro-frontend remotes at ports 4201 and 4202. 👀</p>

<p>These errors mean the host is loading the micro frontends upon initialization of the host, not upon route change like you might think based on configuring a lazy-loaded route in the routing module. Doh!</p>

<p>With the <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> library’s <code>loadRemoteModule()</code> method, we can dynamically load the micro-frontend remotes upon route change with a few quick changes.</p>

<p>Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code>.</p>

<p>The function we pass into the <code>loadChildren</code> property for the lazy-loaded routes changes to using <code>loadRemoteModule()</code>. Update your routes array to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import { loadRemoteModule } from '@angular-architects/module-federation';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: ProductsComponent },
  {
    path: 'basket',
    loadChildren: () =&gt; loadRemoteModule({
      type: 'module',
      remoteEntry: `http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.js`,
      exposedModule: './Module'
    }).then(m =&gt; m.BasketModule)
  },
  {
    path: 'profile',
    loadChildren: () =&gt; loadRemoteModule({
      type: 'module',
      remoteEntry: `http://localhost:4202/remoteEntry.js`,
      exposedModule: './Module'
    }).then(m =&gt; m.ProfileModule)
  },
  { path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
];
</code>   

<p>Now that you’re loading the remotes within the route definitions, you no longer need to define the remote URI in the <code>projects/shell/webpack.config.js</code>. Go ahead and remove or comment out the remotes in the <code>webpack.config.js</code> file. Another benefit of dynamic remote loading is that we no longer need to declare the modules to help TypeScript. Feel free to delete the <code>projects/shell/decl.d.ts</code> file. 🪄</p>

<p>Double-check everything still works by running <code>npm run run:all</code>.</p>

<p>Then stop serving the project and try running only the <code>shell</code> application by running the following command:</p>

   <code>ng serve shell
</code>   

<p>You should now see the shell application and only see a console error when navigating to a route served by a micro-frontend remote. Success!</p>

 Deploy your micro-frontend project using Vercel 

<p>Now that the cupcakes site is working locally let’s deploy this beautiful website using <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. Ensure you’ve authorized Vercel access to GitHub because we’ll take advantage of the built-in integration to deploy changes from the <code>main</code> branch automatically.</p>

<p>First, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo">push your project up to a GitHub repo</a>. If you wish to obscure your Okta configuration, you can make the repo private. The Okta configuration code is not confidential information, as single-page applications are public clients. If you don’t like committing the configuration values into code, you can load the configuration values at runtime or use environment variables as part of your build step. I won’t get into the details of how to handle that here, but I will include some links at the end. Make sure to leave the checkbox for Intialize this repository with a README unchecked.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the Vercel dashboard, press the + New Project button to import a Git repository. Depending on what permissions you granted to Vercel, you might see your newly created GitHub repo immediately. If not, follow the instructions to adjust GitHub app permissions and allow Vercel access to the repo. Press the Import button for the repo to continue. You’ll see a form to configure the project within Vercel.</p>

<p>The idea behind micro frontends is to be able to deploy each application independently. We can do this in Vercel by creating a separate project for each application. Vercel limits the number of projects for a single repo to three in the free plan. What an extraordinary coincidence!</p>

<p>First, we’ll configure the project for the micro-frontend host, the <code>shell</code> application. To keep the projects organized, incorporate the application name into the Vercel project name, such as <code>okta-angular-mfe-shell</code>. You’ll also need to update the build command and output directory for the <code>shell</code> application. Update your configuration to look like the screenshot below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Press the Deploy button to kick off a build and deploy the application.</p>

<p>You’ll see a screenshot of the application and a button to return to the dashboard when finished. On the dashboard, you’ll see the deployed URI for the application and a screenshot of the cupcakes storefront. If you visit the URI, the routes won’t work yet if you try navigating to the remotes. We need to deploy the remote projects and update the URI to the remotes in the route definition. Keep that URI for the <code>shell</code> application handy; we’ll use it soon.</p>

<p>Return to the Vercel dashboard, create a new project, and select the same repo to import. This time we’ll configure the remote application <code>mfe-basket</code>. Update your configuration to look like the screenshot below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Take note of the deployed URI for the <code>mfe-basket</code> application.</p>

<p>Return to the Vercel dashboard to repeat the process for the final remote application, <code>mfe-profile</code>. Update your configuration to look like the screenshot below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Take note of the deployed URI for the <code>mfe-profile</code> application.</p>

 Update the routes to support micro-frontend paths for production 

<p>We need to update the route definition to include the URI for the deployed application. Now that you have the URI for the two micro-frontend remotes, you can edit <code>projects/shell/app/app-routing.module.ts</code>. The values in the <code>remoteEntry</code> configuration option in the <code>loadRemoteModule()</code> method are where you’d define the path. But if we update this value to use the deployed URI, then you’ll no longer be able to run the application remotely.</p>

<p>We’ll use the <code>environments</code> configuration built into Angular to support both local and deployed environments and define a configuration for serving locally versus production build.</p>

<p>We’ll configure serving locally first. Open <code>projects/shell/src/environments/environment.ts</code> and add a new property for the micro-frontend remotes.</p>

   <code>export const environment = {
  production: false,
  mfe: {
    "mfeBasket": "http://localhost:4201",
    "mfeProfile": "http://localhost:4202"
  }
};
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll use the values in the route definition. Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> and update the <code>remoteEntry</code> properties to use the new properties in the <code>environment.ts</code> file below.</p>

   <code>import { environment } from '../environments/environment';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: ProductsComponent },
  {
    path: 'basket',
    loadChildren: () =&gt; loadRemoteModule({
      type: 'module',
      remoteEntry: `${environment.mfe.mfeBasket}/remoteEntry.js`,
      exposedModule: './Module'
    }).then(m =&gt; m.BasketModule)
  },
  {
    path: 'profile',
    loadChildren: () =&gt; loadRemoteModule({
      type: 'module',
      remoteEntry: `${environment.mfe.mfeProfile}/remoteEntry.js`,
      exposedModule: './Module'
    }).then(m =&gt; m.ProfileModule)
  },
  { path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
];
</code>   

<p>Feel free to serve the project using <code>npm run run:all</code> to double-check everything still works.</p>

<p>Now we’ll add the configuration for the deployed applications. Open <code>projects/shell/src/environments/environment.prod.ts</code> and add the same property for the micro-frontend remotes. Replace the URI with the deployed location.</p>

   <code>export const environment = {
  production: true,
  mfe: {
    "mfeBasket": "https://{yourVercelDeployPath}.vercel.app",
    "mfeProfile": "https://{yourVercelDeployPath}.vercel.app"
  }
};
</code>   

<p>Angular automatically replaces the <code>environment.ts</code> file to match when you build the project. So if you’re serving locally, you’ll use the contents from <code>environment.ts</code>, and if you run <code>ng build</code> to create the release, you’ll use the contents from <code>environment.prod.ts</code>.</p>

<p>Note: Vercel has a release promotion mechanism where you first release to a staging environment to conduct release verification, then promote the verified application to prod. With this flow, we’d need to add more complexity to the way we access the URIs. This tutorial will simplify things to only use one environment, but if you need to handle a multi-step release environment configuration, check out the links to blog posts at the end for handling per-environment configuration.</p>

 Add your deployment URL to Okta 

<p>You’ll need to update the Okta application with the new deploy location so that you can sign in. Open the Okta dashboard. Navigate to Applications &gt; Applications and select the Okta application you created for this project. On the General tab, press the Edit button on the General Settings section and add the new deploy URI for the <code>shell</code> application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, add the deploy URI as a Trusted Origin in Okta. Navigate to Security &gt; API and then navigate to the Trusted Origins tab. Press + Add Origin. Add the deploy location and select CORS for the type.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Commit your changes and push to your main branch. After the build succeeds, you should be able to use the deployed site from end to end!</p>

 Secure your micro frontends 

<p>Right now, you can access what should be protected routes by manually typing in the full URI to the profile route. Even though you don’t see any profile information, we aren’t guarding the route. Let’s make the site a little more secure by protecting the route.</p>

<p>Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code>. We’ll add a route guard that comes out of the box with Okta’s Angular SDK. Update the route definition for the <code>profile</code> route as shown below.</p>

   <code>import { OktaCallbackComponent, OktaAuthGuard} from '@okta/okta-angular';

{
  path: 'profile',
  loadChildren: () =&gt; loadRemoteModule({
    type: 'module',
    remoteEntry: `${environment.mfe.mfeProfile}/remoteEntry.js`,
    exposedModule: './Module'
  }).then(m =&gt; m.ProfileModule),
  canActivate: [OktaAuthGuard]
},
</code>   

<p>Now if you navigate directly to the profile route, you’ll first redirect to Okta’s sign-in page, then redirect back to the profile route.</p>

<p>Route protection works well from within the micro-frontend shell. But what if you navigate directly to the URI where the profile micro frontend resides? You will still be able to navigate to the profile route within the micro frontend because there isn’t a guard within the profile application.</p>

<p>This brings us to an interesting concept. In order to fully secure your micro frontends, you should protect routes defined within your micro frontend as well. To add the Okta route guard, you’ll need to import the <code>OktaAuthModule</code> into the <code>mfe-profile</code> application’s <code>AppModule</code>, and add the same configuration as you did for the <code>shell</code> application. The Module Federation configuration shares the Okta library between the applications when accessed via the host application. In contrast, <code>mfe-profile</code> will need its own instance of authenticated state when accessed in isolation from the <code>shell</code> application. Having its own instance of authenticated state means you should add sign-in and sign-out capability in the <code>AppComponent</code> of the <code>mfe-profile</code> application too. This will also allow you to test each micro-frontend application independently.</p>

<p>Security + testing = winning!</p>

<p></p>

 Build the micro frontend on a relevant change 

<p>As mentioned in this post, the value of micro frontends is the ability to deploy each application independently. In production systems, you may need to handle multiple build steps and build out an entire workflow of CI/CD, but for this tutorial, we can cheat a little and still get the benefits of separate deployments. We will add a configuration in Vercel only to kick off a build when there’s changes in the relevant application code.</p>

<p>From the Vercel dashboard, open the Vercel project for the <code>mfe-basket</code> application. Navigate to the Settings tab and select Git. In the Ignored Build Step, we can add a Git command to ignore all changes except those in the <code>projects/mfe-basket</code> directory.</p>

<p>Add the following command:</p>

   <code>git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD ./projects/mfe-basket
</code>   

<p>Next, open the Vercel project for the <code>mfe-profile</code> application to update the Ignored Build Step command. Now add this command:</p>

   <code>git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD ./projects/mfe-profile
</code>   

<p>Lastly, open the Vercel project for the <code>shell</code> application to update the Ignored Build Step command. This command is a little different because we want to pick up any changes to the project excluding this changes to <code>mfe-basket</code> and <code>mfe-profile</code>. Add the following command:</p>

   <code>git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD -- ':!projects/mfe-basket' ':!projects/mfe-profile'
</code>   

<p>Now, if you make a change in a micro-frontend application, only that micro-frontend application will build and deploy. All three projects will notice the change and start building but will immediately cancel the build if the build step should be ignored for the project.</p>

 Beyond this post 

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed creating and deploying this micro-frontend e-commerce site with beautiful pictures of tasty cupcakes. In this post, we used dynamic module loading to load micro frontends lazily within the host application, deployed the project to Vercel, added in multi-environment route configuration, and leveraged a micro-frontend benefit by enabling deployment upon relevant changes. You can check out the completed code for this project in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example/tree/deploy"><code>deploy</code> branch of the code repo</a> by using the following command:</p>

   <code>git clone --branch deploy https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example.git
</code>

<p>As you’d be aware, two of the most widely discussed software/service requirements are&nbsp;security&nbsp;and&nbsp;interoperability. Whether it be for user-level data protection or government-mandated legislative compliance, enterprises require innovative security solutions that help them meet emerging threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decentralized security solutions are built on security and privacy-focused paradigms, such as Ann Cavoukian’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">Privacy By Design</a>, which emphasize end-to-end encryption, least privileges (for data access), etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interoperability has also become a business necessity. While email is a ubiquitous interoperable standard, the more recent secure encrypted messaging systems have emerged as single company controlled “walled gardens” that create vendor lock-in rather than introducing new types of interoperable service offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The standardized decentralized identity service offerings will enable business to attain both strong security and cross-platform interoperability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve previously&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/07/the-business-benefits-from-using-decentralized-identity-technologies-for-customer-identity-management/">noted</a>&nbsp;on this blog that businesses that seize the opportunity to implement emerging standardized decentralized Identity technologies will create a long-term competitive advantage that will enable them to get ahead of the competition and maintain these advantages far into the future.</p>



 



 For proactive organizations, decentralized identity technologies will:&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 <br> 



  reduce the need for centralized databases (and the data items they contain) to the absolute minimum (e.g. for regulatory purposes) and thus give customers complete control and ownership over their personal data&nbsp;&nbsp;  reduce vulnerability to data misuse by those charged with managing it, and to cyberattacks, fraud and other financial crimes&nbsp;  make customers’ lives easier by eliminating passwords for login and ongoing authentication&nbsp;  generate unprecedented levels of human trust between the organization and its customers and partners&nbsp;&nbsp;  reduce the compliance burden of managing customers’ personal data in services&nbsp;  allow participation in an open, trustworthy, interoperable, and standards-based identity management ecosystem&nbsp;&nbsp;  enable exciting new business alliances within which partners can communicate and exchange information securely to deliver services (e.g. in medical or education).&nbsp;  



 



<p>As we said at the start of this article series, Big Tech is scooping up users’ digital exhaust like candy and using it to generate massive profits. Big Data analytics technology is being used to commercialize knowledge of user behavior and influence their digital activities. The privacy crisis is real.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">Consumers want a solution</a>&nbsp;– and businesses, largely due to regulatory requirements, also want to increase user privacy and protect data entrusted to them by their customers. As businesses provide customers with innovative privacy-preserving solutions, customers will reward them with their loyalty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe the solution lies in returning control over personal information back to users through digital identities and decentralized identity technologies – the future of privacy and identity management on the internet.<br><br>Building on the Sudo digital identity and the Sudo Platform privacy and cyber safety capabilities – which contain integrated decentralized identity enhancements – enterprises can rapidly develop and deploy branded privacy and cyber safety solutions to their customers and create a significant competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talk to us about how we can help you.</p>



<p>Next week, in the final part of this series, we’ll explain how we are actively contributing to decentralized identity development.</p>

<p>Community-driven platform powered by blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs&nbsp;</p>



<p>San Francisco, CA — May 18, 2022 – TRM Labs, the leader in blockchain intelligence solutions, along with crypto industry leaders including Circle, Solana Foundation, The Aave Companies, Hedera, Binance.US and Civic, have today announced the launch of a new community-powered scam reporting platform, <a href="https://www.chainabuse.com/">Chainabuse</a>, which empowers anyone in the crypto economy to warn others about scams, hacks or other fraudulent activity as they encounter it. The free tool enables crypto users, victims of financial crimes, and crypto businesses to take an active role in making the crypto ecosystem a safer place to operate.</p>



<p>Despite current volatility, the cryptocurrency industry has grown considerably over the last few years, peaking at a $3 trillion market cap in 2021. But as adoption has increased, so too has the rate of hacks and scams targeting crypto users. Warnings of scams are often reported on social media sites such as Twitter or Discord, but these posts can be difficult to validate, consolidate or track over time.</p>



<p>Chainabuse is the first purpose-built platform of its kind – a multi-chain reporting tool that allows crypto users to report illicit activity to a public forum where others can upvote, downvote or leave comments to contribute additional information. Reports on the same addresses or entities are consolidated and housed in a searchable database, which anyone can use to proactively check addresses or projects before engaging with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In numerous recent attacks and instances of malicious activity, we have already seen the crypto community’s potential to come together to root out bad actors and help protect each other, “ said Joe McGill, former U.S. Secret Service and Postal Investigator, now part of the global investigations team at TRM and one of Chainabuse’s chief architects. “Chainabuse was designed to make it easier for more people to play an active role in advancing that culture and ensure that the spirit of community remains one of crypto’s most powerful attributes.”</p>



<p>The platform is powered by the crypto community and supported by leading crypto businesses, protocols, and foundations committed to making the crypto ecosystem a safe and trusted environment. Chainabuse provides partner crypto platform operators with a consolidated view of illicit activity reports from users, allowing them to identify prevalent, legitimate complaints and launch investigations more quickly.</p>



<p>“Chainabuse significantly enhances the depth and effectiveness of our compliance monitoring program by leveraging an aggregated view of the distributed efforts of the entire crypto community,”&nbsp; said Mandeep Walia, Chief Compliance and Risk Officer at Circle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The safety and security of web3 users is our top priority. Working with TRM Labs will enable us to reduce scams and hacks, which have cost people millions of dollars. Chainabuse will allow us to work together with industry partners to promote a better environment for the next million participants of DeFi and web3,” said Stani Kulechov, CEO of Aave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“TRM Labs is the industry go-to for blockchain investigations, and Chainabuse fills a missing part of a more trusted ecosystem with much-needed resources for scam victims,” said Chris Hart, CEO of Civic. “We’re proud to forge a partnership with TRM Labs and build more intelligence into the investigative process together.”</p>



<p>“DLT and crypto requires a higher level of trust for more mainstream adoption, and tangible safety measures to protect consumers and users,” said Sam Brylski, Regulatory Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer for Hedera. “We are pleased to work with other industry leaders to deliver a multi-chain, community-driven, and freely available platform that lets users report and be warned about hacks, scams, and fraudulent activity, raising transparency for all.”</p>



<p>The platform launches publicly today with hundreds of reports <a href="https://www.chainabuse.com/browse">available to search</a> across eight blockchains – including over 100 scams related to Ukraine crypto fundraising campaigns and over 20 phishing domains and Twitter profiles targeting investors in a popular new gamified metaverse project.</p>



<p>“The latent fear of inadvertently investing in a rugpull – or being hacked – hampers mainstream crypto adoption and reinforces the call for industry-led solutions to consumer and investor protections,” said Esteban Castano, Co-founder and CEO of TRM Labs. “Chainabuse is the latest extension of TRM’s mission to build a safer and more trusted financial system for billions of people and we are proud to partner with leaders in the crypto industry to expand its impact and reach.”</p>



<p>How to support Chainabuse</p>



<p>Chainabuse is the first multi-chain, community-powered crypto scam reporting tool and is available for anyone to use for free. Organizations who are interested in becoming an official Chainabuse partner or want to learn more about scams reported on their platforms can contact the Chainabuse team at TRM Labs: <a href="mailto:chainabuse@trmlabs.com">chainabuse@trmlabs.com</a>.</p>

 Blockchain Veteran and Core Developer Bryan Bishop Teams Up With Shyft Network To Lead Global Security&nbsp;Efforts  The industry veteran will team up with Shyft Network’s core developers to strengthen security, scalability and interoperability. <p>BRIDGETOWN, Barbados, May 18, 2022 — <a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> (“Shyft”), a public protocol designed to validate identity and power compliance directly into blockchain data, today announced that Bryan Bishop, a renowned Bitcoin core developer, technologist, and veteran of the blockchain industry, is teaming up with Shyft’s core development team to collaborate on strengthening the global network security, scalability, and interoperability.</p><p>Mr. Bishop’s decision follows the launch last month of <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, Shyft’s open-source, decentralized solution for the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule, which requires the collection and exchange of customer data to ensure adherence to international rules against money laundering, sanctions evasion and other malicious activities. Veriscope enables digital asset exchanges to comply with the Travel Rule seamlessly and efficiently and solves for the corresponding “Sunrise Issue,” whereby exchanges in varying jurisdictions come into compliance with the rule at different times than their counterparties.</p><blockquote>Thomas Borrel, Chief Operating Officer of Shyft, said, “Bryan is a brilliant engineer whose significant experience as a developer and blockchain consultant will be extremely additive to our talented team of technologists and compliance professionals. We are excited to have Bryan help us strengthen our counterparty data transmission infrastructure, solve other complex security challenges, and continue to bridge the gap between permissionless and permissioned systems.”</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Bishop said, “Veriscope is a necessary step towards continuing to bring crypto into the existing financial system. Travel Rule has presented an enormous regulatory challenge to the crypto industry, and it’s through open-source projects like Veriscope that I believe the industry will be able to come together and coordinate to solve the Travel Rule problem. It’s critical that we get this right, without increasing risk or harming users. Shyft has built out a platform to do just that, and I look forward to helping bolster the platform with more security for a variety of&nbsp;assets.”</blockquote><p>Prior to Shyft, Mr. Bishop served as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Custodia Bank (previously Avanti Bank &amp; Trust), a Wyoming bank specializing in digital asset payment and custody solutions for US businesses. Previously, he was an early technical hire and Senior Blockchain Engineer at LedgerX (now FTX US Derivatives), where he helped build the first federally regulated bitcoin derivatives exchange. He continues to serve on the Board of FTX US Derivatives. Mr. Bishop is a longtime software engineering consultant and contractor and has worked on behalf of companies including Blockstream and Genomic Prediction. Recently, he launched Webcash.org, a Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency without a blockchain. He was one of the first to receive the original Bitcoin email from Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 and currently advises and consults companies in need of his expertise.</p><p>About Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p>Shyft Network is a public blockchain protocol designed to aggregate, embed, and leverage trust, validation, and discoverability to facilitate public and private data transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks.

 ADVERSARIAL CERTIFICATION — How Mattereum Asset Passports Express Doubt and Disagreement <p>By Dr JAMES HESTER FRSA, Head of Ontology, Mattereum</p>Alleged Cast of a Chupacabra Footprint<p><a href="http://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> recently had the opportunity to launch an <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/11/">Asset Passport and NFT</a> for a rather extraordinary object: a plaster cast of a footprint, in the possession of Mattereum team member Ian Simmons, which was allegedly made by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chupacabra">chupacabra</a>. This renowned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptids">cryptid</a> is famed for preying upon goats throughout Central and South America, and its existence has long been a matter of&nbsp;debate.</p><p>Of course, this particular footprint, though by tradition left by this elusive creature, is also well understood as being more likely that of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_panther">Florida Puma</a>. So while it may not be definitive proof of the chupacabra’s existence, it is a fascinating piece of cryptozoological memorabilia that speaks to how stories about such creatures continue to stir the imagination.</p><p>The project also presented a unique opportunity for Mattereum. Normally, Certifiers adding information about objects to our Asset Passports focus on what that object is. For the first time, we had the chance to showcase the usefulness of an Asset Passport highlighting what an object likely is not. In many circumstances, this latter type of information can be just as important as the&nbsp;former.</p><p>Mattereum has for a long time considered the usefulness of what we call ‘adversarial certifications’ in Asset Passports. These are pieces of information which, while contributing to a clearer understanding of the object, are not always entirely positive in nature. In some cases these could be added to an Asset Passport by the object owner themselves at the point of launch. However, these could also be added later by independent Certifiers who want this additional, sometimes unflattering, information to be a matter of record. These certifications would be backed by the same warranties as other certifications to ensure their accuracy, and to provide recourse if there was a dispute about that accuracy (which is particularly important to reduce the risk of baseless mud-slinging).</p><p>I want to speak briefly about two forms that these adversarial warranties might&nbsp;take.</p><p>The first could be termed a certification of ‘negation’. In this case, a certification is created stating that the object is not something. Our Asset Passport for the chupacabra footprint accomplished exactly this by stating that it was very likely (our certifier was pretty certain, but you never know) not that of a chupacabra. The presence of this assertion in the Asset Passport will make it very difficult later for someone to attempt to sell the footprint as being genuine unless they are able to produce a greater degree of verifiable proof to back up their&nbsp;claim.</p><p>A similar practice could be very valuable for passported items from asset classes prone to high levels of fraud and forgery, such as the art or luxury goods markets. Being able to flag an object as a known forgery doesn’t necessarily mean that nobody will ever want it (there’s actually a fairly decent market for artworks by famous forgers), but it does make it far more of a challenge for later unscrupulous sellers to try to fleece potential buyers by passing something off as something that it is&nbsp;not.</p><p>The second possible form of adversarial certification is more affirmational, but the information being affirmed might not necessarily be terribly flattering. At the moment, there is no requirement for those onboarding assets to disclose absolutely everything about them (although we do encourage them to do so, since the more info is known about an object, the more its value is affirmed and the more willing buyers are to pay for it). So it would be very easy for asset owners to omit information that they felt could impact the likelihood of a sale. In these cases, independent Certifiers could act as whistleblowers of a sort, providing information about objects which shines a light into dark corners to make sure that buyers have the ability to make more informed decisions about their purchases. Examples of this information could include associated carbon outputs from production, poor labour practices, or even evidence that the object had been trafficked or had otherwise concerning provenance.</p><p>Although the Mattereum Asset Passport can greatly assist in making an object more desirable on the market, it is, at its core, not solely a marketing tool. Rather, the Asset Passport is a faithful record of all information relating to an object, and at times that means ‘warts and&nbsp;all’.</p><p>Whether the warts are provided by those onboarding the assets, or by independent actors using their knowledge and expertise to ensure that the truth is made available, they are an essential part of ensuring that Mattereum’s mission of promoting truth in trade is carried&nbsp;on.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/adversarial-certification-how-mattereum-asset-passports-express-doubt-and-disagreement-2eb9e575a964">ADVERSARIAL CERTIFICATION — How Mattereum Asset Passports Express Doubt and Disagreement</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

According to a survey conducted by <a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/medialibrary/en/white-paper/2022-sonicwall-cyber-threat-report.pdf">SonicWall</a> in January 2022, 73% of respondents said they were concerned or extremely concerned about ransomware attacks. This was second only to targeted phishing attacks, which 77% of respondents said they were concerned or extremely concerned about.<br><br>SonicWall’s report also indicates that ransomware attacks grew by 105% in 2021 compared with the previous year, with 623.3 million attacks in total between January and December 2021. Since the annual numbers of ransomware attacks were a total of 187.9 million in 2019 and 304 million in 2020, we can say that organizations have a solid reason to be concerned about ransomware and the challenges arising from it. <br><br>Aside from 2022 trends below, the political and economic impact of the war in Ukraine, state-sponsored cyber-attacks, and the functioning “business model” of ransomware are likely to result in further increases in the number of ransomware attacks in the next few years. We do not expect ransomware attacks to slow down.</p>
 <br>Trends in 2022  
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.theiia.org/globalassets/documents/chapters-and-affiliates/north-america/united-states/georgia/atlanta/cyber-threat-landscape-2022.pdf">Deloitte</a> report states that the increase in cyber threats is directly related to digital transformation. The risk of getting exposed to malicious actors is increasing as businesses accelerate their dependency on digital services. This is contributing to the willingness of organizations to pay ransoms to keep the business running. An <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf">IC3</a> 2021 report forecasts that ransomware attacks in 2022 will focus on critical infrastructure, as governments accelerate their interests in digital transformation of the public health sector, the food and agriculture sector, commercial facilities, and the manufacturing sector.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS): There has been an <a href="https://www.venafi.com/blog/what-ransomware-service-raas-need-know-2022">increase</a> in demand for ransomware as a service in the past 18 months, and it is predicted to double its growth in 2022. <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/">RaaS</a> is operated as a business model by the cyber-attack groups, where malicious solutions are made easily available to criminals. It is a subscription-based approach that makes ransomware accessible to criminals who have no expertise in this field. Moreover, the subscription includes attractive features such as customer support, licensing, subscription offers, customer reviews, and other research material to assist interested criminals in making their purchase decision. The subscription also includes access to analytics such as the status of the attack. RaaS is also offered as a profit-sharing solution, where the ransom is split between the RaaS operators and their customers. <br><br>Evolution of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs): As reported by <a href="https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/ransomware-threat-landscape-what-expect-2022">Symantec</a>, evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures will be the constant new threat from attackers in 2022. Ransomware operators have been using a combination of malware and OEM software features to generate new toolsets to launch attacks. PsExec and Cobalt strike ranked as the top two most frequently deployed TTPs for ransomware in 2021. Attackers in 2022 are focusing more on multi-extortion techniques by leaking the data of the victims and threatening to launch a DDoS attack as a follow up if ransom demands are not met. <a href="https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-ransomware-threat-report.html">Palo Alto Networks</a> reported an increase of 85% in 2021 compared with 2020 in the number of victims of multi-extortion techniques. <br><br>Exploiting new software vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities in software will continue to surface as long as there are attackers motivated to use it as a tool for ransomware. Recent examples include the Log4j vulnerability and evolution of ZLoader for deploying ransomware. For example, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/">Microsoft</a> reported a group of attackers from China exploited the Log4j vulnerability as a back door for infecting organizations with Nightsky ransomware. In 2022, ransomware operators will continue to take advantage of unpatched systems to launch attacks on vulnerable systems.<br><br></p>
 Recommendations 
<p>Believe in Zero Trust: Zero Trust is a security paradigm based on the principle of “Don’t trust. Verify!”. According to the Zero Trust concept, no device, user, workload, or system should be trusted by default. For further information, check out our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Comprehensive Guide to Zero Trust Implementation</a> insight.  &nbsp;<br><br>Create a Backup Strategy: Get prepared for the worst-case scenario. Plan and implement a backup strategy prior to experiencing an attack. <br><br>Do Planning: Create an incident response plan and allocate the tasks among security teams. Develop company-wide cybersecurity policies against ransomware. <br><br>Control Authentication and Authorization Methods: Manage your authentication and authorization methods, check privileged users, and if needed, separate duties and departments. <br><br>Deploy Endpoint Security Tools: Make sure that your devices are secured by an endpoint security product or service. Keep an eye on personal devices to eliminate Shadow IT risks. <br><br>Stay Updated: Patch and update your applications continuously. Keep your security leaders and other stakeholders well informed of the current state of ransomware attacks and cybersecurity trends. <br><br>Do not Click on Unknown Links: Avoid clicking on links and attachments from unknown websites and emails.</p>

<p>Around <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/online-shopping-statistics/">79% of the US population</a>, or 263 million consumers, are online buyers. The number will climb to 291.2 million in three years, making online stores a dominant way to purchase.</p><p>Despite these promising numbers, not every person that visits your online store is ready to convert. While potential customers may only browse something, compare products, or kill time on your website, you spend money on nurturing them.</p><p>So how to know which online shopper is worth the effort and which is&nbsp;not?</p><p>You should segment your target audience into types of online shoppers. Categorization will allow you to understand who you deal with, how to convert them, and whether it’s worth it at&nbsp;all.</p><p>This article covers the main groups of online customers to guide&nbsp;you.</p><p>Since there are no two identical customers, you need a custom approach for every person. Learn the most common types of online shoppers, what makes them drop off, and ways to convert&nbsp;them.</p> 1. Discount&nbsp;shoppers <p>Discount seekers (or best deal seekers) are not truly loyal to your brand and easily switch from one online store to another. It’s one of the most common types of shoppers. 97% of surveyed shoppers look for a deal when shopping, while 92% always seek the best deal. When these people find the product they need, they don’t usually purchase it right away. They google the necessary item to find it on multiple websites and compare the&nbsp;price.</p><p>Competing for this category is challenging since you won’t be able to offer the best price for everything. Regular discounts also aren’t an option since they will devalue your products.</p> Why they don’t&nbsp;purchase <p>Discount shoppers won’t convert if your benefits are not much better than the competitors’ ones. If they see that another store sells the same product cheaper (even a one-dollar difference), they will go there. These consumers may even have price comparison extensions in their browsers that automatically detect the website with the lowest price. A bargain-hunter may also delay the purchase if they believe that you will lower the price or provide a higher discount after some&nbsp;time.</p> How to make them&nbsp;convert <p>One of the simplest ways to convert a bargain-hunter is by giving them what they want. In a recent survey, most shoppers (52%) named percentage off as the best kind of discount. Flat dollar amount off, free shipping, and free products are also popular alternatives.</p><p>What kind of discount is the best for&nbsp;shoppers</p><p>Yet, you cannot live on occasional discounts only. Hence, apart from sales, you must also keep discount shoppers by building your brand. Use marketing to explain to consumers the benefits of buying from you, implement a loyalty program (following <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">our best practices</a>) to make them stick around, or offer unique products they cannot find elsewhere. It’s a more far-reaching approach than sales, coupon codes, or discounts.</p> 2. Wandering customers <p>Wandering buyers is another category of online shoppers that takes too much effort to make money. These guys spend a minimum amount to buy anything just for fun. They use quick Google Search or go from website to website, browsing pages and clicking on ads, to spend their free time. Maybe their work is too boring, or they don’t have what to do in the evening. These are also teenagers who love online shopping but cannot afford to buy. Anyway, wandering buyers are unlikely to stay loyal to one brand or make large, <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/purchase-frequency/">frequent purchases</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, this category of buyers has a high cart abandonment rate and often returns the purchased products. It means you will need to consider whether it’s worth targeting them carefully.</p> Why they don’t&nbsp;purchase <p>They don’t come to your website with a clear intent and perceive shopping as an experience, not a necessity. Even if they buy something, the purchase is insignificant for a seller and doesn’t generate much&nbsp;revenue.</p> How to make them&nbsp;convert <p>Even though you shouldn’t focus on this target group, online stores have a smart way to convert them. Quick checkout is the secret weapon. When wanderers can purchase on your website in several clicks, they are the most likely to place an&nbsp;order.</p><p>You should make your checkout processes as smooth as possible and eliminate lengthy registration. Request only an email address and enable login through Gmail or social media websites.</p> 3. Need-based shoppers <p>These online buyers come to your website with a specific goal. They have a problem and need a particular product to solve it. That’s why need-based shoppers pay a lot of attention to detailed descriptions and often compare products on different websites. They rarely make emotional purchases or get something they haven’t planned to. Hence, instead of luring them into a purchase with a low price, you should stress&nbsp;quality.</p><p>Besides the product quality, need-based shoppers value relationships and flawless online customer experience. If they like what you offer and how you treat them, they will return to your brand and become repeat customers.</p> Why they don’t&nbsp;purchase <p>Need-based shoppers don’t convert because they are unsure whether your product meets the requirements. They either don’t have enough details about the product or doubt its quality. Overall, these buyers need the most time to make a purchase decision and don’t&nbsp;rush.</p> How to make them&nbsp;convert <p>There are many ways to nurture need-based leads to grow them into repeat customers. First, you have to create comprehensive product descriptions on your website. Indicate all valuable details (e.g., materials, size chart, colors, technical characteristics, etc.), add professional photos, and enable&nbsp;reviews.</p><p>Apart from that, create reliable support on your website. These may be a combination of web chat, phone, and email. Thanks to this, need-based consumers will be able to find answers to their questions to dispel doubts. They will perceive your website as more reliable.</p><p>Finally, invest in building a seamless customer journey and solid relationships. It’s essential to use multiple channels to connect with these customers and nurture them with quality&nbsp;content.</p> 4. Impulse&nbsp;buyers <p><a href="https://www.soocial.com/impulse-buying-statistics/#:~:text=95%25%20of%20Americans%20make%20in,would%20make%20an%20unplanned%20booking.">86% of Americans</a> have made impulse purchases online. It’s another large group of consumers to target. Like wandering customers, impulse shoppers don’t have a specific product in mind before placing an order. They are just navigating the web when the perfect match strikes them, and they realize they cannot live without it. Seconds after, they complete the purchase driven by emotions.</p><p>These customers are easy to upsell and open to recommendations. They are also ready to spend a lot on shopping and are generally quite profitable.</p> Why they don’t&nbsp;purchase <p>Impulse shoppers may change their minds and refuse to purchase if the checkout process is too time-consuming. As they fill out all details, emotions subside, and they take another look at the chosen product. They might notice it’s not as great as it seemed at first sight. Additional charges at the checkout, like expensive shipping, may also discourage this buyer group from completing purchases.</p> How to make them&nbsp;convert <p>When marketing and selling to impulse buyers, the main rule is to focus on emotions. Advertise your products as something super stylish and innovative every person should have. You may also consider running time-sensitive promotions to nudge website visitors into instant purchases. When a person realizes they have limited time to use a special offer, it triggers an emotional response.</p><p>Besides the listed approaches, you need to make the checkout quick and convenient. The faster instant buyers can place an order, the less likely they are to leave at the last&nbsp;moment.</p> 5. Loyal customers <p>Loyal customers are the favorite type of consumers across all businesses, no matter online or offline. These are brand ambassadors that frequently buy from you and invite friends. They make up 65% of a company’s business. They generate more revenue than other buyers but constitute a relatively small group since turning a lead into a loyal customer is a long process. It may take&nbsp;years.</p><p>Loyal customers also willingly leave positive reviews and comments if you ask them to. They spread a good word about your brand, convincing other people that you are an excellent choice. It’s good to attract new customers and convenience those who hesitate to buy a particular product.</p> Why they don’t&nbsp;purchase <p>Loyal customers stop purchasing when you neglect them. They come across other brands as time goes by and may gradually switch to your competitors. They may also abandon you if one of their latest experiences was too disappointing. For example, they ordered an item, but it was never delivered. Such issues undermine loyalty and dispurt relationships.</p> How to make them&nbsp;convert <p>Loyalty campaigns are a standard yet still an effective way to generate and nurture loyal customers. <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/loyalty-program">66% of consumers</a> admit that rewards change their spending behavior (learn more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/sites/">reward sites here</a>). Hence, by implementing such a program, you achieve two significant benefits. First, you create a roadmap to turn buyers into loyal customers step-by-step. Second, you provide existing loyals with bonuses to encourage repeat purchases.</p><p>In addition to loyalty programs, you may also show your special attitude to your brand ambassadors with custom messages. For example, send them a thank you postcard to express gratitude for staying with your brand for X years. A one-time discount or gift is also an&nbsp;option.</p> 6. Latest-product seekers <p>This category of buyers mainly resides in fashion and technology niches where novelty matters the most. These are the people who stand in queues outside Apple stores on the first day of product launch. They are obsessed with the latest products and readily pay several dollars more for something their peers don’t&nbsp;have.</p><p>For them, the price of the products you sell is less important than trends. Apart from novelty, they also value the brand story and image. You will need to put a lot of effort into brand marketing to make latest-product seekers&nbsp;convert.</p> Why they don’t&nbsp;purchase <p>These consumers won’t buy if you don’t sell trendy products or start selling them later than competitors. A poor image of your brand is an additional reason, among other factors, since latest-product seekers prefer renowned companies.</p> How to make them&nbsp;convert <p>You should be the first to distribute products that have just been released. It’s necessary to closely communicate with manufacturers to have such a privilege. Also, don’t forget to indicate the early access benefit on your website and your marketing materials.</p><p>You can also create online and print newsletters to inform buyers about new arrivals in advance. This way, fans of novelties will be waiting to purchase from you as soon as the new collection arrives.</p> Additional Tips on Converting Different Types of Online&nbsp;Shoppers <p>Besides the conversion tactics listed for each type of buyer, some universal approaches can also help. Check out these extra tips to consider in your marketing strategy:</p>  Remember that customers can change, and so should you. Even if someone was a discount seeker for years, they might become a need-based or loyal customer. The behavior also changes under the impact of external factors. For example, during holidays, <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/holiday-impulse-purchase-statistics/">1 in 3 purchases is impulse</a>, which means other types of customers can act like impulse purchasers. Hence, you must continuously track your customer activity to adapt your sales approaches accordingly.  Calculate customer lifetime value before deciding whether you need to target a specific group. Different groups can bring different revenue and stay with your brand for several seconds to years. You’d better know what to expect before investing in reaching these consumers.  Implement marketing automation software for optimized and personalized marketing. Since you won’t be able to tailor messages to every customer without automation, advanced software is life-critical. You need tools that support triggered-based marketing and respond to customers based on their previous activity. They may, for example, email consumers tailored product selections based on what they’ve purchased, viewed, or added to favorites.   Why Not All Buyers Are Worth Nurturing <p>Before talking about the types of shoppers, we must say that not all leads deserve your attention. Customization is not only about tailoring your marketing and communication but also about channeling your&nbsp;efforts.</p><p>To engage a customer, online stores spend a lot of money. They invest in digital ads, remarketing, SEO optimization, content, and other elements of marketing and sales campaigns. If just another customer comes and leaves without placing an order, the investment on this lead never pays off. And the more leads fail to convert, the more money you put down the&nbsp;drain.</p><p>Therefore, you must understand what customers are the most profitable and what are unlikely to purchase. It’s valuable information to redistribute the marketing budget and choose the most effective customer acquisition and retention approaches.</p><p>We hope this information will help you segment your target audience and create an accurate customer persona. The types of customers you focus on should considerably impact your marketing and sales strategy.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/types-of-online-shoppers/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Everybody wants an incentive to do something. Even when doing everyday things, people need external motivation.</p><p>Why should you exercise? Because you want to look good. Why should you eat at that particular restaurant? Because there’s a new menu item to try. Why do you buy groceries at this chain? Because you have a loyalty card and you get discounts.</p><p>This mindset is why incentive marketing works.</p> What Is Incentive Marketing? <p>Incentive marketing uses rewards and prizes for marketing a brand, product, or service. It is a highly effective marketing strategy that encourages consumers to spend&nbsp;money.</p><p>The Incentive Marketing Association explained the marketing strategy using an equation popular in psychology:</p><blockquote>Ability x Motivation = Performance</blockquote><p>This equation is primarily used in employment. People are hired for their ability. And when you add motivation or incentives, you can expect the person’s performance to&nbsp;improve.</p><p>This can easily be applied to marketing. For example, a customer is inclined to buy something from a specific brand because it manufactures high-quality products-or its ability to deliver. When you add motivation or incentive, such as a discount, you can increase&nbsp;sales.</p> Examples <p>Incentive marketing centers on consumer rewards to increase revenue and encourage customer loyalty. Some examples are <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/how-does-cash-back-work/">offering cash back</a>, having a <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">loyalty program</a> or <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/sites/">joining reward websites</a>. Here are a few more examples:</p> Buy One Get&nbsp;One <p>This is one of the most popular types of incentive marketing-the customer gets another unit of the same product for&nbsp;free.</p><p>A similar incentive can be an opportunity to buy a similar product at a discounted price. The central goal is to generate as many sales as possible.</p> Loyalty Programs <p>Existing customers are asked to sign up for a customer loyalty program for free, and they are given a card that is stamped every time they visit the store. Once they reach a certain number of stamps, they are rewarded with a free item or a discount.</p><p>In the digital age, many loyalty programs are now integrated into brand-specific mobile&nbsp;apps.</p><p>This is a very effective marketing tool because it instantly creates loyal customers. They have the motivation to keep coming back to get that prize after a certain number of visits or purchases.</p> Membership Rewards <p>Getting customers to sign up for a brand newsletter, mailing list, or membership can be challenging. These days, few consumers want to receive promotional emails from the brands they&nbsp;support.</p><p>But when you throw in a reward for signing up, your customers will be more than happy to do so. Rewards can come in the form of a discount every time they buy from the brand-another way to create customer loyalty. You can also give members a chance to purchase exclusive items that aren’t available to average customers.</p><p>Brands often require a membership fee for customers to enjoy premium items. In this case, the incentive should go beyond a simple member discount-a welcome basket with product samples, discount coupons, and exclusive offers can do&nbsp;wonders.</p><p>Another perk of membership is getting exclusive or first access to special brand promotions. They will also be among the first to be informed about sales and new product launches.</p> Raffle Draws <p>This is a popular incentive marketing tactic where customers that spend a certain amount of money will have a chance to win exciting prizes. For example, a grocery store can offer one raffle ticket for every $20 purchase. If they have a lot of enticing prizes, customers will spend more money to get as many raffle tickets as possible.</p><p>This simple yet effective strategy will increase sales and even encourage repeat and even impulsive sales. Because customers want more chances to win prizes, they will spend more money to get more raffle&nbsp;tickets.</p> Reward Points <p>A point program is another way to increase customer loyalty and encourage more sales. This is a financial reward that piles up whenever they purchase something from your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Reward points are given with each purchase. The points accumulate over time, and when enough points are collected, they can be converted to store credit. For example, for every $5 a customer spends, they get one reward point, and every 10 points are equivalent to $1 worth of credit. The customer can then use their store credits to purchase yet another&nbsp;product.</p><p>In this system, the customer is rewarded for their loyalty, and the brand benefits from yet another&nbsp;sale.</p> Exclusive Incentives <p>Some brands provide loyal customers or members with exclusive items and services. In some cases, chosen clientele will get early access to newly launched products or services. This is like having a chance to go to a premiere of a new movie a week before everybody else gets to watch&nbsp;it.</p><p>The incentive could also be the chance to own exclusive brand merchandise. It’s always exciting for a loyal customer to get something exclusive from a brand they&nbsp;support.</p> Why Is Incentive Marketing Important? <p>Almost everything we do in life is driven by motivation. Adults are motivated to work because we need food to eat and have a roof over our heads. Students are motivated to study because they want to get good grades and secure their&nbsp;futures.</p><p>What is important in one’s personal life is also important in business: motivation.</p><p>There are many incentive marketing strategies because they work. When offered these incentives, customers immediately get excited, which engages their attention and motivates them to purchase from&nbsp;brands.</p><p>When you integrate incentives into your marketing strategies, you can expect the following benefits:</p> Increase Profit <p>The exciting rewards offered by your incentive marketing programs will surely encourage customers to spend more and more money on your products or services. Loyalty programs, memberships, and discounts are meant to entice customers to open their wallets and bring in&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>To ensure continuous profits and long-term growth, you must structure your incentives to your brand’s advantage. Even when you give away something to your loyal customers for free, you must receive something in return, and exponentially so. Crunch the numbers and ensure that no matter how many attractive incentives you offer, you are still getting more from your customers than you are giving&nbsp;away.</p> Expand Clientele <p>When people hear about a particular brand’s attractive incentive program, they are much more inclined to check out their products and become a customer themselves. Even a loyal customer of a competing brand would be tempted to switch if the reward is especially enticing.</p><p>Aside from planning and building your own incentive marketing strategies, you should also study what your competitors offer. Try to construct ways to offer better and more attractive rewards than other related brands so you can bring more of your target audience into the&nbsp;fold.</p><p>When you gain more customers, you boost your profits, and you can enjoy business success for a long time to&nbsp;come.</p> Develop Relationships <p>When you offer fantastic marketing incentives, you will continuously expand your base of loyal customers. When your customers feel well taken care of by your brand, and you give them something in return for your loyalty, they will not shop from any of your competitors.</p><p>This creates an emotional bond that benefits both parties. The customer will become more and more attached to your brand, support every new product release, and even become an unwitting brand ambassador in their social circle. A simple word-of-mouth recommendation or social media post from an enthusiastic, loyal customer can do wonders for brand awareness.</p><p>When other people see a customer’s loyalty, they would be curious about it. And this simple curiosity may lead them to try something from your brand, too. One purchase can lead to another, and loyalty can be built as well. The chain continues and expands even further to create more connections and beneficial relationships.</p><p>This type of support cannot be bought or created in any other way, so it must be treasured and cultivated as much as possible by keeping customers happy.</p> 5 Ways to Use Marketing Incentives to Grow Your&nbsp;Business <p>Incentive marketing breeds customer loyalty. It can also help you grow your business. Here are the ways it could help your&nbsp;brand:</p> 1. Brand Awareness <p>Incentive marketing is a great way to introduce the brand to the public. Many new businesses offer free product samples when they start out; it’s one of the easiest ways to spread the word about a new entity in the industry.</p><p>For new restaurants or food products, the brand may offer free tasting during its launch. Companies offering new services may offer discounts during their first few days of operations.</p><p>Despite giving away products and services for free, brands must ensure they are of excellent quality for customers to want to come back and spend&nbsp;money.</p> 2. Lead Generation <p>Incentive marketing is also a great way to generate leads. You can offer customers or potential clientele ebooks, digital coupons, and other digital products in exchange for their names and email addresses. They will then be enrolled on your email marketing list, and you can send them more brand content that they can engage&nbsp;with.</p><p>An incentive will make marketing emails more tolerable to the recipient. Without an incentive, people might just consider your email as&nbsp;spam.</p> 3. Referral&nbsp;Programs <p>A referral program is another way to leverage marketing incentives to grow your business. You can offer something to your existing customers, and in return, they will give you a friend’s name and contact details for customer acquisition.</p><p>For example, you can offer a coupon for a 10% discount on a product or service for every person referred by your customers. There are endless variations of marketing incentives for referrals to increase customer acquisition.</p> 4. Encourage More Purchases <p>There are plenty of promotions you can carry out to encourage people to keep buying. There are loyalty programs through which customers can get free products or services once they rack up enough points. The more they spend on the brand, the more free stuff they get. Raffle draws also encourage sales-the more they spend, the more chances they have to&nbsp;win.</p><p>The more promotions you offer, the more the business will grow as loyal customers keep coming back and supporting the&nbsp;brand.</p> 5. Increase Retention Rate <p>Attracting new customers is essential, but one of the hallmarks of a successful business is its ability to retain them and create a vast loyal following.</p><p>Loyalty programs, exclusive marketing incentives, and membership programs are crucial strategies to retain customers and eventually turn them into loyal allies of the brand. This is easier said than done-you must give customers a reason to keep supporting your brand instead of opting for the competition.</p><p>These loyal customers will not just keep bringing in revenue. They are also crucial in converting their social network into supporting your brand and buying from you as&nbsp;well.</p> Best Practices for Marketing Incentives <p>Why do some incentive programs work and others don’t? How do you ensure that you aren’t wasting your time and money creating campaigns that will fall&nbsp;flat?</p><p>Here are some of the best practices that will help you build effective and profitable incentive marketing programs:</p> 1. Keep It&nbsp;Simple <p>The design principle <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikekappel/2021/09/15/keep-it-simple-stupid-applying-the-kiss-principle-to-reports-marketing--beyond/?sh=20fa5d437913">KISS (keep it simple, stupid!) </a>works for just about every aspect of marketing. It’s important to keep your incentive marketing strategies and procedures easy to understand and implement.</p><p>This is why loyalty cards and membership programs work-brands have been using them for decades, and they are incredibly easy to understand. All you need to do is provide customers with loyalty cards that cashiers will stamp whenever they go in for a purchase. As soon as the number of stamps has been achieved, the customer gets an incentive, usually a free&nbsp;product.</p><p>Starbucks runs one of the most famous and effective loyalty programs-their loyalty card has now become a rewards app. As the brand loves to say, “free coffee is a tap away.” Starbucks rewards purchases with a certain number of stars. And when customers get 50 stars, they get a free coffee, tea, or bakery&nbsp;item.</p> 2. Send Updates and Reminders <p>It’s always a good strategy to let customers know that you care. Sending them updates about special promotions or incentives will make them feel like their participation in these activities is essential.</p><p>Often, when the rewards expire, so does the customer’s loyalty. This is why brands must do everything they can to remind customers of the incentives they’re missing. So if the customer is unable to enjoy their reward for any reason, the brand is not to&nbsp;blame.</p><p>One of the best examples of this type of customer service is Tarte Cosmetics. Those who register for the brand’s perkswill immediately earn 100 points by signing up for a membership. They earn points when they shop from the brand and redeem them for exclusive rewards. Each month, the brand sends monthly roundup emails that summarize the customer’s rewards points and loyalty&nbsp;status.</p> 3. Make Sure Incentives Go Back to the&nbsp;Brand <p>It’s not an effective incentive marketing strategy if your business loses money when you implement it. The structure and implementation of your marketing efforts must benefit your brand and no one else. You must encourage as many sales as possible and continuously generate revenue as you entice more and more customers to opt&nbsp;in.</p><p>Customer rewards and incentives should not cost your brand too much. You must plan and execute these marketing campaigns to ensure that centering customer experience will not compromise your bottom&nbsp;line.</p> 4. Personalized Customer Relationship <p>Offering rewards for a loyal customer’s birthday and giving them something special is one of the best incentive marketing practices you can implement.</p><p>For example, birthday celebrants can enjoy a scoop of ice cream from Baskin Robbins or a $10 to $15 birthday gift from Victoria’s Secret.</p> 5. Know Your&nbsp;Customer <p>Market research is one of the most critical elements of an effective marketing campaign. If you don’t know your audience and your customers, you will not be able to target and calibrate your strategies to engage&nbsp;them.</p><p>When you know your customers, you know what incentives and offers they will be excited about. A great example is 7-Eleven giving away free Slurpees on June 11, which is now known as National Free Slurpee Day. After all, Slurpees are their signature product, and customers all over the world love&nbsp;them!</p> Conclusion <p>According to the Incentive Theory, a person’s behavior is dictated by the desire for external rewards. This is human nature, and it is the reason why incentive marketing works.</p><p>Some people think of incentive marketing programs as a fad or a cheap ploy to gain more customers. However, their resiliency and widespread use by the biggest brands in the world is proof that they still work. Incentives will always attract interested customers, who have the potential to become loyal brand ambassadors when the rewards programs give them something in&nbsp;return.</p><p>Creating clever and effective incentive marketing techniques will make your customers very happy and benefit your brand for years to&nbsp;come!</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/incentive-marketing/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

				  ​Over 1 Billion People Worldwide Lack Legal ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m currently a member of the Trust Over IP Foundation <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/SSI+Harms+%28BGBU%29+Task+Force">SSI harms task force</a>, where we’re working to produce a white paper examining the design features of digital ID systems. This short post aims to identify some of the harms and disadvantages that SSI introduces and ways to mitigate those harms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today about 50% of the world’s population uses the internet, and according to the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/10/12/11-billion-invisible-people-without-id-are-priority-for-new-high-level-advisory-council-on-identification-for-development">World Bank</a>, over one billion (10%) people worldwide lack some form of legal ID, and even more, they don’t have a digital trail, excluding them from participating in the digital economy. Furthermore, there are <a href="https://youtu.be/1-V7lyxrOmw?t=145">divides within</a>; 60% of those people live in lower and middle-income countries, 50% are in sub-Saharan Africa, and about 40% of the women in lower-income countries don’t have access to Identity. Inclusion in identity product and process design is necessary to enable economic growth and financial inclusion for excluded demographics. We need to prioritize inclusion to avoid exacerbating some of the existing divides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I joined this task force because I wanted to learn more about how SSI and identity products can be harmful to people. I didn’t realize how much damage these products can do, but now I am more aware of the dangers. I am committed to doing what I can to help mitigate these harms, but I also recognize that I still have a lot to learn and work to do. Hopefully, the SSI harms task force can create a meaningful white paper that will be applied by organizations and governments building frameworks worldwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Does Digital Identity Mean?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital ID can provide an electronic version of trusted government identification. It offers better security and more robust privacy and can be stored securely on smartphones and other digital devices. Governments and organizations worldwide are developing digital identity frameworks enabling people and businesses to prove their identities online and in person, offering more effortless ways to access online services.</p>
<p>These frameworks are built on the idea that each person has unique, verifiable credentials used to sign up for programs, file taxes, and more, allowing people to control their data and share it with organizations as they see fit. It will also help protect people’s personal information by reducing the risk of fraud and identity theft.</p>
<p>Good digital identity is based on convenience, security, and privacy. Convenient because it allows people to access government services and information online without visiting a physical office. It is secure because it is based on distributed ledger technology and private because it shares only the information that people want to share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why do Frameworks Need to be Inclusive? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital identity frameworks aim to create a standard for verification and authenticating identities in a digital space. Frameworks must be inclusive to be effective. Inclusion is key to creating an identity system that allows people to prove their identities without having to reveal too much personal information. An inclusive digital identity framework will also help combat fraud and identity theft while making it easier for people to access services and goods online safely and securely.</p>
<p>Many frameworks are being developed worldwide, but the most notable is the European Union’s <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS</a> and Canada’s <a href="https://diacc.ca/">DIACC</a>. These frameworks are essential for online interactions. However, most current digital identity frameworks are not entirely inclusive, leading to many negative consequences.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of the digital identity ecosystem is that it can help reduce online fraud. However, if the framework is not inclusive, it can <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/from-cheating-banks-to-faking-identity-aadhaar-frauds-peak-in-2018-report-118052300151_1.html">increase fraud</a> and even discrimination. For example, if identifying documents include a strict gender (or “sex”) marker, it can prevent transgender people from accessing essential services. More importantly, this categorization creates a basis for discrimination and inequality.</p>
<p>In addition, exclusionary digital identity frameworks can limit social and economic opportunities. For example, suppose a digital identity framework does not allow for the use of alternative identities (i.e. passport from another country). In that case, it can prevent marginalized groups from participating in the online economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, inclusive digital identity frameworks are essential for enabling secure and efficient online interactions for all members of society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 When Frameworks Fail 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though digital IDs offer many benefits, they can also create exclusionary effects if not implemented properly. In India, the <a href="https://uidai.gov.in/">Aadhaar</a> program, despite its success, is still <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/coindesks-money-reimagined/a-best-of-holiday-special-of-2021-indias-digital-identity-system/">plagued with technical failures</a> and exclusions. <a href="https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~kamurali/papers/Working%20Papers/ABBA%20(NBER%20WP%2026744).pdf">Evidence</a> shows that compulsory biometric authentication for the public food distribution system leads<a href="https://www.epw.in/journal/2017/50/special-articles/aadhaar-and-food-security-jharkhand.html"> to exclusion problems</a> and increased transaction costs. Many residents have been unable to access their IDs once issued; widowed mothers with children and the elderly who couldn’t pass authentication tests could not access social services or the public food distribution system. These failures can stem from anything by not being able to input your fingerprint or misplacing the ID number. All situations leave residents, especially vulnerable groups, unable to access essential social services. Consider that Aadhaar was initially created to increase inclusion, and things become a bit more confusing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biometric authentication has also raised privacy and data misuse concerns. India has faced significant pushback against biometric national ID systems due to concerns regarding safety and misuse of collected data. Children below the age of 5 were issued Aadhar numbers with their <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/uidai-should-review-issue-of-aadhaar-to-children-below-5-yrs-cag-122040601441_1.html">parents’ biometric data</a>. This caused cases where different residents were given Aadhaar numbers with the same biometric data, exposing flaws in the process and issuance of Aadhaars on faulty biometrics and documents. In light of this, it is crucial to ensure that solid data privacy and security frameworks and systems are in place.</p>
<p>There are pros and cons to implementing digital ID requirements. It can help reduce corruption and ensure that only those meant to benefit from a program do. Yet, it can also create exclusion problems for vulnerable groups and increase transaction costs. Below are a few great stories highlighting the importance of inclusive identity frameworks.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
				
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
				
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  How Can We Ensure Inclusiveness?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensuring inclusiveness in identity products means taking a human-centred design approach. When designing a new product, it’s essential to think about the people using it, and they should be your focus when creating the product. Too often, designers focus on the technology or the business case without considering the people using the product.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.accessnow.org/usha-ramanathan-human-rights-hero/">Dr. Usha Ramanathan</a> points out in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/coindesks-money-reimagined/a-best-of-holiday-special-of-2021-indias-digital-identity-system/">CoinDesk’s Money Reimagined</a> that in India, the well-off tech guys wanted to produce technology for the poor. However, the tech guys don’t know what it’s like to live in poverty. In the name of providing identity to people, the tech guys wanted to create technology for the poor that would, in turn, control their lives. There were claims that the poor lacked access to identity documents and couldn’t get welfare, but this was untrue. Dr. Ramanathan notes that less than 1% of the population lacked identity documents, so these claims were just an excuse for the project.</p>
<p>It’s about designing for people from different cultures and with different needs by people in those same groups. This includes people with different economic backgrounds, gender identities and sexual orientations. Digital Identity inclusiveness is about creating a product that everyone can use, regardless of their background or abilities. We all need to work together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inclusion is important in all aspects of life, including digital identity products. By ensuring that everyone is included in the development process, we can create products that meet the needs of everyone. This article discussed the importance of inclusion and outlined some ways we can make sure everyone is included in the development of digital identity products. Ensuring that the most vulnerable are included in the systems that the privileged take for granted every day is vital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upgrading your DID currently requires a deposit of 2 KILT. Let’s dive into why this deposit exists and how it&nbsp;works.</p><p>First it’s important to understand how DIDs (decentralized identifiers) form the core of your digital identity on KILT. After <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/Create-KILT-Sporran-Identity.pdf">generating your DID in the Sporran wallet</a> for free, you can start building your digital identity by adding <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">credentials</a> such as your social media&nbsp;handles.</p><p><a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/Upgrading-to-on-chain-DID.pdf">Upgrading your free DID to an on-chain DID</a> and anchoring it on the KILT blockchain enables applications “built on KILT” that make Web3 more accessible. For instance, you can add a unique, easily readable <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/introducing-web3name-your-unique-digital-name-for-web3-the-internet-of-the-future-c301a18f75e8">web3name</a> to represent the DID’s string of numbers and letters. You can also link some of your credentials publicly, adding an extra layer of verification to your identity. You can also use your on-chain DID to sign any digital files — PDFs, audio, video, software — privately and securely using&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-didsign-a-new-application-built-on-kilt-e4896ffffb44">DIDsign</a>.</p><p>In simple terms, a blockchain is a digital, decentralized database, or record of transactions. Each digital bookkeeper in the system (in this case, collators on the KILT blockchain), has a copy of all the transactions on the chain. Since this amounts to a lot of data that is continually being replicated and must be accessible, it’s important that unnecessary data be&nbsp;deleted.</p><p>As a Kusama parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem, KILT uses an energy-efficient system in which the fee required to write and store this data on the blockchain is calculated <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-price-of-gas-why-kilt-chose-polkadot-over-ethereum-6bef9006a305">based on the size of the transaction</a>.</p><p>A simple token transfer or writing a hash (a number to represent data) on the KILT blockchain doesn’t use much computing or storage power, allowing low fees for transactions and credentials — as little as a few cents. In contrast, an on-chain DID requires a lot more storage power, as a DID can hold many different keys and endpoints in order to facilitate its functions. All this data needs to be stored on the KILT blockchain for permanent accessibility. Using a formula based on these storage needs, the sum of 2 KILT was calculated to meet these&nbsp;costs.</p> Deposits vs.&nbsp;Fees <p>Instead of charging a 2 KILT fee for an on-chain DID, deposits encourage users to delete DIDs they no longer need, and deters spamming.</p><p>The deposit stays on the balance of the account that paid, but is locked and can’t be used for transfers, staking or voting. If the DID owner later chooses to delete their on-chain DID, the collators (who run the KILT servers) will delete this DID from their database so that it is just recorded in the history but no longer occupies storage. The 2 KILT Coins are then unlocked and added to the payee’s free balance (minus a small transaction fee). This creates an incentive to delete unused DIDs rather than leaving them sitting on the blockchain and wasting storage&nbsp;space.</p> Scalability <p>However, since the total supply of pre-minted KILT Coins was around 150 million KILT Coins at genesis, isn’t this limiting the potential of the KILT blockchain to hold more than 75 million DIDs? Especially considering other factors such as the need for KILT Coins to pay transaction fees, for staking, for Treasury funding, and for future projects on the&nbsp;roadmap?</p><p>This is where the flexibility of the KILT blockchain comes into play, allowing governance on KILT to change the deposit as circumstances change. As the number of on-chain DIDs increases and more KILT Coins are locked as deposits, KILT Coin holders can propose and vote in an on-chain referendum to lower the deposit for future DIDs. A vote may also be initiated by any KILT Coin holder if the price of the KILT Coin should change in a way that makes the deposit unreasonably expensive.</p> Transferring Deposit&nbsp;Fees <p>While a change in the cost of a deposit for an on-chain DID may not be a major issue for individuals, even a small change could be significant for companies who have paid the deposit for a large number of employees. In this case, rather than being locked into the original deposit, they have the option of unlocking the difference. In that case, if the deposit was initially 2 KILT and was then reduced to 0.5, for example, then the company could unlock 1.5 KILT Coins for each deposit paid, while still covering the 0.5 deposit on the individual employee’s account for their&nbsp;DID.</p> Enabling Web3 <p>KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. On-chain DIDs and DIDsign are one step towards achieving this, using the KILT blockchain to create a decentralized digital identity and to sign digital documents privately and safely without unnecessary sharing of&nbsp;data.</p><p>Discover more about KILT on its <a href="https://www.kilt.io/treasury/overview/">website</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">blog</a>, brainstorm KILT use cases in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/847445252663148565/856523327011291137">Discord</a>, or follow KILT on <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> to keep up with the latest news.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>As discussed in the last edition of KC Navigator, public sector organizations are increasingly early adopters in digital identity, digital transformation, and cybersecurity, providing the opportunity for private sector organizations to learn from public sector implementations and follow their lead.</p>
<p>Within cybersecurity, government adoption of a Zero Trust approach to security, particularly in the US, is a prime example of where the public sector is providing a lead for the private sector to follow because both sectors are potential targets of the same cyber threats.</p>
<p>Zero Trust is not a new concept, but developments in technological capabilities, changes in the way people are working, accelerated adoption of cloud and Edge computing, and the continued evolution of cyberthreats have resulted in Zero Trust rising to prominence.</p>
<p>As organizations seek to improve their security capabilities, many are considering Zero Trust, but they are also looking at the concept of Secure Access Edge (SASE) which has risen to prominence for the same reasons as Zero Trust.</p>
<p>As a result, organizations are evaluating both Zero Trust and SASE to determine whether to adopt either, one, or both. It is therefore important to understand what each can potentially deliver and the exact nature of the relationship between them.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>SASE refers to a concept that combines cloud-based software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) with a range of security services and unified management functionality for delivering security and SD-WAN capabilities to any edge computing location, such as branch offices, home offices, cloud services and storage, OT, and IoT.</p>
<p>SASE is designed to address the performance bottleneck issues of traditional networks that rely on traffic backhauling. Additionally, by integrating identity, business context and real-time risk assessment into every connection, SASE architectures promise to prevent a variety of cyber-attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the definition, SASE solutions typically include a networking component such as a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) plus a wide range of security components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These security components are added to secure the communication on the network from end to end, provide consistent policy management and enforcement, add security analytics, and enable an integrated administration capability to manage every connection from everything to every resource.</p>
<p>These components typically include Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), which means a Zero Trust approach to security is one of the security components that enables SASE. In a sense, then, SASE is dependent on Zero Trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero Trust is widely regarded as critical to protecting IT systems, data, and infrastructure because it is imperative that all organizations shift away from the traditional perimeter-based approach to security, which is no longer fit for purpose in an era of cloud computing and remote working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important point to be understood about Zero Trust, is that it is not a product or solution that can be purchased and retrofitted over existing systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero Trust is an approach to security based on the assumption that networks can and will be breached, and the principle of “never trust, always verify”. Zero Trust, therefore, is essentially a concept and an architecture model.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional approach of verifying once at the perimeter and then implicitly trusting everything and everyone within the perimeter, Zero Trust is about continual verification of each user, device, application, and transaction. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing a Zero Trust approach, therefore, is about shifting to a trusted identity-based model of security that secures data, while ensuring it is accessible to those who need it. This increases security, boosts productivity, blocks lateral movement by attackers, and therefore often involves restructuring how resources are secured and accessed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this shift can involve the deployment of new tools, it often simply requires a focus on reusing existing tools, and redesigning security processes and policies. Therefore, Zero Trust is not something that can be implemented overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a journey that begins with a long-term business strategy and focuses on a step-by-step implementation, using existing or readily available tools and technologies, while avoiding adding even more complexity to the existing architecture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because Zero Trust is one of the security components that enables SASE, they appear to be complementary, but their relationship is a little more complicated. SASE solutions often include ZTNA as one of the capabilities, but it may be debated whether the reliance on SD-WAN as the underlying infrastructure does not stand in contrast to the basic principles of Zero Trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The risk is to assume that SD-WAN is always secure and can be trusted, but trusting a single element in the multi-layered security stack is the exact opposite of what zero trust is about. Therefore, is it important to consider this risk in any SASE implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, the relationship between SASE and Zero Trust is largely complementary, so much so, that a well implemented Zero Trust strategy may address the security needs that some organizations might seek to address with SASE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another risk associated with SASE is the risk of supplier lock-in. If SASE is a one-stop shop, then the risk of being locked into the approach of a single supplier – sometimes with few selected partners – is great. SASE needs to evolve to become an open, flexible, standards-based architecture, where different services from different providers can be easily combined.</p>
<p>Considering these risks, it is recommended that organizations adopt a use case-based approach to any potential SASE implementation. Once the use cases are identified and understood, they may well be met by Zero Trust alone, which may be a better overall fit for your organization’s needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally speaking, SASE solutions may be a better fit for a traditional heterogeneous organization, however, even organizations with a lot of traditional IT are well advised to think about the use cases where they really will benefit from SASE, which is essentially an “old school” approach. For cloud-native startups, there really need to be very good reasons to opt for a SASE solution, which is likely to foster a tendency to conserve traditional approaches rather than moving to a more modern approach.</p>
<p>If, however, after the use cases have been carefully considered, SASE still seems like the best way to go, it is important to understand the risks of SD-WAN and supplier lock-in, and then ascertain exactly what is included in any prospective SASE solution to ensure that it contains everything necessary to meet current and future requirements.</p>
<p>Before going ahead with a SASE implementation, verify that it is a viable solution in your context and be clear whether SASE is a tactic to solve an immediate problem in the short term, or whether it is a strategic solution with benefits in the longer term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the final analysis then, where SASE implementations make sense and Zero Trust alone is not enough to meet specific security requirements, SASE and Zero Trust are perfect twins with Zero Trust enabling and complementing SASE, but the risk of SD-WAN should not be overlooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This article serves as an overview of current Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) implementations in the crypto space and discusses what to expect from ZKP as an exciting cryptographic method in the upcoming months and years. Specifically, we provide a snapshot of some of the most interesting projects and how ZKP improves important properties of today’s blockchains’ infrastructure, tooling, and applications. In an <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/selectively-disclosed-verifiable-credentials-79a236b81ee2">earlier article</a> on ZKPs written at the end of 2020, we have taken a closer look at the core principles of Zero-Knowledge Proofs, their usage in Verifiable Credentials, and the state of available implementations back then. Now, in 2022 ZKPs are increasingly used as a solution for some of the blockchains’ scalability issues. We have also started to see improvements in its usage for privacy enhancements, though the topic of privacy seems to be in an earlier stage than scalability.</p> Primer on&nbsp;ZKPs <p>Essentially, a ZKP is all about trust between multiple parties. In simpler terms, this means one party is able to prove to a second party that it holds a certain piece of information without disclosing the relevant information to the receiving party. For instance, proving to the cashier that you are older than 21 without revealing your actual age. To get a better idea of ZKPs core principles, please refer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c">this ELI5&nbsp;video</a>.</p> ZKP Infrastructure and&nbsp;Tooling <p>ZKP solutions discussed in this section focus on improving whole blockchain networks or on providing specialized tools for those. For blockchain networks, ZKPs can help with keeping the ledger size consistent or with providing an overall more efficient approach to Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). SDKs and tools can in return be used for writing ZKP logic and for compiling this logic into <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/66037/what-is-the-role-of-a-circuit-in-zk-snarks">ZKP circuits</a>.</p> Mina Protocol <p><a href="https://minaprotocol.com/">Mina Protocol</a> is a layer 1 protocol that takes blockchain infrastructure to a new level by basing blockchain interactions on ZKPs. While other scaling solutions aim to decrease transaction size and cost, Mina has a more holistic approach. <a href="https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en">Mina is a succinct blockchain, with a constant size of about</a>&nbsp;22KB.</p><p>With Mina, ZKPs are directly integrated into smart contracts and so-called zkApps that can be built using those ZKP-enabled smart contracts. zkApps manage their state off-chain (mostly synchronously) and then store a proof of their state on-chain once the computation is finished. Thus, Mina and zkApps allow the building of highly efficient applications. Fortunately, zkApps are built using Typescript not requiring learning a special-purpose programming language like Solidity with Ethereum.</p><a href="https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/zkapps">zkApp Architecture [2]</a> StarkNet/StarkEx <p><a href="https://starkware.co/starknet/">StarkNet</a> is a layer 2 network for Ethereum using the “StarkEx Protocol” for providing faster and more cost-effective transactions and increased privacy. Instead of directly sending transactions to layer 1 Ethereum, StarkEx uses <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/">zkRollups</a> for creating proofs for the transaction on layer 2 and then stores those proofs in batches on layer&nbsp;1.</p><p>The StarkEx Protocol is defined in five different components, i.e., <a href="https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v4/overview">Application, StarkEx Service, SHARP, Stark Verifier, and StarkEx Contracts</a> of which some are acting on-chain and others off-chain.</p><a href="https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v4/overview">StarkEx (high-level)</a> architecture<p>The high-level architecture above shows how users will use an Ethereum-based application that sends transactions to the StarkEx Service. This service uses StarkWare’s <a href="https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/">Cairo language for creating zero-knowledge programs</a> that prove the application-relevant state. After a proof has been computed off-chain it is stored on-chain using StarkEx Contracts. The Stark Verifier can then be used to verify the proofs by either checking the state of the StarkEx Contract or by using the SHARP service in case one needs to prove the states of multiple different applications at&nbsp;once.</p> <a href="https://dusk.network/">DuskNet</a> <p><a href="https://dusk.network/">DuskNet</a> is a business-oriented ZKP-based blockchain with fast transactions for building <a href="https://research.binance.com/en/projects/dusk-network">privacy-preserving smart contracts and confidential tokens for the financial sector</a> that respect confidentiality agreements. Driving factors for DuskNet are mostly privacy concerns and compliance with GDPR rules and the essential need of companies to keep information secure.</p><p>To provide these properties in a blockchain network, <a href="https://dusk.network/news/zero-knowledge-plonk-demo">DuskNet uses PLONKs</a> that are in general faster than <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/">bulletproofs</a> but in need of a trusted setup. For more information on PLONKs, I can recommend <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/09/22/plonk.html">this blog from&nbsp;Vitalik</a>.</p><p>One interesting use case of DuskNet is the <a href="https://dusk.network/cases/security-tokens">XSC Security Token Standard</a>, which provides permission management for an asset's lifecycle. The ledger records all transactions, but the access rights of token holders are not lost once a token holder fails on a transaction or the access keys are lost. This property is an important requirement of securities law.</p> Nightfall 3 <p><a href="https://github.com/EYBlockchain/nightfall_3">EY’s Nightfall 3</a> provides a secure and privacy-preserving solution for transacting ERC-20 tokens as well as ERC-721 tokens at low cost. <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2021/07/ey-contributes-a-zero-knowledge-proof-layer-2-protocol-into-the-public-domain-to-help-address-increasing-transaction-costs-on-ethereum-blockchain">The successor of EY’s Nightfall called Nightfall 3 aims to improve the performance of such transactions even more while simplifying the developer experience</a>. In addition, Nightfall 3 provides the ability to transfer ERC-1155&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Nightfall’s performance improvements are achieved by combining the existing ZK solution with o<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/">ptimistic rollups</a>, creating a ZK-optimistic rollup hybrid.

SnarkOS contains important logical components for writing ZKP applications and for proving states publicly.</p> ZKP Applications <p>Once you have decided on a certain infrastructure, may it be a ZKP-based blockchain network or a non-ZKP network you can build your own application. This is where ZKPs get interesting for the common user as the benefits are becoming more and more obvious at this&nbsp;level.</p> Hyperledger Aries <p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> describes itself as <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries#:~:text=Hyperledger%20Aries%20provides%20a%20shared,peer%2Dto%2Dpeer%20interactions">“a shared, reusable, interoperable tool kit designed for initiatives and solutions focused on creating, transmitting, and storing verifiable digital credentials.”</a> We discussed Hyperledger Aries and their use of Hyperledger Indy’s “Anoncreds” in our <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/selectively-disclosed-verifiable-credentials-79a236b81ee2">earlier article</a>. Interesting to note at this point is that we can see the first integrations of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+ signatures</a> (signature-based ZKPs) that enable selective disclosure.</p><p>Combined with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-ld">W3Cs JSON-LD credentials</a>, Hyperledger Aries could be one of the first movers in providing the ability to use ZKP-enabled W3C credentials in messaging, resulting in a more private and secure exchange of information between users or even&nbsp;devices.</p> Iden3 <p><a href="https://docs.iden3.io/">Iden3</a> is an open-source project aiming to provide a new and decentralized solution for digital identities. Based on ZKPs, Iden3 powers really neat use cases like <a href="https://iden3-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/9cdef79316906f09753cbca69c965e92/iden3_ethcc_presentation.pdf">anonymous logins and reputation proofs</a> while not requiring users to disclose their actual identity. Although it is in the early stages of development, the use cases of an open-sourced and community-driven digital identity solution for end users seem manifold.</p><p>Iden3 developed its own Circom language and the <a href="https://github.com/iden3/circom">Circom 2.0 compiler</a> that allows creating <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/26/snarks.html">ZK-Snarks</a> (another type of ZKPs) on a more abstract and not mathematical level. This way, Circom allows for easy creation and integration of ZKPs. The figure below shows how <a href="https://docs.circom.io/">Circom</a> and SnarkJS can be used in combination.</p><a href="https://docs.circom.io/">Circom &amp;&nbsp;SnarkJS</a> Loopring <p><a href="https://loopring.org/#/about">Loopring is an open-sourced decentralized exchange using an Automated-Market-Maker(AMM) and zkRollups to provide a fast and cheap method for token exchanges and payment</a>s. Loopring and similar applications could very well introduce a significant improvement for multiple fields in the crypto industry like Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and NFT&nbsp;trading.</p><p>One of Loopring’s <a href="https://loopring.org/#/post/gamestop-nft-marketplace-powered-by-loopring-l2">latest announcements includes the hosting of GameStop’s upcoming NFT marketplace</a>. This might introduce the advantages of ZKPs to a broader audience.</p> dydx <p><a href="https://dydx.exchange/">dydx</a> is another <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/beginners-guide-perpetual-trading-dydx/">decentralized exchange mostly focusing on perpetual trading</a>. While dydx was initially launched on Ethereum’s layer 1 it <a href="https://dydx.exchange/blog/public">introduced trading as a layer 2 solution for Ethereum in mid-2021</a> through zkRollups. The solution used for enabling zkRollups is StarkWare’s StarkEx (described above). Using the layer 2 solution instead of the layer 1 solution provides various improvements to trading <a href="https://integral.dydx.exchange/scaling-with-starkware/">like instant off-chain settlement</a>. For a more detailed comparison of the benefits of the layer 2 approach please see <a href="https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-dydx-explaining-the-popular-crypto-derivatives-dex">this&nbsp;blog</a>.</p> Sorare <p><a href="https://sorare.com/">Sorare</a> uses ZKPs in an app for building your own soccer teams and trading your player cards. Like dydx, Sorare introduced its scaling solution of choice in the middle of 2021 by integrating the StarkEx Protocol. While there's nothing too special about Sorare, I think it is a great example of where the crypto (consumer) space is&nbsp;heading.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/sorare/scaling-sorare-on-ethereum-with-starkware-ccb1b0338ad3">In a blog entry, Pierre Duperrin explained the reasoning behind Sorare’s decision to use Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions that use ZKPs instead of other scaling solutions</a>. The key argument for ZKPs seems to be the <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition">scalability trilemma</a>. While there are other scaling solutions out there, ZKP-based solutions provide the advantage of not compromising on security or decentralization while increasing scalability.</p> Conclusion <p>ZKPs help to improve the scalability and privacy of a lot of existing solutions in the crypto space — for instance decentralized exchanges. Furthermore, ZKP can be a key enabler for the Web3.0 by improving privacy — not just on a transaction level but also on a network level. Users will be able to interact almost anonymously while still being able to provide the necessary information to participate in networks and applications.</p><p>Tools like Hyperledger Aries and networks like DuskNet will further enable businesses to utilize ZKP technology in privacy-preserving solutions. I can also think of scenarios where businesses will be able to integrate private solutions with public solutions. For example, using ZKP-enabled digital identities to participate in open markets privately. Personally, I am confident to say that crypto’s public sector (especially DeFi) will experience a lot of growth in 2022 and early 2023 through ZKP-based scalability improvements. This can already be seen by examples like Sorare or Loopring but will only accelerate once more applications integrate ZKPs.</p><p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes GmbH</a> is a provider of crypto-economy solutions based in Stuttgart, Germany.</p><p>51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/improving-scalability-and-privacy-of-blockchains-2022-update-on-zero-knowledge-proofs-2d90615f0dd">Improving Scalability and Privacy of Blockchains: 2022 Update on Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Da oggi la PEC di Infocert – già scelta da oltre 2,9 milioni di imprese e professionisti -è disponibile anche per usi non professionali</p>



<p>Roma, 17 maggio 2022 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, presenta Legalmail Personal, la <a href="https://www.legalmail.infocert.it/prodotti/legalmail-personal/">casella di Posta Elettronica Certificata (PEC) Legalmail</a> dedicata esclusivamente agli utenti non professionali, per tutte le comunicazioni che necessitano di valore legale. Alternativa alla tradizionale raccomandata e più conveniente di una PEC dedicata ad imprese e professionisti, Legalmail personal è la nuova offerta InfoCert a supporto della digitalizzazione dei cittadini, in continuità con il successo di SPID che la società ha contribuito ad ottenere.</p>



<p>Con dominio @pecprivato.it, le caselle Legalmail Personal di InfoCert offrono – nella versione base – 1 gigabyte di spazio, la ricezione illimitata delle comunicazioni di terzi e un pacchetto di 5 invii inclusi.</p>



<p>Qualora si dovesse esaurire il plafond di GB a disposizione o di invii prima della scadenza, sarà possibile richiedere comodamente pacchetti addizionali. Viceversa, in caso di mancato utilizzo, giga e invii non andranno perduti ma saranno disponibili al rinnovo.</p>



<p>I servizi base Legalmail Personal possono essere arricchiti con tool extra di cybersecurity per phishing e password protection, per una difesa ancora più efficace dalle minacce informatiche.</p>



<p>“L’Italia sta progressivamente guadagnando posizioni in Europa in termini di digitalizzazione: lo testimonia il fatto che, nel giro di soli 5 anni, il nostro Paese è passato dalla venticinquesima alla ventesima posizione nel DESI Index. A raggiungere questo risultato hanno indubbiamente contribuito gli sforzi di professionisti, imprese e pubbliche amministrazioni in termini di trasformazione digitale, ma – parimenti – è stato fondamentale il cambio di passo compiuto dai cittadini, sempre più propensi a preferire i canali e gli strumenti digitali a quelli fisici e tradizionali.” Commenta Giuseppe Tusa, responsabile marketing di Legalmail, InfoCert – Tinexta Group “Per questo abbiamo realizzato la versione Personal della nostra storica PEC Legalmail: per offrire uno strumento semplice ed economico a tutti gli utenti privati che potranno inviare via PEC disdette di abbonamenti, iscriversi ad un concorso, gestire comunicazioni all’interno di associazioni o condomini e scambiare messaggi certificati alla PA.”</p>



<p>Come tutte le altre versioni di Legalmail, anche la casella Personal – disponibile in promozione da 4,90 euro fino al 31 luglio, IVA inclusa – è utilizzabile via WEB, tramite App mobile ed è anche integrabile nel client di posta già in uso dall’utente per l’invio e la ricezione dei messaggi e-mail “tradizionali.</p>



<p>InfoCert SpA</p>



<p>InfoCert, Tinexta Group, è la più grande Certification Authority europea, attiva in oltre venti Paesi. La società eroga servizi di digitalizzazione, eDelivery, Firma Digitale e conservazione digitale dei documenti ed è gestore accreditato AgID dell’identità digitale nell’ambito di SPID (Sistema Pubblico per la gestione dell’Identità Digitale).

<p>US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen has called for far greater regulation of the stablecoin market amid last week’s unprecedented volatility of TerraUSD (UST). The popular algorithmically-backed stablecoin was supposed to maintain a value of one dollar, but it fell to as low as 9 cents on May 16th. Previously, Janet Yellen had spoken quite positively and optimistically in regard to the stablecoin market and its potential for financial innovation and inclusion. Her remarks towards stablecoins were particularly hopeful considering her longstanding criticism of cryptoassets for reasons of volatility and overwhelming risk to the market.&nbsp;</p>

   The demands placed on front-end web applications continue to grow.  As consumers, we expect our web applications to be feature-rich and highly performant. As developers, we worry about how to provide quality features and performance while keeping good development practices and architecture in mind. 

 Enter micro-frontend architecture. Micro frontends are modeled after the same concept as microser

  <p>The demands placed on front-end web applications continue to grow.  As consumers, we expect our web applications to be feature-rich and highly performant. As developers, we worry about how to provide quality features and performance while keeping good development practices and architecture in mind.</p>

<p>Enter micro-frontend architecture. Micro frontends are modeled after the same concept as microservices, as a way to decompose monolithic frontends. You can combine micro-sized frontends  to form a fully-featured web app. Since each micro frontend can be developed and deployed independently, you have a powerful way of scaling out frontend applications.</p>

<p>So what does the micro-frontend architecture look like? Let’s say you have an e-commerce site that looks as stunning as this one:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You might have a shopping cart, account information for registered users, past orders, payment options, etc. You might be able to further categorize these features into domains, each of which could be a separate micro frontend, also known as a <code>remote</code>. The collection of micro-frontend remotes is housed inside another website, the <code>host</code> of the web application.</p>

<p>So, your e-commerce site using micro frontends to decompose different functionality might look like this diagram, where the shopping cart and account features are in their separate routes within your Single Page Application (SPA):</p>

<p></p>

<p>You might be saying, “Micro frontends sound cool, but managing the different frontends and orchestrating state across the micro frontends also sounds complicated.” You’re right. The concept of a micro frontend has been around for a few years and rolling your own micro-frontend implementation, shared state, and tools to support it was quite an undertaking. However, micro frontends are now well supported with Webpack 5 and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/">Module Federation</a>. Not all web apps require a micro-frontend architecture, but for those large, feature-rich web apps that have started to get unwieldy, the first-class support of micro frontends in our web tooling is definitely a plus.</p>

<p>This post is part one in a series where we’ll build an e-commerce site using Angular and micro frontends. We’ll use Webpack 5 with Module Federation to support wiring the micro frontends together. Then we’ll demonstrate sharing authenticated state between the different frontends, and deploy it all to a free cloud hosting provider.</p>

<p>In this first post, we’ll explore a starter project and understand how the different apps connect, add authentication using Okta, and add the wiring for sharing authenticated state. In the end, you’ll have an app that looks like this:</p>

 Micro-frontend starter using Webpack 5 and Module Federation 

<p>There’s a lot in this web app! We’ll use a starter code to make sure we focus on the code that’s specific to the micro frontend. If you’re dismayed that you’re using a starter and not starting from scratch, don’t worry. I’ll provide the Angular CLI commands to recreate the structure of this starter app on the repository’s README.md so you have all the instructions.</p>

<p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example">Angular Micro Frontend Example</a> GitHub repo by following the steps below and open the repo in your favorite IDE.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example.git
cd okta-angular-microfrontend-example
npm ci
</code>   

<p>Let’s dive into the code! 🎉</p>

<p>We have an Angular project with two applications and one library inside the <code>src/projects</code> directory. The two applications are named <code>shell</code> and <code>mfe-basket</code>, and the library is named <code>shared</code>. The <code>shell</code> application is the micro-frontend host, and the <code>mfe-basket</code> is a micro-frontend remote application. The <code>shared</code> library contains code and application state we want to share across the site. When you apply the same sort of diagram shown above for this app, it looks like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this project, we use the <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> dependency to help encapsulate some of the intricacies of configuring Webpack and the Module Federation plugin. The <code>shell</code> and <code>mfe-basket</code> application have their own separate <code>webpack.config.js</code>. Open the <code>projects/shell/webpack.config.js</code> file for either the <code>shell</code> or <code>mfe-basket</code> application to see the overall structure. This file is where we add in the wiring for the hosts, remotes, shared code, and shared dependencies in the Module Federation plugin. The structure will be different if you aren’t using the <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> dependency, but the basic idea for configuration remains the same.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the sections of this config file.</p>

   <code>// ...imports here

const sharedMappings = new mf.SharedMappings();
sharedMappings.register(
  path.join(__dirname, '../../tsconfig.json'),
  [
    '@shared'
  ]);

module.exports = {
  // ...other very important config properties
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      library: { type: "module" },

      // For remotes (please adjust)
      // name: "shell",
      // filename: "remoteEntry.js",
      // exposes: {
      //     './Component': './projects/shell/src/app/app.component.ts',
      // },        
        
      // For hosts (please adjust)
      remotes: {
        "mfeBasket": "http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.js",
      },

      shared: share({
        // ...important external libraries to share

        ...sharedMappings.getDescriptors()
      })
    }),
    sharedMappings.getPlugin()
  ],
};
</code>   

<p>In the <code>webpack.config.js</code> for <code>mfe-basket</code>, you’ll see the path for <code>@shared</code> at the top of the file and the configuration to identify what to expose in the remote application.</p>

<p>The <code>shell</code> application serves on port 4200, and the <code>mfe-basket</code> application serves on port 4201. We can open up two terminals to run each application, or we can use the following npm script created for us by the schematic to add <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code>:</p>

   <code>npm run run:all
</code>   

<p>When you do so, you’ll see both applications open in your browser and how they fit together in the <code>shell</code> application running on port 4200. Click the Basket button to navigate to a new route that displays the <code>BasketModule</code> in the <code>mfe-basket</code> application. The sign-in button doesn’t work quite yet, but we’ll get it going here next.</p>

<p>Note - Another option I could have used for the starter is a <a href="https://nx.dev/">Nx workspace</a>. Nx has great tooling and built-in support for building micro frontends with Webpack and Module Federation. But I wanted to go minimalistic on the project tooling so you’d have a chance to dip your toes into some of the configuration requirements.</p>

<p>The <code>@shared</code> syntax might look a little unusual to you. You may have expected to see a relative path to the library. The <code>@shared</code> syntax is an alias for the library’s path, which is defined in the project’s <code>tsconfig.json</code> file. You don’t have to do this. You can leave libraries using the relative path, but adding aliases makes your code look cleaner and helps ensure best practices for code architecture.</p>

<p>Because the host application doesn’t know about the remote applications except in the <code>webpack.config.js</code>, we help out the TypeScript compiler by declaring the remote application in <code>decl.d.ts</code>. You can see all the configuration changes and source code made for the starter <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example/commit/b851320ca9418b8e28890fab15c7da5313eb8275">in this commit</a>.</p>

 Add authentication using OpenID Connect 

<p>One of the most useful features of Module Federation is managing shared code and state. Let’s see how this all works by adding authentication to the project. We’ll use the authenticated state in the existing application and with a new micro frontend.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the <code>Issuer</code> and the <code>Client ID</code>. You’ll need those values here soon.</p>

<p>We’ll use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-angular">Okta Angular</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-auth-js">Okta Auth JS</a> libraries to connect our Angular application with Okta authentication. Add them to your project by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install @okta/okta-angular@5.2 @okta/okta-auth-js@6.4
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to import the <code>OktaAuthModule</code> into the <code>AppModule</code> of the <code>shell</code> project and add the Okta configuration. Replace the placeholders in the code below with the <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code> from earlier.</p>

   <code>import { OKTA_CONFIG, OktaAuthModule } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
});

@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...,
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth } }
  ],
  ...
})
</code>   

<p>After authenticating with Okta, we need to set up the login callback to finalize the sign-in process. Open <code>app-routing.module.ts</code> in the <code>shell</code> project and update the routes array as shown below.</p>

   <code>import { OktaCallbackComponent } from '@okta/okta-angular';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: ProductsComponent },
  { path: 'basket', loadChildren: () =&gt; import('mfeBasket/Module').then(m =&gt; m.BasketModule) },
  { path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
];
</code>   

<p>Now that we’ve configured Okta in the application, we can add the code to sign in and sign out. Open <code>app.component.ts</code> in the <code>shell</code> project. We will add the methods to sign in and sign out using the Okta libraries. We’ll also update the two public variables to use the actual authenticated state. Update your code to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { filter, map, Observable, shareReplay } from 'rxjs';
import { OKTA_AUTH, OktaAuthStateService } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styles: []
})
export class AppComponent {
  public isAuthenticated$: Observable&lt;boolean&gt; = this.oktaStateService.authState$
      .pipe(
          filter(authState =&gt; !!authState),
          map(authState =&gt; authState.isAuthenticated ?? false),
          shareReplay()
      );
  
  public name$: Observable&lt;string&gt; = this.oktaStateService.authState$
      .pipe(
          filter(authState =&gt; !!authState &amp;&amp; !!authState.isAuthenticated),
          map(authState =&gt; authState.idToken?.claims.name ?? '')
      );

  constructor(private oktaStateService: OktaAuthStateService, @Inject(OKTA_AUTH) private oktaAuth: OktaAuth) { }

  public async signIn(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    await this.oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
  }

  public async signOut(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    await this.oktaAuth.signOut();
  }
}
</code>   

<p>We need to add the click handlers for the sign-in and sign-out buttons. Open <code>app.component.html</code> in the <code>shell</code> project. Update the code for Sign In and Sign Out buttons as shown.</p>

   <code>&lt;li&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="(isAuthenticated$ | async) === false; else logout"
    class="flex items-center transition ease-in delay-150 duration-300 h-10 px-4 rounded-lg hover:border hover:border-sky-400"
    (click)="signIn()"
  &gt;
    &lt;span class="material-icons-outlined text-gray-500"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sign In&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/button&gt;

    &lt;ng-template #logout&gt;
      &lt;button 
        class="flex items-center transition ease-in delay-150 duration-300 h-10 px-4 rounded-lg hover:border hover:border-sky-400"
        (click)="signOut()"
      &gt;
        &lt;span class="material-icons-outlined text-gray-500"&gt;logout&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sign Out&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/ng-template&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code>   

<p>Try running the project using <code>npm run run:all</code>. Now you’ll be able to sign in and sign out. And when you sign in, a new button for Profile shows up. Nothing happens when you click it, but we’re going to create a new remote, connect it to the host, and share the authenticated state here next!</p>

 Create a new Angular application 

<p>Now you’ll have a chance to see how a micro-frontend remote connects to the host by creating a micro-frontend app that shows the authenticated user’s profile information. Stop serving the project and run the following command in the terminal to create a new Angular application in the project:</p>

   <code>ng generate application mfe-profile --routing --style css --inline-style --skip-tests
</code>   

<p>With this Angular CLI command you</p>
 
   Generated a new application named <code>mfe-profile</code>, which includes a module and a component 
   Added a separate routing module to the application 
   Defined the CSS styles to be inline in the components 
   Skipped creating associated test files for the initial component 
 

<p>You’ll now create a component for the default route, <code>HomeComponent</code>, and a module to house the micro frontend. We could wire up the micro frontend to only use a component instead of a module. In fact, a component will cover our needs for a profile view, but we’ll use a module so you can see how each micro frontend can grow as the project evolves. Run the following two commands in the terminal:</p>

   <code>ng generate component home --project mfe-profile
ng generate module profile --project mfe-profile --module app --routing --route profile
</code>   

<p>With these two Angular CLI commands you:</p>
 
   Created a new component, <code>HomeComponent</code>, in the <code>mfe-profile</code> application 
   Created a new module, <code>ProfileModule</code>, with routing and a default component, <code>ProfileComponent</code>. You also added the <code>ProfileModule</code> as a lazy-loaded route using the ‘/profile’ path to the <code>AppModule</code>. 
 

<p>Let’s update the code. First, we’ll add the default route. Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> and add a new route for <code>HomeComponent</code>. Your route array should match the code below.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'profile', loadChildren: () =&gt; import('./profile/profile.module').then(m =&gt; m.ProfileModule) }
];
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll update the <code>AppComponent</code> and <code>HomeComponent</code> templates. Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/src/app/app.component.html</code> and delete all the code in there. Replace it with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hey there! You're viewing the Profile MFE project! 🎉&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
</code>   

<p>Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/src/app/home/home.component.html</code> and replace all the code in the file with:</p>

   <code>&lt;p&gt;
  There's nothing to see here. 👀 &lt;br/&gt;
  The MFE is this way ➡️ &lt;a routerLink="/profile"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code>   

<p>Finally, we can update the code for the profile. Luckily, Angular CLI took care of a lot of the scaffolding for us. So we just need to update the component’s TypeScript file and the template.</p>

<p>Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/src/app/profile/profile.component.ts</code> and edit the component to add the two public properties and include the <code>OktaAuthStateService</code> in the constructor:</p>

   <code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { OktaAuthStateService } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { filter, map } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-profile',
  templateUrl: './profile.component.html',
  styles: []
})
export class ProfileComponent {
  public profile$ = this.oktaStateService.authState$.pipe(
    filter(state =&gt; !!state &amp;&amp; !!state.isAuthenticated),
    map(state =&gt; state.idToken?.claims)
  );

  public date$ = this.oktaStateService.authState$.pipe(
    filter(state =&gt; !!state &amp;&amp; !!state.isAuthenticated),
    map(state =&gt; (state.idToken?.claims.auth_time as number) * 1000),
    map(epochTime =&gt; new Date(epochTime)),
  );

  constructor(private oktaStateService: OktaAuthStateService) { }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, open the corresponding template file and replace the existing code with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;h3 class="text-xl mb-6"&gt;Your Profile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div *ngIf="profile$ | async as profile"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Name: &lt;span class="font-semibold"&gt;{{profile.name}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="my-3"&gt;Email: &lt;span class="font-semibold"&gt;{{profile.email}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Last signed in at &lt;span class="font-semibold"&gt;{{date$ | async | date:'full'}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Try running the <code>mfe-profile</code> app by itself by running <code>ng serve mfe-profile --open</code> in the terminal. Notice when we navigate to the <code>/profile</code> route, we see a console error. We added Okta into the <code>shell</code> application, but now we need to turn the <code>mfe-profile</code> application into a micro frontend and share the authenticated state. Stop serving the application so we’re ready for the next step.</p>

 Module Federation for your Angular application 

<p>We want to use the schematic from <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> to turn the <code>mfe-profile</code> application into a micro frontend and add the necessary configuration. We’ll use port 4202 for this application. Add the schematic by running the following command in the terminal:</p>

   <code>ng add @angular-architects/module-federation --project mfe-profile --port 4202
</code>   

<p>This schematic does the following:</p>
 
   Updates the project’s <code>angular.json</code> config file to add the port for the application and updates the builder to use a custom Webpack builder 
   Creates the <code>webpack.config.js</code> files and scaffolds out default configuration for Module Federation 
 

<p>First, let’s add the new micro frontend to the <code>shell</code> application by updating the configuration in <code>projects/mfe-profile/webpack.config.js</code>. In the middle of the file, there’s a property for <code>plugins</code> with commented-out code. We need to finish configuring that. Since this application is a remote, we’ll update the snippet of code under the comment:</p>

   <code>// For remotes (please adjust)
</code>   

<p>The defaults are mostly correct, except we have a module, not a component that we want to expose. If you want to expose a component instead, all you’d do is update which component to expose. Update the configuration snippet to expose the <code>ProfileModule</code> by matching the following code snippet:</p>

   <code>// For remotes (please adjust)
name: "mfeProfile",
filename: "remoteEntry.js",
exposes: {
  './Module': './projects/mfe-profile/src/app/profile/profile.module.ts',
},
</code>   

<p>Now we can incorporate the micro frontend in the <code>shell</code> application. Open <code>projects/shell/webpack.config.js</code>. Here is where you’ll add the new micro frontend so that the <code>shell</code> application knows how to access it. In the middle of the file, inside the <code>plugins</code> array, there’s a property for <code>remotes</code>. The micro frontend in the starter code, <code>mfeBasket</code>, is already added to the <code>remotes</code> object. You’ll also add the remote for <code>mfeProfile</code> there, following the same pattern but replacing the port to 4202. Update your configuration to look like this.</p>

   <code>// For hosts (please adjust)
remotes: {
  "mfeBasket": "http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.js",
  "mfeProfile": "http://localhost:4202/remoteEntry.js"
},
</code>   

<p>We can update the code to incorporate the profile’s micro frontend. Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code>. Add a path to the profile micro frontend in the routes array using the path ‘profile’. Your routes array should look like this.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: ProductsComponent },
  { path: 'basket', loadChildren: () =&gt; import('mfeBasket/Module').then(m =&gt; m.BasketModule) },
  { path: 'profile', loadChildren: () =&gt; import('mfeProfile/Module').then(m =&gt; m.ProfileModule)},
  { path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
];
</code>   

<p>What’s this!? The IDE flags the import path as an error! The <code>shell</code> application code doesn’t know about the Profile module, and TypeScript needs a little help. Open <code>projects/shell/src/decl.d.ts</code> and add the following line of code.</p>

   <code>declare module 'mfeProfile/Module';
</code>   

<p>The IDE should be happier now. 😀</p>

<p>Next, update the navigation button for Profile in the <code>shell</code> application to route to the correct path. Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app.component.html</code> and find the <code>routerLink</code> for the Profile button. It should be approximately on line 38. Currently the <code>routerLink</code> configuration is <code>routerLink="/"</code>, but it should now be</p>

   <code>&lt;a routerLink="/profile"&gt;
</code>   

<p>This is everything we need to do to connect the micro-frontend remote to the host application, but we also want to share authenticated state. Module Federation makes sharing state a piece of (cup)cake.</p>

 Micro-frontend state management 

<p>To share a library, you need to configure the library in the <code>webpack.config.js</code>. Let’s start with <code>shell</code>. Open <code>projects/shell/src/webpack.config.js</code>.</p>

<p>There are two places to add shared code. One place is for code implementation within the project, and one is for shared external libraries. In this case, we can share the Okta external libraries as we didn’t implement a service that wraps Okta’s auth libraries, but I will point out both places.</p>

<p>First, we’ll add the Okta libraries. Scroll down towards the bottom of the file to the <code>shared</code> property. You’ll follow the same pattern as the <code>@angular</code> libraries already in the list and add the singleton instances of the two Okta libraries as shown in this snippet:</p>

   <code>shared: share({
  // other Angular libraries remain in the config. This is just a snippet
  "@angular/router": { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
  "@okta/okta-angular": { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
  "@okta/okta-auth-js": { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },

  ...sharedMappings.getDescriptors()
})
</code>   

<p>When you create a library within this project, like the basket service and project service in the starter code, you add the library to the <code>sharedMappings</code> array at the top of the <code>webpack.config.js</code> file. If you create a new library to wrap Okta’s libraries, this is where you’d add it.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve added the Okta libraries to the micro-frontend host, you need to also add them to the remotes that consume the dependencies. In our case, only the <code>mfe-profile</code> application uses Okta authenticated state information. Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/webpack.config.js</code>. Add the two Okta libraries to the <code>shared</code> property as you did for the <code>shell</code> application.</p>

<p>Now, you should be able to run the project using <code>npm run run:all</code>, and the cupcake storefront should allow you to log in, see your profile, log out, and add items to your cupcake basket!</p>

 Next steps 

<p>I hope you enjoyed this first post on creating an Angular micro-frontend site. We explored the capabilities of micro frontends and shared state between micro frontends using Webpack’s Module Federation in Angular.  You can check out the completed code for this post in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example/tree/local"><code>local</code> branch in the @oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example GitHub repo</a> by using the following command:</p>

   <code>git clone --branch local https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example.git
</code>   

<p>In the next post I’ll show how to prepare for deployment by transitioning to dynamic module loading and deploying the site to a free cloud provider. Let’s continue building the site by reading “<a>Secure and Deploy Micro Frontends with Angular</a>”!</p>

<p>Nobody likes spending excessive amounts of money. Be it Elon Musk, or your neighbor down the street. Fortunately, banks have stimulated spending money with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-credit-cards-for-credit-scores-of-580-and-below/">credit cards</a> at grocery stores, movie theaters, sports events, etc. over the years, with one very swift move — cash&nbsp;back.</p><p>Well, what’s the trick? Where does this money come from? In this article, we will review what cash back is, how it works, use cases, and 4 ways to earn cash&nbsp;back.</p> What is Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Cashback is a way of getting money back when you’re buying something, and it’s a feature that some credit cards have. Instead of paying the full price for things you buy with your credit card, you get a percentage of that cash&nbsp;back.</p><p>Credit cards with cash back rewards offer a certain percentage of every qualifying purchase back. For example, if you buy a pair of shoes with your credit card that offers one percent cash back, you’ll receive one percent of the amount you spent on the boots back into your&nbsp;account.</p><p>While not every credit card and bank works with the same percentage, typically it’s between 1–2% on average, with some unique campaigns in which you can earn even a more considerable rate.</p><p>This is not an enormous amount of money, but the bigger your credit card bill, the more significant the saving you can potentially make. If you make $2 per 100 spent, imagine what will happen if you spend $10,000. That’s $200 out of&nbsp;nowhere.</p><p>However, you should pay attention to the condition set by credit card issuers, before you go on a shopping spree. Some of them have limits (for example, up to $5,000 or $6,000 are eligible for earning cash&nbsp;back).</p> How Does Cash Back&nbsp;Work? <p>As the name indicates, cash back is money you receive in some way — be it via cash back rewards, money back into your account, or any other&nbsp;means.</p><p>Cash back credit cards are just one of many rewards credit cards out there, but this type of card is so popular because it can pay out at a high rate. For example, you can earn 5% cash back on your first $1500 in purchases every month. These rewards can also help you avoid paying interest charges or come close to them since they pay out money you would have otherwise spent.</p><p>All you need to do is find out if the grocery stores, gas stations, or other businesses that you regularly shop from are eligible for cash back, as banks don’t redeem cash from every place out&nbsp;there.</p> What About Cash Back Credit&nbsp;Cards? <p>There should be something for the bank, as cash back doesn’t come for free. You know the old&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>Money doesn’t grow on&nbsp;trees.</blockquote><p>That’s also valid here. Each credit card company (like VISA, Mastercard, and Amex) makes its money by applying a transaction fee on card payments (it’s floating, but let’s assume it’s around&nbsp;3%).</p><p>Since these companies are interested in you paying with a card rather than cash, they incentivize banks as mediators to offer you something in return. But banks also have another benefit — to promote their credit&nbsp;cards.</p><p>As we stated in the last point, not every place you shop from is eligible for cash back rewards. There is a criterion that should be met. Let’s see some of the common rules that&nbsp;apply:</p>  Unapproved stores — if you’re shopping from your local cafeteria, you might not receive a cash back, as the store is not recognized as a trusted&nbsp;seller.  Money exchange — if you use your money to exchange for another fiat currency, you won’t receive a cash back, as you are not spending&nbsp;money.  Gambling — gambling or anything associated with betting is among the spending categories that won’t qualify as eligible.   4 Ways to earn cash&nbsp;back  1. Cash back credit&nbsp;cards <p>I have already mentioned credit cards as the main way to receive cash back, but I’ll repeat myself again. If you’re not using cash back cards, you’re literally wasting cash. It’s the most straightforward way to get a percentage of almost everything you purchase. You can usually get 2–3% if you have good credit&nbsp;scores.</p> 2. Rewards&nbsp;sites <p>Another trend is <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/sites/">rewards sites</a>. They make things easier. Instead of getting a new credit card issued in your name and thinking of potential issues with interest and overspending, you can use rewards sites such as Monetha, where you receive awards for every purchase you make. You can then spend the cash rewards on gift cards from major shops and services, donate to charity, and even convert to crypto (visit <a href="https://monetha.io/">Monetha</a>&nbsp;now).</p> 3. Coupon&nbsp;websites <p>You can find fantastic promotional codes and offers on sites like Groupon, Livingsocial, and Rakuten. Not only will you receive a great deal on your purchases, but you can also earn money back in the form of discounts or cash back&nbsp;rewards.</p> 4. Post-purchase cash&nbsp;back <p>Post-purchase services provide cash back on purchases. The most common scenario is to get a percentage back after shopping, but you can also receive an extended warranty or join the lottery for free tickets to Paris or a new car. Some of these services are run by the stores you buy&nbsp;from.</p> How to Use Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Once you have generated enough cashback balance, then it is probably time for the sweetest part — to spend it somewhere. But where can you spend&nbsp;it?</p> As a statement credit <p>If you have a mortgage or some credit card debt, you can cover some of it with the cash back. The way it works is simple: it funds your available balance.</p><p>For example, you owe your bank $200 each month for a small housing decoration loan. When you generate $50 in cash back, in your statement credit report you will find the number -$150 instead of -$200, as a small portion, is absorbed by the cash&nbsp;back.</p> As an available balance <p>That’s certainly better than having a debt. Instead of financing your debt, you earn money that goes straight to your bank account, thus increasing your available balance.</p><p>Let’s say you have $1,000 available in your bank and have $100 redeem rewards. Once you receive them, you’ll have $1,100 to&nbsp;spend.</p> As a Gift&nbsp;Card <p>One common way to use your cash back is via a free credit for online shopping on Amazon, eBay, or other places. The gift card is a fixed amount that you can use either once or multiple times until the credit runs&nbsp;out.</p><p>There is one condition, though. The only way to pay the difference is by&nbsp;card.</p> As a&nbsp;Donation <p>It’s always a good idea to donate money to charity, and cash back is a good option to spend some money on good deeds without breaking the bank. In fact, you will pay a grand total of $0 of your own funds, but you will help people in a&nbsp;need.</p> When is a Good Idea to Have a Cash Back Credit&nbsp;Card? <p>Before we talk about the best cash back credit cards on the market, you need to decide for yourself if you’re up for it. Let’s see the ideal situation in which it’s worth having a&nbsp;go:</p>  You have good credit health — if you have an acceptable credit history, you will be able to access more cash back opportunities and grab better deals. This means you’ll have lower interest rates and much better paybacks.  You are disciplined — credit cards are a big gamble in the wrong hands. Failing to meet the deadline means you will pay brutal APRs which will often overshadow any perks of having cash back&nbsp;options.  You have shopping patterns — in order to get the best value out of your cash back provider, you have to shop from the same places to keep collecting points.   What are the Best Cash Back Credit Cards Out&nbsp;There? <p>Which are the hot offers if you would like to open a cash back credit card? Let’s find&nbsp;out.</p> 1. Discover it® Cash&nbsp;Back <p>This is the best option for huge spenders. You can get up to a 5% reward rate which is quarterly rotating spending categories. It comes with an impressive 0% annual fee and no minimum cashback redemption. It requires you to have a Credit Score of at least 700, and has a standard APR starting from&nbsp;12.24%.</p> 2. Capital One® Walmart Rewards®&nbsp;Card <p>There is a sweet 5% cash back bonus for the first 12 months of using the credit card. On top of that, there is a great 2% cash back that you can use for hotel stays and restaurants, which make it a very good option for Walmart shopping and traveling. You can apply with a Credit Score of 650+ points, making more people eligible. However, the APR is extremely high, often reaching up to&nbsp;30%.</p> 3. Chase Freedom&nbsp;Flex <p>Chase Freedom Flex is one of the best options for travelers, as it can rival even travel cards. There’s a generous welcome bonus of $200 and you pay $0 in annual fees. However, the APR is about 16–20% on average, and you should have an outstanding Credit Score of 700+ points to apply for&nbsp;it.</p> 4. Ink Business Unlimited® Credit&nbsp;Card <p>This credit card is one of the most generous, as you earn a $750 bonus cash back as a welcome bonus + 0% APR for the first year. You also don’t have an annual fee but you do have about 17%-20% APR on it. However, one of the main perks is the unlimited 1.5% cash back rewards on all purchases. This is great for businesses, but the Credit Score requirements are also high — 700+&nbsp;points.</p> 5. Amazon Business Prime American Express&nbsp;Card <p>If you’re constantly using Amazon for your online shopping, this card is the right choice. You can receive up to $100 cash back, there’s no annual fee, and you can earn up to 5% back from Amazon’s orders. You can also swap the 5% for 90-day 0% APR financing, which is the main benefit of the card. Bear in mind you should be an Amazon Prime member with a good Credit Score (700+ points), and the penalty APR is&nbsp;huge.</p> 6. U.S. Bank Business Triple Cash Rewards World Elite™ Mastercard® <p>One of the most generous welcome offers is the one promoted by the U.S. Bank. Up to $500 cash back as a welcome bonus, paired with a 0% annual fee, is a fantastic boost. It also has a promotional 0% APR + 3% cash back on different bonus categories. However, there’s one catch — there is a huge standard APR (it can easily exceed 25%), and there’s a balance transfer fee that can eat up you&nbsp;savings.</p> 7. American Express® Business Gold&nbsp;Card <p>Unlike other cards on the list, the AMEX Business Gold card works with points that you can collect. It is a superb value for money if you’re traveling a lot with up to 20–25% cash back on travel flights. You receive up to 60–70 thousand points and 4 points per dollar for the first $150,000. However, there’s a $295 annual fee which is steep. On top of that, the APR rate is not low, starting from 15% and going well beyond the&nbsp;20s.</p> 8. The Hilton Honors American Express Business&nbsp;Card <p>If you travel to luxurious destinations or prefer quality for your business trip, this is the right credit card. You get an excellent value for the annual fee of $95, and on top of that, you’ll get more than 100,000 points. There are no foreign transaction fees, which is a great added bonus, and it’s a great option if you are a Hilton hotel fan. However, you should bear in mind this card has no real value if you’re not a Hilton user. On top of that, there is a high APR fee of up to&nbsp;25%.</p> What Stores Give You Most Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Of course, when we talk about generous offers from credit card issuers, we need to mention the stores that give the best credit card&nbsp;rewards.</p> 1. Kroger <p>Kroger is quite generous with its offer. You can get up to $120 cash back at the store with Discovery card, and you also have to up to $300 for debit cards. There are some things to consider, though: there is a $0.50 fee for cash back amounts of up to $100 and $1.50 for amounts between $100.01 and&nbsp;$300.</p> 2. Whole&nbsp;Foods <p>Whole Foods is pretty standard in its offering. They include all spending categories but can redeem $100 back which is not a bad&nbsp;amount.</p> 3. Walmart <p>Walmart limits you to $20 up to $100 cash back, and it depends on the bonus category you’ve chosen. However, you cannot redeem more than $20 at&nbsp;once.</p> 4. Target <p>Target lets you cash back up to $40 and just like Walmart, you cannot redeem more than $20 at&nbsp;once.</p> Final Thoughts <p>If you already have a credit card, you can benefit from a lot of bonus cash via cash back. It’s money that you can use for so many purposes — you can pay less, cover your debts, and even&nbsp;donate.</p><p>But in case you don’t have a credit card yet, you should consider the benefits against the disadvantages. If you’re not disciplined enough and cannot take control of your spending, you might end up in massive debt, as APR on credit cards is much higher than standard loans and mortgages.</p><p>And if you don’t have a credit card and have no intention to get one, we have to say that there are many options to get a lot of cash back. All you need to do is sign up with a rewards site like Monetha, and you can save as you&nbsp;spend!</p><p>If you like this article, check out our blog post about how to <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/earn-money-from-your-data/">earn money from your&nbsp;data</a>!</p><p>*Disclaimer: All the information is based on Monetha’s research.

			<p>16th May, Luxembourg – <a href="https://www.dltjewel.com/">Jewel</a>, a Bermuda-based digital asset banking platform that has applied for a combined full-service bank and digital-asset license in Bermuda, seeks to offer a full range of digital asset services to institutional clients including payments, banking, custody and lending. In partnership with digital asset compliance infrastructure provider <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, Jewel will power real time settlement for digital asset institutions via its own bank issued USD stablecoin on the Polygon, the leading blockchain development platform, offering scalable and sustainable Web3 infrastructure.</p>
<p>Longer term, Jewel aims to offer a stablecoin-as-a-service solution to other digital asset and financial institutions B2B, allowing those businesses to provide cheaper, easier and near real time payments with stablecoins issued and redeemable directly at the bank level at Jewel.</p>
<p>As digital transformation flourishes across all industries and aspects of finance, banking, and payments, businesses are demanding payment solutions that are fast, inexpensive and programmable. Conventional payment systems are often fragmented and inefficient, creating a challenge for customers who trade and transact globally 24/7/365.</p>
<p>Jewel was an early driver for the use and acceptance of distributed ledger technology and stablecoins within banks tied to bank deposits. Today, Jewel’s bank direct approach is becoming an intelligent and appropriate risk-based approach that US and other regulators are now touting for the structure of stablecoins and their issuance and administration, as reflected in the Biden Administration’s recent Report on Stablecoins from the US President’s Working Group (stating their opinion that stablecoin should be issued by banks and other regulated deposit-taking institutions). This was then further defined under the Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets. Jewel’s stablecoin, Jewel USD (JUSD) will eliminate the need for reconciliation and enable instant payments and transfers to members of its settlement network, “Jewel Settle”.</p>

		 
	 
    Our proposed banking license will allow us to service global firms from Bermuda as we issue fiat-backed stablecoins, first with USD and then a growing number of other proposed single fiat currency stablecoins globally. Through our partnership with Tokeny, we’re able to ensure compliant stablecoin issuance and management in a scalable and easy-to-integrate manner. As a result, we can devote most of our time and resources to further developing our business opportunities. We are already in discussions with exchanges, bank and non-bank financial institutions, and governments, and there is a considerable amount of interest in our offerings.  Chancellor BarnettJewel Founder and Chairman    
	 
		 
			<p>Jewel has chosen Tokeny, the leader in the tokenization field, as its technology partner to assist them with the issuance, transfer, and management of fiat-backed stablecoins on the Polygon Network. Through Tokeny’s API-based solutions, Jewel can issue ERC-3643 permissioned tokens, ensuring the necessary controls and compliance that are required by regulators.</p>

		 
	 
    We are pleased to provide our partner Jewel with a tailored technology solution, so they can focus on their core businesses without having to worry about technology. Together, we can transform the global payment system and accelerate the growth of the digital asset ecosystem.  Luc FalempinCEO at Tokeny

<p>Brand loyalty measurement is more challenging to measure than you think. Consumers are smart and savvy. They change their habits when they are presented with other options that better meet their needs and&nbsp;desires.</p><p>There is an ultimate cost-benefit analysis happening in the mind of consumers on a constant basis. Each time you recommend, highlight, or show off your brand, however, you are adding value. That value must exceed your competitors for it to be effective and build brand&nbsp;loyalty.</p> What is Brand&nbsp;Loyalty? <p>What is brand loyalty? It’s the tendency for consumers to remain loyal to specific brands. A consumer who exhibits brand loyalty will remain loyal even when alternatives are less expensive or offer more features. When a consumer demonstrates brand loyalty, they develop personal feelings toward the brand and its products that influence their choice of brands in a category. Some reasons why consumers exhibit brand loyalty can&nbsp;include:</p>  An emotional attachment to the brand and its&nbsp;identity  A belief in the company’s mission statement and its products/services  A belief in the company’s quality and reliability  <p>Some businesses use loyalty programs to reward frequent customers for returning (learn more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">loyalty programs best practices here</a>), while others attempt to build customer loyalty through marketing campaigns or social media interactions.</p> Why is Brand Loyalty Important? <p>Brand loyalty can be important for several reasons. For example, it helps to build a positive reputation for a company and its products. If a customer is satisfied with their experience with a brand, they are likely to tell other people about their positive experience. Word of mouth is an extremely powerful tool that can bring in new customers.</p><p>A loyal customer base can also be extremely helpful to any business, because they are more likely to remain loyal to the company’s products even if they encounter other products that may be comparable or better, as long as they have had a positive experience with the brand. This is especially helpful in the case of businesses that sell very specific products or services where it is unlikely that there will be many comparable products on the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Another major advantage of brand loyalty is that it can help companies save money by reducing marketing costs and increasing sales. Loyal customers are more likely to purchase items from the same brand over and over again, so businesses don’t have to keep investing in advertising campaigns to promote their products.</p> What is the Difference Between Brand Loyalty and Customer&nbsp;Loyalty? <p>Brand loyalty and customer loyalty are two terms that are often used interchangeably; however, there is an important difference between the&nbsp;two.</p><p>Customer loyalty refers to <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/customer-commitment/">customers’ feelings of commitment</a> or dedication to a company, brand, or product. Brand loyalty refers to customers’ feelings of commitment or dedication to a particular product within a company’s line of products.</p><p>This can be confusing because many companies use the term “loyalty” when speaking about both brand loyalty and customer loyalty. To avoid confusion, it is important to recognize the difference between these&nbsp;terms.</p><p>The main differences between brand and customer loyalty&nbsp;are:</p>  Brand loyalty means that customers will buy anything that comes from a particular company/brand, while customer loyalty means that customers will only buy a specific&nbsp;product.  Brand loyalty usually refers to brands in the same industry, while customer loyalty usually refers to related products within the same industry.  Brand loyalty can be measured over time, while customer loyalty can be measured once the sale is&nbsp;made.  Brand loyalty is not as strong as customer loyalty because of potential changes in the company/brand’s image.  <p>Another significant difference between brand and customer loyalty is that brands tend to be valued by consumers for their symbolic meaning in a way that companies themselves can’t control, whereas customer-company relationships are mostly based on subjective evaluations of a company’s products and services.</p><p>For example, Coca-Cola has been <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/coca-cola-christmas-marketing/">associated with Christmas</a> for many years now, and people just associate it with this holiday — that’s what makes it a brand. However, Coca-Cola can’t control these associations in the same way it can determine how its products or services are perceived by customers.</p> How to Measure Brand Loyalty: The 6 Key&nbsp;Metrics <p>Brand loyalty is an important thing to measure because it will tell you how customers feel about your brand. If you have high brand loyalty, that means that you’re gaining customers who will purchase your products again in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>High brand loyalty can also mean that you have a high customer satisfaction level, which is always a good sign for any business.</p><p>To determine brand loyalty, you’ll want to measure the following metrics:</p>  Customer churn rate&nbsp;(CCR)  Net Promoter Score&nbsp;(NPS)  Customer Lifetime Value&nbsp;(CLV)  Customer Retention Rate&nbsp;(CRR)  Repeat Purchase Rate&nbsp;(RPR)  Purchase Frequency (PF)  <p>Once your target market feels connected with your company, they’ll be more likely to show brand loyalty towards&nbsp;it.</p> 1. Customer Churn Rate&nbsp;(CCR) <p>Customer churn rate (CCR) is a ratio of customer losses to total customers. It is calculated by dividing the number of customers lost during a period by the total number of customers at the beginning of that period. It is often expressed as a percentage value.</p><p>When calculating CCR, only leave-of-absence cancellations should be included in the numerator, and future expected cancellations should be excluded from both the numerator and denominator.</p><p>The resulting value represents an estimation of how many customers will cancel service during a given period, whether because they are not satisfied with the service or because they are leaving the region where the service is provided.</p><p>Counting and excluding cancellations correctly is important for assessing both how well your company retains its existing customers and how much future revenue will be generated by current services.</p> 2. Net Promoter Score&nbsp;(NPS) <p>There are a number of metrics that can be used to measure brand loyalty. The most common is called the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which measures how willing customers are to recommend your business to other people. NPS is calculated by having your customers rank their likelihood of recommending your business on a scale from 1 to&nbsp;10.</p><p>Customers that answer with a 9 or 10 are considered “promoters” of your brand, and customers that answer with a 6 or lower are considered “detractors.” The percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of promoters and provides you with your NPS score. This score can go from -100 (all detractors) to 100 (all promoters). The higher your NPS score, the more loyal customers you&nbsp;have.</p><p>NPS consists of a survey that asks one question: “How likely is it that you would recommend this company/product/service to a friend or colleague?” The answers range from zero (not likely at all) to ten (extremely likely). Customers who answer with a nine or ten are called “Promoters.” Customers who answer with seven or eight are called “Passives.” And finally, customers who answer with six or below are called “Detractors.”</p><p>To calculate NPS, subtract the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters. Passives count toward the total number of respondents, but they don’t count toward the score itself. So if 50% of your customers are Promoters, 40% are Passives, and 10% are Detractors, your NPS is&nbsp;40%.</p> 3. Customer Lifetime Value&nbsp;(CLV) <p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is one of the most commonly used metrics to assess brand loyalty. It predicts your customer’s worth to your company, so it’s a great way to show how much the customer values you and your brand. The higher the CLV, the more loyal the customer is likely to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Once you have an idea of the monetary value of your customers, you can use that data to determine the cost of customer retention.The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) gives you an idea of how much revenue a single customer can bring to your business over their lifetime as a customer. It is basically a measure of the value of each individual customer to your business.</p><p>When calculating CLV, you’ll need to estimate the average amount of time that a customer remains loyal to your company. This is fairly simple: just divide the total number of months you’ve been in business by the number of customers you have lost since&nbsp;then.</p> 4. Customer retention rate&nbsp;(CRR) <p>Customer retention rate (CRR) is a term used by businesses to describe the percentage of customers that return to purchase additional products or services. A company usually measures its CRR as a ratio, showing how many returning customers there are for every 100 new customers that are acquired. The higher this ratio, the more confident management is that the company will be able to make future sales and keep growth&nbsp;steady.</p><p>The purpose of calculating CRR is to figure out how effectively a business is retaining customers: if it can retain more customers than it loses, management knows that it is not going to lose money in the long run. It’s also a way of evaluating how well a business communicates with its existing clientele and what type of loyalty program would be best at encouraging them to stay. One thing important to note here: CRR only measures the number of current customers who purchase again from the business, not those who switch over to another brand or&nbsp;company.</p><p>In most cases, managers will calculate CRR by dividing the total number of returning customers by the total number of new customers acquired in one year. There are other ways to measure this ratio-like dividing the number of returning customers by the number of active accounts-and they will yield very different results.</p> 5. Repeat Purchase Rate&nbsp;(RPR) <p>Repeat Purchase Rate, also known as Customer Loyalty Index (CLI), is a business metric that measures how much customers come back to buy from a brand again and again. Repeat Purchase Rate is a strong indicator of your customers’ loyalty to your brand. To calculate Repeat Purchase Rate, add up all the sales you had in one period and divide that number by the number of customers who purchased at least once during that&nbsp;period.</p><p>For example, an RPR that is calculated for a month can be thought of as the proportion of customers who made a purchase at some point in that month and then went on to make another purchase during that same&nbsp;month.</p><p>RPR can be divided by industry because customer behavior can vary dramatically between industries. For example, Amazon has an impressive RPR due to their expansive product offerings and low prices. A local hardware store may have a lower RPR because their product offerings are more&nbsp;limited.</p><p>In general, a high RPR indicates that your customers are happy with your products and services, and are therefore likely to make repeat purchases from you. A low RPR may indicate that your customers have had negative experiences with your brand, or that they were not able to find what they were looking for in earlier purchases. This could be due to many factors including poor product quality, unfavorable pricing, or poor shopping experience on your&nbsp;site.</p> 6. Purchase frequency (PF) <p>In order to measure and increase brand loyalty, companies can use <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/purchase-frequency/">purchase frequency</a> (PF). Brand loyalty is a consumer’s inclination to remain committed to one product in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>Product loyalty is most often measured by customer purchases of the same brand(s) over an extended period of time. Loyal customers are far more likely to repurchase, more likely to purchase more products, and less likely to switch&nbsp;brands.</p><p>To understand why consumers become loyal, researchers have studied consumer loyalty from all angles: demographic, psychological, and behavioral, among others. Demographic factors include age and income level. Psychological factors include product beliefs and attitudes toward the brand. Behavioral factors include frequency of purchase and product involvement.</p> How to Build Brand Loyalty in 4 Easy&nbsp;Steps <p>Building brand loyalty is a process of identifying, anticipating, and meeting the needs of customers. It is important to know when and how to best reach potential new customers.</p><p>Here are some tips on how to build brand&nbsp;loyalty:</p> 1. Create an exceptional customer experience <p>All companies should strive to create an exceptional customer experience that makes customers feel as though they are getting more value than what they paid for. When a company creates an exceptional experience, customers feel like they have been treated extraordinarily well, which causes them to return and buy&nbsp;again.</p> 2. Reward customers for their&nbsp;loyalty <p>Companies should reward customers for their loyalty in order to encourage repeat purchases and increase sales revenue. If a company does not reward loyal customers, then the loyal customers may stop returning because there is no incentive for them to keep coming&nbsp;back.</p><p>PS: if you’re looking for ways to get customers to buy from you more often, don’t miss our article about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/incentive-marketing/">incentive marketing</a>.</p> 3. Encourage referrals and word-of-mouth <p>Advertising through social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter where customers can share with friends about how great their experience was with your&nbsp;company.</p> 4. Offer discounts on future purchases <p>If they refer someone new who makes a purchase within 24 hours of being referred by one of these loyal customers who already has an account with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Creating brand loyalty begins with the customer. The customer needs to feel a sense of trust and engagement toward your company, which requires that you build a relationship with them. Building this relationship includes knowing what your customers want, being able to get it to them at the right time, and offering them incentives for doing business with or continuing business with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Keep in mind that when attempting to build brand loyalty, as well as other types of marketing strategies, you should always consider the long-term effects. You want to make sure that you are having a positive impact on your customers’ lives and that they will continue to do business with you over the&nbsp;years.</p> Give Your Brand Loyalty a&nbsp;Boost <p>How do you make sure your customers aren’t just content with your product, but in love with your&nbsp;brand?</p><p>Create an emotional connection between them and your products and vice versa. Learn more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/psychology-of-loyalty/">the psychology of loyalty</a> and make use of these important insights.</p><p>It’s all about getting to the root of what makes someone feel connected to a company. Find out what makes them tick, why they buy the things they buy, and how to make their experience feel like more than just a transaction, but an experience.</p><p>And don’t forget about surprise and delight tactics. Even if you have a lot of repeat customers and people who are completely loyal to you, keep them on their toes. Make sure there are always new reasons to come back for more from your&nbsp;brand.</p> Conclusion <p>Brand loyalty is one of the most important metrics in marketing, and yet it is poorly studied. Most brand loyalty studies focus on repeat purchases. Socially conscious consumers are more likely to purchase from brands that align with their values. Brand alignment is a commonality between the social consumer and the brand that creates additional loyalty beyond repeated purchases.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/brand-loyalty-measurement/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Commitment is a bold word, and we can all agree on that. And while in some situations, it’s a positive word bringing a lot of vibes-for example, a marriage, in another context, it might have a negative connotation-if you’re into debt, paying it is a commitment. It isn’t necessarily beneficial for&nbsp;you.</p><p>But we will discuss one other type of commitment in this article-customer commitment. In this article, we will see what customer commitment is, review its importance, mention the types, and give you some tips and tricks on how to improve&nbsp;it.</p> What is Customer Commitment? <p>You can find one of the best descriptions of customer commitment in the book <a href="https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/explaining-customer-loyalty-to-retail-stores/238383">Explaining Customer Loyalty to Retail Stores: A Moderated Explanation Chain of the Process</a>. According to Arturo Vasquez-Parraga and Miguel&nbsp;Sahagun,</p><blockquote>Customer’s engagement or continuous obligation to buy the same product or use the same&nbsp;company.</blockquote><p>In simpler terms, companies are making their services so influential for customers that the latter willingly (or not) keep coming&nbsp;back.</p> Why is It Important? <p>It’s essential to give your customers a reason to come back after you have converted them for the first time (see more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/types-of-online-shoppers/">types of online shoppers and how to convert them here</a>). Offering your customers discounts, loyalty programs, and social share programs are all ways to build lifetime value with them. Innovative e-commerce features such as an app store, in-app payments, rewards, and one-click purchasing keep your clients returning again and again. People want to feel like a part of something bigger than themselves.</p><p>Going the extra mile will be rewarding for your business and your customers. Let’s see&nbsp;why.</p> 1. Better relationships with your customers <p>If you invest in the relationship between you and your clients, you will make them more satisfied with your products. Customers value the personal approach and will always highly regard companies that use it in their marketing strategy.</p> 2. More sales over the long&nbsp;term <p>Every company that invests in its customers will get more committed visitors. Instead of looking for products, they will try to find ways to add more items to their cart, even if they don’t have much money left in their banks, because they like you and your business!</p> 3. Growth potential <p>Customer commitment makes company growth possible. Repeat purchasers can help you invest more in adding extra personnel and investing in new customers, as you will have the available funds.</p> 4. Reduced marketing cost <p>Running an e-commerce store is a challenging endeavor, as advertising on Google, Facebook, and all the other platforms out there is not cheap anymore. However, if you have enough committed customers to your brand, you will drive revenue without spending excessive money and reducing your profit. According to Forbes, converting leads into customers is 5 times more <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/09/12/dont-spend-5-times-more-attracting-new-customers-nurture-the-existing-ones/?sh=39d455325a8e">expensive</a> than investing in your current&nbsp;clients.</p> What are the Types of Customer Commitment? <p>Okay, we already told you about customers’ commitment and why it’s crucial to have more customers coming back to you. But what are the three main types, and how is each one different from the other ones? Let’s find&nbsp;out.</p> 1. Affective Commitment <p>Affective commitment is the emotional attachment to a brand. If a customer’s emotions are wrapped up in a brand, they’ll become more likely to keep coming back. This means that businesses should be sure to create genuine connections with their audience and make consumers feel like they’re part of the&nbsp;family.</p><p>But to generate affective commitment, it’s not enough to achieve high customer satisfaction. There should be more offered on the table, something exclusive. Affective commitment is like creating a “cult” toward a brand and its&nbsp;product.</p><p>Affective commitment is what each company should be fighting for, and it creates brand advocates who are a great asset for future&nbsp;success.</p> Affective Commitment Examples <p>Apple</p><p>Apple is a common example of a brand that drives customer loyalty because of a “cult” around its name. There are plenty of people who choose the company and buy the latest products. Whenever a new iPhone is released, there are massive queues for people who desire to have the latest model, no matter the cost. Typically, Apple’s products are more expensive than the competition, yet they drive more interest than their&nbsp;rivals.</p><p>A lot of customers’ devotion to Apple is explained by the <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/psychology-of-loyalty/">psychology of loyalty</a>, which we have talked about on a previous&nbsp;article.</p><p>Ferrari</p><p>It’s a dream come true for customers who can afford to drive the “Red Horse” badge. And while the cheapest model from their product range (Ferrari Roma) starts with a base price of over $200,000, successful people would love to join the list of people who have access to this masterpiece. Sadly, you can’t go full-throttle in town, but still — it’s better to wait in traffic with a “Red Horse”, rather than in a Fiat,&nbsp;right?</p><p>Nike</p><p>Nike is one of the brands with the most brand advocates among sports fans. Being promoted by some of the most notable sports names — like Cristiano Ronaldo, Michael Jordan, and Rafael Nadal- attracts clients who wear a jersey of their favorite sports clubs and buy the iconic Air Jordans or Air Max&nbsp;series.</p> 2. Continuance Commitment <p>Continuance commitment occurs when customers are not that highly impressed by the company. They choose to stay because they give it more value than other choices, and they pick it for logical&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>Although continuance commitment is an important factor of loyalty, it doesn’t bring the “buzz” effect. There is a thin line between affective commitment and continuance commitment.</p><p>Affective commitment focuses on customers choosing a service provider because they feel attached to the brand, while continuance commitment happens when customers choose because it is reasonable.</p> Continuance Commitment Examples <p>Microsoft</p><p>Microsoft is a typical example of a company that customers find reliable and trustworthy. Nobody is proud of using Microsoft Office or Windows. However, most users engage with the company because they know what to expect: consistency, predictability, and good value for&nbsp;money.</p><p>Walmart</p><p>While Walmart doesn’t attract such devoted fans as Apple or Tesla, it has become a synonym of great deals. While some people love the company, most customers shop there because they can find various brands and purchase goods at outstanding prices. The company slogan “Save Money. Live better.” perfectly fits the customer&nbsp;base.</p><p>IKEA</p><p>Just like Walmart, people know what to expect when they buy from IKEA. Reasonable prices and a variety of products. But that’s not all. IKEA has built a name for Swedish quality and minimalistic design, often attracting customers. While luxurious furniture fans cannot usually be seen there, IKEA is a go-to place for millions of customers worldwide.</p> 3. Normative Commitment <p>Instead of customers remaining committed to a brand because they enjoy doing business with it, the term normative commitment refers to when a customer remains committed to a brand because they feel they have to keep using the service, despite their&nbsp;will.</p><p>However, normative commitments are the worst of the three types, as customers who experience them are not happy. While we still have customer retention, this is the last stage before customers abandon your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Normative commitment is also found in the relationship between employers and employees where the latter want to leave but have no better options at the&nbsp;moment.</p> Normative Commitment Examples <p>Adobe</p><p>Adobe is known for its excessive charges. You cannot buy any of Adobe’s products. Instead, you should subscribe to a single software or get access to all of them. $52.99 per month on an annual basis is what you should pay for one license. It’s definitely a steep price no one wants to pay, but since it’s an industry-standard software, you can’t really settle with a cheaper alternative, as they are not good&nbsp;enough.</p><p>SAP</p><p>If you ask employees, 90% of them probably do not like working with SAP. It’s a monolith platform, has a very outdated UI, costs a fortune, and is very heavy. But why do most Fortune 500 keep using it? Because it is proven to work with large batches of data, and it’s one of the legacy companies of its kind, so migrating to a competitor might be a disaster for clients; thus, they stay despite the shortcomings.</p><p>T-Mobile</p><p>Mobile service providers are often topping charts of unpleased customers simply because there isn’t much competition. T-Mobile is a leading provider, yet it receives very poor feedback for lack of mobile signal, unstable 5G connection, and poor customer service. However, customers keep using it, as loyal customers can still get better plans. Otherwise, if they change their carrier, they risk losing the perks that were stacked over the&nbsp;years.</p> How to Increase Customer Commitment <p>There are many ways to increase customer commitment, and fortunately, it isn’t hard to achieve better results. Let’s see some of&nbsp;them:</p> 1. Offer discounts <p>One of the most popular ways to create a more committed customer base is to offer occasional discounts. Of course, it’s not a good practice to have discounts 24/7 available on all products. But coming up with different offers makes people maintain their interest in your e-commerce platform and check out the website/app more frequently.</p> 2. Reward frequent purchases <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">Loyalty programs</a> are a superb way to reward repeat purchasers. It is an opportunity for you to connect with your customers personally and build your relationship with them. A rewards program gives your customers a unique feeling of gratitude, regardless of the order value or the amounts of orders they&nbsp;make.</p> 3. Set up subscription services <p>Many subscription-based programs offer incentives to customers that other e-commerce sites don’t. For example, a customer can pay $50 per year and in return receive free shipping and a 10% flat discount on all orders. It is a strong reason for customers to keep coming&nbsp;back.</p> 4. Ask for feedback and reply to&nbsp;it <p>Users can feel more involved with your brand if you offer the option to write a review for your product or service. This way, you show them that their opinions matter to your business. But do not forget to respond. It may take no more than 1–2 minutes to come up with a reply, but the effect can be huge. You can thank them for each positive review and provide an apology and explanation for negative&nbsp;reviews.</p> 5. Offer a “Thank you”&nbsp;email <p>A “Thank You” email isn’t much effort to create, and it has become a common practice among companies. All you need to have is email automation software and some original ideas. Your effort ends with no more than a couple of hours of work until you write a good&nbsp;one.</p> 6. Personalize your&nbsp;message <p>Countless advertisements can work against your brand, especially when you oversaturate the market with web banners and newsletter pop-ups. However, by adding personal touches to every campaign and interacting directly with an audience, you can stand out from the competition by giving something that clients&nbsp;want.</p> 7. Focus on delivering a great customer service experience <p>To improve your store’s performance, you need to make yourself available to your customers. Adding customer care agents will significantly improve your performance. Try to add as many channels as possible: email, live chat, phone. Having quick-to-react customer service might make the difference between affective commitment and customers quitting your&nbsp;brand.</p> Conclusion <p>Customer commitment is vital for your business, and it can help your brand generate more money by capitalizing on existing customers and converting leads into new clients. But if you fail to offer something any short of the best, your clients can quickly abandon your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Did you like this article?

 Loyalty Programs Best Practices: 12 Ways to Improve&nbsp;Loyalty <p>3.8 billion — that’s the number of memberships US <a href="https://www.claruscommerce.com/blog/17-staggering-customer-loyalty-stats-that-will-change-your-perspective/">customers</a> hold in loyalty programs. There’s no question that loyalty programs are popular with consumers.</p><p>That loyalty programs are a staple of consumer marketing is therefore no surprise. These programs can be a powerful tool for businesses looking to keep their customers happy (learn more about the <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/psychology-of-loyalty/">psychology of loyalty&nbsp;here</a>).</p><p>Let’s explore the basics of loyalty programs and learn loyalty programs best practices that will keep your customers coming back for&nbsp;more.</p> What’s a Loyalty&nbsp;Program? <p>A loyalty program is a marketing strategy used by companies to reward customers for their continued patronage. Programs can be as simple as a punch card that gets the customer a free item after a certain number of visits, or as complex as a points-based system that allows customers to redeem rewards for products or services.</p><p>Loyalty programs are popular because they offer customers an incentive (read more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/incentive-marketing/">incentive marketing here</a>) to keep coming back to brands and businesses of their choice. They also help businesses build customer loyalty, which ultimately manifests itself in increased sales and&nbsp;profits.</p> 12 Loyalty Program Best Practices <p>There are a number of factors that go into creating an effective loyalty program. Here are some best practices that businesses like you can&nbsp;follow:</p> 1. Make it easy to join and&nbsp;use <p>Your loyalty program strategy should make it easy for your customers to join the program and use it. Customers should be able to sign up and start earning rewards points quickly. The program should also be easy to navigate, with a clear rewards chart and easy-to-use redemption process.</p><p>This best practices suggestion encourages your customers to quickly join and engage in a loyalty program. Make it easy to participate as well, allowing transactions from any point of sale system and a hassle-free billing&nbsp;cycle.</p> 2. Evolve and&nbsp;upgrade <p>Loyalty rewards programs should constantly evolve in order to keep up with the latest consumer trends. For example, if you notice that many of your customers are using their loyalty program to collect points for free products, then consider adding a new tier of rewards that allows them to redeem their points for a discount on a future purchase, or freely exchange points for another set of products.</p><p>You could also change the way you reward your long-term customers. If you use a points system for every purchase, why not explore rewarding social media subscriptions, likes and&nbsp;shares?</p><p>This best practices standard rule will help your brand stay in touch with current trends and the changing expectations of your consumers.</p> 3. Explore company partnerships <p>One best practice rule that many businesses are hesitant to try is to open up their loyalty programs to company partnerships. You may worry that doing so will reduce the effectiveness of your program, or that customers will be confused about how the program&nbsp;works.</p><p>However, research shows that a coalition loyalty program strategy can lead to an increase in engagement from customers. This is because customers appreciate being able to earn points from more than one source. Additionally, partnering with other businesses can help introduce your customers to new products and services.</p><p>Consumers appreciate the flexibility a partnership-based loyalty program offers. Making points and rewards transferable attracts more customers and gives you a better understanding of what your target market is&nbsp;buying.</p> 4. Personalize <p>Personalize your loyalty program to stand out from the crowd. This can be as simple as sending customers special offers or birthday messages, or it can be more complex, such as tailoring the program to each customer’s preferences. Your rewards program could be used to suit their shopping&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Personalization is a best practices rule that shows customers that you appreciate their faith in you. It also keeps customers engaged with your brand, and encourages them to continue participating in your loyalty&nbsp;program.</p><p>Some companies structure their loyalty programs into modules, so customers themselves customize the offerings of the rewards program to suit their preferences. It is a customer-driven personalization and could take form in several ways, such as levels of membership, and the option of selecting and using the program through multiple channels, such as mobile apps, online e-commerce sites, and physical&nbsp;stores.</p> 5. Track and reward loyal customers <p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM software) is a great way to keep track of and reward your loyal customers. CRM makes it easy to identify and track your most loyal customers using customer data through their transaction history and behavior. It also allows you to automate the process of rewarding customers for their&nbsp;loyalty.</p><p>When a customer is loyal, your CRM could immediately track their purchases and transactions and quickly reward them. Your customers don’t have to go to customer service or call anyone to receive their rewards; your management groups your loyal customers and identifies them for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Using this is not only a best practices rule for your business strategies but also for your brand as a whole. It will make your customers feel appreciated, and such customers are more likely to return and/or recommend your business to&nbsp;others.</p> 6. Offer Excellent Rewards <p>A loyalty program should offer excellent rewards that appeal and interest your current and existing customers. There are a number of different types of rewards that you can offer as part of a loyalty program. Some of the most popular include loyalty points, free and discounted products or services.</p><p>But don’t forget to experiment with different rewards to find out what works best for your loyalty program&nbsp;members.</p><p>So, what makes a good reward? Rewards should be relevant to the customer. If they’re not interested in the reward, they’re not going to redeem it. Review customer demands and searches, and see what you could offer to meet them. The rewards should not be expensive, but they should be valuable and be something that the customer would&nbsp;want.</p> 7. Create Emotional Connection <p>Customers tend to remain loyal to a brand because of an emotional connection to a company or brand. This connection could stem from familiarity or tradition. Smart brands often use this connection as part of their loyalty marketing strategy.</p><p>Customers often prefer brands that show the brand cares for their consumers, the environment and have a deeper understanding of their target audience. If your customers consider you to be empathetic and sharing the same values as them, you’d become an integral part of their purchase decisions.</p> 8. Optimize Your Loyalty&nbsp;Programs <p>Optimizing a customer loyalty program to make it accessible to digital users makes it all the more utilitarian, especially at this time when most people are online using social media and e-commerce sites. Making a loyalty program accessible across several channels increases the chances of a customer buying a product or brand. A seamless omnichannel experience would help you score brownie points with your customer.</p><p>Digital optimization makes it easier for your back office systems to track customer engagement and interaction, making the calculation of CLI, CLV and customer engagement scores easier. You could improve your customer service and listen to incoming customer requests through digital&nbsp;media.</p> 9. Offer Rewards and Incentives Beyond Transactions <p>Most brands focus on rewards when customers do actual purchase transactions, but good customer loyalty programs reward customers for any engagement. Explore what your loyal customer base does on social media and give them additional rewards for reviews, likes, shares or even subscriptions to social media&nbsp;handles.</p><p>Also, if you give program benefits to existing customers when they complete surveys and download your apps, then it would encourage customers to participate in your rewards&nbsp;program.</p> 10. Have a comprehensible reward and incentive structure <p>The incentive and rewards system of your loyalty program should be simple for the customer to understand. They should know what rewards they could receive from&nbsp;you.</p><p>If your customer knows what they will earn and when they will receive the reward, they are more likely to repeat a purchas. A frequent flyer point may seem attractive enough, but sometimes when a customer reaches the frequent flyer miles they’ve been targeting, the airline just blocks them with the unavailability of flights or&nbsp;seats.</p><p>For some companies, the customers affected simply did not understand the requirements of the reward. But for customers it is another example of a useless reward program and will not likely renew their membership.</p> 11. Stay in touch with&nbsp;members <p>Your most valued customers value your proactiveness more, since they are the ones who continue to buy your products for a longer time. They are the ones who need regular updates on discounts, sales and offers, and are more likely to respond and avail of these special&nbsp;offers.</p><p>Additionally, communicating with them gives this exchange an air of exclusivity, and makes the membership to the loyalty program something coveted.</p> 12. Be profitable <p>The goal of a loyalty program is not only to incentivize repeat and most profitable customers, but also to increase your profit. Repeat customers are valuable because they do not require new marketing techniques to improve awareness and engagement. You do not need a new campaign to attract repeat customers, but enhance the existing customer-brand relationships to keep your brand loyalists satisfied.</p><p>Track customer spending and product margins when designing your loyalty programs. Ensure that the loyalty program is profitable for the company but also satisfying for the customer.</p><p>Also, don’t forget to <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/brand-loyalty-measurement/">measure your brand loyalty</a> and keep those metrics in check! This might help you to better direct your efforts in marketing and&nbsp;sales.</p> How Can You Measure Customer&nbsp;Loyalty? <p>There are a variety of ways to measure customer loyalty. One way is to survey individual customers and ask them how likely they are to recommend your company to others, and to rate factors such as quality of products/services, price, customer service,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Another way is to analyze customer retention rates and see how many customers are returning or have returned to your business. You can also look at the amount of money customers are spending currently, and compare that to how much they’ve spent in the past. All of these require measurable customer data, and the following are the most common metrics used to measure customer&nbsp;loyalty.</p> 1. Net Promoter&nbsp;Score <p>The net promoter score (NPS) is a way to measure customer experience. You could calculate it using this question: how likely are you to recommend the product to a friend or colleague?</p><p>The NPS uses a scale from 0 to 10 and rates answers into three groups: promoters (9–10), passives (7–8), and detractors (0–6).</p><p>The percentage of detractors subtracted from the percentage of promoters produces your NPS. The higher the NPS, the more your customers are likely to buy and recommend your&nbsp;brand.</p> 2. Repurchase Ratio <p>The number of customers who come back to buy your brand divided by the number of one-time buyers is called the repurchase ratio. Most of a company’s revenue comes from repeat or returning purchasers, though they may be fewer than the total number of their customers.</p><p>The repurchase ratio also depends on the business model. Subscription-based retail models calculate the repurchase ratio by dividing the number of people who continue the subscription by the number of people who cancel after the first contract.</p><p>For retail businesses using a transaction-based model, the number of repeat customers must be calculated first. You can do this by finding the average time between the first and second buys of a repeat customer. The repurchase ratio can then be calculated by dividing the number of repeat customers by the number of non-repeat buyers.</p> 3. Upsell&nbsp;Ratio <p>The upsell ratio is the number of customers who have bought more than one type of product from you compared to the customers who buy only one. The upsell ratio only tracks customers who buy new products, and does not include repeat customers who buy the same&nbsp;thing.</p> 4. Customer Lifetime&nbsp;Value <p>The customer lifetime value (CLV) is the dollar value of a customer’s total purchases over the entire course of their relationship with a company. This metric is used to measure the profitability of a customer, and to help businesses like you determine how much they should spend to acquire new customers.</p><p>There are a few ways to calculate the CLV. The most simple way is to multiply the average purchase amount by the number of purchases made. You can also take into account customer retention rates and calculate how much each customer is worth over time. This gives you a more accurate picture of the value of a customer.</p> 5. Customer Loyalty&nbsp;Index <p>The customer loyalty index (CLI) is a tool that tracks customer loyalty. It uses a set of questions addressing three vital&nbsp;points:</p>  How likely are you to try the brand’s new products?  How likely are you to recommend the brand to your friends and&nbsp;family?  How likely are you to buy from the brand again in the&nbsp;future?  <p>The average for these responses is the CLI of a customer, which they rate from 1 to 6, with 1 for “Definitely Yes” and 6 for “Definitely No”. The customer data and customer insights taken from these surveys help in measuring CLI.</p> 6. Customer Engagement Score <p>Another way to measure customer loyalty is to use the customer engagement score. This is based on individual customers’ activity with your business. You can group your customers using demographics, transactions, and customer behavior. Using these customer segments could help you identify which customers are likely to become repeat purchasers and predict which ones will repurchase or try other new products.</p><p>The customer engagement score is calculated by measuring frequency of use ( <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/purchase-frequency/">click here</a> to learn more about purchase frequency), level of use, actions by customer, time spent on activities, and other performance indicators and metrics that represent engagement success.</p> Give Your Loyal Customers What They&nbsp;Deserve <p>A loyalty program marketing strategy is a great way to reward your best customers for their continued business and retain them for a long time. However, simply having a loyalty program is not&nbsp;enough.</p><p>Loyalty is more than a transaction to your customers; it is a shared value they share with you. Your loyalty program should reflect that&nbsp;too.</p><p>PS: if you’d like to know about your potential customers and how to convert them in the first place, we highly recommend you to read our article about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/types-of-online-shoppers/">types of online shoppers</a>.

<p>Based on recent statistics, 41% of US consumers make an online <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/448659/online-shopping-frequency-usa/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20survey%20published,shopping%20once%20every%20two%20weeks.">purchase</a> once or twice per week. 24% buy something every other week. Your task as a business is to ensure you are among those they buy from and do it&nbsp;often.</p><p>Purchase frequency is one of the core metrics every business should track. It directly affects your profitability and revenue since you are 6X times more likely to <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/">sell</a> to existing customers than new ones. High or average purchase frequency means customer loyalty, while low rates show that people rarely return after the first purchase.</p><p>Find out how to calculate and increase your purchase frequency below. Our tips will help you boost your customer retention metrics.</p> What is Purchase Frequency? <p>The purchase frequency (also PF) is the number of times an average customer places an order within a time period. By measuring PF during the limited time frame you get more accurate results and can compare customer behavior&nbsp;changes.</p><p>The higher the purchase frequency, the more likely your is brand to turn repeat customers into loyal ones. For example, people buy low-cost consumables more often than luxury cars or accessories with a significantly higher average order value. The purchase frequency for these product categories cannot be compared. Hence, you should track average customer purchases within your company or use industry benchmarks for estimates.</p> Why is Purchase Frequency Important? <p>Purchase frequency over a given period is one of the critical indicators for any eCommerce store. But why is it so important? Here are the main reasons for calculating purchase frequency:</p>  Calculating purchase frequency rates allows you to track customer retention. When a customer buys from you repeatedly, you work in the right direction. Without the purchase frequency KPI, you won’t be able to measure&nbsp;this.  It boosts the customer lifetime value. When you increase purchase frequency, the customer lifetime value also grows since an average buyer generates more revenue and stays for a longer time&nbsp;frame.  Repeat purchases are cheaper than customer acquisition. The cost of activating existing customers is much lower than attracting unique customers, which may considerably cut your expenses. <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/customer-loyalty-statistics/#gref">82% of companies agree that customer retention</a> is cheaper than acquisition.  Loyal customers with a large average number of orders are more likely to recommend your brand. People that have completed multiple purchases favor your brand and are ready to invite a friend or join a loyalty&nbsp;program.  Purchase frequency provides reliable data for marketing campaigns. If you are unsure whether your marketing is fruitful, purchase frequency rates help evaluate&nbsp;this.  <p>As you can see, you get more loyal customers, boost sales, and grow revenue when you increase purchase frequency. It’s a must-watch metric for any retailer.</p> How do You Calculate Purchase Frequency? <p>Now, we reach the logical question: How to calculate purchase frequency? All data you need for calculations is in your transactional data. The purchase frequency formula is also pretty easy to&nbsp;use.</p><p>You will need to follow these&nbsp;steps:</p>  Learn the number of orders customers placed with your company during the selected time frame (usually 12&nbsp;months).  Learn the number of unique customers your business served during the same time&nbsp;frame.  Use the gathered information in the purchase frequency formula for calculation.  <p>Purchase Frequency = Number of Orders / Number of Unique Customers</p> Example <p>Suppose you run a business that sells clothes and want to check the purchase frequency. Based on the previously collected statistics, you know that your company had 2500 unique customers and 3300 orders for the same&nbsp;period.</p><p>Then, the purchase frequency is 3300/2500 =&nbsp;1.32.</p> Difference Between Purchase Frequency (PF) and Repeat Purchase Rates&nbsp;(RPR) <p>Many people use the terms purchase frequency and repeat purchase rate interchangeably. Yet these metrics have some significant differences, so it’s necessary to differentiate them for the clarity of this&nbsp;article.</p><p>The purchase frequency rate shows how often an average customer buys something from a single merchant within the specified time frame. On the other hand, the repeat purchase rate is a share of customers who have purchased at least a second time. To calculate repeat purchase rate, you need to divide the number of customers who’ve purchased more than once by the total number of customers.</p><p>While purchase frequency allows you to understand how often consumers buy something, the repeat purchase rate focuses on the share of repeat customers. Both these metrics are helpful to evaluate customer retention and&nbsp;loyalty.</p> 8 Ways to Increase Purchase Frequency <p>If you want to have a flourishing business, you should engage new customers and continuously nurture existing ones. Repeat customers generate more revenue than occasional purchasers. Hence, you must put more focus on them if you expect to grow&nbsp;sales.</p><p>This section includes several most effective ways to increase your purchase frequency by building better customer relationships and more relevant&nbsp;offers.</p> 1. Know your customer before planning marketing campaigns <p>Before you take steps to promote or sell something, you need to know who you target. This information will allow you to choose the best ways to encourage customers to repeat purchases. You will also be able to focus on people who are more likely to convert than&nbsp;others.</p><p>Advanced software is an optimum way to collect details about your target audience (including demographics, purchase history, average order value, preferences, favorite communication channels, etc.). Modern CRM systems integrated with email marketing tools, social media, data analytics, and other solutions automatically record priceless information about customers. They process this raw data to generate insights about what people want and whether they are ready to&nbsp;pay.</p><p>Once you have these details, it’s possible to segment your customers based on their characteristics. This way, you will tailor your marketing and increase frequent purchases.</p> 2. Launch personalized email marketing campaigns <p>Email marketing is the cornerstone of a marketing strategy focused on increasing the number of customers who make repeat purchases. Emails are the most convenient and standard way to communicate with customers about their purchases, special offers, or sales. These communications remind people about your brand to encourage customers to buy something again.</p><p>Yet to boost the efficiency of email marketing campaigns, you’d better make them personalized. Using the person’s name in an email subject line can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/email-personalization-techniques-tools-stats-2021-guide-josh-turner/">increase open rates by 26%</a>. When more customers open your message, customer activity grows, increasing purchase frequency.</p><p>Besides the person’s name, you can customize the content and style of emails based on the recipient’s characteristics, previous responses, purchases, and other details. For example, you can send a custom selection of similar products based on the purchase&nbsp;history.</p> 3. Make limited-time special&nbsp;offers <p>Limited-time offers are steroids for any marketing campaign that considerably affect customers’ behavior. When the person hears that the chance to get something at a lower price will disappear after the set time frame, they rush to take action. As a result, the customer buys a product or service they haven’t planned to purchase before as the offer seems too good to miss it. Such customer behavior increases the purchase frequency and&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>Yet you should be careful and avoid overusing limited-time offers. Consumers will get used to such a customer experience and stop buying without discount codes or sales. It may be counterproductive for the overall purchase&nbsp;rate.</p> 4. Communicate with existing customers through multiple&nbsp;channels <p><a href="https://www.mackenziecorp.com/23-omnichannel-stats/">Over 50% of modern brands use at least 8 channels</a> to interact with customers. You should be ready to serve consumers through emails, social media, messengers, phone calls, online chats, etc. The ability to stay in touch through top popular communication channels directly affects the quality of customer service and satisfaction rates.</p><p>Imagine users find your new product and are ready to place an order, but you don’t reply to their emails for several days. Guess what? The chances they will leave to a competitor are very&nbsp;high.</p><p>You should avoid such issues and provide continuous support via the main communication channels. To make things clear from the start, indicate what channels consumers should use for help on your&nbsp;website.</p> 5. Implement a loyalty&nbsp;program <p>The best customers are loyal customers. They already love your brand, trust you, and make frequent purchases even without you asking them about this. <a href="https://inmoment.wpengine.com/blog/earning-and-destroying-customer-loyalty-retail-cx-trends-you-need-to-know/">60% of loyal customers</a> say they are ready to purchase from their favorite companies more&nbsp;often.</p><p>That’s why you should think about having a customer loyalty program. Offer buyers points for every purchase, give them discounts or make special offers, or find any other incentive that can inspire people to join your loyalty&nbsp;program.</p><p>Not sure how to implement loyalty programs? <a href="https://www.monetha.io/business/">Join Monetha</a> to get a ready solution for eCommerce loyalty campaigns.</p> 6. Use software to automate manual sales and support&nbsp;tasks <p>Apart from nudging your customers to convert, you must be ready for increased purchase frequency on your side. As the purchase frequency rate grows, the volume of orders you need to process also skyrockets. It may turn out that your sales and support teams are not ready to meet the&nbsp;demand.</p><p>Therefore, to increase the productivity of your sales and support teams, you need automation software. Modern tools can automatically respond to standard emails, implement online website chats, track order fulfillment, update order statuses, and complete many other actions you would otherwise do manually.</p><p>It reduces the load on sales and support departments allowing them to enhance customer service and focus on strategic tasks.</p> 7. Introduce gamification elements <p>When a customer purchases a product, it should be a fun and pleasant experience. Therefore, gamification elements in your sales strategy are a great way to stir buyers’ interest and increase purchase frequency.</p><p>Gamification is the most relevant in loyalty campaigns where users can win points, move from one level to another, or even compete with peers. When people get engaged and want to reach the highest level, they willingly do what you ask them to do. For example, when a buyer needs ten orders to move from the starter level and enjoy additional benefits, they are more likely to place ten orders than without incentives.</p> 8. Fight cart abandonment <p>Abandoned carts are among the most upsetting types of customer behavior for businesses. People browse your website, select products, add them to the cart, and leave at the last moment without paying. Given that the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopping-cart-abandonment">average customer abandonment rate is 69.57%</a>, the impact on the purchase rates and overall revenue is enormous.</p><p>Even though you won’t be able to make all customers complete the order, you can take steps to remarket them. Try sending them a reminder email, offer a discount on the products added to the cart, etc. Remarketing can convince a part of abandoners to come back and restore the purchase frequency.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/purchase-frequency/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Have you wondered why you keep buying lattes from your local cafeteria, even though Starbucks charges you $1.50 less than that? Is it because of the smile you receive from the merchants every time you order or the reward proposition of 1 free coffee every ten orders? Or because of the&nbsp;habit?</p><p>In this article, we will review one of the critical components for every successful company-regardless of size, location, and staff number-loyal customers.</p> What is a Loyalty&nbsp;Program? <p>A loyalty program, also known as a reward program, is an initiative by a brand to offer its customers special incentives based on their past purchases. These objectives can vary from brand to brand; one company might want to tempt people with discounts or by <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/how-does-cash-back-work/">giving customers cash back</a>, while another might reward people for completing repeat&nbsp;orders.</p><p>Regardless of the goal, all loyalty programs seek to keep customers interested in the brand by building and strengthening <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/brand-loyalty-measurement/">brand loyalty</a> — and keeping them close. An interesting stat from <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/customer-loyalty-statistics/#gref">SmallBizGenius</a> indicates that 72% of adult US citizens are part of at least one loyalty&nbsp;program.</p> Why Are Loyalty Programs Important? <p>Customer loyalty has become a cornerstone topic for businesses, and brands are constantly coming up with new rewards programs to attract more clients. But for both parties-brands and consumers, loyalty points are more than just numbers. And it means so much more! Let’s see some of the crucial benefits of incorporating points programs.</p> 1. Improve the relationship between brands and&nbsp;clients <p>To emotionally engage customers and encourage them to come back, brands must provide more than just the possibility of a free bottle or free glasses-they must create an experience. Giving customers a chance to meet with other dedicated fans of a personality or brand, for example, can inspire a feeling of community and belong among new shoppers.</p> 2. Attract new customers <p>A happy customer is a repeat customer. According to a study conducted by Nielsen, <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2015/digital-formats-are-among-the-most-trusted-advertising-sources-despite-slow-growth/">83% of new customers</a> will trust a personal recommendation from friends and family members. That’s a lot more than any other type of marketing. So, the importance of your loyal customers can not only bring you increased value from them-your efforts can actually bring you business from new customers!</p> 3. Repeat customers have better&nbsp;ROI <p>A loyalty strategy in place is well worth it. If you put more effort into keeping your current clients happy, you will have up to a 300% revenue increase. That’s right-300%. According to RJMetrics, you can get three times the business volume. Of course, you need to get real; these numbers are optimistic.</p> 4. Reduced marketing costs <p>As the digital economy grows and evolves, brands need to adapt their strategies accordingly lest they be left in the&nbsp;dust.</p><p>But why splash tons of money acquiring new customers (considering that marketing does not guarantee you a sale) when you can spend five times less to reward customers and keep them loyal to your business? That’s right, a new customer “costs” about 5X more than a current&nbsp;one.</p> 5. Loyal customers are easier to upsell and cross-sell <p>Loyalty programs aren’t just a tool to increase customer retention; they also boost your business profit. Because upselling and cross-selling use AI to predict customer behavior, you can offer your clients better-suited offers that reward them for the bigger purchase.</p><p>Since your loyal consumers are aware of your brand, they can take advantage of a good deal and be happy. You will be astounded by the way how most people embrace&nbsp;deals!</p> 6. Free marketing <p>Instead of spending 1000’s of dollars trying to figure out the market and swearing Facebook and Google about their ever-changing algorithms, you can sit comfortably and watch how word of mouth marketing can benefit your business passively.</p> 7. Access to precious customer&nbsp;data <p>Brands can implement a loyalty program that collects critical data and leverages customer behavior with machine learning to improve the customer journey across the&nbsp;board.</p><p>Clients are more willing to share data with businesses they know which can be your key to success. You can personalize their experience, building an even more solid emotional foundation.</p> The Psychology Behind Loyalty&nbsp;Programs <p>Loyalty programs and all the tools that calculate progress and track results are based on real-world research made by leading psychologists. There are several pivotal principles when it comes to the psychology of&nbsp;loyalty.</p> First impression matters more than anything&nbsp;else <p>The first impression of your ecommerce store proceeds even the first purchase by your customer.</p><p>According to research, 94% of first impressions are design-related, so you should invest in looks just as much as giving your clients different freebies and discounts.</p><p>A good loyalty program lies on the foundation of an attractive proposal that is “dressed” well. The color theory plays a huge role-branded colors can give an additional boost to any loyalty&nbsp;program.</p> Positive reinforcement for forming a&nbsp;habit <p>Positive reinforcement is a reward that gives a positive outcome after completing an action. Giving your customers a positive stimulus makes them more likely to respond to it. The greatest loyalty programs are fueled by positive reinforcement. Rewarding users for their loyalty and interaction with your brand encourages them to keep participating in that behavior.</p><p>While using this technique can make driving permanent, consistent behavior patterns easier, it’s essential to be thoughtful about approaching your rewards system. But if you do, purchasing from your store might become as light as buying goods from the local grocery store -a&nbsp;habit.</p> Applying the “Rule of The&nbsp;Boxes” <p>Typically, if users choose between two products, they pick the cheaper one. If Product A costs $50 but offers 2–3 key functions while Product B costs $100 but offers 10–15 key features, people will choose the cheaper&nbsp;option.</p><p>However, if we add something in between-Product C, which costs $80 but has 8–12 options, people will find it the best deal. That’s the rule of the&nbsp;boxes.</p> The goal gradient&nbsp;effect <p>The goal gradient theory proves that consumers are motivated to make more purchases when closer to achieving their goals. The goal gradient theory focuses on the relationship between effort and the level of motivation that goes into attaining specific&nbsp;goals.</p><p>The goal gradient effect is easily accessible. For example, many cafeterias offer a free coffee for every ten orders, making customers more prone to purchase to get the&nbsp;freebie.</p> The FOMO&nbsp;effect <p>FOMO (in short for “Fear of Missing Out”) is a very popular effect. Research shows that we’re more motivated to avoid losing something than earning it. This is called loss aversion, and recently it’s been applied to loyalty programs.</p><p>Loss aversion explains the difference between a one-time point-based survey and a rewards program; instead of earning points, customers are motivated when they see how many points they can&nbsp;lose.</p><p>In the sports betting industry, it’s a common strategy to offer customers to cash out. If they are betting on 5–6 events, they can cash out (while missing some of the potential profit) but keep some of their profits, or keep playing and lose everything, including their&nbsp;bets.</p> A sense of exclusivity <p>As humans, we’re naturally attracted to the feeling of gaining social status. High-tier rewards give shoppers an excellent reason to keep coming back and incentivize them to spend&nbsp;more.</p><p>People can easily find this exclusivity effect in real life. For example, the famous travel website Booking gives its users an additional discount if they reach a certain level (Genius 1, Genius 2, Genius). They have to book more holidays within a certain period to achieve&nbsp;it.</p> Increased commitment <p>Once customers have invested in your brand, they’re more likely to remain loyal than if they had only entered your&nbsp;store.</p><p>The “sunk cost fallacy” is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when individuals see investment as an increase in their own worth, so any withdrawal from that investment becomes a loss of personal&nbsp;value.</p><p>In other words, the more your customers engage with your ecommerce store, the more likely they are to keep purchasing from&nbsp;you.</p><p>PS: want to learn more about the topic? Then read our article about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">customer commitment here</a>.</p> Summary <p>Loyalty programs are the backbone of almost any business, but businesses must constantly innovate to avoid becoming complacent and falling behind. Customer perception is crucial-marketers can customize everything from rewards to customer engagement techniques to appeal to audiences’ mindsets.</p><p>Rewards are the most direct way for customers to appreciate your brand-they give people something they want, so long as they continue buying your product or&nbsp;service.</p><p>And as you already saw, understanding and leveraging psychology will not only give you short-term results, but it will help your business succeed in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>Did you like this article?

  <p>Long theorized as the solution to the verification problem on the internet, decentralized identity has now achieved lift-off in the marketplace. In this workshop, we’ll explain who’s interested, why, and what we learned building a series of solutions for global enterprises in the finance, health, and travel sectors. We’ll explain how we implement decentralized identity through the concept of a Trusted Data Ecosystem, and what the near future looks like for businesses who adopt this technology now, including the critical importance of verifiable digital identity to decentralized finance, the metaverse, and to the interaction of digital objects and non-digital objects in the spatial web—the “Internet of Everything.”</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-dahl-ebert-decentralized-identity"></a>

<p>Staying up to date and learning hacking techniques is one of the best ways to know how to defend your organization from cyber threats. Hacking gamification is on the rise to help keep security professionals up to date on the latest exploits and vulnerabilities. This session is about helping you get started with hacking gamification to strengthen your security team.</p>
<p>In this session Joseph Carson Chief Security Scientist and Advisory CISO at Delinea will select two systems from Hack the Box and walk through each of them in detail explaining each step along with recommendations on how to reduce the risks. Going from initial enumeration, exploitation, abusing weak credentials to a full privileged compromise.</p>
<p>What will I learn?</p>
 
 How attackers gain access to IT environments and systems and escalate privileges 
 What a real-world hack looks like in a use-case demonstration 
 Best practices for combating attackers by establishing multiple layers of security to minimize risk 
 
<p>Get answers to these important questions:</p>
 
 How has moving to the cloud affected cyber security from a PAM perspective? 
 What are the most common types of attacks that criminal hackers use to compromise cloud environments? 
 What are common misconceptions that lead to cyber security “blind spots” of vulnerability?

  <p>The Internet had been created without an identity layer, leaving it to websites and applications to take care for authentication, authorization, privacy and access. We all know the consequences - username and password still being the dominant paradigm and, even more important, users not having control over information that personally identifies them. The risk of data misuse, of being hacked or manipulated has become a significant challenge and and requires a new approach in times of an emerging web3 and its core capability of transferring value. Is decentralized, DLT based Identity the solution that finally will enable DeFi, NFTs and DAOs?

  <p>Trust is not just technical, and it’s not just derived from a process or an organisation. The need for Trust is also variable based on the risk involved in a transaction or the risk appetite of the service provider. Sometimes trust is almost irrelevant. Digital doesn’t make things any easier as we often have multiple parties involved in the communication of trust from issuer to holder of credentials, and on to a relying service not to mention requirements for onboarding, verification, issuance, and authentication to name but a few along the way.</p>
<p>Emerging standards and relentless innovation make many things better, but they also introduce challenges when we want multiple systems to work together and for trust to be largely independent of the underlying technical stacks.</p>
<p>To make Trust work in diverse ecosystems we need clear rules of engagement that champion the needs of all participants and clearly define their responsibilities to one another, and to the wider legal and business ecosystems they ultimately interact with. Efforts in multiple jurisdictions in both the public and private sector are developing these rule sets right now – this is what we can learn from the rise of the Trust Framework.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-cooper-trust-rules"></a>

To get there, we need open Standards, Protocols and Alliances that help individuals, as well as businesses of any size, to participate in a digital future inside the metaverse and beyond - just like trade unions helped the working class during the industrial revolution to fight for their rights. In this panel session, we will discuss about the enablers of such a different approach and the requirements to actually be successfull.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-gain-future-internet"></a>

The addition of consumer-permissioned data from an open banking platform allows early-stage FinTechs access to the data they need to mitigate fraud, maximize confidence, and provide more choice in payment transactions to improve user experiences.</p>
<p>“Mastercard’s open banking platform provides consumer-permissioned data that is critical to enabling all ecosystem players, opening the door for the future of financial experiences, and can help streamline account verification to reduce friction between apps and consumers,” said Andy Sheehan, Executive Vice President, U.S. Open Banking at Mastercard. “Mastercard and Synctera’s partnership enhances the support and collaboration that is critical to FinTech innovators and will allow entrepreneurs and developers the ability to go to market quickly and ultimately deliver more consumer choice.”</p>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>IIW was established in 2005, and boasts over a hundred sponsors, with hundreds in attendance. As the focus is on “getting things done” the agenda is created live each day by attendees present at the opening of the day, giving you the opportunity to establish what you want to talk about and getting the real time ability to see which topics others will be deliberating that you might want to join in on.</p>
<p>IIW is an un-conference, which means that there are no keynote speakers, presentations, or sales pitches (for the most part). Participants are encouraged to come with topics they would like to discuss with the community in attendance, with the goal of “moving topics, code and projects downfield.”</p>
<p>The Take Aways</p>
<p>Because of the unique style of this conference you are sure to take part in, sit in on, or just overhear a variety of conversations on all kinds of work in the identity space. Here are some of the topics Indicio’s team at IIW found interesting.</p>
<p>Trust registries and Machine Readable Governance: The question, “How do we know which Issuers to trust?” was brought up several times at IIW with “Trust registries” being a common response. But&nbsp; there seemed to be a division over what a trust registry is or should be. One interpretation saw it as a third party fulfilling a top-down, command-and-control, pay-to-play, API-to-call function in determining which credential issuers can be trusted. The other saw it as something collaborative, a resource for governance files that allows those files to be cacheable among agents through machine readable governance. This triggered interest in what machine readable governance was, how it made a trust registry portable,&nbsp; and how it could be implementedThere</p>
<p>DIDComm as a Control Channel: This concept is all about using DIDcomm as a coordinating service, connecting two endpoints that want to communicate and handling everything from authentication to coordinating money transfers or shipping details, while also adding an additional security layer for the end user. While it was a new idea to many, there were a few people that raised their hands and said that they have already implemented something like this and showed some real world examples, increasing excitement around the possibilities and promoting further adoption.</p>
<p>Interoperability: As usual, many people were concerned with how to solve interoperability challenges in the community. The crowd was very keen on the idea of running an Aries Interop-a-thon (based on the hackathon style events Indicio has run for the Cardea Project at Linux Foundation Public Health) The idea that IIW tickets be issued as credentials so the community can personally test its solutions and try to iron out some of the interoperability challenges was proposed, and has a good chance of moving forward.</p>
<p>The really thought provoking discussion was about the current state of identity interoperability vs interoperability in other areas of tech. When compared to browsers, it was said it is tempting to feel like we are in the Netscape era of standardization. When in reality we are likely more in line with the Compuserve-AOL era of standardization and have much further&nbsp; to go.</p>
<p>AnonCreds VS W3C JSON-LD Creds: Our team expected some disagreement about this topic, but both sides seemed to realize that delivery is what matters here, and additional argument isn’t going to help. Multiple sessions were run trying to identify which credential format to use, resulting in 7+ different formats being discussed, with Anoncreds &amp; W3C JSON-LD being the most popular for debate. The ISO mDL 18013-5 credential format was also brought up for use in drivers licenses.</p>
<p>Why should you participate in the next IIW?</p>
<p>No wrap up or bullet point list can capture every conversation. This year was the first in-person conference since the start of the pandemic and every member of our team was excited to go.</p>
<p>While it was cheaper to attend over zoom, the conversational opportunities presented by in-person attendance—the ability to to really dig into the technology, simply don’t occur online. While this could be said for any conference, the unconference style of IIW encourages much greater audience participation. The number of engineers in these discussions drives challenging, exciting, and insightful ideas, so much so in fact, that In the middle of this IIW they decided to do the next one in person, rather than one remote and one in person per year as had been previously planned.</p>
<p>And worse case scenario, you can use the opportunity of bringing your team together for some sweet photo ops like our team did.</p>
<p>Tickets sell out quickly so for more information and to make sure you can join the next event we encourage you to check out the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW website</a>!</p>

<p>Es zirkulieren falsche Annahmen und Missverständnisse in den Medien über das Potenzial und die Risiken von SSI. In diesem Artikel setzen wir uns mit einigen Missverständnissen auseinander und fassen die wichtigsten Kernthesen über SSI zusammen. So entsteht am Ende ein übersichtliches Bild darüber, was SSI ist, und vor allem: was SSI nicht ist und sein soll.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Können SSI Daten gestohlen und ohne mein Wissen verwendet werden? Ermöglicht SSI einen Datenmarkt und weiteren Missbrauch von unseren Daten?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bei SSI stehen die selbstbestimmte Nutzung und gleichzeitige Datensicherheit für das Individuums im Mittelpunkt. Gleichzeitig ist Datensparsamkeit wichtig: der User sollte immer nur das erforderliche Minimum der Informationen über sich preisgeben müssen, das für die Nutzung eines Dienstes notwendig ist. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass man bei SSI nur entscheiden kann, wem man die Daten gibt, nicht aber, was mit ihnen passiert – was keine technische Frage ist, sondern den Trust Frameworks und der Umsetzung von Policies geschuldet. Dies wird über Zertifizierung und Zulassung geregelt, da so Vertrauen in die am Ökosystem beteiligten Akteure hergestellt werden kann. SSI selbst bietet keinen allgemeinen Schutz vor Datenmissbrauch. Dennoch stellt es die Möglichkeit dar, durch das Prinzip der Dezentralität die eigenen Daten sicher und selbstbestimmt zu verwalten. Die Dienste, an welche man persönliche Daten übermittelt, sind letztendlich ebenfalls an die Datenschutzgrundverordnung gebunden. Man kann nicht nur entscheiden, wem man die Daten gibt, sondern auch wie (bspw. als ZKP oder als VP).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wieso bietet SSI mehr privacy als derzeitige Systeme?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weil wir unsere Daten nicht an Hunderte von Plattformen auslagern, sondern zentral bei uns verwalten. So wären im Idealfall beim Hack eines Dienstes keine Tausende von Userprofilen mit sensiblen Daten zu erbeuten, sondern nur wertlose peer to peer connects. Dadurch entstehen mehr Privatsphäre und Eigenverantwortung über die persönlichen Daten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schon im ersten Artikel zu SSI von Christopher Allan steht: Der User kann und soll selbst entscheiden, wem er oder sie persönliche Daten zeigt und wofür. Voraussetzung dafür ist Interoperabilität und Portabilität der Identitäten. Diese Idee ist gewissermaßen der Kern von SSI. Doch die Aussage, dass ich als User die komplette Hoheit über meine digitale Identität habe, wird oft missverstanden und ist in dieser Form falsch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ist SSI mit Klarnamenpflicht gleich zu setzen und verliere ich meine Anonymität?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Welche Daten ein Dienst einfordert liegt beim Dienst und an den gesetzlichen Vorgaben. Ist der Dienstanbieter nicht an eine Klarnamenpflicht gebunden, also nicht verpflichtet einen Klarnamen abzufragen und zu überprüfen so kann er das auch nicht vom Nutzer einfordern (nach Datenschutzgrundverordnung). Tut er dies trotzdem, muss der Benutzer zustimmen und es muss ein konkreter Grund genannt werden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wieso hat SSI nichts mit Blockchain zu tun?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>SSI wird oft mit der Blockchain Technologie gleichgesetzt. Dadurch entsteht der Eindruck, dass SSI nur gemeinsam mit Blockchain funktionieren kann. Das ist jedoch nicht der Fall. Wir haben eine umfassende Erklärung hier zusammengefasst: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/">https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week we released a new version of Holochain Launcher with a lot of new features. I took it for a test run and I have to say… I'm excited. It feels like something my dad could actually use! The new Launcher is much more welcoming to non-technical users. I’m going to unbox it below, but first, the Holochain release notes for this week.</p> Holochain 0.0.139: Keystore version bump, simpler link CRUD <p>Breaking changes: none<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129, 0.0.130, 0.0.131, 0.0.132<br>Compatible Lair version: 0.1.3</p><p>This release is another small one, albeit with a couple meaningful changes for devs and users:</p>  The compatible Lair keystore has been bumped to version 0.1.3 (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1377">#1377</a>). This brings mostly documentation updates, but also fixes a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/all-agents-busy-please-stand-by/#holochain-00137">bug</a> involving spaces in Lair’s socket/pipe path (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/91">lair #91</a>) and gets more strict about the version of Lair that it intends to connect to (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/95">lair #95</a>).  The link CRUD functions <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.create_link.html"><code>create_link</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.get_link_details.html"><code>get_link_details</code></a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.get_links.html"><code>get_links</code></a> now take any DHT hash that can be converted to a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/prelude/type.AnyLinkableHash.html">linkable hash</a>, rather than requiring you to convert it yourself. On the flip side, entry, header, and external hashes now have <code>Into&lt;AnyLinkableHash&gt;</code> implementations to make this all possible. Surprisingly, this isn’t a breaking change, as it all happens in the HDK before getting sent to the host. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1365">#1365</a>)   Unboxing the user-friendly Launcher 0.4.4 <p>Compatible Holochain versions: 0.0.127, 0.0.131, 0.0.132, 0.0.136</p><p>If you’re not familiar with the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a>, it’s a user-friendly manager for running hApps. This will eventually be our end-user offering, and one of the primary ways you’ll be able to distribute web-based hApps to your users.</p><p>Version 0.4.4 is a huge jump toward the goal of user-friendliness, in a few ways:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub-dnas">DevHub</a>, a built-in package manager that lets your users download and install hApps right from within the Launcher!  It supports multiple Holochain versions, which means that you don’t have to worry quite as much about whether your users have the right Launcher installed. It also means they also won’t have to perform any more factory resets and lose their data!  <p>Okay, let’s unbox this thing.</p> 1. First run <p>Here’s something new: When you start up Launcher 0.4.4 for the first time, there’s already a hApp running! It’s the first public preview of the new DevHub hApp. (I’ll talk more about that at the bottom of this Dev Pulse.)</p> 2. hApp Library <p>If you click on the ‘Install new app’ button, instead of getting a file dialog, you see the new App Library! It’s powered by the DevHub DNA, and it lets you download, install, and start a hApp with just a couple of clicks. Currently there’s only one hApp with a public release, called Notebooks, but it’s a fun one.</p> 3. Installing a hApp <p>As you can see, I didn’t have to hunt around for a hApp bundle file on the internet, and I didn’t have to hunt for the downloaded file on my device’s storage. The Launcher just downloaded Notebooks and showed me a simplified installation dialog. The membrane proof fields are hidden; all I have to do is change the hApp’s name if I feel like it.</p> 4. Behold, a newly installed hApp <p>Now I have two hApps, DevHub and Notebooks. They each require a different conductor version, but that’s no problem; you can see that Launcher started up 0.0136 automatically for me. Users probably won’t notice or care about this detail, but what it means for them is that It Just Works.</p> 5. Using Notebooks for the first time <p><a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/notebooks">Notebooks</a> is a real-time collaborative document editor, similar to HackMD or Google Docs. It’s built using a framework called <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/decentralized-next-level-collaboration-apps-with-syn/">Syn</a>, created by Eric Harris-Braun and his son last year. I’d like to say more about Notebooks, but for brevity’s sake I’ll say this: I was surprised by how delightful it was to use. The real-time editing experience is smooth and snappy, just like you’d expect from a cloud app. But I’m comforted by the knowedge that all the stuff I care about is on my machine!</p><blockquote>So, now that you’ve seen the new Launcher, why not <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.4.4">give it a try</a>? I invite non-developers to try it out too!</blockquote> DevHub public preview <p>So the other big news that got bundled with Launcher 0.4.4 is, of course, the first public preview of the DevHub hApp. It’s not ready for prime time yet (that will likely happen after the Stable Validation milestone) but I’m still excited by the possibilities it hints at.</p><p>So what is DevHub? If you’re a developer, it’s easiest to think of it as a package manager and distributed repository for hApps, built on Holochain. You can distribute releases of your zomes, DNAs, hApps, and web-based UIs for other developers to remix, or for users to download.</p><p>If you’re a user, it’s like an open-source hApp store or library. As we’ve seen, the Launcher can talk to the DevHub DNA natively, giving it the power to search, download, install, and update hApps.</p><p>The DevHub hApp comes with a web-based GUI that attempts to serve both devs and users. In the future, it will split into two GUIs — one specifically tailored to devs, and a user-focused ‘hApp store’ experience.</p><p>This demonstrates that you don’t have to use a hApp’s default UI — you can fork it, create your own, or even build it into a desktop app, as the Launcher’s native support demonstrates. This is what happens when an app’s API is totally accessible to you on your machine. It’s all under your control!</p> Unboxing the DevHub GUI <p>Now let’s take a look at this first iteration of the DevHub GUI. It’s being redesigned at the moment, but this will give you a taste of what the DNA is meant for.</p> 1. Main page <p>When you open up the GUI, you see a listing of hApp packages, sorted by date. You can get info on a package, add your own hApp, or choose instead to look at individual DNAs and zomes if you’re interested in remixing and creating your own hApp.</p> 2. hApp info page <p>Let’s take a look at the Notebooks listing. We can see some information about the hApp — what it’s for, how fresh it is, who wrote it, etc. Below that, you can see all the individual releases of the hApp.</p> 3. Release page <p>Let’s take a look at the 0.0.1 release of Notebooks. It was published on 9 May 2022, and we can see the changelog. To the right we can see the DNAs that comprise it — `syn` and `notebooks` — and download a headless `.happ` package or a full `.webhapp` package.</p><p>That’s all for now — once I learn more about DevHub I’d like to do a more in-depth study of what it can do!</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@spacex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">SpaceX</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/launch?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>To the ShareRing Community,</p>



<p>It’s been a tough few days for many people and we understand that the resulting challenges may be with us for quite some time. Transparency drives the core values of ShareRing, and we aim to maintain a level of consistency in being transparent with you, our community members who have supported us through the highs and lows.</p>



<p>As a company we have always strived to maintain consistent transaction fees, in particular when it is within our control. When external protocols are required in the transaction, it becomes more challenging to do so. The average cost of Ethereum transaction fees have risen exponentially over the last few days, and as a result we are going to temporarily increase the swap out fees from SLP3 to ERC20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Swap out fees will be increased from 5000 SHR to 10,000 SHR. This takes effect immediately as of the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Our team closely monitors the market costs and we are always positioned to make the necessary adjustments to reflect the trends.</p>



<p>The ShareRing Community has always been the core of our business, and we endeavour to work through the challenges together, as a whole. Short term challenges prepare us for prospective growth and we look towards the shining light at the end of the tunnel, not just as a community and company, but the industry a whole.</p>



<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jonathon, </p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> The need for authentication standards 
<p>In the cybersecurity industry, many new technologies–particularly those related to identity management and authentication–are constantly driving change and innovation. Yet one thing remains the same: the use of passwords continues to pose a threat to an organization’s IT security. As long as passwords continue to be used, users and organizations will remain vulnerable to attacks. Fortunately, due to the development of new solutions and authentication standards, replacing passwords as the dominant form of authentication on the Internet now seems to be possible.</p>
<p>Various annual surveys demonstrate that password compromises are associated with 70-80% of data breaches. As a response to the over-reliance on passwords, the non-profit organization FIDO ("Fast IDentity Online") Alliance was launched in 2013 to develop and promote authentication standards. With the help of the FIDO Alliance, a set of open, scalable, and interoperable specifications has been developed to replace passwords as a secure authentication method for online services. The alliance has also worked with companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple to integrate and adopt FIDO standards across their operating systems.</p>
 <br>FIDO Alliance reveals its latest whitepaper 
<p>Most recently, the FIDO Alliance and the W3C WebAuthn working group published a whitepaper in March 2022 explaining how the introduction of multi-device FIDO credentials will enable FIDO technology to supplant passwords for many consumer use cases. The framework goes further by outlining two proposals for phishing-resistant authentication mechanisms:</p>
 
 Using your phone as a roaming authenticator: Essentially, this involves connecting the user's smartphone (which becomes the FIDO authenticator) and the device from which the user is trying to authenticate via Bluetooth. Since Bluetooth requires physical presence, the use of proximity-based authentication should be resistant to any phishing attacks. As a result, the smartphone becomes a sort of smart card while providing the necessary FIDO requirements to the device from which the user is trying to authenticate. 
 
 
 Multi-device FIDO credentials: To improve user experience, the second proposal encourages FIDO authenticator vendors to adapt their authenticators in the event of lost or stolen devices. As users move from device to device, FIDO credentials should be available on a user’s new device without the need of implementing a password.&nbsp; For example, a smartphone, a desktop, and a USB token could act as a mutually exchangeable FIDO authenticator. 
 
<p>The whitepaper argues that the syncing of FIDO credentials, together with the Bluetooth alternative, allows FIDO authentication to be a secure and convenient solution for existing two-factor deployments. Furthermore, the paper makes it clear that the proposal is not a change in standards, but rather a set of prescriptions for vendors to implement themselves.</p>
<p><br>However, there is one crucial point that the FIDO and WebAuthn proposals seem to ignore. So far, the whitepaper has not specified whether users will feel comfortable with a password successor where the cloud operator has access to secret keys. If users roam enterprise-issued keys via potentially insecure clouds, organizations must understand the risks that come with convenience when syncing is not end-to-end secured.&nbsp; At the end of the day, it comes down to what end users will do and only time will tell if they are willing to trust<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless"> Microsoft</a>,<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/protect-gce-vms-with-managed-fido-security-keys"> Google</a>, and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/expanded-support-for-fido-authentication-in-ios-and-macos/">Apple</a> as the ultimate confidants of their organization's credentials.</p>
<p><br>In addition, if the deprovisioning of access within applications is not properly implemented, former employees might gain access to cloud-based applications when leaving an organization and returning their physical FIDO key. By not having proper controls in place, this new level of convenience will increase the risk and reduce the level of control an organization is able to exert.<br>Therefore, KuppingerCole believes that companies and other organizations that are looking to modernize and improve authentication solutions should understand the consequences beforehand. If done right, this solution has the potential to provide a frictionless user experience while improving security at the same time. We expect to see a significant number of FIDO authenticators, vendors, servers, and compatible web apps in industry over the course of the next few years.</p>

<p>Nel corso di questi ultimi anni una serie&nbsp;di progetti innovativi, come&nbsp;l’invio digitale, certificato e sicuro, delle comunicazioni di inizio quarantena per Covid da parte dei medici di base ai propri assistiti&nbsp;o&nbsp;ancora, la raccolta del consenso informato dematerializzato dell’avvio della campagna vaccinale di inizio 2021 hanno contribuito in maniera forte alla digitalizzazione nel campo sanitario.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“L’obiettivo è giungere a una digitalizzazione completa di tutte le fasi dell’iter pre-intervento di un paziente per garantire ai cittadini maggiore efficienza e anche migliore qualità di comunicazione con le strutture sanitarie.”</p>Carmine Auletta, CISO di InfoCert</blockquote>



<p>Negli ultimi anni la sanità è stata oggetto di numerosi&nbsp;cambiamenti, dettati prima dalla pandemia e ora dagli investimenti in ambito Pnrr. In questo contesto numerose sono state le soluzioni digitali adottate nel campo sanitario, facendo sì che ad oggi la digitalizzazione della sanità risulti essere uno dei pilastri dei recovery plan di tutta Europa. &nbsp;</p>



<p>InfoCert è da sempre protagonista della digitalizzazione nel mondo Health Care grazie soprattutto a LegalCare e ProxySign, le soluzioni Trust studiate per la digitalizzazione dei processi&nbsp;di lavoro clinici e amministrativi e già adottate da importanti Aziende Sanitarie Italiane.&nbsp;</p>

Because they’re built with web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS), you can also deploy your Ionic apps as single-page applications.
Or, even better, as progressive web apps (PWAs) that work offline.</p>
 
 
<p>Ionic supports the big three web frameworks: Angular, React, and Vue.
Once you’ve written your app, you can deploy it to a simulator or device with <a href="https://capacitorjs.com/">Capacitor</a>.
Capacitor (pictured as the blue layer) provides the runtime for your app to communicate with the native operating system and vice versa.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>Ionic’s main competitors are native apps built with Swift or Objective-C (for iOS) and Java or Kotlin (for Android).
Ionic also competes with React Native, which uses web technologies and translates them to native components.</p>
 
 
<p>The Ionic blog has a recent post that <a href="https://ionicframework.com/blog/ionic-vs-react-native-performance-comparison/">does a performance comparison between Ionic and React Native</a>.
TL;DR: Both options will give you a high-performance app with a truly native look and feel.</p>

 What the heck is JHipster? 
 
 
<p>This tutorial will show you how to use Ionic, Angular, and Capacitor to build a mobile app that talks to a Spring Boot backend. It won’t take but a few minutes, thanks to JHipster!</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://www.jhipster.tech">JHipster</a> is an application generator that creates an Angular frontend and a Spring Boot backend based on the options you choose. It has the ability for you, as a developer, to customize what it generates with blueprints. The blueprints feature has resulted in many additional options for an app: Kotlin, Spring Native, Micronaut, Quarkus, .NET Core, NestJS, and Svelte.</p>
 
 
<p>Below is a diagram of the app you’ll create in this tutorial and its authentication flow.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 ✨ Introducing the JHipster Ionic blueprint! 
 
 
<p>The JHipster project has supported generating an Ionic app using a <code>generator-jhipster-ionic</code> module for the past several years.
As the primary maintainer of this module, I’m proud to announce that it has been re-written as a blueprint, and it’s much easier to understand now.
The previous module relied on the Ionic CLI, the base Angular <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/starters">starter</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/ionic-jhipster-starter">Ionic JHipster starter</a>, and custom code to glue it all together.
Now, the source code is all contained in one project.</p>

<p>Here’s how to use it:</p>
 
 
<p>Create an <code>ionic-app</code> directory alongside your JHipster app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- backend
- ionic-app</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Navigate into <code>ionic-app</code> using your terminal.
Install Ionic for JHipster and create a new app using <code>jhipster-ionic</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster-ionic
jhipster-ionic</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll be prompted for the location of your JHipster app, a name for your Ionic app, and then you’ll be off to the races!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can also create a JHipster app and an Ionic app simultaneously by using the bundled JHipster.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkdir bug-tracker &amp;&amp; cd bug-tracker
jhipster-ionic jdl bug-tracker.jh
cd ../ionic4j</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This process will follow the same convention where the generated backend and frontend apps are side-by-side on your hard drive.</p>
 
 
<p>Then you can run both apps from your Ionic app using easy-to-remember commands.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run backend:start
# open a new terminal window
npm start</code> 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 






The JHipster Ionic blueprint currently only supports Angular.
Now that it’s a blueprint, it will be much easier to add support for Vue and React.
If you’re interested in helping out, please let me know!
Okta is a platinum sponsor of the JHipster project and enjoys assigning <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%24%24+bug-bounty+%24%24%22">bug bounties</a> for feature development.



 
 
 
 
 Build a mobile app with Ionic and Angular 
 
 
<p>To see Ionic + JHipster in action, let’s start with a <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/full-stack-java-with-react-spring-boot-and-jhipster/">Full Stack Java + React app I created for the Auth0 blog</a>.
I updated the app to the latest version of JHipster (v7.8.1) and created an Ionic app with JHipster Ionic, so everything is guaranteed to work.
This Flickr clone allows you to upload photos, tag them, and organize them into albums.
First, clone the example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-ionic-example.git \
  jhipster-ionic --depth 1
cd jhipster-ionic/backend</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Start the app:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run ci:e2e:prepare # starts Keycloak and PostgreSQL in Docker
./mvnw</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your favorite browser.
Sign in with <code>admin/admin</code> credentials and rejoice when it all works.</p>
 
 
<p>Open a new terminal window and enter the <code>jhipster-ionic/ionic-app</code> directory.
Install its dependencies and run <code>npm start</code> to test the Ionic client.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install
npm start</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should be able to sign in and add a new photo.</p>
 

  
    
    
  
  
    
    
  

 
<p>Please keep reading to learn how JHipster made all of this possible.
Or, skip ahead to <a>run your Ionic app on iOS using Capacitor</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 How to integrate Ionic and Spring Boot 
 
 
<p>JHipster makes it easy to create a Spring Boot API that Spring Security protects.
The JHipster Ionic blueprint generates an Ionic client that talks to your Spring Boot API and understands its auth mechanism.
I created the <code>jhipster-ionic</code> project using the following steps:</p>
 
 
<p>Install the JHipster Ionic blueprint:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster-ionic@8.0.0</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a parent directory to hold everything:</p>
 
 
 
 <code># take is a shortcut for mdkir &amp;&amp; cd
take jhipster-ionic</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Clone an existing JHipster Flickr example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git backend --depth 1</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a new directory to hold your Ionic project, then run <code>jhipster-ionic</code> in it:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>take ionic-app
jhipster-ionic</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Provide the path to your backend JHipster app and name your app <code>flickr2</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>That’s it!
The blueprint will generate an Ionic client, complete with screens for editing entities, unit tests, and end-to-end tests with Cypress.</p>
 
 
<p>Pretty slick, don’t you think?!
😎</p>
 
 
 Run your Spring Boot API 
 
<p>You’ll need to start your backend first, so your Ionic app can talk to its API.
First, start Keycloak and PostgreSQL in Docker containers:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd backend
npm run ci:e2e:prepare # starts Keycloak and PostgreSQL in Docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, update <code>backend/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml</code> to allow CORS from <code>http://localhost:8100</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  ...
  cors:
    allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:8100'
    allowed-methods: '*'
    allowed-headers: '*'
    exposed-headers: 'Authorization,Link,X-Total-Count,X-${jhipster.clientApp.name}-alert,X-${jhipster.clientApp.name}-error,X-${jhipster.clientApp.name}-params'
    allow-credentials: true
    max-age: 1800</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, start the backend app using <code>./mvnw -Pprod</code>.
You should be able to log in at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> (with <code>admin/admin</code>) and add new photos using Entities &gt; Photos.
Add a few photos so you have some data to work with.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Run your Ionic app 
 
<p>Open another terminal and navigate to the <code>ionic-app</code> folder.
Launch your Ionic client using  <code>npm start</code>.
In your default browser, the app will be opened at <code>http://localhost:8100</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You should be able to log in with Keycloak and see all the listed entities in your app.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>In the JHipster app’s tutorial, there’s a section where you’re instructed to remove photo fields that can be calculated.
Specifically, height, width, date taken, and date uploaded.
These values are calculated when the photos are uploaded, so there’s no reason to display them when adding a photo.</p>
 
 
<p>To add this same functionality to your Ionic app, modify <code>src/app/pages/entities/photo/photo-update.html</code> and wrap these fields with <code>&lt;div *ngIf="!isNew"&gt;</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;div *ngIf="!isNew"&gt;
  &lt;ion-item&gt;
    &lt;ion-label position="floating"&gt;Height&lt;/ion-label&gt;
    &lt;ion-input type="number" name="height" formControlName="height"&gt;&lt;/ion-input&gt;
  &lt;/ion-item&gt;
  ...
  &lt;ion-item&gt;
    &lt;ion-label&gt;Uploaded&lt;/ion-label&gt;
    &lt;ion-datetime displayFormat="MM/DD/YYYY HH:mm" formControlName="uploaded" id="field_uploaded"&gt;&lt;/ion-datetime&gt;
  &lt;/ion-item&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The Ionic CLI will auto-compile and reload the app in your browser when you save this file.
You can prove everything works as expected by stopping your app (with Ctrl+C) and running all the end-to-end tests with Cypress.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run e2e</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run your Ionic app on iOS using Capacitor 
 
 
<p>Generate a native iOS project with the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx ionic build
npx ionic capacitor add ios</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add your custom scheme (<code>dev.localhost.ionic</code>) to <code>ios/App/App/Info.plist</code>.
This scheme is configured in <code>src/environments/environment.ts</code>; you can easily change it to something else if you like.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLTypes&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
  &lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.getcapacitor.capacitor&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;capacitor&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;dev.localhost.ionic&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
  &lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the JHipster app’s CORS settings (in <code>backend/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml</code>) to allow <code>capacitor://localhost</code> as an origin.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  ...
  cors:
    allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:8100,capacitor://localhost'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your backend app.
Deploy your Ionic app to iOS Simulator and run it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx cap run ios</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Confirm you can log in and rejoice in your success!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Run your Ionic app on Android 
 
 
<p>Generate an Android project with Capacitor.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx ionic capacitor add android</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Enable clear text traffic and add <code>dev.localhost.ionic</code> as a scheme in <code>android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;activity ... android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"&gt;
  &lt;!-- You'll need to add this intent filter so redirects work --&gt;
  &lt;intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" /&gt;
    &lt;data android:scheme="dev.localhost.ionic" /&gt;
    &lt;!--data android:scheme="com.okta.dev-133337" /--&gt;
  &lt;/intent-filter&gt;

  &lt;intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /&gt;
  &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the JHipster app’s CORS settings to allow <code>http://localhost</code> as an origin.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  ...
  cors:
    allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:8100,capacitor://localhost,http://localhost'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your backend app and run your Ionic app on Android using the Capacitor CLI:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx cap run android</code> 
 
 
 






If you get an error when running this command, make sure to use Java 11.



 
 
<p>You’ll need to run a couple of commands to allow the emulator to communicate with JHipster and Keycloak.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
adb reverse tcp:9080 tcp:9080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should be able to log in and edit entities, just like you can in a browser and on iOS!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Why use OpenID Connect for mobile apps? 
 
 
<p>Storing <a>API keys and secrets in mobile apps is not safe</a>.
OAuth 2.0 solves this problem by not shipping any secrets in mobile apps and instead involving the user in the process of getting an access token into the app.
These access tokens are unique per user, and they’re updated every time the user logs in.
The <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/">PKCE extension</a> provides a solution for securely doing the OAuth flow on a mobile app even when there is no pre-provisioned secret.</p>
 
 
<p>If you need to access an API from a mobile app, hopefully, it supports OAuth and PKCE!
Thankfully most of the hard work of PKCE is handled by SDKs like <a href="https://appauth.io/">AppAuth</a>, so you don’t have to write all that code yourself.
If you’re working with an API like Okta, then Okta’s SDKs do PKCE automatically, so you don’t have to worry about it.
The JHipster Ionic blueprint uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ionic-appauth">Ionic AppAuth</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The previous sections showed you how to use Keycloak as your identity provider. If you’re deploying to production, you might not want to manage your users and authentication system. That’s where Okta and Auth0 can help!</p>
 
 
 Switch your identity provider to Okta 
 
<p>If you don’t have an Okta developer account, you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">sign up for one</a> or run <code>okta register</code> after installing the Okta CLI.</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to change your JHipster app to use Okta, the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> makes this as easy as <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>.
This command creates a <code>.okta.env</code> file you can source to override the default Keycloak settings.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .okta.env
./mvnw -Pprod</code> 
 
 
 
<p>With Keycloak, you don’t need a separate OIDC app for Ionic.
With Okta, you do.
See JHipster’s documentation to learn <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#create-a-native-app-for-mobile-on-okta">how to create a native app for Ionic on Okta</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>After you’ve changed the client ID in your Ionic app, run it using <code>npm start</code>.
You’ll be prompted to log in using your Okta credentials at <code>http://localhost:8100</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 Switch your identity provider to Auth0 
 
<p>To switch your identity provider to Auth0, you first need an <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">Auth0 account</a>.
Then, create a <code>.auth0.env</code> file and see <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#auth0">JHipster’s Auth0 docs</a> for how to populate it.</p>
 
 
<p>Next, <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#create-a-native-app-for-mobile-on-auth0">configure a native app for Ionic on Auth0</a>.
Once you’re finished updating your Ionic app with a new client ID and audience, you should be able to run your backend and new frontend client using the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .auth0.env
npm run backend:start
# open a new terminal
npm start</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To see it in action on your mobile emulators, use the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run build

# iOS
npx cap run ios

# Android
npx cap run android</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Learn more about Ionic, Spring Boot, and JHipster 
 
 
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed learning about Ionic and the new Ionic blueprint for JHipster.
In my opinion, it’s pretty neat that you can rapidly prototype a mobile client for your JHipster.
It’s even better that you can use a leading-edge mobile application framework to do it.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-ionic-example">@oktadev/okta-jhipster-ionic-example</a> repository.</p>

What lessons can we learn?&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣 OPOLIS | Sign Up to Get 1000 $WORK and 1000 $BANK <a href="https://bankless.cc/Opolis">https://bankless.cc/Opolis</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; 🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://podcast.banklesshq.com/">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:&nbsp;</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALED ETHEREUM <a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>❎ ACROSS | BRIDGE TO LAYER 2 <a href="https://bankless.cc/Across">https://bankless.cc/Across</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🏦 ALTO IRA | TAX-FREE CRYPTO <a href="https://bankless.cc/AltoIRA">https://bankless.cc/AltoIRA</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>👻 AAVE V3 | LEND &amp; BORROW CRYPTO <a href="https://bankless.cc/aave">https://bankless.cc/aave</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚡️ MAKER DAO | THE DAI STABLECOIN &nbsp;<a href="https://bankless.cc/MakerDAO">https://bankless.cc/MakerDAO</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET <a href="https://bankless.cc/Brave">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro 6:30 Explaining the Terra Ecosystem 9:30 Tail Risk and Background 13:50 Bitcoin, Curve, and Monsters 17:54 The Initial Destabilization 20:14 The Panic Begins 24:40 The Charts 27:18 A Total Collapse 32:30 Regulators Get Involved 35:08 Was This An Attack? 37:58 The Collateral Damage 40:00 Do Kwon’s Big Talk 41:52 Rick Sanchez and Basis Cash 44:08 Community Response 46:05 How Do We Move On? 49:14 Don’t Take Shortcuts</p> <p>------ Resources:</p> <p>Anchor Protocol: <a href="https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn">https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn</a>&nbsp;  Buying Bitcoin: <a href="https://twitter.com/LFG_Reserve/status/1507688906820620291">https://twitter.com/LFG_Reserve/status/1507688906820620291</a>&nbsp;  Curve Pools: <a href="https://dune.com/SebVentures/UST">https://dune.com/SebVentures/UST</a>&nbsp;  Binance Orderbook: <a href="https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1523817151471230976?s=20&amp;t=FiTLk5ce5JmTg_s7QnWgMw"> https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1523817151471230976?s=20&amp;t=FiTLk5ce5JmTg_s7QnWgMw</a>&nbsp;  External Collateral: <a href="https://twitter.com/ThinkingBitmex/status/1523526622044860416">https://twitter.com/ThinkingBitmex/status/1523526622044860416</a>&nbsp;  Deploying More Capital: <a href="https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1523733542492016640">https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1523733542492016640</a>&nbsp;  Collapse: <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1523712585794977792">https://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1523712585794977792</a>&nbsp;  Bitconnect: <a href="https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1524451573908209664?s=20&amp;t=1cKzW3BXwfKsAdFAsObfLQ"> https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1524451573908209664?s=20&amp;t=1cKzW3BXwfKsAdFAsObfLQ</a>&nbsp;  Historical: <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1524233730717585409?s=20&amp;t=azvpduGJEOCfqyNCUFSBWA"> https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1524233730717585409?s=20&amp;t=azvpduGJEOCfqyNCUFSBWA</a>&nbsp;  Janet Yellen: <a href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1524031909067698180?s=20&amp;t=FiTLk5ce5JmTg_s7QnWgMw"> https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1524031909067698180?s=20&amp;t=FiTLk5ce5JmTg_s7QnWgMw</a>&nbsp;  Coordinated Attack: <a href="https://twitter.com/TerraBitesPod/status/1524229263469293570?s=20&amp;t=FiTLk5ce5JmTg_s7QnWgMw"> https://twitter.com/TerraBitesPod/status/1524229263469293570?s=20&amp;t=FiTLk5ce5JmTg_s7QnWgMw</a>&nbsp;  Vitalik Clip: <a href="https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ/status/1523995722261147648?s=20&amp;t=FiTLk5ce5JmTg_s7QnWgMw"> https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ/status/1523995722261147648?s=20&amp;t=FiTLk5ce5JmTg_s7QnWgMw</a>&nbsp;  Mental Health: <a href="https://twitter.com/Shigeo808/status/1524149580048191488?s=20&amp;t=azvpduGJEOCfqyNCUFSBWA"> https://twitter.com/Shigeo808/status/1524149580048191488?s=20&amp;t=azvpduGJEOCfqyNCUFSBWA</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

<p>What if semiconductor manufacturers made chips especially intended for crypto-wallets? That’s the topic of Blockchain Commons’ first <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">Silicon Salon</a>, which will feature two different chip manufacturers who are expanding into the crypto industry. The first is CrossBar, a leader in Resistive RAM (ReRAM) technology, which can implement high-performance physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Together, ReRAM memory and PUF solutions enable a new class of secure computing and storage with physical countermeasures — and CrossBar is interested in bringing that to digital-asset management. The second is Tropic Square, whose tropic01 secure element offers a fully transparent and auditable chip as a basis for better hardware security. They use transparency as a driver for innovation.</p>

<p>Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to bringing together a community of developers and manufacturers to jointly develop specifications that will empower the entire industry, we’ve seized upon our work with these two companies to produce our first salon since the pandemic: a virtual Silicon Salon, where semiconductor manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and other interested parties can come together to talk about the next generation of semiconductors, which for the first time ever will be specialized for our cryptographic needs.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon is scheduled for June 1st, running three hours beginning at 9am PT (noon ET, 6pm CET). Signups for the Salon are now available on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">Eventbrite</a>, with tickets limited to the first 40 participants.</p>

 Read More 



<p>The first hour of the Salon will feature presentations from silicon manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and experts in the field about how semiconductor design can support cryptographic functionality. Companies CrossBar, Tropic Square, and Proxy and experts Bryan Bishop and Christopher Allen are all scheduled to talk.</p>

<p>The other two hours of the Salon will feature facilitated discussion of topics intended to determine the needs of the hardware-wallet community. Specific topics may include: the importance of MCU and secure enclave integration; the importance of secure and persistent storage; the need for physical countermeasures; the advantages of hardware and software cryptography; the use of open licenses for hardware; and discussions of how new semiconductor designs intended for cryptography can improve security and efficiency. We don’t have all the answers: one of the most important goals of the salon is to find out the needs and thoughts of the community!</p>

<p>We hope you’ll <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">join us</a> to learn a bit about what’s already going on and to share your ideas, requirements, and expertise!</p>

<p>We are limiting the number of attendees to allow for Q&amp;A from the community, thus we are charging US$25 to hold a space at this unique virtual event. So <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">sign up</a> soon! If you are already a <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/sponsors.html">Patron</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">monthly sponsor on Github</a> of Blockchain Commons, please check your email: we will be sending you a free invite code automatically.

<p>Get ready! We are entering an era where IAM professionals can rise above those tradeoffs, and rapidly evolve from technical experts to experience artists by using solutions that customize, code, and integrate for you. This means humans can focus on what humans do best: creating amazing experiences, differentiating from competitors, reacting to market trends, leveraging innovations like decentralized identity and partnering with business owners to anticipate and exceed user expectations.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-worley-human-centric-identity"></a>

  <p>Consumer identity is still a hot topic in IAM in general. CIAM has experienced a great deal of technological innovation in the last five years, and much of the innovation in CIAM has found its way into B2B and B2E IAM solutions through the "consumerization of IT". KuppingerCole is updating research on CIAM, and in this session we'll consider what we have learned thus far, including trends in authenticator availability and usage, consent and privacy management features, regulatory compliance developments, the integration of consumers' device identities, the challenges of account recovery and linking, and the rising need for identity proofing services.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-tolbert-developments-ciam"></a>

  <p>HTTP is an amazingly powerful protocol, and it's the lifeblood of the internet today. On the surface, it seems to be a simple protocol: send a request to a server and get back a response, and everything's structured in useful ways. HTTPS adds the TLS protocol to secure the connections between endpoints, protecting the messages with encryption and keeping them away from attacker's eyes. But what if you want to be sure the sender is the right sender, and what you see is what they sent? What if you've got a more complex deployment, with proxies and gateways in between your endpoints that mess with the contents of the message? What if you need assurances on the response as well as the request, and to tie them together? People have been trying to sign HTTP messages in various ways for a long time, but only recently has the HTTP Working Group picked up the problem. Come hear about the HTTP Message Signatures work from the draft specification's authors and see how it works, how to apply it, and talk about how it could change how we use the web.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-richer-http-message-signatures"></a>

  <p>We are in the mid of one of the most significant revolutions in the cloud and identity ecosystem since the last decade. With the dynamic transformation from Web2.0 to Web3.0, both the cloud as well as the identity ecosystem embrace themselves for a change in the way we perceived security. Blockchain is revolutionizing both the cloud industry as well as the financial sectors. In my talk, I will focus on the transformative impact of blockchain protocols like Filecoin and Storj which are playing a significant role in changing the way we have perceived cloud storage. Decentralized Cloud Storage will be the future for sustainable data storage in Web 3.0, in which we will move from a single service provider to create an ecosystem where anybody could be a cloud storage provider. Highly successful blockchain projects like Filecoin have been able to create such an ecosystem. But we are far away from attending the level of scale needed to reach out to every corner of the globe. Decentralized Cloud Storage poses a different set of security challenges and scalability issues. I will be presenting my research work which focuses on the new advances in tackling future security threats for decentralized cloud storage. Additionally, I will focus on discussing how to overcome scalability issues in the blockchain using the most advanced cryptographical tools knowns as zk-SNARKs.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-kundu-decentralized-cloud"></a>

  <p>A practical approach to cyber security architectures: In a hybrid ecosystem we have not only to find a suitable security model for IT but also for OT like in production environments. And after all cloud services are adding another dimension of complexity. We will take a short look at the security basics, compare some outdated, updated and up-to-date security models finding suitable models for IT-security, OT-security and cloud-security. Finally we will put it all together in combined scenarios. This presentation will focus on practical security architecture rather than on formal compliance.</p>

<p>Key Topics:</p>
<p>* IT-security, OT-security, cloud-security</p>
<p>* Cyber security: from basics, perimeter, air gap to zero trust</p>
<p>* Hybrid world: isolation or integration</p>
<p>* Tops and flops in practical cyber security</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-richter-cybersecurity-architectures-hybrid"></a>

  <p>This presentation will explore adding deception as a component of a security-in-depth strategy to increase cyber resilience (in case the garlic, crosses, and wooden stakes are not effective). We will discuss whether you should invite attackers into your network. Much like with vampires, inviting attackers in can have serious repercussions. However, unlike vampires, cyber attackers do not need an invitation. Fortunately, deception within our networks can aid in identifying, delaying, and evicting unwanted guests, including insider threats (or vampires already amongst us). We will explore several deception use cases &nbsp;that can dramatically increase cyber resilience without attracting more attackers.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-wendt-deception-cyber-resilience"></a>

  <p>Mergers and acquisitions amongst large, globally-distributed organizations are notoriously complex, error-prone, and resource consuming. But did you know that merging smaller organizations comes with its own set of unique issues and risks? One year ago, Okta announced its acquisition of Auth0. Since then, the combined forces of their internal business systems teams have been working hard to bring the identity and compliance capabilities of the organizations together. The union of these two companies introduced some novel challenges- even for veteran practitioners with experience in IAM mergers at much larger organizations. In this talk Jon Lehtinen will take you on a guided tour of the Okta/Auth0 identity merger from a practitioner’s perspective, and share the learnings, the challenges, and the recommendations for other practitioners tasked with merging the IAM programs within smaller, high-growth companies.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-lehtinen-identity-m-and-a"></a>

  <p>Many companies are engaging in remote onboarding and need to adopt new methods of identity verification that can be done digitally. While new forms of ID verification are most prevalent today with Financial Services as a means of performing Know-Your-Customer regulations, there is nascent adoption across other industry verticals. In this session, the speakers will demonstrate an open standard based approach to ID verification based on verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers for remote onboarding across industries. With this new approach users can verify their identity once and use their credentials with any organization. Enterprises can leverage this simpler cost-saving approach to remotely onboard employees, partners and customers compliantly while respecting the end users’ privacy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-patel-remote-onboarding-verifiable-credentials"></a>

  <p>SSI and Verifiable Credentials are the latest development in identity management. They offer many benefits over existing federated identity management systems. Unfortunately some proponents of SSI are mandating that companies implement decentralised identifiers (DIDs) and blockchains in order to benefit from SSI. This is not necessary. In fact the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model Recommendation makes it clear that DIDs are not needed for verifiable credentials, and vice versa. DIDs and blockchains are something of a ball and chain around the legs of companies that want to benefit from SSI when leveraging their existing web based security infrastructures. This keynote talk will describe how it is possible to build standards compliant high performance, user friendly, SSI systems using the World Wide Web, Transport Layer Security, Jason Web Tokens, Web Authentication and X.509 public key certificates, allowing them to experience all the benefits of SSI without the ball and chain impediments of DIDs and blockchains. - the benefits of SSI over existing identity management systems - the downsides of DIDs and blockchains - the upsides of using existing World Wide Web infrastructure to build your SSI solution</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-chadwick-implementing-ssi"></a>

  <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) has reached the in-between stage: more than a concept, not yet fully deployed. This is where the work can get the most gruesome and exhausting, but also the most creative and rewarding. While the dedicated W3C standards are reaching maturity levels, we see regulators and government actors jump on board and asking for even more stability across specifications and standards in order to establish real world systems. In fact, we see large pilot projects and implementation programs worldwide. One promising but equally critical development is the eIDAS 2 regulation, &nbsp;promising dependable answers to questions about governance and trust frameworks that will drive adoption. This short deep dive will give you an orientation of the state of play for SSI in the context of these greater developments – and might provide an outlook for your projects as well.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-adamski-ssi-production"></a>

Of course, this raises the question of suitable methodologies and tools. At the same time, the strategic orientation of the company must be included in this security strategy. We have also learned in the recent past that attacks like the “Solarwinds Hack” are becoming more and more sophisticated and that the attackers now focus on the entire value chain. What tools are there, and where should they be used? How can I start tomorrow to prepare myself for the future against the challenges of cyber attacks?

  <p>Two decades of digital transformation and cloud migration have been slowly eroding the traditional network perimeter and with the past two years of transition to more remote work, the walls have come tumbling down. Privileged credentials from access tools (like VPN and RDP) that have been left on endpoints are a valuable target for attack. SAAS applications and Cloud access further expand the proliferation of potentially exposed identities. Once an attacker establishes initial access it becomes trivial for lateral attack movement to take control over critical systems or the entire network. The network perimeter is obsolete. Identity is the new perimeter. Organizations must discover, mitigate and protect their identity risks.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-halbartschlager-identity-perimeter"></a>

  <p>The third iteration of the Web, Web 3, aims to put more control over web content in users’ hands. It promises to be built on blockchain, eliminating all big intermediaries, including centralized governing bodies. The vision for a Web3 world is for people to control their own data and be able to bounce around from social media to email to shopping using a single personalized account, creating a public record on the blockchain of all of that activity. What does this mean from an identity management point of view? We will explore some important questions that should be addressed as the future of the internet unfolds, including the impact that limited oversight in crypto currency will have, including poor authentication; the role of decentralized identities and private key management; and finally, the privacy aspects of having transaction data on the blockchain and what that means for attackers that can potentially compile new identities or further identity theft as we know it today. Whether it is Web3 or beyond, these issues will be critical to build trust on the internet of the future.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-zelazny-identity-management-web-3"></a>

   Gaia-X Federation Services is a European project that promotes innovation through data sharing and represents the next generation of the data infrastructure ecosystem. To see how we bring about an open, transparent, and secure digital ecosystem, we thus share a practical example and working code of the Gaia-X for the Notarization API. 
 
 The aim of this product is to establish digital trust in disclosed data (paper or electronic) for Gaia-X participants to use in the Gaia-X ecosystem. To reach this goal, an issuance module to transform data into digital verifiable credential (VC) is needed. With this component, certification institutions such as government, lawyers, etc. are able to prove the identity and provide data of any organization that desires to be a Gaia-X participant. Thus deliver the desired verified attestation as a digital representation. 
 
 This use case on enterprise identity is an example of a contribution to the meta-platform concept: a platform that enables and fosters participant-controlled value transfer across and among other platforms and participants. An open, interoperable, portable, decentralized identity framework is thus a prime candidate for becoming such a meta-platform and for leveraging this aggregate network effect. 				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-stoecker-enterprise-identity-eu-gaia-x"></a>

  <p>David will talk aboout a new technology that allows the person owning a public key to prove that they have memorized a passphrase, from which they could at any time easily compute the private key.<br>One example use is for votexx.org elections, which are conducted remotely without polling places. The ballot-casting in such elections is done by a signature that is publicly verifiable as corresponding to a particular public key posted in advance by the election authority. The voter registration authority would require a proof that the voter knows the corresponding passphrase and hence ensures that the voter has irrevocable access to the private key corresponding to the posted public key. This lets the voter give all of their keys (in an extreme case) to a vote buyer and/or coercer – while the voter is never able to give up knowledge of the passphrase and the ability that it confers to secretly cancel any vote made with the corresponding private key. This is just one example David will feature in his presentation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-chaum-credentials-privacy"></a>

New technologies like Privacy-ABC based on ZKP were ready to provide the user with control over how much personal data he wants to disclose, while promising, commercial solutions were neither accepted by the market nor solving the problem of reliability of transactions exhaustively. Today, the new decentralized digital identity model of Self-Sovereign Identity, utilizing verifiable credentials and Decentralized Identifiers, is giving new hope of finding sustainable solutions. This session will map out the main questions around privacy within this context:</p>
 
 What are the privacy pros and cons of a blockchain-based identity management system based on an “European Digital Identity Wallet”? 
 What are key pain points of the emerging "European Autonomous Identity Framework" (ESSIF) compatibility with GDPR? Is there “enough privacy” in eIDAS 2.0? 
 How can one trust that the entity issuing the credentials is in fact the entity that it claims to be?

   The cyberssecurity approaches and strategies that works well for a multinational with a large and well funded cybersecurity department may not be as applicable for a mid sized company where the security department may be a single person. 
 
 Still if the partner company that delivers the cheese to a retailer falls to a cybersecurity attack there is simply no cheese to sell to the customers so the retailer not only looses money but also fails at their most basic task. So how do we as multinationals help our partners with implementing basic controls such as PAM in a way that works in their business reality? 
 
 In this session we will be looking at how you as a relatively cybersecurity mature company can do to help your less mature partners. It is also suitable for persons who has been asked to launch a cybersecurity or PAM program without been given the full resource to execute a full program. 				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-sandren-pam-for-the-people"></a>

  <p>&nbsp;As customer identity programs mature, they bring new opportunities and risks. In the rush to launch new customer experiences, personal data is over-exposed and over-replicated. The default is to ship all identity attributes, to all systems, on every request in order to make access decisioning easier for application developers.<br><br>This approach disperses identity information across the application stack; which increases risks of data breach, data loss, and compromised identities. As a result, consumers lose trust and new business opportunities falter; or worse, customers like the new experience, but its success creates security and compliance liabilities that expand exponentially. To remediate the risk, data teams enter a never-ending cycle of costly data analysis and audits.<br><br>Identity architects and developers need to address privacy requirements earlier - not in post-collection data management, but instead in the application development process. While Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default principles are a helpful framework, they offer little practical guidance for developers to actually build privacy-preserving applications.<br><br>We will discuss how to use identity data at run-time, in the context of the application; how to retrofit existing applications with privacy requirements; and how to easily evolve applications over time.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-upadhyaya-privacy-identity-aware"></a>

  <p>Many decentralized identity infrastructures and ecosystems around the world are emerging, but how can we get to true global interoperability, where my digital identity works seamlessly across borders and across different use cases?</p>
<p>Two of the most prominent initiatives in the digital identity space right now are 1. the digital Permanent Resident Card use case supported by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and 2. the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI) with its various pilot projects.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will look at the "Transatlantic SSI Interop" experiment conducted by an EU company (Danube Tech) and a US company (Digital Bazaar) that shows how such different initiatives can connect and interoperate.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-sabadello-transatlantic-ssi-interoperability"></a>

<p>In traditional banking, to get a loan, make a deposit or speak to a banker, customers have usually traveled to a physical branch.</p>
 
<p>But today, more banking services are available digitally. As a complement to existing online banking services, innovators are building the new and improved financial experiences that consumers are looking for. These innovators may not even have a brick-and-mortar presence, but they add multiple layers of value on top of existing financial services.</p>
 
<p>The digital movement is giving customers more tools and options to build their financial lives in the way they see fit, and Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) is making this possible. Customers can now turn to innovators who offer niche financial services that cater to their unique needs, creating new ways for them to split dinner bills, take out a microloan, invest in crypto, track spending, saving and more.</p>
 
<p>But creating a new fintech company, app or product has not been simple. The traditional path to creating financial services was a long, hard road, from getting a banking license to building a new tech stack. Synctera is one fintech that offers an easier on-ramp to new, innovative financial products through BaaS. BaaS platforms and technology solutions provide the building blocks necessary for a fintech or neobank to quickly start creating innovative financial use cases for the modern consumer.</p>
 
<p>Synctera acts as a fintech banking platform, connecting a fintech builder with a community bank that has the requisite banking license. On the development side, Synctera provides an end-to-end toolkit, offering the critical technology services and providers that help innovators build their ideas. This includes consumer-permissioned data for account verification through Mastercard’s open banking platform, to help bring financial service ideas like quick money movement to life.</p>
 Modularizing banking solutions 
<p>All the things an entrepreneur needs in order to offer a banking service—including the ability to accept deposits, make loans and payments — BaaS service providers like Synctera encapsulate into the application programming interface (API) as modular blocks, so a fintech can tap in and build new solutions. Whether it’s issuing cards, sending ACH payments or more basic financial operations, developers can take these blocks and reassemble them to meet their needs.</p>
 
<p>The key to building with a BaaS provider is having just one API that’s simple to connect to. This reduces architecture and modeling requirements on the fintech development side. These tools allow fintechs to set up new customer accounts without delays from microdeposits, using instant verification, enabling customers to connect their external accounts and transfer funds into new financial services faster.</p>
 
<p>Another advantage of BaaS: Since multiple solutions are offered in the same API, it’s easy to make changes. If a company that’s scaling up tries an account authentication solution that’s slow and not quickly verifying that customer accounts are funded, they can replace it seamlessly with an alternate solution. That means less disruption to operations; money can keep moving.</p>
 Offering a marketplace of options 
<p>BaaS wraps all of its services, including those developed in-house and those from outside developers, into one API marketplace to make it easy for fintechs to launch everything together. Instead of trying to integrate tech from multiple financial services partners, a fintech developer can come to a BaaS provider like Synctera and build more, with less overhead and less plumbing.</p>
 
<p>Working with a BaaS provider allows fintech builders to focus more on the features of the product they’re offering to customers, like offering a virtual storefront to artists, discounted pet insurance to pet owners or easier access to small business capital. The marketplace solution means a fintech could choose a waterfall approach; if one solution fails, the system can be set up to automatically try another one.</p>
 How Mastercard fits in 
<p>Consumer-permissioned financial data can also be piped into BaaS solutions. Mastercard’s open banking platform provides secure connections to consumer-permissioned financial data from 95% of bank deposit accounts in the U.S. This data can power use cases like credit decisioning, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/digital-account-opening-report/">account opening</a> and linking. It creates more choice in <a href="https://www.finicity.com/payment-open-banking-effect/">payments</a> and transaction data for better financial insights.</p>
 
<p>Every fintech product needs financial data, the ability to manage consumer permission and to access those accounts. It’s one thing to have a customer knock on your door. It’s another to help them walk through the door without unnecessary obstacles blocking their way, and to make the first deposit into their new accounts happen quickly and compliantly.</p>
 
<p>Mastercard’s open banking platform provides consumer-permissioned data to power the tools that Synctera and other BaaS providers and innovators create. By using account verification and transaction data from Mastercard’s open banking platform, all ecosystem players can authenticate users and get them online fast, and in a compliant manner.</p>
 Fraud detection and speed are of utmost importance 
<p>Understandably, the risk, compliance and customer experience balance is delicate–efficiency can’t compromise fraud prevention. By adding open banking data to the BaaS platform, financial service providers can verify and access bank account data with instant account verification, helping to ensure that the person opening a new account actually owns the account they are linking to the new fintech app, before moving money.</p>
 
<p>Speed is another top concern for fintech builders. And since banks are not tech companies, many operate on pre-internet tech. COBOL, a programming language developed in 1959 that underpins many banking systems, can make it difficult to upgrade systems quickly, or to seamlessly connect with today’s technology. This can result in a speed mismatch between banking networks and the world of fintechs, who want to be able to release new products and services in a few weeks. Mastercard helps connect customer accounts quickly and speeds up the customer onboarding process.</p>
 
<p>There’s a lot of new and improved technology being created in the world of financial services, and more options for developers result in more next-gen products that help consumers on their financial journeys.</p>

 Over the past few years we’ve seen the development and standardization of the concept of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>. Built on blockchain technology, decentralized identity provides a strong foundation for a much-improved privacy experience for a user – and it has been&nbsp;called the most important privacy innovation for the coming decade.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Anonyome Lab’s Sudo Platform provides enterprise developers with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;capability to use for their applications and users. The platform offers both client- and service-side capabilities.</p>



 



Sudo Platform identity components.



 



<p>You can see above some of the key areas of decentralized identity development within Anonyome Labs. On the left side, we have how a user can leverage decentralized identity capabilities within the context of their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo digital identities</a>. This extends&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>&nbsp;of digital interactions into decentralized identity-based interactions.</p>



 



 On the right of the diagram are the current areas of decentralized identity development within the Sudo Platform: 



<p></p>



  Identity Wallet&nbsp;– A user-controlled local data store that safeguards a Sudo’s decentralized identity identifier (DID), cryptographic keys, verifiable credentials, and other artifacts for use with issuers, verifiers, public ledgers, and other third parties. The wallet supports multiple devices, cloud backup and recovery.  



  Mobile Agent&nbsp;– Usually an app that lets users interact with the Identity Wallet, as well as enabling various external activities, such as interacting with any standards-based public ledger, streamlining the login process to accounts and services, providing end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer interaction, assisting users with the request and presentation of verifiable credentials, and more.  



  DI Relay&nbsp;– The DI Relay (i.e., decentralized identity relay)&nbsp;provides mobile agents with an&nbsp;always onconnection point that facilitates user-to-user and user-to-service communications. Without an always on relay, mobile agents wouldn’t be able to communicate reliably with each other.  



  Verifiable Credentials&nbsp;– The Sudo Platform issuer service&nbsp;can create verifiable credentials. The issuer service first registers a credential definition on the blockchain which references an existing schema as well as registers the issuer service’s DID and public key.&nbsp;<br><br>Using their mobile agent, a user can request a verifiable credential from the issuer service. The new credential will be securely transmitted to the user’s mobile agent, which will secure it in the user’s identity wallet.<br><br>Additionally, via their mobile agents, users can present their verifiable credentials to a verifier, including the Sudo Platform’s verifier service. The user will be prompted to approve (or deny) presenting all of the requested verifiable credential claims, just some claims, or may even elect to only provide zero knowledge proof.<br><br>  Encrypted Messaging (end-to-end)&nbsp;– Whether used for user-to-user, user-to-service, or service-to-service communication, messages are encrypted end-to-end using peer-to-peer connections secured using the DIDComm protocol.  



 



<p>Next week, in part 4, we’ll outline the benefits to enterprises from proactively adopting decentralized identity.</p>

 A deep dive into the current state of crypto regulation, the FATF Travel Rule, and how our recently-launched solution, Veriscope, has solved the unsolvable: the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue. <p>On May 4th at 11:00 am EST, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> launched the debut edition of the Unhosted Webinar Series, with 80 attendees joining. It was presented by Shyft Network and <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope’s </a>Head of Strategy for Global Regulatory and Compliance Solutions, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/bitmex-compliance-chief-malcolm-wright-jumps-to-shyft-network/">Malcolm&nbsp;Wright</a>.</p><p>The webinar’s theme was the current state of crypto regulation, the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf">FATF Travel Rule</a>, and how Shyft Network’s recently-launched solution, Veriscope, has solved the unsolvable: the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue.</p><p>We’ve also done a short re-cap of the key themes and challenges discussed in the&nbsp;Webinar:</p> FATF Recommendations on Virtual&nbsp;Assets <p>Financial Action Task Force, the global anti money-laundering &amp; terrorism financing watchdog, has made recommendations to prevent the use of virtual assets in illicit activities. Countries are required to adopt these recommendations within a definite period of time, which will then become a guideline for the industry to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>After countries implement FATF recommendations, the global watchdog will make periodic assessments on the implementation of the guidelines. Countries that fail to receive satisfactory scores on various parameters can be penalized by FATF, which can affect their financial standing globally and impact their ability to obtain funding from external sources, such as the World Bank and the&nbsp;IMF.</p> The Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The Travel Rule is the most crucial recommendation on virtual assets issued, to date, by FATF. It was adopted in June 2019 when FATF issued draft guidelines. Then, during the first (June 2020) &amp; second (June 2021) assessments, FATF found that countries and industries are still not following its recommendations. Then, in October 2021, FATF issued its final guidelines on virtual assets &amp; Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).</p><blockquote>Under the Travel Rule, both originator and beneficiary VASPs must store and exchange certain personally identifiable information, such as the customer’s name, wallet address, location, national ID number, and DOB. They must also present the information to authorities when requested.</blockquote> Risk of Sanctions <p>Although Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and blockchain analytics are among the must-have tools that VASPs should have to ensure sanctioned parties cannot find a way around sanctions through virtual assets, they aren’t enough to mitigate the sanctions risk.</p><p>To fully comply with the FATF recommendations, it is crucial to know both parties involved in the transaction, which requires the implementation of the Travel Rule. Failing to comply with FATF recommendations can result in sanctions from authorities, which can yield devastating results.</p><p>To mitigate the risks, ensure GeoIP monitoring, proper KYC with name screening, implement blockchain analytics, and Travel Rule. Following these steps enables businesses with a significant amount of business volume outside their jurisdiction to have a solid defense against any potential sanction violation.</p> The Challenges  1. Poor Data&nbsp;Accuracy <p>Receiving incomplete or inaccurate data from the originator or beneficiary VASPs can result in significant challenges, such as increased customer support &amp; compliance costs, failed payments, and poor customer experience.</p><blockquote>Shyft Network’s Veriscope has implemented automated discovery of counterparty VASP through the token’s address to solve this problem. Also, Veriscope has automated exchange of personally identifiable information (PII) of both originator and beneficiary to ensure 100% accuracy.</blockquote> 2. Data&nbsp;Security <p>Storing PII on Travel Rule Service Provider’s (TRSP) infrastructure can result in internal and external hacking attacks, intermediaries meddling in and snooping on the data, and malicious actors exploiting the entire process to obtain counterparty PII by submitting fake transactions. There are also challenges to storing PII without user&nbsp;consent.</p><blockquote>The solution? Veriscope. It offers data security through three measures.</blockquote><blockquote>(i) User consents every time before PII is&nbsp;shared.</blockquote><blockquote>(ii) PII is encrypted and off-chain to prevent malicious actors from accessing the user&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>(iii) The transmission of PII data between VASPs is through peer-to-peer mode only, which means Shyft Network does not handle PII at any point in&nbsp;time.</blockquote> 3. Know Your VASP&nbsp;(KYV) <p>Opting for just any average TRSP comes with a fair share of challenges. First, all data that a VASP relies on is collected by the TRSP; with such TRSPs, there is no option to choose a counterparty VASP. Then, there is the issue of inaccurate VASP discovery, as it may fail to capture granular data at the entity&nbsp;level.</p><blockquote>Veriscope’s design mechanism enables it to solve these complex problems swiftly. It ensures that PII data is sent to the correct VASP entity and that the network participants have undergone due diligence at internationally recognized standards. It is also highly scalable and can easily accommodate the growing needs of both legal and operational teams.</blockquote> 4. Payment Screening <p>The usual approach to obtaining beneficiary data is to collect the information from the originator. There are several issues with this approach. For instance, such data can be incomplete or inaccurate, further complicating screening efforts. It can even lead to higher exposure to sanctions risk.</p><blockquote>Veriscope has implemented a mechanism that mandates obtaining beneficiary data from the beneficiary VASP. Shyft Network’s approach ensures that the data is accurate and complete, resulting in efficient name screening. That’s not all, as it also enables VASPs to request any additional information through the RFFI&nbsp;process.</blockquote> Sunrise Problem: A Major Roadblock in Implementing the Travel Rule&nbsp;(Recap) <p>The most significant problem that VASPs face in implementing Travel Rule is the Sunrise issue. The problem is that countries have adopted or will adopt the Travel Rule into local regulations at different times. Thus, most VASPs located in jurisdictions that have not yet adopted the Travel Rule are unlikely to have a Travel Rule Solution and will issues for those VASPs who do have a Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>Recent data suggests there are over 600 cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Depending on their jurisdiction, they may or may not have adopted the Travel Rule yet. That’s where the problem lies, as the countries that have adopted the Travel Rule may mandate compliance both domestically and internationally. So, a compliant VASP must obtain data from the counterparty VASP regardless of their compliance status. If the compliant VASP fails to comply with the rule, they may receive severe penalties.</p><p>Suppose a VASP based in a country that has adopted the FATF Travel Rule (VASP A) sends Requests for Information (RFI) to a VASP operating in a country yet to adopt the Travel Rule (VASP B) on day zero (April 1st, 2022). They may or may not provide the information. After all, they are not legally obligated to do so yet. But VASP B will want to respond after the country they are based in implements the regulations. Meanwhile, without the necessary information, how can VASP A be compliant? This problem is referred to as the sunrise&nbsp;problem.</p><p>So, what’s the solution here? Veriscope. Thanks to Veriscope’s Historic Look Back feature, whenever VASP B’s home country adopts the Travel Rule, they can sign up for the solution and access all the RFIs sent to them even before they were legally required to comply with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Let’s say the VASP B joins six months after day zero (October 1st, 2022). They will see all the RFIs when they join and can respond to all of them. So, VASP A &amp; VASP B finally successfully exchanged the information required under the Travel Rule because of Shyft’s Veriscope.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner. Shyft Network allows and gives incentives to individuals and enterprises to work together to add context to data, unlocking the ability to build authentic digital reputation, identity, and credibility frameworks.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Website</a> / <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/">Medium</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/z65MC5JkrG">Discord</a></p>

 From Start-up to Scale-Up: How Tokeny Prepared for Large-Scale Tokenization 
<p>Our solutions now become more scalable and flexible as we have our own indexer and nodes to interact with relevant data on the blockchain. This improvement eliminates any downtime for our services and enlarges our capacity to handle thousands of tokens in parallel.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the Product Focus newsletter April &amp; May 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Scalability is one of our top priorities as we are working with large financial institutions with very high volumes anticipated. We regularly run intense scalability tests and a few months ago, we concluded that we should reduce our dependence on some third parties to provide faster and enterprise-grade solutions. This newsletter explains how we became more autonomous and scalable by running our own blockchain Indexer and nodes:</p>
 Blockchain data Indexer 
<p>In order to build the real-time cap table of token holders with fully accurate information, our <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> needs to&nbsp;scan and read the&nbsp;blockchain to index relevant transactions&nbsp;happening to the ERC-3643 tokens and ONCHAINIDs. Technically, it can be very challenging for complex operations, and tools like The Graph, the “Google for blockchains”, enables developers like us to tackle these issues.</p>
<p>However, in our testing, we encountered some upcoming limitations as the use of these third party tools and protocols can be slow and requires some manual procedures. Therefore,&nbsp;we decided to build our own Indexer technology, enabling automated token indexing that can be completed within minutes, without any downtime, for thousands of tokens in parallel.</p>
<p>Also, we realized that many Web3 applications were having trouble interacting with blockchain through third-party services,&nbsp; so we decided to improve this as well:</p>
 Blockchain connector (Remote Procedure Call)&nbsp; 
<p>A RPC is a set of protocols and interfaces that enables a software to&nbsp;interact with the blockchain, to read and write, similar to a website interacting with a server. In blockchain terms, a server is referred to as a node, a synced database of the blockchain. Most applications use Infura to do so; it provides RPCs and AWS-like services for nodes, so developers don’t need to build a RPC or manage their own nodes.</p>
<p>Due to Infura’s popularity, blockchain applications become less decentralized and it could become a single point of failure, such as the time it went down because of a service outage one week ago, causing many dApps, including MetaMask, to not function.</p>
<p>It became obvious to us that we had to run our own nodes and build our own RPC to provide better services for our customers. As a result, we have built a system that we can monitor, scale, and rapidly fix if needed.&nbsp;We even enabled switchable RPCs to keep the T-REX Platforms always available by monitoring the state of nodes to connect with functional nodes including our own nodes and third party nodes (e.g. Infura, Alchemy, …).</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>We are proud of our tech team, especially our DevOps Engineer Cyrille, Lead Core Developer José and Senior Full Stack Developer Mihalis, for their hard work to complete these improvements. We will continue pushing the limit to provide the most advanced, flexible and secure solutions for you.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: You might have heard of eIDAS before, especially if you are in the payment industry. But now in the recent years, the European Commission is working on a new version, eIDAS 2.0. We’re going to talk about that and especially from the perspective of Finland. We have a special guest who has been working in Finland. And our special guest today is Bo Harald.</p>
<p>He started his career in banking in the 1970s by promoting and building electronic banking, payments, and e-business services. He developed Nordea’s Electronic Banking and payments operation for 30 years, after which he started working with TietoEvry as the Head of Executive Advisors.</p>
<p>He has also served as the Chairman of the EU Expert Group on Electronic Invoicing, the Chairman of Mobey, Mobile Financial Services Forum, and has held and holds directorships in various companies and associations. He has been named as one of the most influential technologists of the 20th century by Institutional Investor, and has been awarded for advancing the Information Society by the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications.</p>
<p>Bo currently works as an independent advisor at Findy.fi, a Senior Advisor at the Finnish Council of Regulatory Impact Analysis, a Founder and Steering Committee member at MyData.org, and with the publicly funded, Real Time Economy programme.</p>
<p>Hello, Bo.</p>
<p>Bo Harald: Hello, and thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure, Bo. Thanks for joining us. And definitely, I want to hear all these very interesting things about eIDAS 2.0. So let’s start, let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. We’d like to hear from your very extensive and varied background in banking and technology. Please tell us a bit more about your career journey – how everything until today working in the Finnish eIDAS 2.0 workgroups.</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah, it’s a long ladder, and I want to call it a ladder. It started back in the late ’70s, when we developed the first versions of home banking, the PC banking in the very early 1980s for private customers at Union Bank of Finland, and nowadays Nordea. And also for SMEs long before internet. And the first step was obviously with payments, invoice payments, typically, bill payments. And then we moved on to put all banking services actually into e-banking before internet already. And so that was the first phase.</p>
<p>The second phase was about interconnecting bank customers, not only with payments, but also with e-identification, e-signatures, e-invoice and e-salary, for example. This was a very important step when you look at the benefits for society at large, you get the economy of trust the economic reuse, the economic repetition, the economy of scale, and all that.</p>
<p>And from here, when internet then came in the mid ’90s, we had already half a million people on e-banking in Finland. And we were the biggest bank in e-banking in the world, in absolute terms for many, many years, all the way to Nordea.</p>
<p>So from here, we established then the public-private real time economic programme, focusing very much on e-invoicing, accounting automation, real time income register for the tax authorities. And that’s what I tried to also promote when I was the Chairman for the EU Commission Expert Group.</p>
<p>The next phase, if I condense this ladder, was the MyData principles that started to grow out in 2016, putting the citizen in control of all of his or her data, naturally supported by the legal promise from GDPR in Europe. But we could see at that early stage that there was no practical way of getting this data to travel from the enterprises that had the legal obligation to send it and that’s where we started to look for a new solution in 2017 and ’18.</p>
<p>And there we could see that Self-Sovereign Identity and Trust over IP was the solution to go forward with. And we established this public-private Findy cooperative as the solution. And it was a real eye-opener and this is soon coming to eIDAS to see that we were able to solve the pressing need for being able to trade and issue non listed, unlisted shares.</p>
<p>And there you have this pretty tricky situation that you need to serve private shareholders, organisational shareholders, the issuer, the state, the trade registry, the banks, for payments, for trading, for settlement, for delivery, for keeping up the registers. But when you issued all of these parties, with the same generic wallets or fact wallets, we prefer to call them fact wallets – identity wallets is the other name for it. Then it was astonishingly easy to interconnect these parties – four coders, four months, and it worked like a dream.</p>
<p>So that’s when I got the eyes open for the eIDAS architecture needs. That’s the ladder. And actually, the ladder is important to understand that you should have all the ranks or the steps on it, you know, enabled to rise to the higher platforms in between. That was the path, my path.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, very, of course, been long, long journey and super interesting all the type of projects you have been involved. And now, you are working very heavily on eIDAS, especially this new version 2.0. If you can tell us about that but also tell us for the ones who are not so familiar, what is eIDAS? And then tell us the difference between the current eIDAS 1.0 and the new one, eIDAS 2.0.</p>
<p>Bo: Yes, eIDAS 1.0 and eIDAS 2.0 are two entirely different things. eIDAS 1.0 failed. It was focusing on cross-border identification services with pretty stiff requirements. And there were two things missing that led to the failure – supply and demand. There is such a limited need for identifying citizens, organisations, cross-border. And in the Nordic countries, we already have extremely well-functioning identification services in place, mainly run by the banks in Finland, also teleoperators are involved, I think that may be the only country in the world where teleoperators are doing this as well. It’s good with competition.</p>
<p>But when you talk about eIDAS 2.0, it’s not a question of identification, it’s a question of identity. And that’s a totally different thing. You could say that the identity is built from credentials from all sorts of sources in the private sector, in the public sector, statements about your knowledge, your skills, your vaccinations, where you live. We’re disclosing as little as possible, thousands of different statements that build a person’s identity all the way to – you might call it a “digital twin”.</p>
<p>And, here, obviously, eIDAS 2.0 is promising that every European will get a wallet issued by qualified issuers, possibly also by the states, if needed. And these wallets are then the ones where you will get these credentials, statements, the verified data about you when you need it.</p>
<p>So that’s a big difference between eIDAS 1.0 and eIDAS 2.0. And obviously eIDAS 2.0 is an absolutely enormous opportunity for the economy at large on the one hand, and for building a real single digital market on the other hand.</p>
<p>Oscar: As you have mentioned wallets, earlier you mentioned fact wallets or identity wallets, does it already exist? Just to understand that concept better, could you describe how it would be in practice? Is there anything like that today so we can have an idea?</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah. There are already wallets out there, pretty many, many versions of them actually. Obviously, Europe is working on trying to establish what kind of standards such a wallet should have, be it then an application in your mobile phone, which seems to be very much in focus now, mainly serving citizens, also, perhaps smaller enterprises.</p>
<p>But obviously, these kinds of applications or wallets, ID wallets or rather fact wallets, are also needed by larger organisations. And then the mobile application is not the solution, but an application, a computer or in the cloud. But obviously, all these wallets, be they then in a mobile or in a computer or in the cloud, should be interoperable by design. That’s the whole idea here.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Yeah, understanding now the, what is this new concept of eIDAS 2.0 based on identities that you say in wallets, tell us more about the opportunities that this new framework is going to provide for the future across Europe.</p>
<p>Bo: Yes, I’m very happy to see that the commission work is really embracing Self-Sovereign Identity, which is obviously the standard, and I can’t see any alternative to that. And in many, many countries already Trust Over IP stacks are the starting point like they are here in Finland, and have been already for five years.</p>
<p>And here, what will happen is that the data rights holder, you as a citizen, or you as working for a company, you are in the driver’s seat. You can go to a data source, public or private, and say, that now I have a life event of this sort, looking for a job, establishing a company, somebody has died in the near family, which is the most stressful life event, and thousands of other life events, and now I need the data from all of these, all relevant sources. And I have a wallet, and the wallet is helping me to find those sources. And then I get the data to my wallet. And then I go to a service provider of my choice, I have this data and you are specialising in this particular life event. If I need financing, it may be a bank. And could you please take care of the need.</p>
<p>And the beauty of this is these three parties, the data rights holder with the wallet, the source and the service provider do not need to be technically integrated, do not need to be technically integrated. Because in this infrastructure, the technical connection is handled in the infrastructure, which is very cheap to build, of course, it needs rulebooks. And that’s the whole beauty of it.</p>
<p>Obviously, this infrastructure, we call it the data highway here in Finland is used both by the public sector and the private sector. That’s a no brainer, like a road is open to everyone to use. And it should obviously be a non-profit organisation that handles this. That’s why we have established this in the cooperatives to do that. So that’s how it works. And it’s not that difficult to understand, actually.</p>
<p>The benefits of Self-Sovereign Identity are absolutely enormous to reducing risk and friction in the economy at large. It’s of course, improving automation. It’s protecting privacy like nothing we have seen before. It’s preventing crime and grey economy. And this book that I mentioned to you, Self-Sovereign Identity by Drummond Reed, is quoting sources saying that the cost of cybercrime is something in the region of $6 trillion. So that’s a kind of a big picture. McKinsey for its part estimates the benefits of the trust infrastructure to be 3% to 6% of GDP, depending on the maturity of a country.</p>
<p>So this is an absolutely massive step forward. Some people say that this is more important than Internet, I agree. And some people say that the fact wallet is at least as important as the internet browser was when internet started. So you can see that this is something that every state, every government should actually do everything they can, and obviously, European Union to happen as fast as possible. We have no time to lose in this world. But they cannot do it on their own. And they are– the clever governments understand that they have to do this hand-in-hand with the Self-Sovereign Identity experts and the enterprises that are working in that field, and that’s the way it works in Finland.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely the way you say it sounds like there are definitely plenty of benefits. And yeah, we hope to see these benefits in the near future definitely.</p>
<p>Bo: Oh, I mean, it’s a kind of a responsibility of any government that are looking for reducing crime and improving privacy and above all, naturally, getting the productivity in place and the benefits of data according to the MyData principles. And this is the really only practical way I can see that they could implement the MyData principles, protecting people’s data. I’ve seen during 40 years of digital work, I’ve seen a lot of important things, but this is the biggest by far.</p>
<p>And if you want to go into the wallets, which will get a lot of so-called credentials or statements, verify data, the e-receipt is something of the highest volume. And even the lines in the e-receipts, if you look at the number of lines in e-receipts and e-invoices in Finland, and both of them will in a couple of years’ time be the only kind accepted legally. In accounting, there are some 20 billion of them every year and these can– each line can be verified on its own. So it will be by far the biggest volume of credentials sitting delivered from the seller’s wallet to the buyer’s wallet, be the buyer or seller private or an organisation.</p>
<p>And the reuse of this e-receipt is a fantastic opportunity. We all know what travel expense means for all of us. We know how difficult it is to get financing in enterprises, and you have an invoice there, verified by the buyer, it’s so much easier for insurance companies. In Finland only there is a calculation saying that about 100 million can be saved when e-receipts are actually available. And obviously the insurance fraud is a big issue in any country. That’s just one example. But there are any number of them that– what is the– when you get a verified data statement, a credential that can be used in so many different places.</p>
<p>Oscar: So the e-receipts is also part of eIDAS 2.0?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, it’s not directly but I mean, when you have eIDAS 2.0 in the right way. And I’m a little bit worried, I have to admit, about the Commission’s, let’s say, level of understanding of the importance of this 3% to 6% of GDP. They are focusing, in my opinion, too much on the private wallets and not enough on the enterprise wallets, to get the real benefit. If you focus only on private wallets, and for example, then government-issued credentials, then you get to a point 0% or 0.1% perhaps of the benefits. But when you have a full picture then you can get 90% of the enormous, enormous benefits.</p>
<p>That’s why I wrote this <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/22017/open-letter-to-the-eu-commission">open letter</a>, which can be found in my LinkedIn account. Also, if somebody’s interested to the Commission, but we should understand how big this step can be if it’s done correctly, and not only looking at some sort of additional identification tool and only government-issued credentials.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, we’re going to add this, I read your open letter to EU Commission. So yeah, we’re going to add it also to the show notes of this episode so people can read it, definitely. How can we centre the users’ needs while at the same time balancing organisational priorities in any new solution?</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah, this is a very good question and an important question, and I don’t have all of the answers here. But I have some basic answers based on my experience from banking, and so forth. I think that the, the mission and the– must always be the passion in any organisation that wants to be successful is to think hard about what the customers need tomorrow. And it’s a familiar phrase is that you should never ask the customer what he needs, because he doesn’t know, you should know before he does.</p>
<p>And in this particular time now, I think it’s time to start all the service design from the customer’s life events. Both data is needed for this live event and where does it sit? How can the data be verified and available in real time? The value of data arriving one second faster is quite different from the one that comes later. And it’s then in this particular setting, natural for many, many organisations to issue these wallets, be they in a mobile phone or in a computer. And also then include the National ID, invite the government to make the root idea, the electronic ID card into these wallets, so that it can be used for opening bank accounts and whatnot, where this is always needed according to the law, at least in the Nordics, but also other credentials from the public sector.</p>
<p>Then you can produce fantastic value for the customers, be they private customers or for SMEs who are going to take and actually charge. So that you [indiscernible] and the costs are not big, that is the fantastic feature here with open source technology and open data and open standards. So, I see that the solution will be that the role of public and private sector organisations will be, and is already, in GDPR supply data, but it should be verified data. The value of verified data is a thousand times more than just generic data. Also for machine learning and artificial intelligence, to supply that data to citizens and SME fact wallets and these are generic tools, generic tools, standardised interfaces all over the place.</p>
<p>The data rights holder as I said before here, then herself decides which service provider is best suited to use the data, to solve the need. And then in an ideal world, the public sector would not need to act as a service provider at all. They can let the enterprises do that on their own, and that will save a lot of taxpayers’ money. But of course, we have to see to it that there are no walled gardens built, that data is flowing freely, that you can always change your service provider without any lock ins, and that the competition is serving us all.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be that difficult because the whole Self-Sovereign Identity is built on open standards and no wall gardens and no technology and no– it’s a kind of religion in that so that’s why I feel so comfortable in promoting it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Now with your experience working in Finland in banking and several other projects until now, how can Europe – and even if we see it globally with initiatives like GAIN, the Global Assure Identity Network – how these can learn from the experiences in Finland and in the Nordics in general?</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah, I have to admit that I have failed miserably in one aspect. This e-identification services that GAIN is now looking at was started back in I think ’93 in Finland. And we have then taken it from here to the other Nordic countries so that the banks are actually the suppliers to the identification services. And I have been preaching this in conferences all over the world all the time, since then, and I have written any number of blogs, in the <a href="https://www.finextra.com/latest-blogs?memberid=43145">Finextra blog posts</a>, you can you can find it on frequently. That banks should be doing this and not only by their own will but should actually be forced into this kind of service by the government. Because they are so suited, because they are trusted, trusted institutions and the economic trust is immensely important and they are legislated into it because of the anti-money laundering legislation and all that.</p>
<p>And now GAIN is looking at it and unfortunately, it is very late. And now with the wallets, you don’t need it in the same time as– in the same way as you would have done it if you had started 20 years ago, 25 years ago as we did. But I didn’t get in my way, there has been so many different crises in banking that has taken away the attention. A little bit the same has happened also in electronic invoicing, banks woke up a little bit late. I can only look myself in the mirror.</p>
<p>But the lessons learned in Finland was that the economy of reuse and the economy of trust, using bank ID for identifying in all kinds of services was really, really important. It became a generic tool, both in your private role and in your work roles. And now, when you have this in overflow of everything – I mean, the attention span is– if it is eight seconds, still, it’s good. I mean, the goldfish has nine seconds. And everything else is overflowing except time and the value of something that you know already and trust is growing exponentially.</p>
<p>But now, I jump from there to the wallets, a generic wallet that you can use at home and at work supported by a generic public-private joint infrastructure is, of course, even more valuable, many times more valuable than the e-identification services provided by the banks. And this is something that not only the banking sector should be providing but many other sectors as well and everyone should naturally use it. So we have to live with the times and realise that people don’t have time to learn anything new if it can be avoided.</p>
<p>Oscar: Now, seeing the evolution because eIDAS 2.0 as I understand is still being cooked, let’s say, so it’s not completely finished. So how, let’s say smaller EU countries, and even individuals, who are really concerned about this or how is it going to be the standard and the standard coming can have more power to influence the commission decisions that is going to affect so many residents?</p>
<p>Bo: And this is a very critical question, an important question. And to get anything done now, the first thing to say is that even if you have the best public servants in the world, they are not Self-Sovereign Identity experts. Even if the European Commission has said that the Self-Sovereign Identity is at the core of eIDAS, they haven’t yet understood– had time to understood the full picture perhaps.</p>
<p>The remedy is that EU and any country, sit down with the public sector and say that OK, you government, you have realised that you can have 3% to 6% GDP benefits out of this Trust Infrastructure. And you do understand that your lawyers and economists and whatnot, they are not experts in building this radically new infrastructure. You have to do it together, in this public-private team, formulate the narrative. And some basic use cases like the receipts, or whatnot, so that the citizens will actually start asking for it, demanding it from their own government. That’s what you need.</p>
<p>And from Brussels, because we do understand that the Europe is the biggest economy in the world and if it becomes one single market, the benefit for everyone will be absolutely massive. And this is real – this trust infrastructure is a bigger step than Internet. And the fact wallet is the new browser. So we have to get people to understand how big this is.</p>
<p>And then the countries, once you have done it in your home country, then you join forces with others, like we now do with Sweden, Norway, and Germany, Holland, and so forth, and influence Brussels so that it is not overregulated, which will make it too expensive for small players, and actually just help large organisations to protect their positions. They have money enough to do this, even if it’s very regulated. So it’s important to see to it that the competition from the smaller guys is possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: So yeah, it’s important to, as you say, join forces, right, with the countries that have already– countries and organisations that are already active in… yeah, quite knowledgeable and active today.</p>
<p>Bo: Exactly. And that’s what they are doing now. Very happy to see that our neighbour Sweden has been quite keen to work together with the other countries also.</p>
<p>Oscar: And when is it expected to be ready, eIDAS 2.0?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, we’ve had a very tight timetable when it was launched. And we were of course quite happy about that last summer, it was announced and this was exactly what we had been hoping for, and even more. So that was good. But then it has now taken a lot of time and gone into overregulation aspects, which we fear and not enough understanding for the need for organisational wallets and of course or for wallets for things and bets and whatnot to get the full benefit.</p>
<p>So I’m, let’s say, prepared to wait half a year more if these aspects get into the drawings so that you can get the benefits out of it. The economic benefits and privacy benefits and single market benefits. So we must work hard to avoid, let’s say, minimal mobile application for citizens only. I don’t know how long it will take but probably not much will be seen how in way of use cases this year, next year should be a breakthrough year.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. In 2023, we’ll see some of the fruits at least will be available for people to use and as you say organisations as well, all together.</p>
<p>Bo: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla Excellent. Final question for you, Bo. For all business leaders listening to us now what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, this is of course a very challenging question. But if I choose from a long list of experiences from the past in electronic banking, electronic invoicing, e-identification services and all and how they come together and form the ladder. And when this ladder was– when they started to raise this ladder, we were happy enough to have hundreds and hundreds of bank branches that could do the selling on a personal basis to the individuals. Now, we are not really that many bank branches left anymore so it’s a new, it’s a new game, you have to do it without much personal selling.</p>
<p>So my simple line would be to say that, for God’s sake, do not serve your customer, to have a life event, with the fact wallets for all needed verified data into the wallet, and you have to do it closely together with the public sector. And they should also help with the financing because so much of the benefits will be for the society at large and only a small part for the enterprises and such. But this is the joint effort, the biggest one I’ve seen ever.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, thank you very much, Bo, for this very interesting conversation and shedding light about eIDAS 2.0 and everything that is, yeah, behind that. I definitely learned a lot from this conversation. I’m sure our audience had fun and also super interesting. If someone would like to hear more about you, or get in touch with you, or follow you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, I have such an unusual name so it’s easy to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bo-harald-4768b51/">find me on LinkedIn</a> and please feel free to contact me. I have <a href="https://www.finextra.com/latest-blogs?memberid=43145">written blogs for at least 10 years on Finextra</a>. So there, most of the material that I have myself produced can be found there in a fairly condensed form, not too long texts. So please feel free to use as much as you like.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, perfect. Again, thanks a lot, Bo, for this conversation and all the best.</p>
<p>Bo: Thank you very much.</p>

				 Internet Identity Workshop IIWXXXIV <p>The 34th Internet Identity Workshop in Mountain View, California was a major success. Our Trinsic team, sporting our Trinsic-blue Vans, gathered with hundreds of other buzzing minds to discuss the disruptive technologies and principles that are shaping the internet movements around us. The conference covered a wide array of topics with over 80 sessions held in the span of a few days. While we can’t begin to do a comprehensive overview of all of IIW, below are some key insights our team gained from this latest IIW.</p> &nbsp;  Building in Under 30 Minutes <p>IIW is the perfect staging ground for testing out ideas and experimenting with emerging technology. Keeping in tradition with other IIW conferences, our Trinsic team talked with new innovators this spring about building an SSI proof of concept in under 30 minutes. This year’s group taught us the following in regards to building and testing SSI proof of concepts:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  You truly can build a proof of concept in under an hour. The feasibility of building and testing a concept is not only thrilling but it also means we can make advancements in digital identity quicker. If testing is easier, more ideas can be brought to light which enables us to sift through and make headway in building better identity products for everyone. If you’re someone with an idea but have been hesitant about where to begin building and testing, <a href="https://trinsic.notion.site/Build-an-SSI-Proof-of-Concept-dae9d6e565eb4770be41b61d55e090cb">this is an excellent place to begin working within minutes</a>.  We build better products when we openly collaborate with each other. If you’re looking to build a new ecosystem, seek feedback from community members who have been through the process or are building a product that could complement yours. At the end of the day, we’ll only be successful if all our identity products are interoperable. Yet that won’t ever happen if we aren’t talking with one another and following the same standards. <a href="https://slackcommunity.com/">Trinsic’s developer slack community</a> is a great place to start meeting and speaking with fellow builders.  The best SSI proof of concepts are built by teams with great chemistry. We’ve worked with a lot of companies, and those that are the most successful are successful because of their team. Having the right resources in terms of talent often outweighs the importance of other capital resources. This spring’s IIW conference showcased a growing community of talented companies, with a rapidly growing need to hire. It seems we’re all hiring, which means we can each expect to put a lot more effort into attracting top talent.   &nbsp;  The Catch-22 of Interoperability <p>Verifiable credentials and adoption were among the hottest topics of IIW. The unique value of a verifiable credential is the fact that it is an interoperable standard–that is, one credential can be accepted and verified across multiple institutions. However, the value of a standard is less obvious before being widely adopted. Thus, we find ourselves with a chicken-and-egg problem: how do we get people to use verifiable credentials while the main value is the fact that other people are using the standard? The key is to focus on solving business problems today for a single ecosystem. That’s why Trinsic created Trinsic Ecosystems, a product focused on enabling adoption among issuers and verifiers. If you’re building an SSI ecosystem, reach out for a demo.</p> &nbsp;  Decentralized Identity Has Great People <p>IIW once more established that this industry has some of the best people.
