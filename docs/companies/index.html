<p><a href="https://oosto.com/">Oosto</a> is making the case for surveillance technology in commercial settings. The facial recognition specialist argued that the technology can <a href="https://oosto.com/video-surveillance-to-mitigate-risk/">help mitigate risk</a> in a number of different ways, from both a security and human safety perspective.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, Oosto noted that modern surveillance cameras are far more intelligent than their predecessors, and support the use of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/amr-predicts-surveillance-tech-will-drive-24-34-billion-video-analytics-market-012706/">video analytics technology</a> that can process footage far more quickly than a human agent. That software can be trained to recognize individual people, or to watch for certain events or activities.</p>



<p>Identification software is useful because it allows a business to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/anyvision-explains-how-facial-recognition-can-help-improve-casino-operations-101501/">track people of interest</a> in real time, whether they are known criminals or VIPs that are supposed to be getting priority service. In either case, venue operators will receive an alert, and can then use that information to respond more quickly. For example, shoplifters can be removed from the premises before they have an opportunity to steal something from the retail floor.</p>



<p><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/oosto-strengthens-mask-detection-surveillance-capabilities-vision-ai-platform-110401/">Oosto’s platform</a> can do that while still protecting the identities of innocent bystanders. The solution has a feature that will automatically blur the faces of anyone who is not of interest, and ensures that those individuals are not added to a larger corporate database. As a result, organizations can target bad actors <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/anyvision-drafts-template-help-nyc-businesses-comply-with-new-privacy-law-082703/">while still complying</a> with any <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/oosto-calls-for-national-ethical-guidelines-for-biometric-tech-501191/">privacy, consent, and data collection regulations</a> that may be in effect.</p>



<p>Surveillance can also help improve general workplace safety. The technology can monitor equipment to make sure that it is working properly, or warn administrators about any debris or other obstacles that might be cluttering a warehouse floor. Staff can then step in to clean up the mess before someone gets hurt.</p>



<p>Behavioral analysis, meanwhile, allows employees to respond more quickly if an adverse event does occur. Event detection software can send a notification when someone is drowning or when they slip and fall, ensuring that they receive emergency attention in a timely fashion.</p>



<p>Finally, Oosto noted that its technology can dramatically speed up forensic investigations. That includes active criminal investigations, and internal investigations in which an organization is simply trying to figure out what happened within its own facilities.</p>

 <a href="https://cvent.me/44D7Gw?RefId=np"></a><a href="https://cvent.me/44D7Gw?RefId=np">Learn more about biometrics and blockchain at our upcoming virtual event.</a> 



<p><a href="https://humanode.io/">Humanode</a>, the startup behind an eponymous blockchain platform based on ‘proof of existence’ staking, has closed a $2 million seed funding round led by Republic Capital.</p>



<p>The project first came to light last summer, when it was revealed that <a href="https://www.facetec.com/">FaceTec</a>, one of the biggest names in face-based identity verification, would <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/trailblazing-blockchain-project-looks-facetec-key-proof-existence-tech-081001/">play a critical role</a> in the unique blockchain platform. </p>



<p>Because blockchain platforms are essentially decentralized databases of information, they are supported by numerous nodes, each of which contains a copy of the full database that can be corroborated against the others. Some, like Bitcoin, entice end users to participate in the network through a ‘proof of work’ model in which a user’s computer helps to process algorithms that unlock cryptocurrency as a kind of reward for supporting the network. Others use a ‘proof of stake’ model in which they invest their own cryptocurrency and essentially receive a kind of interest payment for helping to validate blockchain transactions.</p>



<p>One problem with both of these approaches is that they open the door to large-scale mining and staking efforts that can become outsized players in a given network. Humanode is seeking to resolve this issue with a ‘Proof of Existence’ and ‘Proof of Uniqueness’ model in which each node is verified to belong to a single user using biometric technology – a system that can help to ensure democratic governance on the blockchain while preventing ‘sybil attacks’ in which a single entity uses multiple accounts to manipulate blockchain transactions.</p>



<p>FaceTec’s technology is essential to this approach. Using <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/id-talk-podcast-facetec-ceo-kevin-alan-tussy-face-authentication-100k-spoof-bounty-912089/">three-dimensional face mapping</a> and biometric matching, the company’s solution allows end users on the Humanode blockchain to confirm their unique identities, without the need to share personal information.</p>



<p>Humanode says it received 11,000 applications to participate in its first testnet, which got 500 validator nodes up and running last year. A public beta was launched in late December, bringing the total number of unique blockchain validators to 1,650 as of February 10, 2022.</p>



<p>Going forward, the $2 million in seed funding will help Humanode to prepare for the launch of its mainnet in mid-2022.</p>



<p>In addition to Republic Capital’s investment, the funding round featured contributions from other notable names, including Blizzard’s Avalanche ecosystem fund, Tribe Capital, GravityX Capital, Wintermute, Shima Capital, Genblock, AU21, StaFi, and Polygon co-founders Jaynti Kanani and Sandeep Nailwal.</p>

<p>I<a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/">nnovatrics</a>‘ fingerprint recognition technology has taken the top spot in accuracy in the latest round of testing by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>



<p>The Minutiae Interoperability Exchange (MINEX) III is widely considered the gold standard in the evaluation of fingerprint algorithms. The testing program evaluates both template generators and template matching, and it’s in the latter category that Innovatrics has excelled.</p>



<p>Innovatrics’ solution proved to be the most accurate among over 40 competing vendors. While Neurotechnology has retained its lead in the template generation category, it has now fallen to second place in matching, with algorithms from other big names including Thales, Safran Identity &amp; Security (now IDEMIA), and Dermalog also ranking in the top five.</p>



<p>In announcing Innovatrics’ breakthrough, the company’s R&amp;D head, Marian Beszedes, attributed it to sophisticated machine learning AI. “Our latest fingerprint verification algorithm has been significantly improved by incorporating deep neural networks into the process, and the current fingerprint matcher is the best matcher worldwide as measured by NIST,” he explained.</p>



<p>The MINEX III achievement further illustrates the brisk pace of Innovatrics’ research and development efforts. In December, the company detailed its use of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-uses-filters-improve-accuracy-liveness-detection-system-121505/">a filtering process</a> to improve its liveness detection solution, and in January it announced <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-improves-edge-processing-capabilities-with-smartface-5-011805/">an upgraded version</a> of its SmartFace facial recognition and surveillance platform that was more scalable. The company also announced updates for its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-upgrades-biometric-onboarding-solution-712105/">Digital Onboarding Toolkit</a> just a couple of weeks ago.</p>



<p>As for its business activities, Innovatrics recently supplied Guinea’s national police force with an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-outfits-guinea-police-with-modern-digital-abis-system-020104/">Automated Biometric Identification System</a>. More such contracts may be possible in the future, given that MINEX III is used to determine the compliance of fingerprint recognition systems with the US government’s Personal Identity Verification Program standards.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/">1Kosmos</a> is celebrating its recent iBeta certification. The company’s flagship BlockID solution now has the approval of iBeta and the FIDO Alliance, and has also met the NIST’s 800-63-3 standard.</p>



  



<p>The iBeta evaluation specifically concerned the organization’s 21 CFR 1311.116 Standard. BlockID passed the test with flying colors, performing 200 live biometric attempts without producing a single false match for an overall false match rate (FRM) below 0.1 percent. Those matches were performed on iOS and Android devices, for a 95 percent confidence level.</p>



<p>1Kosmos’ BlockID solution is designed for onboarding and ongoing authentication. The platform combines user biometrics with private blockchain technology to create a secure user identity that can be used to gain passwordless access to various online applications.</p>



<p>“Preventing false matches in live biometrics is both critical for identity proofing in sensitive applications and extremely hard to accomplish,” said 1Kosmos CTO Rohan Pinto. “Not only did BlockID meet iBeta’s FMR requirements, we exceeded them. Our compliance with the 21 CFR, FIDO2 and NIST standards provides customers full confidence in the reliability and accuracy of our live identity verification capabilities.”</p>



<p>1Kosmos <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/1kosmos-blockid-gets-fido2-certification-100605/">received its FIDO2 certification</a> in October of 2020, and followed that with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/1kosmos-blockid-receives-nist-certification-051305/">NIST certification</a> in May of the following year. The company now credits those accomplishments for its <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/1kosmos-triples-new-customer-count-2021-012003/">breakout success in 2021</a>. 1Kosmos emerged from stealth mode last February, and has since gone on to double its headcount and triple its number of clients over the course of the year.</p>



<p>Along the way, 1Kosmos released a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/1kosmos-aims-eliminate-login-friction-with-passwordless-identity-package-052802/">new Passwordless Identity Package</a> that lets people replace the traditional username and password fields with a QR code for authentication. The company has also launched a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/1kosmos-lets-users-bind-one-phone-number-their-account-121503/">SIM binding feature</a> that lets users link one mobile number to their BlockID account to stop fraudsters who might try to register a second device during an attack.</p>

To date, leading <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf">exchanges</a> globally like <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/%E2%80%8Bbinance-deploys-shyft-networks-veriscope-to-support-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-421499824684902555">Binance</a>, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/08/17/bitmex-deribit-tap-shyft-network-for-fatf-travel-rule-solution/">Bitmex</a>, Bitfinex, Deribit, and <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/tether-begins-testing-and-integration-of-veriscope-shyft-networks-solution-to-the-travel-rule-55af3e800fd8">Tether</a> have already announced their participation and collaboration with Veriscope.</p><p>We know that when navigating the compliance space — whether you’re an exchange, custodian or CCO (Chief Compliance Officer) — you will have questions about how different solutions work and what your options are. Below, we’ve highlighted some of the key advantages of Veriscope, which we believe truly separates us from the pack of other Travel Rule solutions in the&nbsp;market.</p> 1. How frictionless is the Veriscope customer experience? <p>Very. While other Travel Rule solutions might ask their customers for VASP details (name, address, VASP code, etc.) Veriscope doesn’t. When using our solution, you don’t need to collect beneficiary VASP details, including VASP codes. Veriscope offers automated and accurate detection of beneficiary VASP details directly from the beneficiary’s wallet address — so you don’t have to. Imagine, from your customers point of view, there will be no change to how they transact&nbsp;today.</p> 2. Is Veriscope a safe and secure solution? <p>Security of customer information and trust are paramount to Veriscope. We offer a VASP-to-VASP transfer of customer PII, and there is never any storing of customer PII by Veriscope. Customer PII doesn’t even relay or route through our servers; it is a completely P2P solution. You can also trust our secure technology to prevent data mining of your customer PII through an explicit and unique customer consent mechanism.</p> 3. How can we trust the VASPs who use Veriscope? <p>Good question! Veriscope utilizes VASP due diligence information to internationally recognized standards, with an option to seek a third-party verification from major global law firm DLA Piper. We also offer you the capability to select counterparty VASPs based on jurisdiction, license, and/or due-diligence status. This is the only solution to offer this capability to meet FATF guidelines and protect your customer&nbsp;PII.</p> 4. Is Veriscope a popular solution? <p>We’re already in advanced stages with the majority of transaction flow for the global VASP market — and the numbers don’t lie: VASPs responsible for over 60% of global transaction flow are already evaluating or integrating Veriscope. Significant large-scale VASP development input since inception means you can expect unparalleled support and industry alignment from our&nbsp;product.</p> 5. Is Veriscope committed to open technology and decentralization? <p>Absolutely. Veriscope is a future-proof, completely open technology. Decentralization is on our radar as a priority to prepare for next-generation VASPs, such as DeFi. And yes, we’re already speaking with DeFi providers about participation in Veriscope because our technology is perfectly aligned. Regarding openness, Veriscope is built by VASPs, for VASPs. Our open architecture allows for co-development by VASPs to continuously improve our solution.</p> 6. Does Veriscope require expensive fees — and a lot of&nbsp;them? <p>Our blockchain-based architecture enables consistently low transaction fees. We have zero set-up fees, zero minimum charges, and zero ongoing licensing fees. You only pay per-transaction network fees with a native token, where you can control the&nbsp;fee.</p> 7. Does Veriscope work with other Travel Rule protocols? Is it interoperable? <p>Yes, and yes. Veriscope is integrating with other Travel Rule protocols to enable the broadest VASP network reach. Watch for our announcements as these come online in the coming weeks! Veriscope can also integrate with third-party service providers such as blockchain analytics firms to provide an all-in-one solution. It’s a one-stop-shop for VASPs — from big to&nbsp;small.</p> 8. Is Veriscope able to look back at past transactions? Can you protect against the “Sunrise&nbsp;Issue?” <p>We’re proud to be the only Travel Rule solution protecting against the Sunrise Issue. No other solution can provide this. We permit a historic transaction lookback on any transaction involving a VASP broadcast to Veriscope before the date of integration. Additionally, transaction broadcasts are immutable records on-chain, providing an open, permanent audit&nbsp;trail.</p><p>If Veriscope sounds like the solution for you and you’d like to learn more, and receive integration guidance, <a href="https://veriscope.network/">contact us&nbsp;now.</a></p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems.

<p>Dock has a mission to enable organizations and individuals to create and share verifiable data. For organizations that want the ability to issue and share verifiable credentials in a mobile application, we’ve developed our mobile SDK.</p><p>SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of software development tools in one installable package, facilitating the creation of applications. Dock’s SDK will allow organizations to:</p>  Build their own mobile applications on Dock’s network  Integrate Dock’s functionality into their own applications  Have full control over the creation, issuance, and verification of verifiable credentials  <p>We understand many SMEs and large organizations want to offer storage and functionality of digital credentials in their applications but don’t have the resources to make this happen. In a quest to help organizations offer verifiable credentials, the complete source code for Dock’s SDK is available to install from <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk">GitHub</a>, which will allow organizations to embed an identity wallet into their own, existing React Native apps that can be deployed rapidly. </p><p>Helping the Development Team</p><p>Helping reduce the time and cost of building an API from scratch, while having full control over creating and managing API keys and more, Dock’s SDK is the ideal starting point to incorporate verifiable credentials and decentralized identity.</p><p>Enabling digital credentials to be stored in a mobile wallet can take months of development, meaning more money and time being spent from the already scarce resources of a developer's time. Users will have access to support throughout the years should any bugs and errors arise giving back time to the development team to focus on other projects. </p><p>Installation</p><p>Dock’s SDK is available for installation via NPM or Yarn. Once the package has been installed, users can import the SDK like any ES6/CJS module.

Find tutorials on how to install and set up <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/dock-tutorials">Dock’s SDK here</a>. </p><p>Add Dock’s Functionality to your Website</p><p>Dock also offers an API as a complete solution for creating, managing, and presenting verifiable credentials, allowing users to issue, verify, and revoke credentials, manage decentralized identities and interact with the Dock blockchain. For organizations wanting to add verifiable credentials and decentralized identities to their website functionality, Dock’s API is easy to integrate.<br><br>For organizations who don’t have the ability or resources to integrate with an API, we’ve created Dock Certs. Verifiable credentials and decentralized identities can be created, issued, and verified in a few simple clicks.

<p>Two new members have been appointed to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pclob.gov/">Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB)</a>. The PCLOB was established in the wake of 9/11, to serve as an independent watchdog organization that advises the federal government on policy matters related to civil liberties and human rights.</p>



  



<p>Unfortunately, the organization has struggled to fulfill that objective since 2017 due to membership issues. The PCLOB is supposed to have five members, but has only had three members (and has not had an acting chairperson) for the past few years.</p>



<p>The two new members should allow the PCLOB to operate in a full capacity once again. Sharon Bradford Franklin has been appointed as the chair of the board, while Beth Williams is signing on as a regular member of the organization. Both appointments were voted on by the Senate.</p>



<p>In terms of experience, Williams previously served as the assistant attorney general (and as a policy advisor) for the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Policy between August 2017 and December 2020. Bradford Franklin, on the other hand, is returning to the PCLOB following an earlier stint as the organization’s executive director. She has also served as the policy director for New America’s Open Technology Institute, and sat on the cybersecurity subcommittee of the Homeland Security Department’s Data Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee.</p>



<p>The PCLOB is expected to make facial recognition one of its top priorities when it eventually reconvenes. The technology has been the subject of intense debate for the past few years, due to its growing ubiquity in surveillance operations and in public-facing identity applications. For example, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/gao-finds-broad-support-facial-recognition-clearview-ai-among-federal-agencies-082701/">multiple federal agencies</a> have been criticized for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/federal-law-enforcement-keeps-signing-new-facial-recognition-contracts-011203/">partnering with Clearview AI</a>, while the IRS recently <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/irs-abandons-biometric-login-plan-020807/">backed away from a policy</a> that would have <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/irs-makes-id-me-mandatory-people-accessing-online-accounts-011802/">made facial recognition mandatory</a> for everyone signing up for an online account through the ID.me identity platform.</p>



<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation and Fight for the Future are some of the many civil liberties organizations that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/open-letter-urges-executive-oversight-body-to-suspend-use-of-facial-recognition-901291/">signed an open letter</a> asking the PCLOB to push the federal government to suspend its use of facial recognition tech.</p>

  <p>AngularJS 1.0 was released in October 2010. At the time, it was considered one of the most revolutionary and popular web frameworks ever to see the light of day. Developers loved it, and created many apps with it. However, as a pioneer in the JS framework space, AngularJS had some growing pains and significant issues. The team went back to the drawing board for a major breaking release with Angular 2. It took two years to develop and influenced many devs to hop onto other frameworks in the meantime.</p>

<p>Today, five years after Angular 2 was released, we just call it “Angular”, and its version numbers have far less meaning. Five years is a long time for a modern JS web framework to live and thrive. If you look at the number of Stack Overflow questions, you’ll see that users struggle with React far more than Angular.</p>



 


<p>I kid, I kid. 😅</p>

<p>I don’t think Stack Overflow tags indicate that developers have a hard time with the framework; I think they indicate a thriving community. The more people use technology, the more they submit questions for it.</p>

<p><a href="https://hotframeworks.com/">hotframeworks.com</a> lists a score that combines GitHub stars with Stack Overflow tags and says the top six web frameworks are as follows (at the time of this writing):</p>

 
   React 
   ASP.NET MVC 
   Angular 
   Ruby on Rails 
   AngularJS 
   Vue.js 
 

<p>Angular is still very popular among developers. If you’re developing an Angular app today, you probably need a way to authenticate your users. That’s where OpenID Connect (OIDC) can help you. OIDC is a layer on top of OAuth 2.0 that provides identity.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to add OIDC authentication with Auth0 to a new Angular app in just a few steps.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   A favorite text editor or IDE. I recommend <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, but I know many JavaScript developers prefer <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. 
   <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> v14+ and npm installed.

 Create an Angular app 

<p>First, you’ll need to create a new Angular app with routing enabled. Install the Angular CLI globally, then create an app.</p>

   <code>npm i -g @angular/cli@13
ng new auth0-demo --routing
</code>   

<p>You’ll be prompted to select your favorite stylesheet format. The selection you make doesn’t matter for this example since we’re focused on functionality rather than updating visuals.</p>

 Add Auth with OpenID Connect 

<p>To add authentication with Auth0, you’ll first need a <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">free Auth0 account</a>. Install the <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli#installation">Auth0 CLI</a> and run <code>auth0 login</code> to register your account. Then, run <code>auth0 apps create</code>. Use the name <code>auth0-demo</code> and specify a description of your choosing. Select Single Page Web Application and use <code>http://localhost:4200/home</code> for the Callback URL. Specify <code>http://localhost:4200</code> for the rest of the URLs. We’re using 4200 as the port here because that’s the default for local Angular development.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can also use the Auth0 Console to create an OIDC app:</p>

   
     <a href="https://auth0.com/auth/login">Log in</a> to Auth0 or <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">create an account</a> if you don’t have one. Go to Applications &gt; Create Application. 
     Choose Single Page Web Applications as the application type and click Create. 
     Click Angular, then the Settings tab. 
     Add <code>http://localhost:4200/home</code> as an Allowed Callback URL and <code>http://localhost:4200</code> as a Logout URL. 
     Specify <code>http://localhost:4200</code> as an Allowed Origin and click Save Changes at the bottom. 
   
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have a new Angular app and Auth0 OIDC set up, you can use <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#angular--auth0">OktaDev Schematics</a> to add OAuth 2.0 and OIDC support to your Angular app. Be sure to execute this command in the folder for the app itself (<code>auth0-demo</code>) adjacent to <code>package.json</code>.</p>

   <code>ng add @oktadev/schematics --auth0
</code>   

<p>The Auth0 CLI will prompt you for an issuer URL and client ID, which were displayed when setting up the app in Auth0. If you used the CLI, it would have shown the issuer URL right above the client ID.</p>

   <code>=== dev-0ua1y-go.us.auth0.com application created

  CLIENT ID            TJgZxGnlSkqUe6JfMFSipZcFsbpl6LS2
</code>   

<p>This process will perform the following steps for you:</p>

 
   Install the <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular">Auth0 Angular SDK</a>. 
   Add <code>src/app/auth-routing.module.ts</code> with your OIDC configuration and initialization logic. 
   Configure an <code>AuthHttpInterceptor</code> that adds an <code>Authorization</code> header with an access token to outbound requests. 
   Create a <code>HomeComponent</code> and configure it with authentication logic. 
   Update unit tests for <code>AppComponent</code> and <code>HomeComponent</code> to mock Auth0.

</blockquote>

 Test your Angular authentication flow 

<p>Run <code>ng serve</code> in your app, and you should see a login button at <code>http://localhost:4200/home</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Login button and sign in with one of the configured users for your Auth0 application. Because this is just a demo, you probably haven’t done that - more likely, you should sign up as a new user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After login, you’ll be redirected back to your app, and you’ll see a Logout button displayed in the bottom left corner.</p>

<p></p>

 Display the authenticated user’s name 

<p>To display the authenticated user’s name, you can use the <code>user$</code> observable on the <code>AuthService</code> instance.</p>

<p>Modify <code>src/app/home/home.component.html</code> to display a welcome message to the user.</p>

   <code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="(auth.isAuthenticated$ | async) === false" (click)="login()" id="login"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;div *ngIf="auth.user$ | async as user"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Welcome, {{user?.name}}!&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="auth.isAuthenticated$ | async" (click)="logout()" id="logout"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Refresh your app, and you should see your name displayed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If everything works—congrats!</p>

<p>Introduction: Isolationism: AERGO’s Solution: The Utilization Of Merkle&nbsp;Bridge</p>The Great Connection<p>Blockchain isolationism is a focal problem that the totality of the cryptocurrency space faces; multi-chain technology enables universal interconnectivity between different projects. Although the usage of digital assets and different blockchains are increasing at a rapid rate, isolationism is still the predominant “law” of blockchains. The exchange of information has become stuck in a “blockchain stagnation” because of the lack of interconnectivity between ecosystems. For example, since Bitcoin and Ethereum have their own isolated ecosystems, consensus model and transaction methods, the smooth transference of information and communication is all but impossible to achieve in an immediate fashion. This creates a problem of convenience and efficiency.</p><p>The Merkle Bridge: The Creator Of Convenience</p>Merkle Bridge: The Technology Of Interoperability<p>The Merkle Bridge has solved a simple yet imperative function for the expansion of blockchain: that function being interoperability. The Merkle Bridge is a technology that interconnects heterogenous blockchains together. In essence, the technology is designed to enable the exchange of assets and information between inherently different blockchains or platforms; Ethereum to AERGO being an example as such. This is a major stepping stone of interconnectivity between AERGO and the collective totality of ERC-20 tokens and Ethereum&nbsp;itself.</p><p>For more details, please refer to the follow article&nbsp;below:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-merkle-bridge-what-else-is-needed-for-nft-c5170502da3a">Aergo Merkle Bridge: What else is needed for NFT?</a></p><p>The Great Relationship: GEMpay, A Blockchain Based Simple Payment Service And The Merkle&nbsp;Bridge</p>Merkle Bridge: Bridging The&nbsp;Gap<p>GEMpay works with different scalable economies; it is imperative to understand that GEMpay is a simple and easy to utilize blockchain service payment system. The more users that pay with AERGO Gem, the more discounts they receive as well; this is the cornerstone of economic self-interest and practicality. All GEMpay users must first top-up their AERGO Gem to use their points. AERGO Gem has the same value as the KRW, and you will receive an appropriate discount or profit in this functional rewards paradigm built within the GEMpay system based on your participation in the ecosystem. AERGO Gem natively supports swaps through the AERGO token. In addition, plans are put into place to support to enable swaps to Ethereum through the Merkle Bridge, which will enable swaps with various ERC-20&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>For those who’re unfamiliar with Ethereum, ERC-20 is the token standard within the Ethereum ecosystem; every Ethereum based token is an ERC-20 token. In essence, this compatibility with AERGO through the utilization of the Merkle Bridge will enable easy and seamless access for ERC-20 holders to utilize the service platform with Ethereum based tokens of their own choosing.</p><p>📊 Token Price&nbsp;Indexes</p><p>We would like to request for the patience of those who wish to utilize GEMpay. Discussions with various companies are ongoing to conduct a sufficient POC to create an appropriate index for AERGO Gem prices. It is not easy to create a reliable index in the current cryptocurrency token environment. Whether it is a centralized exchange or a decentralized exchange, since the price value in the virtual currency market depends entirely on the liquidity pool of the active wallet, it is a structure in which the exchange party must bear the risk of the index. This is because it is an environment in which anyone can attack the price whenever they want. Our plan is to open the GEMpay service according to the timeline set forth, starting with the POC and pre-booking openings in March and until the second quarter of&nbsp;2022.</p><p>If You Have Gem, You Garner A Double Discount With&nbsp;GEMpay:</p><p>March POC And Advance Reservations Are&nbsp;Open:</p><p>📍 The Three Line&nbsp;Summary</p>  The Merkle Bridge is a technology that enables interoperability between heterogenous blockchains.  GEMpay works with different economies of&nbsp;scale.  Discussions are underway with various companies to conduct POC to create an appropriate index for AERGO&nbsp;Gem.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/merkle-bridge-the-causality-that-connects-gempay-with-ethereum-and-erc20s-4d8bfc3c57b5">Merkle Bridge: The Causality That Connects GEMpay With Ethereum And ERC20's</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.trulioo.com/">Trulioo</a> has acquired <a href="https://www.helloflow.io/">HelloFlow</a> in an effort to improve its customer experience. HelloFlow is based in Denmark, and has developed a platform that allows organizations to build their own custom workflows without needing to write any lines of code.</p>



  



<p>Instead, HelloFlow uses a drag-and-drop interface to speed up the development process. The solution is designed to mitigate costs, and allow organizations to set up new customer and employee workflows (including onboarding workflows) more quickly.</p>



<p>Trulioo, meanwhile, will integrate that technology into its <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/trulioo-brings-globalgateway-pakistan-091103/">flagship GlobalGateway platform</a>. GlobalGateway is geared toward onboarding and identity verification, and cross-references personal information with other sources to make sure it is legitimate. It can also use face and document recognition to match a selfie to the image on a photo ID.</p>



<p>The goal is to provide organizations with a comprehensive end-to-end identity solution that is both user-friendly and compliant with international Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations. The acquisition will allow Trulioo to deliver a unified identity verification and orchestration platform, which will in turn simplify account management and allow customers to create a new workflow in a matter of minutes.</p>



<p>The move is in keeping with Trulioo’s broader expansion efforts. The company plans to double its employee headcount in 2022, and believes that HelloFlow’s presence in Denmark will make it easier to reach out to potential clients in the European market.</p>



<p>“Our ability to verify both businesses and individuals globally combined with HelloFlow’s advanced orchestration delivers unmatched capabilities and helps us accelerate an end-to-end identity platform that meets the evolving needs of our customers,” said Trulioo President and CEO Steve Munford.</p>



<p>“We set out to build a platform that businesses could leverage for digital onboarding regardless of company size, resources, market or jurisdiction,” added HelloFlow Founder Mikkel Skarnager. “We’re thrilled to be joining Trulioo and continue the journey of digital innovation and inclusion.”</p>



<p>GlobalGateway was recently cleared for use as an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/german-authorities-approve-trulioo-solution-online-age-gating-120102/">online age verification solution in Germany</a>. Trulioo has already provided identity services for a number of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/four-european-payment-providers-sign-up-trulioo-identity-services-070903/">European payment institutions</a>, and for multiple <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/trulioo-provides-globalgateway-services-six-cryptocurrency-companies-121705/">enterprises in the cryptocurrency space</a>. The company also reached unicorn status following a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/trulioo-becomes-tech-unicorn-after-394m-series-d-706072/">round of Series D funding</a> back in June.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nextbiometrics.com/">NEXT Biometrics</a> has received a substantial follow-up order from Page Electronica and <a href="https://www.ngrave.io/">NGRAVE</a>. The two companies <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/next-biometrics-tech-to-secure-crypto-wallet-911101/">started buying NEXT fingerprint sensors</a> in November of 2020, with plans to deploy them in NGRAVE’s cryptocurrency wallets.</p>



  



<p>Page Electronica and NGRAVE have now gone through all of the sensors in that initial order, and have placed the follow-up to make sure that they are able to keep up with demand despite ongoing supply chain issues and the limited availability of semiconductors internationally. NEXT is expected to fulfill most of the order before the end of the year, and will ship all of the contracted sensors inside of 18 months.</p>



<p>The new purchase order is for NEXT’s Access 200 fingerprint sensor, and is worth NOK 3.1 million (roughly $350,000 USD). The first batch was supposed to be delivered over the course of 24 months, though NEXT ended up completing the order well ahead of that two-year schedule due to high demand.</p>



<p>“We are stunned about the market response of our crypto-wallet and we’re pleased to have integrated it with the secure fingerprint solution from NEXT Biometrics,” said NGRAVE CEO Ruben Merre. “Their slim form factor with superior performance enables our NGRAVE ZERO crypto-wallets to be ultra-secure.”</p>



<p>“This follow-up order from NGRAVE proves that our fingerprint sensors are well fitted to be integrated in various security demanding use cases,” added NEXT CEO Peter Heuman. “The NGRAVE crypto-wallet is a great design-win for NEXT, with potential in a continuously growing cryptocurrency market.”</p>



<p>This is the second major order that NEXT has announced in February. An unnamed equipment manufacturer in India placed an order for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/next-biometrics-receives-2-2-million-order-from-indian-oem-020302/">$2.2 million worth of FAP 20 sensors</a> at the beginning of the month, though that deal is contingent on Aadhaar certification. NEXT has also <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/next-biometrics-gets-first-order-in-multi-year-contract-709132/">started fulfilling</a> a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/european-tech-provider-integrate-fap20-sensors-from-next-biometrics-031008/">five-year sensor contract</a> for a tech company based in Europe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.appgate.com/">Appgate</a> is strengthening its cybersecurity portfolio with the addition of a new behavioral biometrics service. The company provides clients with Zero Trust security solutions, and will be using behavioral biometrics to assess risk levels during individual transactions.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, Appgate’s solution operates much like other behavioral biometrics offerings. The platform analyzes someone’s keyboard and mouse behaviors during an online session, and uses that information to create a unique profile for each user. It can then send a notification to administrators and step in if it notices any deviations from that pattern, which could point to the presence of a potential fraudster.</p>



<p>Appgate’s behavioral biometrics platform can be deployed through an API, and gives organizations the ability to set their own risk levels. They can also configure the platform to take specific actions when an interaction exceeds a given threshold. For example, Appgate might ask for step-up authentication during a high-risk interaction, and send a notification to administrators to give them an opportunity to respond.</p>



<p>Legitimate users, on the other hand, should enjoy a more seamless login experience. Appgate’s solution operates passively in the background, and allows organizations to remove friction if no anomalies are detected. The company believes that its solution can help financial institutions combat account takeover attacks, and keep pace with rapidly evolving cybercriminals.</p>



<p>“Organizations with a high volume of online end user interactions—like financial institutions, retailers, utilities and healthcare providers—must ensure that these interactions are secure,” said Appgate CPO Jason Garbis. “At the same time, their customers expect a seamless digital experience. Our new behavioral biometrics offering enables organizations to strengthen their security posture and provide dynamic protection while minimizing the impact to the end user.”</p>



<p>Fact.MR has predicted that the behavioral biometrics <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fact-mr-forecasts-9-billion-behavioral-biometric-market-100601/">market will reach $9 billion by 2031</a>. Estimates from <a>Global Industry Analysts</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/grand-view-forecasts-4-62-billion-behavioral-biometrics-market-101503/">Grand View Research</a>, meanwhile, have placed demand at around $4 billion in 2027.</p>

<p>The UK Home Office is moving forward with an age estimation trial that will enable self-service checkout for people purchasing alcohol. The trial will run through the end of May, and is kicking off at a pair of Asda locations in Pudsey and Stevenage and an Aldi store in London.</p>



  



<p>During the trial, shoppers who want to buy alcohol will be able to scan their purchases at <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/yoti-strongpoint-biometric-age-scan-906037/">self-service checkout terminals</a> that have been outfitted with a camera and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/yoti-highlights-age-estimation-tech-on-safer-internet-day-021001/">Yoti’s age estimation technology</a>. The camera will scan each person’s face, and <a href="https://www.yoti.com/">Yoti</a> will try to determine whether or not the individual is over the age of 25.</p>



<p>Those who clear the required age threshold will be able to proceed with their purchase without showing any other form of identification. Those that could be younger than 25 can prove their age with Yoti’s digital identity app, or with the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/uk-post-office-embraces-yotis-biometric-mobile-id-solution-79042021/">Post Office’s EasyID app</a>, which debuted in September and also leverages Yoti technology. In both cases, shoppers will not need to interact with a store employee, and will instead enjoy a fully self-service checkout process.</p>



<p>Those who don’t want to subject themselves to the age scan will still have the option to go to the counter for a manual age check. The trial is limited to alcohol sales, so the Yoti age check cannot yet be used for the purchase of other age-restricted goods like knives and DVDs.</p>



<p>Yoti has claimed that its age estimation technology is 98.96 percent reliable. With regards to younger shoppers, it can guess someone’s age to within 2.35 years if that person is between the ages of 16-25. However, the company has been taking steps to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/yoti-takes-steps-improve-age-estimation-technology-032901/">improve the accuracy of its technology for younger users</a>. Yoti’s age estimation tech has already been used to enable <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/yoti-age-verification-online-alcohol-sales-australia-705212/">online alcohol sales in Australia</a>.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The debate over which type of database is superior – the traditional relational (SQL) or modern document (NoSQL) ones – has continued since the NoSQL concept itself emerged around 2009. Back then, a popular opinion was that relational databases with their rigid data schemas and very limited horizontal scalability were already on the way out and alternative schema-less database architectures with their flexibility, ease of use, and seemingly limitless scalability were just the right tool for modern, highly distributed, cloud-native applications.</p>
<p>Alas, the enthusiasm of those early years turned up to be overly optimistic – over a decade later both SQL and NoSQL solutions are going strong without a clear winner. Personally, I have always been on the fence with regard to this argument – I firmly believe that the original dichotomy is largely artificial, caused by technology limitations that have long been resolved, and, last but not least, is completely meaningless from the business perspective.</p>
<p>In a sense, this reminds me of a similar situation with Big Data. Do you remember when you had to invest in a complex and mind-bogglingly expensive hardware and software platform to be able to manage a few terabytes of data? Nowadays, the only thing you need is a credit card and a public cloud account. The very notion of Big Data has almost completely disappeared already – from a modern business perspective, it’s just “data”.</p>
<p>The same considerations apply to the SQL vs NoSQL debate: as long as your corporate data is available, consistent, and reasonably protected from misuse, your applications meet certain performance criteria and can be quickly adapted to changing business requirements, and your IT costs remain within the budget, the LOB people couldn’t care less about the name of your favorite database. Unfortunately, under the hood, the situation is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>For people working in cybersecurity, one of the daily mantras is “Complexity is the worst enemy of security.” This is true for every kind of IT infrastructure, but perhaps nowhere can making an early mistake lead to catastrophic consequences than in data(base) management. Sure, having a selection of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/">over a dozen specialized database engines</a> to choose from for your new project might sound like a great idea at first. Yet, sooner or later, you will inevitably stumble upon an unexpected limitation and face a difficult decision: should you refactor your application to support a different, more suitable engine, or should you add another one into the mix: for example, to solve a scalability challenge or simply (ha-ha!) to be able to run business analytics on live data?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, modern database vendors think about these challenges all the time and constantly work to address them for their customers, preferably in advance. And, even less surprisingly, these developments lead to a convergence of SQL and NoSQL databases towards a universal multi-model data management platform.</p>
<p>Take MongoDB, the <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/">most popular NoSQL</a> database platform. Over the years it has become such a de facto standard for NoSQL that other document database engines like Amazon DocumentDB and Azure Cosmos DB implement MongoDB APIs to allow existing apps and tools to connect to their services instead. Developers that rely on this compatibility layer get more flexibility in choosing a more suitable (better scalable, more integrated, or simply less expensive) alternative to MongoDB. The downside of this approach, of course, is that not all functions of the original are implemented, and the degree of compatibility can vary a lot across different projects. An even bigger challenge, however, is making NoSQL instances available to 3rd party tools that expect relational data – the most common use case being business analytics. Connecting existing BI tools to MongoDB is possible but requires additional infrastructure to set up and operate and most often does not provide access to real-time data, resulting in analysis of stale data.</p>
<p>Well, the more interesting is the latest news from Oracle – the database vendor known for not one but two of the most popular database engines in the world. The company just announced its own alternative for MongoDB, aptly named <a href="https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/autonomous-json-database/">Oracle Database API for MongoDB</a>. But wait, you’re probably saying, isn’t Oracle Database a relational database? How can it possibly emulate the capabilities of a document database like MongoDB?</p>
<p>Although its origins are firmly in the RDBMS camp, over the years Oracle Database has evolved into a multi-model data management platform, with native support for JSON data model available since 2014. Many customers have been using Oracle for their NoSQL projects for years, but now, with the new compatibility API, this functionality can be transparently available to any existing MongoDB-compatible application without any changes to its code. The announced API is compatible with MongoDB 4.2 and offers support for transactions and load-balanced connections. According to Oracle, the only thing developers need to change in their app is the database connection string.</p>
<p>But wait, you’re probably asking again: how exactly is it different from other compatibility APIs mentioned above? Well, this is where the most interesting things begin… As a proper multi-model database, Oracle Autonomous Database can transparently convert document collections to relational data structures and vice versa. This means that it is possible to import an existing MongoDB database into Oracle, continue running your existing app without any modifications, and get all the benefits of SQL-based business analytics on live data. The opposite is possible, too: you can expose existing relational data as MongoDB collections – for example, to make analytics reports available back in the original app with no effort.</p>
<p>The security and compliance benefits of this approach are also worth mentioning. Since all data previously spread across disparate data sources can now reside within a single database instance, it is no longer exposed to various threats and risks during the ETL process. On the contrary, all the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev70965/oracle-database-security-assessment/">enterprise-grade security features</a> of the Oracle Autonomous Database ensure consistent protection and compliance without the need to configure or tune them manually. Oracle’s MongoDB API is also backed by Oracle’s native user and role management, simplifying overall access management and governance.</p>
<p>So, where’s the catch? Well, the only one I can think of is that at the moment, the MongoDB API is only available as a part of Oracle Cloud. There are no technical limitations that would prevent it from working on-prem as well, but the company is naturally planning to use this capability to further promote its cloud services. However, considering that Oracle’s solution claims to overcome several key technical limitations of both the original MongoDB Atlas service and their competitors’ alternatives while remaining more economical to use, migrating your NoSQL workloads to Oracle Cloud might not be such an unthinkable idea at all… In fact, it could be just what developers tired of moving data from one database to another and dealing with complex manual processes are looking for.</p>

<p>About Episode</p>
 
 
<p>Antti Kettunen is a digital identity and digital trust expert and advisor. He designs ecosystem solutions, actively participates in standards and industry groups (e.g. CEN, Trust over IP, Mobey), and helps customers deliver value in their digital identity projects. He also writes and speaks about digital identity and the ongoing paradigm shift in his blog Identifinity. Antti is also one of the co-founders and advocates of the FindyNet cooperative, a digital identity network for Finland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 During this conversation, we discuss: 
 
 
 
 The current digital landscape in the Nordics, the maturity of e-Government and digital registries, and the trust that citizens of these countries have towards their governments. 
 
 
 How does the private sector in the Nordics look at self-sovereign identity? Where do they see the benefits? How do they look at the onramp from their existing federated authentication models? 
 
 
 Knowing where my organization fits inside my value chain and why knowing this will help me understand how to both benefit, contribute and thrive within an ecosystem-centric system. 
 
 
 How to decide whether or not to participate in the governance of an ecosystem? 
 
 
 The problems with API-centered architectures and the benefits gained from adopting data-centric architectures. 
 
 
 Why focusing too much on the Verifiable Credential Trust Triangle isn’t sufficient as the only tool to help with the adoption of SSI ecosystems. 
 
 
 An update on the EU Wallet and some thoughts on how it can spur SSI adoption, while looking at the risks of it possibly impeding private sector adoption.

 Spherity joins the Global Battery Alliance to support the development of the GBA Battery&nbsp;Passport <p>Spherity, one of Europe’s leading providers of decentralized, digital identity technology, has become a member of the Global Battery Alliance (GBA). The GBA is a public-private collaboration platform founded in 2017 at the World Economic Forum to align interests of the stakeholders operating in the battery industry. The goal of the GBA is to establish a circular and sustainable battery value chain by 2030. Spherity was recognized by the group in respect of its efforts in the field of developing and innovating identity technologies around the concept of the Digital Product Passport.</p>Spherity joins the Global Battery Alliance to support the development of the GBA Battery Passport.<p>The Paris Agreement of the United Nations defined the goal to decrease global warming by 2°C and to build a fairer and more sustainable society. To implement it the European Union has ratified the European Green Deal, which is defining several activities.</p><p>As one of the activities to reach a circular economy, the European Commission has proposed the “new EU Battery Regulation” which mandates a Digital Product Passport for batteries (short battery passport) above 2 kWh capacity from January 2026. The battery passport shall carry all relevant information of a battery that makes it longer lasting, reusable or recyclable. In the GBA, the battery industry is coming together to find an industry-wide solution to comply with this regulation.</p><p>Being one of the pioneers developing solutions for the Digital Product Passport, Spherity is working closely with policy makers and international companies to conceptualise a globally acceptable technology. Spherity is engaged in the track &amp; trace working group of the GBA to develop a battery passport that embraces standardization, interoperability, inclusivity, privacy, and an affordable cost structure.</p><p>“Spherity’s GBA membership is yet another move towards the company’s strong commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in general and towards enabling the circular economy with digital product passports in particular.” says Susanne Guth-Orlowski, Chief Innovation &amp; Solutions Officer of Spherity.</p><p>About the Global Battery&nbsp;Alliance</p><p>The Global Battery Alliance (GBA) is a public-private collaboration platform founded in 2017 at the World Economic Forum to help establish a sustainable battery value chain by 2030. The GBA brings together leading businesses along the entire battery value chain, international organizations, NGOs, academics and multiple governments to align collectively in a pre-competitive, multi-stakeholder manner to drive systemic change. All its activities follow <a href="https://www.globalbattery.org/media/publications/gba-10-guiding-principles.pdf">Ten Guiding Principles</a> in an effort to realize the <a href="https://www.globalbattery.org/media/publications/WEF_A_Vision_for_a_Sustainable_Battery_Value_Chain_in_2030_Report.pdf">GBA 2030 Vision</a> across three dimensions: establishing a circular battery value chain that is a major driver to achieve the Paris Agreement targets; transforming the economy in the value chain, creating new jobs and economic value; and safeguarding human rights and economic development in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

<p>In business banking, 2022 is all about the fintech sector. In the past, huge strides have been made in digital banking and fintech services for individual customers’ needs. Apps, customer service chat, and 24/7 transaction times have all revolutionized the banking experience for the customer. While some of these services have benefited business and commercial banking, banks and financial services could do more.</p>



<p>Business banking specialists provide small and medium business owners a great deal of services and opportunities with a <a href="https://getpenta.com/en/business-account/open-an-account/">business bank account</a>, to get entrepreneurial ventures off the ground and help established businesses flourish. This year is going to see a lot more innovation in these areas from them and others.</p>



<p>Below are some of the biggest business banking trends set to take off in 2022. Take these predictions as both things to get excited about and to prepare yourself for. It’s going to be a big year for business owners.</p>



 Super apps 



<p>2021 saw the release of<a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/107787/paypal-venmo-banking-super-mobile-app-payments/?internal-link-blist"> PayPal’s ‘super app’</a> and banks and financial services would have done well to pay attention. PayPal’s app combined a huge breadth of services for consumers, integrating shopping, investing, mobile payments, crypto services, and more all into one app.</p>



<p>For business banking, the super app’s potentialities are even more exciting. Business banking services are consistently updating their apps, taking advantage of what fintechs offer to create the ultimate app from which any entrepreneur can handle all their financial responsibilities.</p>



 Sustainable banking 



<p>The reality of climate change is finally arriving in the business sector. It is easier now than ever for companies to measure their carbon footprints and achieve<a href="https://getpenta.com/en/blog/penta-is-carbon-neutral/"> carbon neutrality</a> or offset their pollutive output by funding sustainable organizations.</p>



<p>The expectation is growing in the business banking sector. We are now seeing the demand from business owners to align themselves with financial services, which align themselves with sustainable models, and actively participate in the fight against a rising climate. Fintech has shown itself to be a suitably disruptive sector regarding sustainability in finance. This is especially important in banking, an industry historically fraught with fossil fuel funding. As the consumer demand for a sustainable world grows and green tech start-ups dominate the market, business banking services will race to meet these demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Artificial intelligence 



<p>The list of AI’s capabilities in finance today would require a much lengthier post than this—and its future capabilities are limitless. Already, AI has helped banks and financial services with improving security and fraud detection while streamlining various services for consumers, but 2022 promises more exciting developments.</p>



<p>AI and business banking are ideal pairing. Businesses need from their financial services intelligent interfaces, smart chatbots handling the bulk of inquiries, and powerful machine learning tools to gather important data about how entrepreneurs run their businesses. Be prepared to see developments in all these areas this year.</p>



 Open banking APIs 



<p>Despite controversial claims to<a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2021/11/open-bankings-failure/#:~:text=Speaking%20to%20MPs%20at%20a,has%20not%20been%20a%20success%E2%80%9D.&amp;text=One%20of%20the%20heroes%20of,incentivise%20consumers%20to%20switch%20accounts."> its lack of success</a>, open banking is here to stay, and it’s likely to expand in 2022. The exciting prospect stands to increase consumers’ data portability and make data sharing easier without the interference of institutional banks. While this has been met with some skepticism over data protection and safety, the recent executive order in the US to<a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/118023/white-house-tells-cfpb-to-hit-the-accelerator-on-bank-data-share-rules/?internal-link-embd"> implement data sharing provisions</a> demonstrates that these concerns are being met, and the trend is gaining traction.</p>



<p>APIs that allow easy communication for business owners will make open banking a huge time saver in business banking. Through these platforms, entrepreneurs with business banking accounts in an open banking landscape can expect to reach more clients and manage many complex transactions with ease.</p>



<p>Staying ahead of the trends in business banking means knowing what to expect and allowing yourself the opportunity to learn about it before everyone else. Big things are happening in fintech in 2022 and many of them will directly benefit business banking.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, the decentralized data exchange protocol that unlocks data for AI, is excited to announce the launch of DataX Protocol, a project financed through <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a>, Ocean’s community-curated grants&nbsp;program.</p><p><a href="https://datax.fi">DataX Protocol</a> has an ambitious lineup of innovative DeFi tooling for datasets in the roadmap. Its goal is to build DataFi infrastructure to help onboard masses to the data economy and also boost Ocean Protocol’s footprint by building innovative tooling around datatokens.</p> DataX: DeFi Tooling for Data&nbsp;Dapps <p>DataX Protocol is building an open and decentralized financial layer on datasets. It aims to create complementary infrastructure around Ocean Protocol’s datatokens that will boost new integrations into the Ocean ecosystem. The DataX Protocol at the onset will enable any developer or dapp to use its libraries and tooling to build and create multi-token trading and staking infrastructure.</p><p>DataX tooling promises to increase metrics in the Ocean ecosystem like number of dapps being built, daily active users, total value locked, and trading volume of datasets.</p><p>Ultimately, DataX Protocol aims to make data liquid and a dominant asset&nbsp;class.</p> <a href="https://datapolis.city">Datapolis DApp</a> <p>To further the adoption of the data economy, DataX Protocol is launching the concept of Data Nation — a template for the states and countries who treat their data as an important asset and engage in creating a data economy for their citizens.</p><p>To implement this template and to make the prospect of staking and investing in datatokens for the masses interesting, DataX is also building a white-label platform named Datapolis. Datapolis is a virtual sovereign city state that prides itself as the world’s first Data Nation. It is also a showcase of DataX features.</p><p>Datapolis shows how an ideal real-world scenario could be for sharing data, trading datasets, or earning from data. Datapolis is built around the core principles of decentralization and democracy where citizens have a say via voting, economic activities like trading and staking, or help grow the DataX Community and earn incentives.</p><p>Trent McConaghy, Founder, Ocean Protocol, commented:</p><blockquote>Ocean was built with the aim to level the playing field around data &amp; AI, so that everyone can be a participant in the new Data Economy. DataX Protocol strengthens the Ocean ecosystem by catalyzing data as assets and the communities that form around data&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><p>Manan Patel, Founder, DataX Protocol&nbsp;added:</p><blockquote>DataX Protocol will play a leading role not only in furthering the growth of the Ocean ecosystem but also in establishing data as a dominant asset class at the global level. DataFi holds the key to solving global issues from data privacy and data ownership to income inequality and even poverty. This launch of the DataX Protocol is a major step in that direction.</blockquote><p>The Datapolis platform will be launched in February 2022, with trading and staking datasets. In the long run, Datapolis will add more features to the roost, like data farming, data insurances, data&nbsp;loans.</p><p>About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a new Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality data. Ocean’s intuitive marketplace technology allows data to be published, discovered, and consumed in a secure, privacy-preserving manner. By giving power back to data owners, Ocean resolves the tradeoff between using private data and its public exposure.</p><p>About DataX&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>DataX Protocol is a DeFi protocol building an innovative open financial infrastructure on datasets. DataX brings DeFi to data, and is a gateway to unlock DataFi for the masses. DataX is creating money markets specially suited for datasets and related services with a goal to make data truly liquid assets and a dominant asset&nbsp;class.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-announces-the-launch-of-datax-an-oceandao-grantee-4ff6c4f665b4">Ocean Protocol announces the launch of DataX, an OceanDAO grantee</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Why you should care about dependency injection 

<p>Dependency injection is a tried and proven design pattern for producing code that is testable, readable, and reusable. This is achieved by creating (or increasing) a separation of concerns, where each class has a dedicated area of responsibility.</p>

<p>Dependency injection is just one design pattern used to achieve inversion of control in which the calling code, or client, has no knowledge of the inner workings of the dependency, also called the service. The calling code only needs to know the interface of the dependency so it can call the dependency correctly. In dependency injection, the service is injected into the client class or function where it is used.</p>

<p>This makes it easier to test code by mocking—or stubbing—the service code for predictable results that the client can operate on. For example, if your service calls a database and returns an entity, you can mock this code to always return the entity and eliminate concerns such as the entity not being found, the connection to the database being unavailable, or other issues that may arise in the service. You can test the client code as though the service will always perform in a specific way, thus making the client code easier to write.</p>

<p>During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET Framework</a> days, there were two major libraries used for supporting dependency injection; Ninject and Unity. Both libraries gave years of admirable service to developers and applications. Ninject was generally more popular because it was a little more feature-rich, with the ability  to detect circular dependencies; Unity, however, was more performant. There were other libraries as well such as <code>Castle.Windsor</code> and <code>Autofac</code>. Each of these had its advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>While many of these libraries did extend support into .NET Core, these days the de facto way of achieving inversion of control is Microsoft’s implementation of dependency injection in .NET Core and beyond.</p>

<p>In this article, you will learn to use the default implementation of dependency injection that comes with .NET 5. You will see how to register services with different service lifetimes and understand the differences between those service lifetimes. You will also learn how to inject services into controllers, which is the most common usage of services in ASP.Net Core, and how to inject services into middleware. And I will show you how to write services so that they can be injected.</p>

<p>The example application will consist of a single page with three pieces of information; your application’s name with randomized upper and lower case letters, the number of requests made to the server, and a list of users from your Okta account. Each of these three pieces of information will be obtained from its respective service. Each service will have a different service lifetime.</p>

 Prerequisites 

 
   Basic knowledge of .NET 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5</a> 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Your favorite IDE (I’ll be using Visual Studio 2022)</a> 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">An Okta account</a> 
 

<p>If you wish to download the code immediately you can do that <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-dependencyinjection-dotnet-example">on my GitHub repository</a>.</p>

 Set up Okta for the SDK 

<p>Open your Okta admin console and navigate to the Tokens tab on the API page. Click on Create Token and give it a meaningful name. You will be shown the API key. Make note of this as you will need it in your application.</p>

 Create your ASP.NET Core application 

<p>If you are using Visual Studio 2022 you can follow the instructions below.</p>

<p>First, open Visual Studio and then click Create Project. In the Create a new project pane select <code>ASP.Net Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)</code> as your template.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Next and under Configure your new project and name it <code>OktaDependencyInjection</code> and press Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Under additional info make sure you have <code>.NET 5.0</code> selected as your framework. You can leave the other options as the default.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Create and give Visual Studio a moment to scaffold your project.</p>

 Install dependencies 

<p>For this project, you will only need one package from NuGet—the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Okta.Sdk/">Okta SDK</a>. This package will help facilitate communication between your application and your Okta admin server using the API token you created earlier.</p>

   <code>Install-Package Okta.Sdk -Version 5.3.2
</code>   

 Set up your application settings 

<p>The first thing to do is select your settings. The only configuration needed is for Okta; in more advanced applications you may need more settings. First, you are going to modify the <code>appsettings</code> files that were created when Visual Studio scaffolded your application. Next, you provide a class to mimic the structure of that configuration. Finally, you will bind the configuration section to the class you created.</p>

 Add configuration to your appsettings 

<p>Next, you will want to set up your <code>appsettings</code> configuration files. Visual Studio should have added 2 files, <code>appsettings.json</code> and <code>appsettings.Development.json</code>. In my GitHub repository, I check in <code>appsettings.json</code> with the structure from <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> and no values. You can copy this convention if you want.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "",
    "Token": ""
  }
}
</code> 

<p>The code in <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> is not optional, however. This code contains the values required to run your application.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "",
    "Token": ""
  }
}
</code> 

 Add a class for your Okta configuration 

<p>Add a folder called <code>Settings</code> to the root of your project. In that folder add a class called <code>OktaConfiguration</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Settings
{
    public class OktaConfiguration
    {
        public string Domain { get; set; }
        public string Token { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>As mentioned before, this class mimics the structure of your <code>Okta</code> configuration section in your <code>appsettings</code> files. It’s possible to customize the configuration for more advanced binding but that isn’t necessary here.</p>

<p>The last step is to bind the configuration section to your class. You will do that when you start to work in your <code>Startup.cs</code> file.</p>

 Create your view and model 

<p>Next, you want to create the view that your users will see. In this application, you are only displaying one page to the user so this work is pretty light.</p>

 Add your view model 

<p>In the <code>Models</code> folder create a new file called <code>HomeModel.cs</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>using Okta.Sdk;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Models
{
    public class HomeModel
    {
        public string ApplicationName { get; set; }

        public List&lt;User&gt; Users { get; set; }

        public int NumberOfHits { get; set; }

        public HomeModel() { }

        public HomeModel(string applicationName, List&lt;User&gt; users, int numberOfHits)
        {
            ApplicationName = applicationName;  
            Users = users;
            NumberOfHits = numberOfHits;
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This model will contain the application name and a list of users associated with your Okta account. It will also have the number of times that a request has been made against your website since the last time the application was started.</p>

 Edit the home view 

<p>Open the file <code>Views/Home/Index.cshtml</code> and replace the code with the following.</p>

 <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
}

@model OktaDependencyInjection.Models.HomeModel


&lt;h3&gt;@Model.ApplicationName&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A Small Demonstration of &lt;b&gt;Dependency Injection&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;.NET 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of Hits Since Last Startup: @Model.NumberOfHits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Written by &lt;a href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Nik Fisher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
    Secured with &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;My Current List of Users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table class="table table-bordered"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Username&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    @foreach (var user in Model.Users)
    {
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@user.Profile.Email&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@user.Status&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    }
&lt;/table&gt;
</code> 

<p>This view is going to display your application name (with randomized upper and lower case numbers) and a list of your current users in Okta using the <code>HomeModel</code> you just created.</p>

 Update your layout 

<p>Finally, you will want to update your <code>Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml</code> view. This step isn’t strictly necessary but if you want your page to match mine you will need to update it.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

 Setting up the dependency injection 

<p>This is the last piece of code you can write before you start to focus on the dependency injection. Now, to populate your model and keep track of the number of hits, you will need to set up some middleware and services.</p>

 Write your services 

<p>First, you want to write the services. As mentioned above, the client needs access to an interface so it knows what to call on the service, even though it doesn’t know about the implementation. Since C# gives us access to interfaces, you can separate your services into interfaces and concrete implementations. Later you will bind the implementation to the interface to make it available for clients.</p>

<p>Start by creating a folder called <code>Services</code> in your project and add a folder called <code>Interfaces</code> to the <code>Services</code> folder.</p>

<p>Add an interface called <code>INumberOfHitsService</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Services.Interfaces
{
    public interface INumberOfHitsService
    {
        public int NumberOfHits { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The interface will just have an integer called <code>NumberOfHits</code> that exposes the getter and setter. This will enable the middleware to set the value and enable the controller to access it.</p>

<p>In the <code>Services</code> folder add a file called <code>NumberOfHitsService</code> with the implementation in it.</p>

   <code>namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Services
{
    public class NumberOfHitsService : Interfaces.INumberOfHitsService
    {
        public int NumberOfHits { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add an interface in the same folder called <code>IOktaService</code>. Add in the code below.</p>

   <code>using Okta.Sdk;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Services.Interfaces
{
    public interface IOktaService
    {
        Task&lt;List&lt;User&gt;&gt; GetUsersAsync();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This interface defines a method for <code>GetUsersAsync</code> whose implementation will reach out to your Okta server using the Okta SDK.</p>

<p>Add the implementation by adding a file called <code>OktaService</code> to the <code>Services</code> folder with the following code.</p>

   <code>using OktaDependencyInjection.Settings;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Options;
using Okta.Sdk;
using Okta.Sdk.Configuration;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Services
{
    public class OktaService : Interfaces.IOktaService
    {
        private OktaClient _client;

        public OktaService(IOptions&lt;OktaConfiguration&gt; options)
        {
            _client = new OktaClient(new OktaClientConfiguration()
            {
                OktaDomain = options.Value.Domain,
                Token = options.Value.Token
            });
        }

        public async Task&lt;List&lt;User&gt;&gt; GetUsersAsync()
        {
            var users = await _client.Users.ToListAsync();
            return users.Select(r =&gt; r as User).ToList();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Here you are using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0">options pattern</a> which, like dependency injection, helps with the separation of concerns. The <code>options</code> object contains the configuration items from your <code>appsettings</code> file. It uses these values to create an <code>OktaClient</code>, which can then be called to get the users from your Okta account.</p>

<p>The last service to add is the <code>RandomUpperAndLowerService</code>. Start by adding the <code>IRandomUpperAndLowerService.cs</code> file to the <code>Services/Interfaces</code> folder with the code below.</p>

   <code>namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Services.Interfaces
{
    public interface IRandomUpperAndLowerService
    {
        string RandomizeString(string input);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now add its implementation to the <code>Services</code> folder. Call this file <code>RandomUpperAndLowerService.cs</code> and add the code below to it.</p>

   <code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Services
{
    public class RandomUpperAndLowerService : Interfaces.IRandomUpperAndLowerService
    {
        public string RandomizeString(string input)
        {
            List&lt;char&gt; chars = new();
            var rand = new Random();

            foreach (var c in input.ToCharArray())
            {
                var next = rand.Next(0, 2);
                chars.Add(next == 0 ? char.ToUpper(c) : char.ToLower(c));
            }

            return new string(chars.ToArray());
        }
    }

 Register your services 

<p>It’s time to register your services so that you can use them in your application. Start by opening <code>Startup.cs</code> and replacing the code with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddControllersWithViews();

            services.Configure&lt;Settings.OktaConfiguration&gt;(Configuration.GetSection("Okta"));

            services.AddTransient&lt;Services.Interfaces.IRandomUpperAndLowerService, Services.RandomUpperAndLowerService&gt;();
            services.AddSingleton&lt;Services.Interfaces.INumberOfHitsService, Services.NumberOfHitsService&gt;();
            services.AddScoped&lt;Services.Interfaces.IOktaService, Services.OktaService&gt;();
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            else
            {
                app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
                // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
                app.UseHsts();
            }
            app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            app.UseStaticFiles();

            app.UseRouting();

            app.UseMiddleware&lt;Middleware.HitTracker&gt;();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
            {
                endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                    name: "default",
                    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>By default <code>Startup.cs</code> has 2 methods: a constructor (with a service injected into it!) and a property for <code>Configuration</code>.</p>

<p>The first question you may have is “Who injected IConfiguration into this class?” That work is handled by the boilerplate in <code>Program.cs</code>. Many developers never touch or look at this file. This is the application that calls <code>CreateDefaultBuilder</code>, which make <code>IHostEnvironment</code>, <code>IConfiguration</code>, and <code>IWebHostEnvironment</code> available to the <code>Startup</code> class. <code>ConfigureWebHostDefaults</code> will configure the <code>IHostBuilder</code> with the defaults for hosting a web application, including configuring the startup file to use.</p>

<p>The two methods in <code>Startup.cs</code> can cause some confusion.</p>

<p>Initially, <code>ConfigureServices</code> is called by the runtime, typically when the application first starts. This method will add services to the app container. The boilerplate code calls the extension method <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>. Under the hood, there is nothing special about this code. You can follow it <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/d40eea990edd1ac7205a983cbe4d13a71fd4ad68/src/Mvc/Mvc/src/MvcServiceCollectionExtensions.cs#L186">in the Asp.NET Core source code</a>.  You’ll see that, eventually, this adds several services related to rendering and displaying views, binding models and attributes to controllers, and controlling many other operations found in a web application. For example, you can follow the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/d40eea990edd1ac7205a983cbe4d13a71fd4ad68/src/Mvc/Mvc.DataAnnotations/src/DependencyInjection/MvcDataAnnotationsMvcCoreBuilderExtensions.cs#L76">data annotations code</a> to find a line of code that reads <code>services.TryAddSingleton&lt;IValidationAttributeAdapterProvider, ValidationAttributeAdapterProvider&gt;();</code>. This line looks remarkably similar to the code where you will add your services.</p>

<p>Next, you can configure your simple configuration. Set up the Okta section.</p>

   <code>services.Configure&lt;Settings.OktaConfiguration&gt;(Configuration.GetSection("Okta"));
</code>   

<p>This is the magic that will make your <code>OktaConfiguration</code> available in the options pattern you learned about above.</p>

<p>Finally, you have to register your three services. Each of these services has been registered with a different <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#service-lifetimes">service lifetime</a>.</p>

<p>First, you register the <code>RandomUpperAndLowerService</code> using the <code>AddTransient</code> extension method.</p>

   <code>services.AddTransient&lt;Services.Interfaces.IRandomUpperAndLowerService, Services.RandomUpperAndLowerService&gt;();
</code>   

<p>Transient services are created every time they are requested from the service container. These are recommended for lightweight, stateless services. At the end of each request, any transient services will be disposed of. In this example, the <code>RandomUpperAndLowerService</code> is stateless and lightweight, so transient is a lifetime for it.</p>

<p>Next, you registered the <code>NumberOfHitsService</code> as a singleton.</p>

   <code>services.AddSingleton&lt;Services.Interfaces.INumberOfHitsService, Services.NumberOfHitsService&gt;();
</code>   

<p>Singletons are created the first time they are requested. They are disposed of when the application is shut down. This means that the same instance of <code>NumberOfHitsService</code> will be available on every request. This is why you can store the number of hits in this class and have it keep count as long as your application continues to run. If you add a service as a singleton you must ensure that it is thread-safe. Also, singletons are more susceptible to memory leaks since  they are only disposed of when the application is closed.</p>

<p>The <code>OktaService</code>is the final service you’ll register for. It is added as a <code>Scoped</code> service.</p>

   <code>services.AddScoped&lt;Services.Interfaces.IOktaService, Services.OktaService&gt;();
</code>   

<p>A scoped service will be created when it’s requested and will be disposed of after each request is completed. This is common when using services like external APIs or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/entity-framework">Entity Framework</a>. The same instance of the <code>OktaService</code> will be used for each request to the server. For example, if you queried information about each user by creating a <code>GetUser</code> method in the <code>OktaService</code> and called it for every year, you would still only use one instance of the <code>OktaService</code>. Once the response is sent to the client, the service is disposed of and is not recreated until a new request for the service is received.</p>

<p><code>Configure</code> is used to configure your HTTP request pipeline. Essentially, each request will be impacted by the <code>Use*</code> statement in this pipeline. This code is boilerplate except for the line <code>app.UseMiddleware&lt;Middleware.HitTracker&gt;();</code>. At this moment, it will appear as aa compiler error for you, but you will fix that shortly. This is an extension method that configures your application to use custom middleware called <code>HitTracker</code>. You can write that next.</p>

 Using your services in middleware 

<p>Add a new folder called <code>Middleware</code> to your project. In it, add a file called <code>HitTracker.cs</code> and add the following middleware code.</p>

   <code>using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

using OktaDependencyInjection.Services.Interfaces;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Middleware
{
    public class HitTracker
    {
        private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
        private readonly INumberOfHitsService _numberOfHitsService;

        public HitTracker(RequestDelegate next, INumberOfHitsService numberOfHitsService)
        {
            _next = next;
            _numberOfHitsService = numberOfHitsService;
        }

        public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
        {
            _numberOfHitsService.NumberOfHits += 1;
            await _next(context);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Middleware is code that executes in your request pipeline. For example, authorizing a user is middleware. Before any controller code is called, your application will attempt to authorize the user and if that fails, it will handle an unauthorized user as instructed. If the user is unauthorized, there is no need to tie up resources calling controller code.</p>

<p>In Asp.NET Core, a middleware class is required to contain a public constructor with a parameter of type <code>RequestDelegate</code> and a public Method called <code>Invoke</code> or <code>InvokeASync</code>. This must return a task and accept a first parameter type of <code>HttpContext</code>.</p>

<p>Inject services from your service container into this by injecting them into the controller,  unless they are scoped dependencies. Middleware is constructed at app startup and has an application lifetime, which makes it a singleton. Scope validation dictates that you cannot inject a scoped dependency into a singleton, because it may unintentionally make the singleton not thread-safe. If you need to inject a scoped dependency like the <code>OktaService</code> you’ll need to inject it into the <code>Invoke</code> or <code>InvokeAsync</code> method, whichever you were using.</p>

<p>You are free to inject the <code>NumberOfHitsService</code> here because you can inject a singleton into a singleton. And because the <code>NumberOfHitsService</code> is a singleton, as long as your application doesn’t close, this code will keep track of the number of requests against the application since it began running. After updating the number of hits it will then call <code>_next</code>, which indicates to the app that it should run the next piece of middleware.</p>

 Using your services in controllers 

<p>The last step is to set up your <code>HomeController</code>. You will need to inject all of your services into this class to build the model for your home page.</p>

<p>Replace the code in <code>Controllers/HomeController.cs</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

using OktaDependencyInjection.Models;

using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

using OktaDependencyInjection.Services.Interfaces;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; _logger;
        private readonly INumberOfHitsService _numberOfHitsService;
        private readonly IOktaService _oktaService;
        private readonly IRandomUpperAndLowerService _randomUpperAndLowerService;

        public HomeController(
            ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; logger,
            INumberOfHitsService numberOfHitsService,
            IOktaService oktaService,
            IRandomUpperAndLowerService randomUpperAndLowerService)
        {
            _logger = logger;
            _numberOfHitsService = numberOfHitsService;
            _oktaService = oktaService;
            _randomUpperAndLowerService = randomUpperAndLowerService;
        }

        public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; IndexAsync()
        {
            var users = await _oktaService.GetUsersAsync();
            var hits = _numberOfHitsService.NumberOfHits;

            var appName = _randomUpperAndLowerService.RandomizeString("dependency injection with okta");

            HomeModel model = new HomeModel(appName, users, hits);

            return View(model);
        }

        public IActionResult Privacy()
        {
            return View();
        }

        [ResponseCache(Duration = 0, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None, NoStore = true)]
        public IActionResult Error()
        {
            return View(new ErrorViewModel { RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>ILogger</code> is boilerplate for all controller code. The other services are injected through the constructor like the middleware you set up. Controllers can accept singleton, transient, and scoped services. The first thing to do is grab a list of users from your <code>OktaService</code>. Next, get the <code>NumberOfHits</code> from the <code>NumberOfHitsService</code>. Finally, randomize a string for the title of your application. Return this in a model and let your view code handle the presentation.</p>

 Test your application 

<p>Start your application and you should see your homepage.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As you can see, the first time you visit the page you are presented with a wacky-looking title, a banner telling you that there has been one hit so far, and a list of users. In my case, I only have one user in my Okta account so it’s just me. Refresh this page five or six times.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you can see that the number of hits counter is up to six and the uppercase and lowercase letters on the title of the application are randomized differently. Success! All your services are set up correctly and working as intended.</p>

<p>From baby boomers to Gen Z, each successive generation is more comfortable with using technology tools to manage every aspect of their daily lives. Gen Z (born 1997-2012) only knows a world that’s almost completely digital. It’s no surprise then, to find out that Mastercard’s <a href="https://openbanking.mastercard.com/the-rise-of-open-banking">Rise of Open Banking</a> study showed that they were the most willing and eager to adopt cutting-edge fintech apps and services before older generations. Given that millennials have recently <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/28/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers-as-americas-largest-generation/">surpassed baby boomers</a> as the most populous generation in the U.S. and Canada, sensitivity to their financial needs and desires is critical for fintech developers and entrepreneurs, as well as banking sector incumbents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked about why you would use technology to manage finances, convenience is the top driver. The desire to try something new is motivation responsible for the biggest gap between younger and older generations. A full 28% of Gen Z and 33% of millennial consumers selected to try something new as the reason for using technology to manage finances. This compared to 21% of Gen X and 12% of boomers using technology because they wanted to try something new.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gen Z and millenials are also far more responsive to social pressure from their peers to adopt new technologies. Twenty-two percent of Gen Z consumers and 21% of millenials react to social pressure by adopting technology to manage finances, while only 8% of Gen X and 4% of boomers feel compelled to do the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having been born into a digital world, digital natives are unafraid to try a new payment app or digital lending service, just because it’s better than anything else available. They’re accustomed to the fast pace of technological development, and the accelerated life cycle of digital tools. Thirty percent of Gen Z and 34% of millennials have little hesitation to jump on board with newer, better offerings, as opposed to 23% of Gen X and 17% of boomers.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Next-Gen Use Cases Built to Serve Younger Generations 
<p>One of the newest, fastest-growing use cases powered by open banking is <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/september/mastercard-reinvents-installments-to-give-consumers-more-payment-choices-wherever-they-shop/">Buy Now, Pay Later</a>. BNPL is essentially a riff on layaway payment plans, where consumers gradually paid off a piece of merchandise before taking it home. BNPL apps and services allow users to have the merchandise right away, but split payments up over a short period of time, in many cases at zero percent interest. BNPL usage grew <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/buy-now-pay-later-gen-z-millennials/">an astounding 81.2%</a> from 2020 to 2021, with nearly 75% of BNPL users in the Gen Z and millennial cohort. They’re far more willing to adopt these new fintech tools, while Gen X and baby boomers trust a branded card over new digital innovations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some BNPL lenders are using open banking and consumer-permissioned data points to look beyond FICO scores to <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2021/buy-now-pay-later-redefines-credit-worthiness/">qualify borrowers</a>. This benefits consumers who have thin credit files, who can now establish a history of borrowing and repaying, without the traditional FICO barrier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young consumers are also loving the new wave of gamified digital banking experiences that open banking can enable. For a generation raised on video games, this is a natural fit. Gamification has been hugely successful in <a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/103616/banks-millennials-gen-z-personalization-loyalty-fintech-gamification/">education, health and fitness</a>, and is steadily growing in the <a href="https://financesonline.com/gamification-statistics/">finance sector</a>. Through challenges where the user can compete against others, themselves, or even <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/how-gamification-can-help-you-meet-financial-goals/">build a virtual world</a> to entice smart financial moves, next-gen apps and services are catering to the tastes, desires and motivations of younger consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that most of their daily lives take place on a mobile screen, it’s not surprising that Gen Z and millennials are far more likely to connect their bank accounts for digital payments. Recurring transactions like gym and streaming memberships, digital wallet top-ups, and even retail purchases are all use cases that young consumers are readily adopting to make direct digital payments.</p>
 Digital Banking Isn’t Trending, It’s the Future 
<p>Digital natives are driving innovation in the finance sector. A full <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/millennials-personal-finance/">78% of millennials</a> use mobile banking, and one-fourth of millennials now have their primary checking accounts in digital-only banks. Open banking platforms can empower these consumers to benefit from their data through a wide variety of third-party financial apps and services. These apps and services utilize that data to offer them the new money experiences they want in their financial lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As consumers adopt and demand more personalized digital tools to save time and money, and look to improve their financial outlook, our partners can leverage open banking solutions to drive stronger customer engagement and loyalty. Consumers should be at the center of the data experience, helping them feel more connected and in control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity’s Global Open Banking Platform is democratizing access to data, providing consumers with greater access to credit, payment choices, and convenient digital banking experiences. With their growing purchase power, this is what Gen Z and Millennial generations expect and demand, moving into the next evolution of financial apps and services.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs already maintains validator nodes in support of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/our-recent-upgrade-to-our-sovrin-network-validator-node-in-australia-supports-the-decentralized-identity-community/">Sovrin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/anonyome-labs-joins-the-indicio-mainnet/">Indicio</a>&nbsp;networks. Recently we increased our contribution to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials by becoming a founding member of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cheqd.io/">cheqd</a>&nbsp;production network. With more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bosch.com/stories/self-sovereign-identities/">companies leveraging SSI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.egovernment.ch/en/umsetzung/schwerpunktplan/elektronische-identitat/">governments beginning to implement them</a>, large-scale public adoption of these technologies appears to be around the corner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is particularly interested in new economic models for SSI technologies and infrastructures that can amplify adoption by end-users, businesses, and governments. Economic incentives provide a way for validators to be rewarded for running the network and for issuers of verifiable credentials to be rewarded for issuing credentials. The adoption of these new economic models in turn increases the amount of SSI credentials in circulation, making it increasingly easier, more efficient, and more secure for organizations to get trusted data from the consenting identity subject. These financial incentives are a clear driver for transition from centralized and federated identity systems to an SSI ecosystem.</p>



 What are verifiable credentials? 



<p></p>



<p>In short, they are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically. Their use cases include checking the validity of travel visas, healthcare certificates, airline tickets, credit score checks and credentials for opening a bank account. Three parties take place in the verifiable credential workflow: the&nbsp;issuer&nbsp;digitally signs a document and sends it to the&nbsp;holder&nbsp;which can then present their credential (to W3C specifications) to a&nbsp;verifier.&nbsp;A verifier checks presented credentials and verifies the contained authority, validity, and tamper-proof characteristics of the credential. If validity conditions are met and the presented credential contains the required claims, the holder is granted access to an associated resource or service.</p>



 Why do we need tokens for SSI? 



<p></p>



<p>Currently the main method of paying for verifiable credentials is through conventional payment networks. This has several drawbacks as mentioned in Sovrin’s&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Protocol-and-Token-White-Paper.pdf#Sovrin-Whitepaper-v5b.indd%3ABut%20today%2C%20the%20only%20option%20for%20paying%20for%20verifiable%20credentials%20is%20conventional%20payment%20networks%3A132">whitepaper</a>, where:</p>



  markets are restricted to only the highest value credentials  current issuers are at risk of data breaches  credentials are not privacy respecting.&nbsp;<br>  



<p>Since third-party identification issuers (such as credit bureaus) charge a fee to verify a user’s identity, it can be assumed that paying for credentials will remain a fundamental element of SSI. Tokens act as a solution to this problem, with&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/sovrin-foundation-launches-test-token-for-decentralized-identity-network/">Sovrin having already designed and tested tokens for their network (but not put them into production).</a></p>



 <a href="https://www.cheqd.io/ssi-self-sovereign-identity-explained">What is cheqd?</a> 



<p></p>



<p>cheqd’s network is bult on the Cosmos blockchain with a dedicated token for payment which enables new business models for verifiers, holders and issuers. In these business models, verifiable credentials are exchanged in a trusted, reusable, safer, and cheaper way — alongside a customizable fee.&nbsp;</p>



 How cheqd uses tokenomics&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>cheqd employs concepts of tokenomics on top of governance which sets it apart from the Sovrin network. With any of the three participants – holders, validators, and issuers – capable of receiving tokens as an incentive, it promotes participation and accountability, which will facilitate a greater adoption of the technology and SSI as a whole. This allows users to reclaim their privacy, and organizations to build their reputation and reduce the potential for fraudulent credentials. The value of $CHEQ depends on&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/cheqds-tokenomics-for-ssi-explained-part-2-c4ecfc32b813">several factors</a>&nbsp;including overall cryptocurrency market health, cheqd protocol resilience and the real-world implementation of use cases by SSI vendors.</p>



 cheqd’s choice of SDK 



<p></p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.sovrin.org/hyperledger-welcomes-project-indy-77e8b2c62dcf">2017 Sovrin open sourced their codebase to Hyperledger Indy</a>&nbsp;which&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/indy_network_transaction_wizard/">Indicio builds upon to provide its services and network</a>. Hyperledger Indy is a collection of tools, libraries and further components for digital identities rooted on blockchains. It’s important to note that tokens are not natively supported; in fact Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director of the Hyperledger Project, mentioned in an interview that “<a href="https://www.eweek.com/cloud/hyperledger-blockchain-project-is-not-about-bitcoin/">you’ll never see a Hyperledger coin</a>” and “by not pushing a currency, we avoid so many political challenges of having to maintain a globally consistent currency.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>cheqd’s network is built on the&nbsp;<a href="https://tendermint.com/sdk/">Cosmos SDK</a>&nbsp;which has&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/advanced-concepts/building-on-cosmos">several benefits</a>. They include Cosmos’s identity capabilities, easily customizable token behavior, on-ledger voting for governance frameworks and smart contract functionality. cheqd’s&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/master/intro/why-app-specific.html">application-specific blockchain</a>&nbsp;implementation addresses the shortcomings of smart contracts by building a full-node client, a light-client, and all the necessary interfaces (CLI, REST, etc.) to interact with the nodes. These reasons make Cosmos a viable solution as an SDK since the added benefits that tokenomics bring allows cheqd to develop a network for SSI applications.&nbsp;</p>



 cheqd DID method 



<p></p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are cryptographically proven, verifiable and decentralized digital identities. DIDs are designed to be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers and certificate authorities. A DID can refer to any subject, entity, organization, thing, data model or abstract entity as specified by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-controllers">DID controller</a>. Where DIDs come into play is their ability to be stored on the blockchain as a public verifiable data registry. These immutable records can be queried for the authenticity/validity of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/gentle-introduction-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credential</a>&nbsp;to see who issued without consulting the issuer.<br></p>



<p>cheqd has&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/node/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-cheqd-did-method">proposed</a>&nbsp;that it will build on Hyperledger Indy DID method, renaming&nbsp;<a href="https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/transactions.html#nym">NYM</a>&nbsp;transactions to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> transactions and removing&nbsp;roles&nbsp;to move from a&nbsp;public-permissioned&nbsp;network to&nbsp;public-permissionless.</p>



 The Anonyome validator configuration 



<p></p>



<p>Because of the potential advantages of having a token as part of the decentralized identity network, Anonyome Labs has configured and brought online its own&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.cheqd.io/validator/cheqdvaloper1djh8syeug9ylw7v8ca6jvq3s59klzmm4fm949w">validator</a>. We use Amazon Web Services to deploy our validator, however the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/node/docs/setup-and-configure">cheqd-noded software can be run by other hosting providers or even locally</a>.</p>



<p>To successfully become part of the cheqd production network and have an operational validator, we:</p>



  set up an AWS elastic cloud (EC2) instance running Ubuntu 20.04  configured a virtual private cloud (VPC) using security groups at the network interface level to act as a firewall  enabled automatic backups via AMI policies  created custom SNS topic to Slack notifications for outlier detection within CloudWatch Metrics.  



 AWS elastic cloud (EC2) 



<p></p>



<p>To run the cheqd validator installation we currently use a t3.small EC2 with the Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS (HVM) image. The storage is split across two EBS volumes: a 10GB EBS volume for the operating system and cheqd software and another 150GB EBS for the cheqd home directory containing the increasingly large data directory which stores the ledger.</p>



<p>Both disks are encrypted, and the 150 GB volume is mounted within the operating system and set as the home directory for the cheqd user account.</p>



 Virtual private cloud (VPC) 



<p></p>



<p>The VPC security groups are configured to whitelist inbound and outbound traffic, only allowing specific access to SSH, RPC and HTTP/HTTPS ports from pre-determined IP addresses. Deliberately specifying which traffic the validator allows/expects reduces the potential for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. An elastic-IP connects to the EC2 instance which grants the validator a static IP.</p>



 AMI backup policies 



<p></p>



<p>To ensure swift recovery from any outages, attacks or node misconfigurations, an EBS-backed AMI policy has been put in place to make daily and monthly backups. These backups create live snapshots of the system such that when the validator must be restored, it resumes from the snapshot’s instance state. This aims to minimize downtime on the network and the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/tokenomics/slashing-explained">slashing penalties</a>&nbsp;that incur. When restoring from an AMI, the validator only needs to catch up from its latest block height and match that of the networks rather than a new validator which would have to catch up from the beginning, potentially saving days of downtime.&nbsp;</p>



 SNS topic to Slack notifications 



<p></p>



<p>Enabling telemetry via Slack notifications allows for real-time error handling and informative reporting on the status and health of our validator. This minimizes the risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the node through notifying problem-specific alerts which can be acted on immediately.</p>



<p>Some of the triggers our system looks out for are:</p>



  abnormally high resource usage (CPU, RAM, NetIO)  unusual cheqd network statistics (no validators on the network)  security alerts (unauthorized access)  general instance status metrics.  



 Future plans 



<p></p>



<p>With new technologies come new challenges and by nature many learnings and improvements are discovered. While we have our&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.cheqd.io/validator/cheqdvaloper1djh8syeug9ylw7v8ca6jvq3s59klzmm4fm949w">node</a>&nbsp;actively validating, there are several improvements that we are making to our system architecture to tighten security and reduce the risk of downtime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upgrading the network to a multi-node&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/validators.html#setting-up-a-validator">sentry-validator architecture&nbsp;</a>allows for stronger protection from DOS attacks and other threats which can be mitigated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/honey-pot">honeypots</a>. Although more complex than a single validator instance, the benefit of reduced downtime in the case of an attack ensures a lower risk of slashing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to reduce the risk of lost or stolen tokens earned through validating, we aim to use a cold-wallet backup solution. The implementation will include further steps to tighten security, such as multi-factor authentication, hardware cold-wallets and internal auditing, which in turn minimizes the attack vector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other future considerations may include securing validator keys using a&nbsp;<a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/encryption/hardware-security-modules">HSM</a>&nbsp;or other implementations which secure the&nbsp;<a href="https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a>&nbsp;keys used by&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/validators.html#validator-keys">Tendermint Core</a>. These improvements and alterations to the validator are first performed on our Testnet node before they are applied to the Mainnet. Since Testnet tokens have no actual value, they can be used to develop, test, and deploy security changes without having the risks associated with making changes on the Mainnet validator.</p>

Together with NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) it’s dominating the news since 2021. But what is the noise all about, and why is the criticism from the regulators so loud?&nbsp;</p>



 What is DeFi?&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralized finance means financial services or instruments which are not managed by a central company or authority, but rather operated on a form of blockchain or DLT. Essentially, DeFi allows users to directly interact with a product or service without any intermediaries. By being open, borderless and permissionless, DeFi wants to democratize financial services and make them accessible for everybody in this world.&nbsp;</p>



 Limitless potential: The future of finance.&nbsp; 



<p>DeFi means much more than just <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">cryptocurrencies</a> and payments. It is expected that DeFi will replicate all forms of assets, financial instruments and contracts that exist in traditional finance today. Furthermore, the advanced technologies are creating the opportunity for entirely new financial services and products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The risk: When AML meets anonymity.&nbsp; 



<p>In the beginnings of crypto, many of the early crypto exchanges did not require a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC check</a>. Not without reason, crypto had and for some parts still has a negative stigma around money laundering and cyberfraud. What’s more convenient than an anonymized and fully digital cryptocurrency with little to no AML monitoring?&nbsp;</p>



 Is DeFi the new wild west?&nbsp; 



<p>The unregulated times of crypto are long gone, at least for central providers. Following the rising popularity and increasing mass adoption, the financial authorities caught up and included crypto into existing laws. Some countries even created new rules, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/crypto-license-guide/">crypto custody license in Germany</a>. However, through the rise of DeFi, the industry is on the best way of turning back into the wild west.</p>



 How is DeFi different from other crypto services?&nbsp; 



<p>The straight answer is: control. While the offered services might be the same at first sight, there is a huge difference in governance. While a crypto exchange like Coinbase or Bitpanda is operated by a company with a legal entity, decentral exchanges, like Uniswap, are not controlled by a central company or entity. In consequence, there is no single entity to be governed or sued.&nbsp;</p>



 How unregulated DeFi puts the image of crypto at risk.&nbsp; 



<p>Open, borderless, permissionless – for the same reasons DeFi offers limitless opportunities, it brings along the same amount of risk of money laundering and fraud. In our traditional financial systems, central institutions and governing authorities were created to prevent fraud and ultimately create trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e6e7d9d6-7778-4286-ba6f-e5831fcbc538">Regulators are struggling</a> to comprehend and process DeFi applications without institutions or intermediaries. In consequence, the international Financial Action Task Force (FATF) published a <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html">new guidance for virtual asset service providers (VASP)</a> with a new focus on DeFi. In their guidance, the FATF is essentially recommending its members to crack down on DeFi without a KYC check and proper AML monitoring.&nbsp;</p>



 KYC does not mean centralization.&nbsp; 



<p>Critics say that any form of KYC would transform a DeFi application into a centralized service. However, that is not necessarily true, as the KYC check does not need to be performed by a central entity. Instead, DeFi protocols could create the mechanisms to allow trusted third parties, like identity providers, to perform the KYC and verify the holder of a crypto wallet. Based on the successful identity verification and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML screening</a>, a wallet address could be whitelisted. This way a DeFi protocol could remain decentralized, but the trust and security would increase tremendously.&nbsp;</p>



 DeFi is global, but regulation is local.&nbsp; 



<p>One of the key benefits of DeFi is it being borderless and accessible to everybody on the internet. At the same time, traditional finance is centralized and financial and AML regulations highly local. To onboard and service customers from all around the world, you not only need partners that can handle a large variety of identity documents, but also comply with the respective country-specific AML regulations.&nbsp;</p>



 How KYC could boost DeFi mass adoption.&nbsp; 



<p>Corporate users and institutional investors require compliant solutions in order to comply with their own regulation. For example, big players like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/07/28/uniswap-says-its-talking-with-paypal-robinhood-and-more-in-deleted-video/">PayPal and Robinhood are asking Uniswap</a>, the largest decentralized exchange, as well as OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace, to implement mandatory KYC checks before they can integrate the services. Therefore, complying with KYC and AML regulation would open up DeFi to new user groups and hence boost mass adoption.&nbsp;</p>



 The light side: DeFi plus KYC &amp; AML.&nbsp; 



<p>Ultimately, the discussion about KYC or not, will split DeFi into a light and a dark side. It’s now upon DeFi protocols and their developers to decide on which side they want to play. Those who intend to join the light side should look into implementing KYC checks into their protocols, before the regulators will crack down on DeFi for good.&nbsp;</p>

It is true that people in the decentralized field are increasingly interested in DAOs, but the development of DAOs still faces difficulties. Ontology community members believed that implanting DID in DAOs can eliminate “centralization” based on digital assets to a certain extent. DID can encourage DAO members to become more active, and balanced decision-making between the development team and ordinary&nbsp;members.  The Ontology Chinese Community <a href="https://twitter.com/ontologycn/status/1485878035580854273?s=21">Twitter</a> was live to track more information and progress of Ontology.

Global News   Ontology published the <a href="https://twitter.com/ontologynetwork/status/1487975370552791040?s=21">DAO 101</a> series on twitter, discussing a key point in DAO governance: What kind of incentives should be set up? Ontology proposed the following solution: Set up a DID with a reputation scoring system for each DAO member. When you enter a DAO, you need to first register/own a DID and submit certain verifications (authorization through encryption to protect privacy), such as on-chain/off-chain assets, whether you have similar experience or capabilities, and so on. After verification, you will be given an initial value and mark to help you better participate in&nbsp;DAO.  Ontology cooperates with the famous media <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1489844335205965828?s=20&amp;t=5KziQ6PiyZB8JI7wNwJI8A">Blockster</a>, users can now keep up-to-date with Ontology news via the Blockster platform.

That includes securing the enrollment process and taking a multi-layered approach to verifying and authenticating identity throughout the customer lifecycle. From enrollment to payment, managing change events to ongoing KYC and compliance. ”</p><p>For the above requirements, Ontology’s DID and data solutions provide reliable technology. ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework based on the W3C commendations for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, using blockchain and cryptographic technology, that can quickly identify and connect people, data, and services. It is decentralized, self-sovereign, privacy-preserving, and easy to use, enabling users to fully control their own data and identities. At present, Ontology’s DID and data solutions can be seamlessly integrated into many platforms and applications, and have served many enterprises and platforms.

Once completed, you can submit your proposal to our forum:&nbsp;<a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-15/75">Port</a>.</p><p>As a voter, Port is where you can see all proposal details and cast an informed&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Proposals that meet the basic criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO receive funding in&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Project Standing</p><p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing. This enables eligibility in upcoming Funding Rounds. Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p><p>Funding Tiers</p><p>To continue incentivizing completion and outcomes we are continuing Funding Tiers, which can be achieved by Teams delivering on their grant promises.</p><p>The funding tiers&nbsp;are:</p>  New Project    Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $20,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>4. Veteran&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $35,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 5 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>Above are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects by projects in OceanDAO. The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the first three groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  24,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  12,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  134,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>A total of 200k OCEAN is available.</p><p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>If you are interested in contributing to Ocean Protocol there are earmarked Core Tech Initiatives that are being continuously expanded upon. You can <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#4-build--improve-core-ocean-software-core-tech-initiatives-earmark">view them inside our&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p><p>You can find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech Working Group discord&nbsp;channel</a>.</p><p>Unleash Data&nbsp;Category</p><p>In Round 13 we have revised the Unleash Data Category to have the same rules as the rest of the Funding Categories. They can qualify again for funding up to 35,000 OCEAN conditional that Unleash Data projects:</p>  “Unleash data” has actually always had a broad intent, towards driving Data Consume Volume. It is intended for projects like: becoming a data broker to get data owners’ data into Ocean Market, networking / “hitting the phones” to increase consumption on Ocean Market, integrating Filecoin &amp; publishing data on Ocean Market, etc. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#3-unleash-data">Here are further examples</a>. It was never meant to be solely for constructing / maintaining a small number of datasets.  Whatever is proposed should be high value-add to the Ocean ecosystem.  Example of poor value-add: requesting a lot of OCEAN to construct / maintain a small number of datasets to sell with expectation of profit. We expect and encourage OceanDAO voters to downvote such proposals.  <p>Burning becomes Recycling</p><p>Starting Round 13, any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the Treasury.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">For intuition on how burning relates to voting in OceanDAO</a>.</p><p>You can find all the steps&nbsp;below:</p>  [Earmarked Grants] winners are counted&nbsp;first.  Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  Any remaining funds inside an Earmark, are then moved towards [General&nbsp;Grants]  [New &amp; Core Tech] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Categories].  Returning teams are eligible to be funded from [General&nbsp;Grants].  50% or more “Yes” Votes receive a&nbsp;grant.  Any remaining funds inside the [General Grants] Category are moved back to the treasury.  <p>Quadratic Voting</p><p>Quadratic Voting has shipped in Round&nbsp;14!</p><p>You can now visit the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/web3Tools">Web3 Portal</a>, register yourself with BrightID and receive a voting&nbsp;boost.</p><p>Voter Delegation</p><p>In Round 15, we will be introducing Voter Delegation to our grants&nbsp;program.</p><p>Participants will now be able delegate decision making, and easily assign their voting power to other addresses.</p><p>We look forward to having more votes unlocked inside OceanDAO, and contributors acting as delegates while stewarding positive outcomes in the ecosystem.</p><p>Working Groups</p><p>Head to the <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">Ocean Discord</a> and dive into each Working Group. There you will find each Working Group’s respective documents, stewards, members list, meeting times, and&nbsp;more:</p>  Project Guiding Working&nbsp;Group  Parameters &amp; Roadmap Working&nbsp;Group  Core Tech Working&nbsp;Group  OceanDAO Engineering Working&nbsp;Group  Data Consume Volume Working&nbsp;Group  Ambassadors Working&nbsp;Group  <p>Working Group&nbsp;Outline</p>  Each Working Group has its own public discord sub-channel. Then, each Working Group can leverage real-time discord channels (voice/video).  Each Working Group has its own membership + working&nbsp;process.  Each Working Group has a weekly or bi-weekly call.  Each Working Group has Stewards (who’s accountable to run the group), and Members (people who participate and contribute).  <p>Town Hall</p><p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Town-Hall">Town Hall</a> has been running weekly since the beginning of OceanDAO. Currently the DAO is expanding and with this growth so will the Town&nbsp;Hall.</p><p>Town Hall will be a structured presentation and expand its scope to include the entire Ocean Ecosystem where each Working Group presents slides on their current progress and&nbsp;updates</p><p>Deadlines</p>  Proposals Submission Deadline is March 1st at midnight&nbsp;GMT  Add OCEAN to Voting Wallet by the Proposal Submission Deadline.

<p>It’s no longer safe to use only a secured network or to just put your systems behind a firewall. Cybercriminals are constantly searching for loopholes in digital processes where personal — especially healthcare — information is available. When it comes to healthcare information, the vulnerabilities outnumber the safety measures that have been implemented. The cost of healthcare fraud is $68 billion USD every year, which is about 3% of the nation’s entire healthcare spending! Hackers can extort millions from a single data breach, which makes service providers easy targets. Healthcare providers store highly confidential and private patient data, which cannot be protected using passwords alone.</p>



<p>A crucial sore spot that has put healthcare services on the radar of e-criminals is the use of outdated technology in hospitals and other medical institutions. This archaic technology provides a broader surface for cyber attacks. The software that is most widely used has almost no security layers at all. One example that illustrates the magnitude of loss is the over 5 million health records that were breached in August 2021 alone across just 38 incidents. Weak IT networks at medical facilities open doors for all kinds of cyber threats, including malware, viruses, and ransomware attacks.</p>



<a href="https://imageware.io/resource/healthcare/"></a>



<p>Though the lack of advanced security solutions is a major deficiency in healthcare risk management systems today, there are some big challenges faced in other areas of healthcare, too. For example, administrative staff at hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed with mismanaged online information, such as health and insurance records and staff information.</p>



<p>Switching to <a href="https://imageware.io/resource/healthcare/">digital identity</a> is no longer a choice – it’s a necessity – especially when the e-healthcare sector is currently undergoing such a highly volatile phase with constant pressure to deliver fast and high-quality services. However, 99% of attacks can be prevented by using biometric multi-factor authentication. To ensure safe and effective patient care, healthcare technology professionals must work towards incorporating these reliable security tools to create a zero-trust security approach.</p>



<p>Biometrics plays an increasingly important role in reducing identity fraud and protecting healthcare data by establishing highly secure, controlled access to medical records. Replace usernames and passwords with Imageware’s biometric MFA, a seamless and more secure way to access your systems.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thank you for joining. Today, we’ll have now a conversation with an entrepreneur in the tech industry that is not directly connected in the identity industry, but they are very innovative company and the CEO has a very interesting story to tell us.</p>
<p>So let’s welcome Aran Khanna. He has been labelled many things. A thought leader, an innovator and at times, a troublemaker. Now, in his search to give technological control back to the developers and business leaders, he has added cloud management entrepreneur to that list, as being the co-founder and CEO of Archera, a company that helps organisations find cloud solutions that fit their companies.</p>
<p>Hello, Aran.</p>
<p>Aran Khanna: Hi, Oscar. Thanks so much for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome to the show. Let’s talk about digital identity. But of course, first of all, we want to hear your story, a bit of your journey, how, since the beginning of your career, you end up in this world of – you tell us about your company, and also about identity, please tell us.</p>
<p>Aran: I can tell the short version here, I don’t want to bore you guys with a 30-minute background. But in short, I was born and raised in Seattle, I’ve really grown up all my life around technology. Both my folks worked at Amazon and Microsoft in the early days. And my first foray into technology was actually working at, funnily enough full circle, at the cloud provider that was soon to become Azure, it was called something different back then. But essentially started in that world. Really, from there, I started to get really interested in digital privacy as myself and all of my friends at college and high school were migrating all of our communications, all of our financial activity on to platforms like Facebook, Venmo, Twitter, etc., Instagram, right?</p>
<p>And I started to think a little bit about particularly the data leakage that was coming out of that sort of migration of really society, and started my journey as a privacy researcher in college working with the former FTC CTO Latanya Sweeney on a number of projects, including one very well-known one that actually got me fired from Facebook for revealing some pretty invasive defaults that they had in their platform around location sharing.</p>
<p>From there, I actually went into machine learning research, there was very interesting story behind that, but really started working on fundamental deep learning research, and actually then got pulled right back into the cloud world when AWS acquired that team that was working on to become their internal deep learning team. We launched a number of products at Amazon. And I started again, to start seeing this disconnect between platform users and the platforms themselves and the rules they were putting forward, similarly to what I was looking at in the privacy space, but really around financials in the cloud space.</p>
<p>And that’s when I spun off and started this company Archera to help customers, just like I did in the privacy space and the social media space, understand data leakage, and how platform incentives were not aligned with them, and how they had to orient their behavior to correct against that, trying to apply that sort of thinking into the B2B space with businesses who are migrating to the clouds, and trying to parse the incredible complexity of pricing and the different offering types on the cloud service provider platforms.</p>
<p>So in a nutshell, that’s sort of the arc of the journey. There’s obviously a lot more detail in there. But really, I’ve touched identity and access management and identity and privacy more broadly, both on the consumer side and the business side throughout that journey. So excited to chat more about that with you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, thank you. And definitely your company, Archera, sounds very interesting. As you said, also, that the case of data there in cloud platforms that are becoming, well inevitably, most of cases, most services require some level of cloud. And also something that I was also checking your website about finding the right model, so you can save money on that is interesting. Sometimes it feels like, in my own case, I feel that the cloud providers make it difficult to find how to save money just by using the elements on the cloud. And also about yourself, I went actually to search just put Aran Khanna on using DuckDuckGo. And first of all, I think you’re the most famous if not the only Aran Khanna I have found.</p>
<p>Aran: I think I might be the only one – so the least and the most famous one.</p>
<p>Oscar: If not the only one, the most famous for sure, all the top 10 entries are about you. And yeah, a few of them talk about your Facebook story. So tell us a bit more about that.</p>
<p>Aran: That’s a real fun one. So actually, at that time, I was in college in 2015 at Harvard, and studying computer science. I had actually not started doing my privacy research yet. This was one of the things that catalysed that world of research and projects that I did, but I was learning how to develop web applications and extensions at the time. And what was interesting is all of my friends at Harvard had migrated to using Facebook Messenger on their mobile devices largely – this was 2015.</p>
<p>What was interesting about the product was every time one person would send a message to another person, the default behaviour of the application, you have to go into the settings deep and turn this off – was that it would attach your location to that message. And this wouldn’t matter if you’re in a one-on-one chat with friends, or a massive group chat with 200 people in a class, and you’re constantly texting back and forth, your location was actually being leaked and revealed.</p>
<p>And what I started to think about was, “Hey, wouldn’t it be in the user’s best interest to understand that this default is on. And it’s not just one-off location data points being shared, there’s so much information given the volume of chat that’s happening here, that you can actually build an incredibly detailed picture of someone’s historical locations, their future locations, given their routine, and really come up with some fairly invasive data if you aggregated this.</p>
<p>So that was sort of my hypothesis. And I thought this was something that users would be really happy to know about, Facebook would be really happy if I actually kind of built something that helped people understand this data leakage, and then showed them where the knobs were to control it if they thought it was a problem.</p>
<p>So I went ahead, move fast and break things, and built this Chrome extension and wrote a blog post alongside it. The Chrome extension was called Marauder’s Map, you know, just like in Harry Potter, if you’ve read the books, there was a map where Harry and other folks would actually use it to track people’s live locations around the castle. And very similarly, people say Harvard looks like Hogwarts a little bit, I was able to build a little prototype where I could actually stalk my friends around Harvard campus using this Chrome extension.</p>
<p>So I wrote up that story, released the extension. And really, the point was to educate users, educate what I thought were the customers of the Facebook platform on this very interesting design decision, this product decision that might be affecting them and something they may want to turn off. So I thought this was a great thing for Facebook users, for Facebook as a company, I released it. And at the same time, I actually had an internship lined up at Facebook on a completely different team, on newsfeed ranking, which funnily enough became the source of a whole another set of controversies years later, with respect to echo chambers and digital amplification and misinformation.</p>
<p>But what happened was right before I was supposed to join Facebook, right before I was supposed to start my internship, the VP of Engineering and the Head of HR called me up and said, “Hey, by releasing that extension, you didn’t act in our best interest as a company, so we’re going to let you go.” And this was the Friday before I was supposed to start my internship, I had a place already booked in California and paid for and it was quite a rug pull.</p>
<p>And I think that whole journey really taught me a few key things. I think, first and foremost, it taught me a lot about Facebook’s culture, and that they do not see the people who are using the platform, you and me, as users or customers. They view us as cattle, that is more likely to be happy when the wool is pulled over our eyes versus transparency about how the platform operates being given to us.</p>
<p>And the other thing I realised was that this is a pervasive problem, that is not just a Facebook issue. If we have more and more of our lives moving online to these sorts of platforms, often the incentives of the users are misaligned with growth incentives, and the incentives of the platform, which are really not just to suck all the data out of users, but also to reveal that data publicly in a way that benefits their growth in some advantageous manner.</p>
<p>So that was one of the things that I think it really launched me into looking more deeply at these privacy issues throughout the tech industry. And then really focusing a few years of my life doing research there and additional projects, just like the Marauder’s Map Project with companies like Venmo to reveal all of the issues around the transparency with which these platforms operate, particularly with respect to customer data.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s a very interesting story. I’m sure you learned a lot about that. And it’s interesting that as you explained that, so the user, if the user was curious enough or observant enough, would see the location just in front of his or her eyes, correct?</p>
<p>Aran: Correct. You just have to click on the message and the exact location it was sent from was attached. So all you really needed was a piece of paper and a pencil to go and do this by hand. I just happen to do it programmatically and release an application to help customers do this. So they could make the decision for themselves, whether or not this was something that should be left on or turned off.</p>
<p>Oscar: You also mentioned the example of Venmo. I know you have shown also in some of your blog post Venmo is, I think not so familiar here at least in Finland, I think it’s an app for splitting the bills, right? When you buy something together with your friends?</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, it’s more generally like peer-to-peer payment. The way that they really came at it was it was a mobile-first peer-to-peer payment solution that had a very big social component to it. And I believe the company thought the social component was a big part of their growth. So what they did was that by default, when you sign up for Venmo, and you know, if your friend wants to pay you back for a meal, you have to sign up for Venmo. All transactions that you put into the system, become default public and actually show up on a global news feed.</p>
<p>And the thinking and I saw a number of talks from folks at the company including their Chief Growth Officer saying the thinking behind this was, the more people who share the more people see them sharing and the more the company grows. So even if it wasn’t in the user’s best interest to share all of their financial transactions with friends. And I did a very similar project where I went back, added up all of those transactions and built a map to show things like who’s your best friend, who are you going on dates with, what clubs are you a part of, etc. But the user, basically, it may not be in their best interest to share all this stuff publicly. But by default, they make it very difficult to turn off, and it helps the business grow.</p>
<p>So that was another instantiation of the same problem. And I think it’s intertwined with identity moving to the net, in that era, right, in the 2010s, people started to use their real names on the internet. And now that identity was tied to these things in such a tight way, you could really get fairly clear signal about specific individuals from all of this public data that these platforms were in a sense, forcing them to reveal by hiding defaults and controls behind different layers of friction.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, for instance, the case of Facebook, that map you created, it was in 2015, now we are 2022 so a few years forward, so how – today, if you still continue with social media for a bit while, social media platforms are doing better in data privacy?</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, I think the target has shifted a little bit. I think the major things that happen were things like GDPR, between 2015 and now, and honestly, I don’t think it was very effective. I think from a privacy standpoint, the most effective thing has been increased scrutiny, and increased public awareness of these issues. And hopefully, my projects and other journalists writing on this actually did something to catalyse that.</p>
<p>But what I’m seeing now, and what I’m most concerned about now is actually, even if the data on people is not being publicly revealed to the world, for the purposes of growth, or inadvertently through features like location sharing in Messenger, what I’m really concerned about is how that data that’s now been collected even internally in a secure database is being used with things like machine learning algorithms to actually manipulate people at a much broader scale.</p>
<p>So I think the ball has shifted a little bit on where my concern is. I don’t think the privacy issue is necessarily completely solved or rectified. But I think it’s not the most pressing issue of the day, because there are other issues that are downstream from that, that are also causing large, inordinate impact and likely have to be addressed before we even go back and address the privacy issue. And that kind of brings me to why I even started researching machine learning in the first place coming out of 2015.</p>
<p>Oscar: So that was one of your drivers to go deeper into machine learning.</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, I think after seeing the amount of data just being leaked, it was very clear how much data was being collected. And the natural consequence of that data collection to me was OK, I know who you are, I know all this data associated with you. And I have a cohort of folks who look like you, can I not build models and experimentation to do things that are basically not in your best interest as a user?</p>
<p>I think it’s a very similar sort of thought process I went through on the privacy side, which is how are these platforms going to use these technologies in ways that are not aligned with customers or their users. And how do I help users actually navigate that? Educate them about it, so they can make informed decisions on what they use and how things are used against them.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how social media platforms currently handle more broadly, identity management?</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, that’s a very interesting topic, because I think it varies broadly between platforms, right? Working on Venmo, I think the places with the highest fidelity kind of identity mapping are, by necessity, these social cross financial platforms where you need KYC AML, to actually enter into the gates, you need to upload your ID to be a member of Square Cash or Venmo. So from that perspective, I think there’s sort of a bifurcation where you have these strongly enforced identity social platforms, largely correlated with some regulatory requirement.</p>
<p>And then you have these much more weakly enforced platforms, things like Twitter, and Instagram, and Facebook, where you see even today, huge issues with identity, with bots, with harassment. And I think that it’s not a one brush that you can paint the whole space with. There’s a lot of nuance there. And I think identity plays a different role in different places around the social ecosystem today that is really dependent on what the goal of that underlying social platform is and sort of what regulatory regime it operates under.</p>
<p>Oscar: And if go a bit broader, not only on social media platform, but any company that has users, many tech companies, how do you think from your perspective, of course, you have your own company, you might have an idea how the companies do on that side, but other companies who have services/applications are handling the identity management?</p>
<p>Aran: I think there’s a few questions in there, right. One is how are these companies, these technology companies, many of which we serve, we serve social media companies, B2B companies, kind of all over the space of technology, how do they handle internal identity and access management for their engineers, for their employees? And then how do they handle user data and identity for their customers?</p>
<p>Again, I think the customers piece is something that varies a lot more, because it’s a function of trying to have minimum friction, while meeting regulatory requirements at the space, the FinTechs that we work with obviously have much, much tighter regulations around their customer data, where it can be stored, the keys that manage it, so heavy usage of KMS and other services within the cloud providers that assist with that sort of process.</p>
<p>And on the other side, what’s heartening is seeing a lot of the internal practices around engineering teams, regardless of what the company is doing standardised with respect to identity and access management So we see lots of folks using internal SSO providers now, I think that’s the majority of our customers, whether or not they’re in the B2B or B2C space, we see widespread usage of KMS, and other custodial encryption services that help encrypt data at rest. And I think in flight as well, though, a lot of cloud providers have done a really good job of, by default, encrypting data in flight within their networks.</p>
<p>And I think what we’re seeing as well is with a lot more focus, particularly in the B2B space, on things like SOC 2 Compliance and ISO Compliance in Europe, a much more standard operating model for engineering teams with respect to when passwords are rotated, who has access to what, you know, are people all sharing the same account, the login, the stuff. A lot of that gets hammered out with these broader certification schemes.</p>
<p>So I think in the enterprise space, specifically with how customers‘ data is being managed, there’s variance, but internally with respect to how identity is being enforced, within organisations, for the internal teams, we’re seeing a lot more standardisation. And I think that’s very heartening. It’s showing a much greater level of maturity entering into the space. And obviously, that raises the bar for everyone in terms of security.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, as you know, many service providers – mixing the topic with the social media, again – many use social media authentication, what’s your opinion on that, the use of that and how, for the ones who use it, what could you say are good practices?</p>
<p>Aran: I think that’s a mixed topic again, because frankly, from my perspective, I view login with Facebook and login with Google, even though they’re both technically social logins for consumers, as very, very different. And I think it really goes back to the motivations behind those specific products.</p>
<p>I look at the motivations behind the login with Google product, it’s really around things like making sure that these users who are already Gmail users are being safe with password management on the internet. It’s very much a function of doing good for the community of users by giving them a tool to sort of authenticate and log in globally without having to deal with passwords, which are sort of a mess. So if you secure your Google account, which most folks do, becomes really easy downstream to log in and use best practices. So I actually view that as a net positive.</p>
<p>When I go to the other side with Facebook’s login, which came a little bit later, for their single sign-on solution, it’s useful. And I think it accomplishes many of the same things. And especially for parts of the world where Facebook is the internet, like the developing world, it’s kind of the only option you have. But in terms of the data that it extracts from customers, it becomes much more invasive.</p>
<p>So it really becomes a function of yes, the customers ultimately have the choice and you should give them the choice as the platform. But do you have a point of view as a business when you’re offering this? And is your customer base one that is going to, for example, if you have both individuals and business customers, you’re probably not going to have a login with Facebook, you might actually have a login with Google because that handles G Suite and the enterprise side as well as the consumer side.</p>
<p>So again, there’s a nuance there. But I think in terms of best practices, selecting one of those providers is really a function of what is your customer base? Who are they? Where do they live? And then do you have any strong views as a business on where you expose their data?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think it’s an interesting distinction. You mentioned, Google, yeah, tends to be more oriented to business because there is a Google Suite, for instance, that doesn’t exist in the Facebook world. Yeah. So to your view is Facebook, it’s much more invasive as this identity provider point of view.</p>
<p>Aran: It’s purely extractive in terms of why they created that, right? They don’t have a business to business service on the backend, that they’re actually serving and building this as a legitimate solution for.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, because they are in a position of power. In many cases that’s, as you mentioned, some places it’s just the only way to have this log in.</p>
<p>Aran: It’s a way to get Facebook pixel out into the world, essentially, they just want more pixels on more sites so they can track you on more parts of the internet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And what if one business has decided, OK, we’re going to use anyway log in with Google, log in with Facebook, log in with LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, LinkedIn and GitHub I’ve seen.</p>
<p>Oscar: So what do you say in terms of making that more robust as an authentication to safeguard the data, what do you say are important things for the service provider who is adding that functionality and sign in with Google or sign in with GitHub, what would you say?</p>
<p>Aran: It’s difficult, right? Because when you do that, you assume that you’re pinging the API on the GitHub side or the Facebook side or the Google side. They’ve done all the heavy lifting for you. They done the 2FA, they’ve really gone in and made sure that the person who is giving you the token, is the person they say they are.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that you are outsourcing that trust. Now obviously, from a development standpoint, that’s exactly what you want to do. You don’t want your engineers going and building this thing that’s been built 500 times, you just want to use someone else’s sort of version of this where customers already have credentials and already have a process set up.</p>
<p>That being said, if you’re the service provider, I think it’s incumbent on you to think about what is the level of security I need here? Facebook, for example, is never going to kind of enforce 2FA in a strong, strong way for their customers, because they want people logging in and looking at the site. I think GitHub on the other hand, especially like for corporate GitHubs or G Suite on the other hand, for corporate accounts, they do have the ability to enforce that centrally. And you know, if you need even stronger access controls, getting something like an Okta with SSO is a consideration.</p>
<p>But again, I think it’s really a function of what is the level of security that your customers are requiring from you. And do you choose a platform that matches that? And we’ll give them those downstream controls and that you can trust to actually maintain that contract.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. And on your case, I was checking also the Archera website. So you offer on this type of social media, you offer Google and Microsoft, correct.</p>
<p>Aran: Google, Microsoft and yeah, Okta more broadly, which is powering the whole thing. And it’s really just because we serve enterprises, right, big and small, we need to be where those enterprise admin accounts are set up, be it in G Suite, be it in Office 365, in Active Directory, or be it in Okta.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So based on the customer that the enterprise already use.</p>
<p>Aran: Correct.</p>
<p>Oscar: For all business leaders listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Aran: Hmm, the one actionable idea. I think one thing that has been surprising to me when I go in and audit platforms, including our own, or those of our customers for security and identity and access management best practices that I constantly see is the fact that the defaults, and the policies often don’t change from kind of the first setup to whenever I go and look at the thing, even if it’s three years, five years, N years down the line.</p>
<p>So having a review every quarter of particularly our identity and access management policies internally and for customers and being thoughtful about the goals of those policies, being thoughtful about setting them, having a cross functional team talk about it, at least once a quarter, because things change really quickly in this world, frankly. It’s something that I think is really important for leaders to go and do and build a cadence around.</p>
<p>And often, you know, if you’re doing SOC 2, or ISO, whatever, you’re going to have to do this anyways, there is some sort of cadence that is built into getting that certification. But building that muscle, regardless, I think is going to be very important going forward for business leaders.</p>
<p>Oscar: And normally what kind of position in the company normally takes care of that?</p>
<p>Aran: It depends on the scale. I’ve seen dedicated CISOs, Chief Information Security Officers, in less mature companies, sometimes the CIO, the Chief Information Officer, and even less mature companies, sometimes it’s the CTO and team of SRE or developers underneath them. But in general, it’s someone on the engineering side, who has deep knowledge of the architecture of the infrastructure, and likely deep knowledge of the cloud provider that the core infrastructure is being run on.</p>
<p>Because nowadays, and we see this in a lot of our customers, to really get in and fix a lot of issues or update a lot of issues, when you find them, you need to have that deep understanding of the offerings of the cloud provider, and how to actually orient and change those without impacting the application in a negative way. Or on the flip side, something we see a lot is impacting the costs in a very negative way by turning on things like detailed logging, when it might not be necessary and blowing up the amount of ingress or egress that you have from certain systems.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. Well, thanks a lot, Aran for this very interesting conversation, I definitely like all the work you have done, not only talking about your story, of course, the story you had with Facebook, and also other cases when social media and other providers didn’t take privacy seriously. So thank you for that, for sharing that story. Please let us know how people would like to get in touch with you.</p>

 What Can You Do With Affinidi’s Tech&nbsp;Stack? <p>Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs provide the building blocks for decentralized identity creation, verifiable credential issuance, and verification.</p><p>This documentation will talk in detail about Affinidi’s SDK and what you can do with it. Also, browse through this <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">blog post</a> or watch this video to see how you can build a driver’s license use-case with these&nbsp;SDKs.</p> An Introduction to Affinidi’s SDK <p>Affinidi’s SDK enables you to issue Verifiable Credentials (VCs), register accounts, collect and validate information, verify VCs, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This SDK consists of six packages, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Core  Browser  Expo  Issuer-kit  React-native  VC-data  <p>Let’s now look through each of these packages and what they&nbsp;do.</p> sdk/core <p>The core folder contains the @affinidi/wallet-core-sdk and it implements the common logic for account registration and management, credential issuance and verification, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>The sdk/core package is a comprehensive kit that enables you to issue, share, and revoke VCs. It also provides for the ancillary tasks associated with them such as the generation of API keys, DID anchoring, validating holder response, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>The entry point for this package is a method called CommonNetworkMember. By default, this will use Affinidi’s staging environment, though you can initialize it with specific service endpoints.</p> Generate API&nbsp;keys <p>It creates apiKey and apiKeyHash values after you register your entity at Affinidi’s stack environment, which can be staging, production, or dev. They are both request headers. apiKey is used when calling SDK methods and apiKeyHash is used for making <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api">API&nbsp;calls</a></p> const options = {  env: ‘staging’,  apiKey: ‘YOUR API KEY’ (or accessApiKey: ‘YOUR API KEY HASH VALUE’)  }  Access Through an Interface <p>You can call/access the wallet through any platform.</p> const { AffinidiWallet } = require(‘@affinidi/wallet-{PLATFORM}-sdk’) // where platform is one of ‘browser’, ‘expo’, ‘node’, ‘react-native’ <p>Accordingly, you will use the sdk/browser, sdk/expo, and sdk/react-native packages respectively.</p> Create a&nbsp;DID <p>A DID is a type of unique identifier (URI) that enables entities to generate and control their identifiers in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>Creating a DID is easy with our tech stack as you’ll just have to make the below&nbsp;calls.</p> const wallet = await AffinidiWallet.createWallet(options, password)  const { did, encryptedSeed } = wallet <p>Here, encryptedSeed is a random auto-generated value that’s used as an input for private key generation. It is stored as an encrypted value in the protected vault and is never exposed to the public. It always remains in its encrypted form as a property to the&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>However, you need this value to access or open a&nbsp;wallet.</p> const wallet = AffinidiWallet.openWalletByEncryptedSeed(options, encryptedSeed, password) <p>To get the DID, make the below&nbsp;call.</p> const wallet = AffinidiWallet.openWalletByEncryptedSeed(options, password, encryptedSeed)  const did = wallet.did <p>You can also sign up for the Affinidi cloud wallet using an existing DID or&nbsp;keys.</p> const { did, encryptedSeed } = await AffinidiWallet.createWallet(options, password)  const keyParams = { encryptedSeed, password }  const email = ‘example@affinity-project.org’  const userPassword = ‘Password123’  const options = { env: ‘dev’ }  const messageParameters = { message: ‘Welcome to Affinity, here is your OTP: {{CODE}}’ } // (optional)  const token = await AffinidiWallet.initiateSignUpByEmail(options, email, userPassword, messageParameters)  const confirmationCode = ‘123456’  const wallet = await AffinidiWallet.completeSignUp(options, token, confirmationCode, keyParams)  Sign a DID&nbsp;Document <p>Here is an image that shows the relationship between a DID, DID subject/controller, and a DID document.</p><p>A DID Document must be digitally signed for authentication.</p><p>This signature is verified using a set of parameters. For example, in a public key cryptography, a public key can be used to verify a digital signature, provided the signer has the associated private&nbsp;key.</p><p>The sdk/core package makes this signing easy, as you can use the following method.</p> const signedDidDocument = await wallet.signDidDocument(didDocument)  Change the Username and&nbsp;Password <p>Users have to be logged in to change the password and the method to call&nbsp;is,</p> await wallet.changePassword(oldPassword, newPassword) <p>If they are not logged in or have forgotten their password, the password recovery method&nbsp;is,</p> const token = await AffinidiWallet.initiateForgotPassword(options, login, messageParameters) <p>To change the username, the user requires a new phone number or email&nbsp;address.</p> const token = await wallet.initiateChangeEmail(newEmail) <p>or</p> const token = await wallet.initiateChangePhone(newPhone) <p>newEmail or newPhone — email address or phone number to be later used to log into&nbsp;cognito</p><p>The challenge for verification can be done via this&nbsp;method.</p> await wallet.completeChangeEmailOrPhone(options, token, confirmationCode) <p>Finally, to sign out the current user,&nbsp;call</p> await wallet.logOut()  Generate a Verifiable Presentation <p>You can generate a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable presentation</a> with the below&nbsp;call.</p> const { isValid, did, challenge, suppliedPresentation } = await verifier.verifyPresentation(vp)  Request and Verify a Verifiable Presentation <p>The verifier can request the holder to provide a verifiable presentation containing one or more VCs required for verification.</p><p>Use the below method to request for a verifiable presentation that meets the w3c specification structure.</p> const jwtOptions = { audienceDid, expiresAt, nonce, callbackUrl }  const presentationChallenge = await verifier.generatePresentationChallenge(  credentialRequirements,  issuerDid,  jwtOptions,  ) <p>To verify the presentation, use</p> const { isValid, did, challenge, suppliedPresentation } = await verifier.verifyPresentation(vp) <p>If the verification is valid, it returns {did, nonce}&nbsp;, else it returns isValid:&nbsp;false.</p> Validating the Holder&nbsp;Response <p>This package has the methods to validate response tokens and verify the signature.</p> const { isValid, did, nonce, selectedCredentials } = await issuer.verifyCredentialOfferResponseToken(  credentialOfferResponseToken,  credentialOfferRequestToken, <p>If the verification is not valid, this method will return isValid:&nbsp;false</p><p>On the other hand, if the response is valid, it returns issuer, nonce, selectedCredentials.</p><p>Thus, these are some things you can do with the sdk/core&nbsp;package.</p> sdk/browser, sdk/expo, and sdk/react-native <p>This package contains the @affinidi/wallet-[PLATFORM]-sdk package that extends the wallet-core-sdk logic with client specific implementations for crypto operations.

  <p>Elasticsearch is a search engine that can be integrated into any of your tech stacks using its REST APIs and its wide selection of libraries.</p>

<p>By installing and integrating Elasticsearch into your system, you can add a search engine to your website, add autocomplete functionalities, use its machine learning functionalities to perform analysis on your data and provide better results for your users, and much more.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to integrate Elasticsearch into a Laravel blog. You’ll also add authentication to your blog using Okta and allow authenticated users to create new blog posts.</p>

 What is Elasticsearch? 

<p><a href="https://www.elastic.co">Elasticsearch</a> allows you to index your data and perform searches quickly and efficiently. It also allows you to better understand your data, and to track your query load times using tools like <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana/">Kibana</a>, a visualization dashboard for your data .</p>

<p>If you have an e-commerce website, it’s important to add a search engine that will allow your users to search through thousands of products, including multiple fields like titles, descriptions, and categories in the search. Elasticsearch is a versatile search engine that not only makes the process easy for you, but also indexes and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-caching-deep-dive-boosting-query-speed-one-cache-at-a-time">caches</a> data to provide a faster and more optimized response to your queries.</p>

 Integrate Elasticsearch with Laravel 

<p>In this section, you’ll create a blog with <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a> that shows posts for unauthenticated users and allows users authenticated with <a href="https://developer.okta.com">Okta</a> to add posts. Then you’ll integrate Elasticsearch, adding search functionality to the blog.</p>

<p>You can find the code for this tutorial in <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-php-laravel-elasticsearch-example">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

 Prerequisites 

<p>Before you start with this tutorial, you’ll need <a href="https://www.php.net">PHP</a> version 7.3 or higher. If you’re running Windows, you’ll also need to enable the use of the SQLite3 extension by adding a DLL to the system <code>PATH</code>, following the directions in the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/sqlite3.installation.php">SQLite3 installation guide</a>. You also need to have <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/">Composer</a> installed.</p>

<p>To use Elasticsearch, you need to have it installed and running on your machine. You can follow the installation steps in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html">this guide from Elastic</a>, and then <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/starting-elasticsearch.html">learn the basics here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a fresh PHP installation, or haven’t worked with Laravel before, you might need to install some extensions, such as <code>php-dom</code>, <code>php-zip</code>, and <code>php-curl</code>. For more detail on how to install any of these extensions, you can follow <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-laravel-setup-6c1fd98c2670">this guide on how to install the PHP extensions necessary for Laravel</a>. Please note that the linked guide uses PHP version 7.3—if you’re using PHP version 7.4, be sure to replace <code>7.3</code> in the commands with <code>7.4</code>.</p>

 Creating your project 

<p>In your terminal, run the following command to create a Laravel 8 project:</p>

   <code>composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-es '^8'
</code>   

<p>Navigate to the directory of the newly created project:</p>

   <code>cd laravel-es
</code>   

 Build your database 

<p>To manage the blog data, you’ll need a database. To keep this tutorial simple, you’ll be using <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. Run the following command to create the database:</p>

   <code>touch database/db.sqlite
</code>   

<p>Then change the database configuration in <code>.env</code>:</p>

   <code>DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/absolute/path/to/laravel-es/database/db.sqlite
</code>   

<p>For <code>DB_DATABASE</code>, make sure you set the absolute path to the SQLite database you just created.</p>

<p>Now you’ll prepare the migrations to create the tables in the database.</p>

<p>By default, Laravel comes with a migration for the <code>users</code> table, which you can find in <code>database/migrations</code>. The file name should be <code>2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table.php</code>. Open the file and change the content of the <code>up</code> method:</p>

   <code>Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table-&gt;bigIncrements('id');
    $table-&gt;string('email')-&gt;unique();
    $table-&gt;string('name');
    $table-&gt;text('token');
    $table-&gt;timestamps();
});
</code>   

<p>This change will allow you to integrate with Okta later. Because the authentication will be done through Okta, all you have to do is store the user’s token, though you can also store other details, like name and email, for easy access to user details.</p>

<p>You also need a <code>posts</code> table. Run the following command to create a migration for it:</p>

   <code>php artisan make:migration create_posts_table
</code>   

<p>This will create a new file in <code>database/migrations</code>, starting with a timestamp and ending with <code>create_posts_table.php</code>. Open the file and replace the content of the <code>up</code> method with the following:</p>

   <code>Schema::create('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table-&gt;id();
    $table-&gt;string('title');
    $table-&gt;longText('content');
    $table-&gt;foreignId('user_id')-&gt;constrained('users')-&gt;cascadeOnUpdate()-&gt;cascadeOnDelete();
    $table-&gt;timestamps();
});
</code>   

<p>This will create a posts table that has the fields <code>id</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>content</code>, and <code>user_id</code>. These are the essential fields for a blog post, but you can add other fields if you wish.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create the tables in the database:</p>

   <code>php artisan migrate
</code>   

 Create your models 

<p>Next, you need to create models that you’ll use to interact with the tables in the database.</p>

<p>By default, Laravel has the <code>User</code> model created for you in <code>app/Models</code>. However, because you modified the migration file earlier, you also need to modify the model.</p>

<p>Open <code>app/Models/User.php</code> and change the content of the <code>User</code> class:</p>

   <code>protected $fillable = [
    'email', 'name', 'token'
];

protected $hidden = [
    'token'
];
</code>   

<p>This will change the <code>fillable</code> fields to <code>email</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>token</code>, and will keep the token private by adding it to the <code>hidden</code> array.</p>

<p>Let’s now create the <code>Post</code> model. Create the file <code>app/Models/Post.php</code> and add the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'title', 'content', 'user_id'
    ];
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>Post</code> model has the fillable fields of <code>title</code>, <code>content</code>, and <code>user_id</code>.</p>

 Create a home page for your blog 

<p>. Nearly all blogs begin with a website of some sort. You’ll start by creating a home page to display all the posts that have been added to the blog.</p>

<p>Create the controller to handle incoming requests using this command:</p>

   <code>php artisan make:controller BlogController
</code>   

<p>This will create the file <code>app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php</code>. Open it and import the class <code>Post</code> at the beginning of the file:</p>

   <code>use App\Models\Post;
</code>   

<p>Then add the following method inside the <code>BlogController</code> class:</p>

   <code>public function home (Request $request) {
    $posts = Post::all();

    return view('home', ['posts' =&gt; $posts]);
}
</code>   

<p>This retrieves the posts and sends them to the <code>home</code> view.</p>

<p>Now create the file <code>resources/views/home.blade.php</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>@extends('layout')

@section('content')
    @forelse ($posts as $post)
      &lt;div class="card mt-3"&gt;
        &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
          &lt;h5 class="card-title"&gt;{{ $post-&gt;title }}&lt;/h5&gt;
          &lt;span class="small"&gt;{{ $post-&gt;summary }}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;
            {!! $post-&gt;content !!}
          &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    @empty
      &lt;div class="card mt-3"&gt;
        &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
          There are no posts available
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    @endforelse
@endsection
</code>   

<p>This code will show the posts, if there are any, viewed as cards. Notice that this extends another view, called <code>layout</code>, which you’ll create now.</p>

<p>Make the file <code>resources/views/layout.blade.php</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;

</code>   

<p>This eliminates repeated code by creating a layout view that other views can extend. For ease of styling, you’re using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> to create your layout.</p>

<p>All pages will have a navigation bar. When the user is not authenticated, they’ll see a sign-in link. Otherwise, they’ll see a link to add a post.</p>

<p>The last step to creating your home page is registering the new route. Open <code>routes/web.php</code> and replace the current <code>/</code> route with the following:</p>

   <code>Route::get('/', [App\Http\Controllers\BlogController::class, 'home']);
</code>   

<p>Let’s test it out now. In your terminal, run the server with the following command:</p>

   <code>php artisan serve
</code>   

<p>This will run your server, typically on <code>localhost:8000</code>. Open it in your browser, and you’ll see that there are currently no posts on your website.</p>

<p></p>

 Add authentication with Okta 

<p>You’re going to add user authentication to your website using <a href="https://developer.okta.com">Okta</a>.</p>

 Set up Okta 

<p>If you don’t already have an Okta account, go ahead and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">create one</a>—otherwise, just log in. From the sidebar, click Applications, then Applications in the sub-menu. After that, click on Create App Integration.</p>

<p>In the pop-up, select OIDC - OpenID Connect and Web Application, then click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, on the page that opens, you’ll enter details about the new integration. In the first section, you need to enter the app’s name. For Grant Type, choose Client Credentials, and for Sign-in redirect URIs, enter http://localhost:8000/login/redirect. Later, this is where you’ll handle the authentication.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At the bottom of the form, under Assignments, choose Allow everyone in your organization to access. This allows any user in your Okta organization to log in to the blog.</p>

<p>Once you’re done, click on Save. You’ll be redirected to the page of the app you just created. On that page, you can see Client ID and Client Secret keys. Copy them and add them as new keys in <code>.env</code>:</p>

   <code>OKTA_BASE_URL=
OKTA_CLIENT_ID=
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=
OKTA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/login/redirect
</code>   

<p>The last thing you need is your organization’s Okta base URL, which can be found by going to Security, then API. It’ll be in the table under Issuer URI. You only need the authority, not the full path.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Okta is now ready to be used for authentication!</p>

 Add authentication in Laravel 

<p>Back in Laravel, you’ll add the authentication with Okta by using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/socialite">Socialite</a>. Socialite allows you to add social logins, as well as OAuth providers like Okta, to your Laravel app.</p>

<p>Install the package for authentication with Okta using Socialite:</p>

   <code>composer require laravel/socialite socialiteproviders/okta
</code>   

<p>After installing the package, you need to add Okta in the <code>config/services.php</code> so that Socialite can find and use its keys:</p>

   <code>'okta' =&gt; [    
        'base_url' =&gt; env('OKTA_BASE_URL'),
        'client_id' =&gt; env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'),  
        'client_secret' =&gt; env('OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET'),  
        'redirect' =&gt; env('OKTA_REDIRECT_URI'),
        'auth_server_id' =&gt; env('OKTA_SERVER_ID')
      ],
</code>   

<p>You also need to configure Socialite’s listener to listen to the <code>SocialiteWasCalled</code> event to use Okta. In <code>app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php</code> add the event in the <code>$listen</code> array inside the <code>EventServiceProvider</code> class:</p>

   <code>$listen = [
  ...,
  \SocialiteProviders\Manager\SocialiteWasCalled::class =&gt; [
              \SocialiteProviders\Okta\OktaExtendSocialite::class.'@handle',
        ],
]
</code>   

<p>You can now use Socialite to authenticate with Okta.
Start by first importing the <code>Socialite</code> facade at the beginning of <code>app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php</code>:</p>

   <code>use Laravel\Socialite\Facades\Socialite;
</code>   

<p>Then add a new method in the <code>BlogController</code> class:</p>

   <code>public function redirectToLogin () {
    return Socialite::driver('okta')-&gt;redirect();
}
</code>   

<p>When the user clicks the Sign In link in the navigation bar, they’ll be taken into the <code>login</code> page in your Laravel blog, which is handled by <code>redirectToLogin</code>. On the <code>login</code> page, Socialite will make use of the keys you added to <code>.env</code> to redirect users to Okta’s authentication page.</p>

<p>Add the route to this <code>login</code> route in <code>routes/web.php</code>:</p>

   <code>Route::get('/login', [App\Http\Controllers\BlogController::class, 'redirectToLogin'])-&gt;name('login');
</code>   

<p>Change the URL of the Sign In link in <code>resources/views/layout.blade.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="{{ route('login') }}"&gt;Sign In&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now when you open the home page again and click the Sign In link in the navigation bar, you’ll be taken to Okta’s authentication screen.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Before you can test the authentication, you need to add the redirect route that will handle the response of the successful authentication.</p>

<p>In <code>app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php</code>, add the necessary import at the beginning of the file for <code>Auth</code>, which you’ll be using for authentication:</p>

   <code>use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use App\Models\User;
</code>   

<p>Then, add the following method inside the <code>BlogController</code> class:</p>

   <code>public function handleLogin () {
    $oktaUser = Socialite::driver('okta')-&gt;user();

    $user = User::where('email', $oktaUser-&gt;email)-&gt;first();

    if (!$user) {
        $user = User::create([
            'email' =&gt; $oktaUser-&gt;email,
            'name'  =&gt; $oktaUser-&gt;name,
            'token' =&gt; $oktaUser-&gt;token,
        ]);
    } else {
        $user-&gt;token = $oktaUser-&gt;token;
        $user-&gt;save();
    }

    try {
        Auth::login($user);
    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        return redirect()-&gt;route('login');
    }

    return redirect('/');
}
</code>   

<p>This tells Socialite to retrieve the Okta user, then checks if the user’s email address is in the database. If it is, the <code>token</code> field is changed to reflect the user’s token. If it isn’t, a new user is created, and the <code>token</code> field updates with their information. The user is then authenticated on your Laravel blog using <code>Auth::login</code> and is redirected to the home page.</p>

<p>Next, add the route in <code>routes/web.php</code>:</p>

   <code>Route::get('/login/redirect', [App\Http\Controllers\BlogController::class, 'handleLogin']);
</code>   

<p>You can now test the authentication. Fill out the Okta form with your name and password.</p>

<p>After logging in, you’ll be redirected to the home page, and you’ll see that the link in the navigation bar has changed to Add Post. You’ll also see your name on the right side of the navigation bar.</p>

<p></p>

 Add your post page 

<p>Now that users can log in, you’ll need to add a page where authenticated users can create new blog posts.</p>

<p>Create the file <code>resources/views/post-form.blade.php</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>@extends('layout')

@section('content')
    &lt;form method="POST" action="#"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;New Post&lt;/h1&gt;
      @csrf
      &lt;div class="mb-3"&gt;
        &lt;label for="title" class="form-label"&gt;Title&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" id="title" name="title"&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="mb-3"&gt;
        &lt;label for="content" class="form-label"&gt;Content&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;textarea id="content" name="content"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
@endsection

@push('scripts')
  &lt;script src="https://cdn.tiny.cloud/1/no-api-key/tinymce/5/tinymce.min.js" referrerpolicy="origin"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    tinymce.init({
      selector: '#content'
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
@endpush
</code>   

<p>This will create the new post form, with a textbox to add the title and a <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/">tinyMCE</a> rich text editor to add the content.</p>

<p>Add the new route in <code>routes/web.php</code>:</p>

   <code>Route::get('/post/new', function () {
    return view('post-form');
})-&gt;name('post.new.form')-&gt;middleware('auth');
</code>   

<p>Change the URL of the Add Post link in the navigation bar in <code>resources/views/layout.blade.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="{{ route('post.new.form') }}"&gt;Add Post&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>If you go to the home page and click on Add Post, you’ll be taken to the form you just created.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To add the form POST request handler route, add the following to <code>app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php</code>:</p>

   <code>public function savePost (Request $request) {
    //save post
    $user = Auth::user();

    $post = new Post([
        'title' =&gt; $request-&gt;get('title'),
        'content' =&gt; $request-&gt;get('content'),
        'user_id' =&gt; $user-&gt;id
    ]);
    $post-&gt;save();

    return redirect('/');
}
</code>   

<p>This will save the new post and redirect you back to the home page.</p>

<p>Add the new route in <code>routes/web.php</code>:</p>

   <code>Route::post('/post/new', [App\Http\Controllers\BlogController::class, 'savePost'])-&gt;name('post.new')-&gt;middleware('auth');
</code>   

<p>Change the value for the <code>action</code> attribute of the form in <code>post-form.blade.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;form method="POST"  action="{{ route('post.new') }}"&gt;
</code>   

<p>Open the page with the Add Post form again, enter a title and body content, then submit the form. You’ll be redirected to the home page, which will now display the post you added.</p>

 Add search functionality 

<p>The last part of this project is adding a search bar and integrating it with Elasticsearch to index data and fetch results.</p>

<p>You’ll need to install the <code>laravel-elasticsearch</code> package, which wraps Elasticsearch’s PHP package so it can be used easily in Laravel:</p>

   <code>composer require cviebrock/laravel-elasticsearch
</code>   

<p>Add configurations to connect to the Elasticsearch server on your machine.</p>

<p>In <code>.env</code> add the following new keys:</p>

   <code>ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=127.0.0.1
ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200
ELASTICSEARCH_SCHEME=http
ELASTICSEARCH_USER=
ELASTICSEARCH_PASS=
</code>   

<p>These are the default configuration values for Elasticsearch configurations, and will set the host, port, and scheme, as well as user and password, if you choose to configure them.</p>

<p>Use the following command to create a command in Laravel that will allow you to easily index the data:</p>

   <code>php artisan make:command IndexPosts
</code>   

<p>Then open <code>app/Console/Commands/IndexPosts.php</code> and change <code>$signature</code>:</p>

   <code>protected $signature = 'index:posts';
</code>   

<p>Add <code>use</code> statements before the <code>IndexPost</code> class:</p>

   <code>use App\Models\Post;
use Elasticsearch;
</code>   

<p>And change the content of <code>handle</code>:</p>

   <code>$posts = Post::all();

foreach ($posts as $post) {
    try {
        Elasticsearch::index([
            'id' =&gt; $post-&gt;id,
            'index' =&gt; 'posts',
            'body' =&gt; [
                'title' =&gt; $post-&gt;title,
                'content' =&gt; $post-&gt;content
            ]
        ]);
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        $this-&gt;info($e-&gt;getMessage());
    }
}

$this-&gt;info("Posts were successfully indexed");
</code>   

<p>This will loop through the posts on the blog, then index the data in Elasticsearch. All posts will be indexed under the <code>posts</code> index, and the body will include the title and content of the post. This means that both the <code>title</code> and <code>content</code> fields are searchable.</p>

<p>In your console, run the following command:</p>

   <code>php artisan index:posts
</code>   

<p>You should see a message that posts were successfully indexed.</p>

<p>Finally, you’ll add a search bar to the home page so users can search the posts. In <code>resources/views/home.blade.php</code>, add the following before the <code>@forelse</code> loop:</p>

   <code>&lt;form method="GET" action="/"&gt;
  @csrf
  &lt;div class="mb-3"&gt;
    &lt;input type="search" class="form-control" id="q" name="q" value={{ request()-&gt;get('q', '') }}&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code>   

<p>Then, in <code>app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php</code>, change the <code>home</code> method to the following:</p>

   <code>public function home (Request $request) {
    $q = $request-&gt;get('q');
    if ($q) {
        $response = Elasticsearch::search([
            'index' =&gt; 'posts',
            'body'  =&gt; [
                'query' =&gt; [
                    'multi_match' =&gt; [
                        'query' =&gt; $q,
                        'fields' =&gt; [
                            'title',
                            'content'
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]);

        $postIds = array_column($response['hits']['hits'], '_id');
        $posts = Post::query()-&gt;findMany($postIds);
    } else {
        $posts = Post::all();
    }

    return view('home', ['posts' =&gt; $posts]);
}
</code>   

<p>This change will retrieve the search term from the parameter <code>q</code>. If it’s found, the search is run using Elasticsearch’s <code>search</code> method. This method receives an array that accepts the <code>index</code> key for the name of the index to search through. It also accepts the <code>body</code> key, which holds the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html">Elasticsearch query</a>. In the query, you can use the <code>multi_match</code> option to search multiple fields; in this example our fields are <code>title</code> and <code>content</code>.</p>

<p>The post IDs are retrieved from the response, and the associated post models are sent to the <code>home</code> view.</p>

<p>Remember to add the <code>use</code> statement at the beginning of the file to use <code>Elasticsearch</code>:</p>

   <code>use Elasticsearch;
</code>   

<p>Opening the home page now, you’ll see a search bar. If you enter a search term, the results will show posts with the term you entered in their title or content.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">first</a> and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">second</a> articles in this series explored the nature of unenclosable carriers and their potential to underpin an unprecedented explosion of human creativity and social flourishing. We suggest starting there if you haven’t already.</p><p>This final installment delves into the unenclosable carrier Holochain specifically, including what makes it unenclosable and how it can be used.</p><p>(One thing this article doesn’t provide is much of a comparison between Holochain and blockchain technology; we wrote <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">another piece</a> to serve that purpose.)</p><p>Let’s get right to it.</p> What Holochain Is <p>Holochain is an open-source, unenclosable framework that enables hosting of peer-to-peer applications without any centralized or consensus-based infrastructure. It provides a way of ensuring the integrity and accuracy of data in a network while also enabling every user to host and represent their own data. Rather than having actions validated and information verified by centralized entities (as in internet apps) or <a href="https://artbrock.medium.com/blockchain-blind-spots-1904d490218d">global consensus mechanisms</a> (as in blockchain apps) — both of which are enclosable and result in power imbalances (see <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">Part 1</a>) — actions and data within Holochain apps are validated entirely peer-to-peer.</p>  By “framework”, we mean a database for storing, organizing, and finding data that is spread across many computers, so that no one has to hold a lot of data. In Holochain apps there can be data that remains local to one’s own computer, on what’s called a Source Chain, and there can be data that is shared across many computers, on what’s called a Distributed Hash Table (DHT).  By “peer-to-peer applications”, we mean a version of decentralized applications (dApps) that are hosted entirely by the participants in the app, rather than by a central company. (Holochain applications are sometimes called hApps.) There are no limits to the kinds of apps that might be built on Holochain, other than that they have to involve two or more parties communicating or transacting. Apps for social networking, currency systems, ride-sharing, travel booking, buying and selling, team coordination, collective decision-making, chat, weather, and news applications are all possible. Most ways that you currently interact digitally with people or businesses, as well as many ways you might imagine doing so, can be built on Holochain and can probably be enhanced by unenclosability.  By “data integrity”, we mean the assurance that data cannot be tampered with once it has been created, including by anyone storing data about themselves on their own Source Chain. For example, if you have 100 currency units and you spend 50, it has integrity for you to represent to the network that you have 50 units remaining; it would not have integrity for you to be able to represent that you still have 100. Similarly, it would not have integrity if you could display a 5-star user rating when the average of your ratings is actually 3 stars. Holochain provides a way of cryptographically ensuring that if you misrepresent any data, such as your account balance or reputation score, it will be obvious, and your communication or transaction will be flagged and rejected by the peer-based validation mechanisms.  <p>Each Holochain app is a collaborative platform within which users host themselves and also provide just a little extra computing power and storage so that extra copies of data are always online and agreements are mutually validated and enforced.</p> What Makes Holochain Unenclosable <p>Holochain is agent-centric. Holochain enables individual choice over just about everything, including which applications and networks to participate in, your identity and address within those networks, and what information you expose to other participants. And you always store and own your own data, taking it with you as you move between applications, which is not possible with internet search engines, social networks, or shopping sites — or even blockchain apps.</p><p>Holochain enables direct interaction. With Holochain, you act truly peer-to-peer, free from intermediaries except those you freely choose. You and your actions write directly to the ledger of events, and you share only share with the network what you have agreed to share according to the terms of whichever apps you have freely chosen to participate in. You represent yourself, rather than being subject to representation by central authorities like legislators, miners, stakers, or even internet service providers.</p><p>Direct interaction also means that Holochain functions on any network. It can operate through the internet (TCP/IP) but doesn’t require it; apps can just as easily operate on mesh networks or even local area networks, Bluetooth networks, or any other means of communicating data among peers. Even when offline from the larger network of app users, a subgroup of connected peers can run the app with full functionality among themselves (since everyone hosts a copy of the core application code) and synchronize their changes with the network later.</p><p>Holochain enables groups of any size, whether 2 people or 2 billion people, to operate on a shared set of agreements. Most blockchains have problems at the low end, requiring hundreds if not thousands of players before there is enough of a distributed consensus mechanism to prevent attacks by a majority of nodes. And so far, blockchain-based dApps (decentralized applications) haven’t demonstrated much of an ability to scale beyond <a href="https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings">a few thousand active users</a>, suggesting they may have problems at the high end too. For a carrier to be unenclosable, it’s important that any number of people can interact and mutually enforce the integrity of the space they’re participating in.</p><p>Holochain is free to use. Since all users host themselves on Holochain, there is no need for costly central hosting infrastructure as there is in web apps, nor any need to pay tax-like ‘gas’ fees to miners or stakers to run the network as there is in blockchain apps. Each peer carries a bit of extra load to store and validate a portion of the information that’s distributed to the group. Any fees that occur in Holochain apps are chosen and mutually enforced by those freely participating within a given app space, with no revenues skimmed by the network.</p><p>(Holochain is not to be confused with Holo, which is an optional, peer-to-peer hosting framework that enables users who are not hosting themselves to access Holochain apps through a web browser.)</p>Virtually all of today’s web and blockchain apps could be improved in some way by shifting to unenclosability and peer-to-peer infrastructure. What You Can Do with It <p>In <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">Part 2</a>, we imagined how applications built on an unenclosable carrier like Holochain could have game-changing effects on our food supply, energy infrastructure, financial systems, and natural ecosystems. But virtually all of today’s web and blockchain apps could be improved in some way by shifting to unenclosability and peer-to-peer infrastructure.</p><p>Consider:</p>  An agent-centric social network, intrinsically proofed against centralized surveillance and the selling of data to advertisers, with content-ranking algorithms that serve the common good – or your own individual preferences – not the interests of an enclosing corporation.  A self-hosted community chat, similar to WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, where freedom-of-speech policies can be implemented by the communities themselves according to mutually-agreed rulesets, not imposed by a centrally controlled software company that is subject to all sorts of economic and political pressures.  A self-hosted team chat, similar to Slack, that doesn’t share your data with a corporate entity, works asynchronously and can be used offline, and operates without infrastructure costs. (<a href="https://elemental-chat.holo.host/">Elemental Chat</a> is currently live as a proof-of-concept.)  A rideshare system, similar to Uber and Lyft, that eliminates most of the hosting costs and corporate overhead that is currently paid by riders and drivers. Rideshare networks could even be owned collectively by drivers, with relatively small fees paid to a software provider that could serve hundreds or thousands of driver collectives. Rides could become more affordable even as drivers are paid more. And bonus: rider locations would never be visible to a corporate entity.  A knowledge base like Wikipedia that is collectively held by the people who use it.  A media-sharing platform like Spotify or YouTube that could reinvent revenue-sharing models from the ground up, without the layers of royalties paid to ‘distributors’. For example, what if subscribers of a given artist actually participated in hosting music for others to stream, with those gains being partly retained by the artists and partly cycled back to the fans as rewards in some form or other?  A document-editing system similar to Google Docs that is truly private, not vulnerable to observation by anyone who might gain (or already have) access to Google’s centralized databases.  A system for peer-reviewing scientific articles that could replace expensive scholarly journals while promoting more diversity of thought.  A tamper-proof election system: an immutable, crypto-signed voting system in which any voter is able to verify that their vote was accurately included.  <p>Or imagine (or build upon!) these more innovative possibilities:</p>  A location-sharing app (like a <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Weasley_Clock">Weasley clock</a>, for Harry Potter fans), where your information is shared only with family and friends you choose, not exposed to companies or governments.  A medical data repository where you are in charge of your data and can grant access to providers – and to trusted family members – so that they are able to provide information in cases of emergency.  A neutral layer for sense-making that sits atop the web, enabling people to associate into networks and then comment on, share, and discuss the information they find online.  A simplified supply-chain system: Cross-organizational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources,_events,_agents_(accounting_model)">REA accounting</a> where digitally signed payments become the accounting entry for both parties in their ledger history. An immutable, easily-auditable, self-populating accounting framework that streamlines compliance with contracts and regulations.  <p>(By the way, in case you’re wondering whether blockchain technology could support some of the same ideas: probably not most of them, due to its <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">limitations around speed and cost of storage</a>.)</p><p>And building on Holochain doesn’t mean sacrificing profitability. You can't make money by controlling data, but there are lots of other ways of earning a profit. In fact, most Web-2.0 revenue models still work for Holochain apps, including:<br>- ‘Software as a subscription’ (Saas), with or without a free trial<br>- ‘Freemium’ in which a free version remains functional while subscribers get upgraded features<br>- Service fees, like on Airbnb or Uber<br>- Fees for hosting data, like on Dropbox or Gmail<br>- Sponsorships from service providers relevant to the audience<br>- Promoted listings by item sellers or service providers, like on Amazon and eBay<br>- Donations, like on Wikipedia</p><p>The only Web-2.0 model that doesn’t work, really, is the one that many people today find the most distasteful: surveillance-driven advertising, in which a company collects personal information or tracks user activity, then uses that information to either sell targeted advertising on its platform or straight-up sell the data to advertisers.</p><p>So, what’s different about a Holochain-based social network versus Facebook or Instagram isn’t that the Holochain version is more philanthropic; it’s (1) the choice that people have in how to interact with one another and with the application, (2) the ownership and authorship that people retain over their own data, and (3) the decreased infrastructural costs because the load of running the software and hosting the data is spread across the user base.</p><p>Of course, for people that do want to create hApps just for the common good and not for profit, Holochain makes that easier because the infrastructure costs are so low. Maybe you want to set up a reputation-enabled child-care directory because you want easier, safer access to reliable babysitters and nannies in your neighborhood, not because you want to make money. You can do that without needing to configure, manage, or pay for servers, plus Holochain’s developer tools simplify app development (more on those in a bit). Then if your application happens to become a big success, it can scale on Holochain without adding cost, and you could choose to adopt a business model at that time.</p> Why All of This Matters (a Recap) <p>Today, a single person’s message can reach billions of people in seconds. This phenomenon, which would have been unfathomable to prehistoric humans, exists thanks to a progression of carrier technologies that have emerged over thousands of years, including written records, the printing press, sound amplification and recording, radio, television, film and, more recently, the internet, email, and social media. These developments have unleashed tremendous human coordination, but, as a side effect, we have surrendered covert power to those who control the carriers, enabling them to decide what gets transmitted and how we interact with each other.</p><p>Our mainstream monetary systems are examples of carrier enclosure, too, since they empower governments and financial institutions to say what counts as legitimate currency and trade, as well as to make fiscal policies that affect the behavior of our currencies. Blockchain technology commendably turns over the job of legitimizing transactions to a ‘decentralized’ consensus network, but it still converges to the same side effect, simply replacing governments and corporations with people who control computing power and cryptotokens. A system that is unenclosable is not just decentralized; it cannot ever be centralized.</p><p>Over the centuries, the power and wealth differentials have become so extreme that instead of a level economic playing field we have a steep mountainside that most people aren’t able to climb. (We explored some of these imbalances and their consequences in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">Part 2 of this series</a>.) When disproportionately powerful people (understandably) act in their own interest, it often comes at the expense of the greater good. This is why many of humanity’s greatest challenges — rainforest destruction, pollution and climate instability, food supply degradation, the looming energy crisis, and so on — won’t be solved at the levels of policy or diplomacy, but only by shifting the underlying architectures that determine how wealth and power are allocated and how people are incentivized to act.</p><p>The good news is that such a shift is technologically possible in ways it hasn’t been before. Suddenly, at the outset of the 2020s and for the first time in history, we are now able to build communication and transaction systems that let us have it both ways: capacity for massive scale and freedom from the power distortions of enclosability. What is available, and what we must undertake, is a proliferation of new forms of social organizing so expansive that it deserves to be named analogously to the Cambrian Explosion of new biological organisms. We call it the Holocene Explosion, after the current geological epoch.</p><p>Designed as a carrier for this Explosion, Holochain preserves individual sovereignty by giving all agents the power to represent themselves in all interactions, and to voluntarily enter (or not) into spaces where mutually agreed-upon rules are mutually enforced. If someone comes to have broader influence than someone else, it’s not because of carrier control, but because that person has gained capabilities according to rules voluntarily opted-into by the people participating in that app space. If anyone doesn’t like the rules of a given space, they are free to leave and join or start another, and since they own their data, they can take it with them.</p> Holochain is the spark. You are the flame. <p>It’s come time to close out this series, and we’ve considered a number of ways of doing so. What haven’t we said, we asked ourselves, that still ought to be said?</p><p>We considered getting into how scalable Holochain apps are – how easily they can accommodate millions or billions of users because everyone shares in the work of writing and storing data. Or how fast they are – how they enable virtually-real-time interaction. These are actually key reasons, beyond unenclosability, that Holochain may be more suitable than blockchain for real-world collaborative applications. But we covered these topics in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">Holochain-blockchain comparison</a> we published recently, so you can go there if you want to learn more about them.</p><p>We also considered talking about how a truly unenclosable, peer-to-peer future implies a truly peer-to-peer internet, completely replacing the existing one. But this seems like a story for another time.</p><p>We have said – but it's probably worth reiterating – that we can only speculate about what new social forms will emerge through the Holocene Explosion (see <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">Part 2</a>). We’ve also said, or at least implied, that Holochain’s architects don’t claim to fully know how it will be used in the future: the idea in designing it was not to build a whole bunch of new social patterns, but rather to build a framework for new social patterns. This means that the list of possible Holochain apps we shared earlier is truly partial; it’s likely that the most profound and transformative uses for the framework will only emerge over time. (Even within the apps we listed earlier, the most transformative features are TBD: novel incentive systems, governance systems, currency designs, and so on, yet to be invented.)</p><p>We have also said that what makes Holochain so suitable for rapid evolution is its unenclosable nature: Holochain is peer-to-peer, agent-centric, free to use, and able to operate on any transport protocol (even without the existing internet). From <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">Part 1 of this series</a>: “With free association and forkability in place, an evolutionary phenomenon emerges: the spaces themselves, each with their own patterns and protocols, enter into a process of natural selection. The ones that solve problems better or serve people better will gain greater adoption, while the ones that don’t do as good a job will die off.”</p><p>If there’s one more aspect of Holochain worth mentioning, it might be how Holochain the project (distinct from Holochain the framework) is building an ecosystem to foster experimentation and iteration. Creating a truly optimized evolutionary space isn’t just a matter of building the right core technology; it’s a matter of making that technology as easy to utilize as possible. To that end, Holochain the project is creating:</p>  Dev tools: A suite of developer tools designed to make it easy to build with Holochain, including a “RAD” (Rapid Application Development) suite that streamlines common functions into essentially drag-and-drop actions.  A DevHub: a Holochain application that functions like a decentralized Github for sharing developer resources: modules, applications, and user-interface components. Developers can draw from these resources to mash up new apps from existing elements, and to collaborate on and review code.  A hApp Store: a Holochain application where people can browse or search for Holochain apps, complete with end-user ratings and reviews.  <p>Lowering the barrier to development increases Holochain’s composability, which means how easy it is to mix and match elements – with one another, as well as with whatever outside elements that the technology needs to interact with. Composability also encompasses cost-efficiency of new application development and making updates to existing software.</p><p>(Fixing a bug or making an update is a particular challenge in blockchain-based dApps, where the smart contracts are immutable once live – and already have assets connected to them! It’s notoriously nerve-wracking for blockchain devs to push to mainnet because there’s no way to revise live code the way there is in centralized apps.)</p><p>The lower the cost and risk of change, the more participation in creating change, and the faster the change. And rapid change is what we need to keep up with the pace of change in the world, and to address the problems we’re facing on the timeline we need to address them.</p> A Complex Technology for a Complex World <p>In one sense, Holochain is quite a simple piece of software: it’s a lightweight framework that allows people to create and share data in a way that ensures accuracy without relying on concentrated power-brokers. It’s not an application layer in and of itself, and it’s highly neutral as to the kinds of applications that are built with it. And it’s unburdened by many of the complications of web2 (where data is subject to centralized control, surveillance, censorship, and points of failure) or early web3 (where global consensus mechanisms and massive data replication result in high computing costs and slow processing).</p><p>In another sense, though, Holochain is highly complex: there’s actually a lot of technology that goes into ensuring data integrity without centralized components. This is partly because Holochain is a networking system, and any networking system has to deal with many ‘states’ of data (across many computers) by either updating them all together or otherwise integrating them with one another. But it’s also because Holochain doesn’t force the network into a universally shared state (which would result in enclosure points) but rather enables massive simultaneity of perspectives. Everyone in a Holochain application space represents their own record, yet all the records remain tamper-proof. If that sounds like a complex challenge, you’re on the right track. It’s no wonder Holochain has only recently become ready for prime time, after years of work.</p><p>And yet, nothing less complex would map to the problem space Holochain is designed to address. Global challenges are interrelated and multi-faceted in their causes and effects, so they require interrelated and multi-faceted solutions. You can’t solve the energy crisis, pollution, deforestation, or hunger with centralized systems – or, as it turns out, with blockchain tokenization – any more than you can fix a meadow with a hammer. Matters have gotten out of hand precisely because we have been force-fitting living systems through power-entrenching enclosure points for centuries.</p><p>What is required is a radical, widespread shift away from extractive economics and toward regenerative economics, yet the power imbalances we’ve created over time perpetuate the cycle of extractive power. This is why we maintain that Holochain or something like it is a necessary foundation for saving the world.</p><p>The technological capacity to have built Holochain, and now Holochain itself, have come along not a moment too soon. Now we just need to put it to work.</p>

<p>All communication relies on one or more carriers. At the most basic level, when you’re speaking to a group of people in a room, the air is the carrier for the sound waves moving through it. You pass air through your vocal chords and shape your mouth in funny ways, and a bunch of compression waves emerge and fill the room with information that others then decode. No one can just grab the words out of the air to stop them from reaching someone else. The carrier is unenclosable.</p><p>For the sake of contrast, let’s say your boss puts out a suggestion box, in order to give you and your fellow employees the opportunity to make a difference in the workplace. Sounds nice, right? And yet, the box is enclosed; there’s no way to see how many suggestions have been made, or which ones have been discarded before even reaching the people who could implement them. The system includes a filtering mechanism that allocates some degree of control to whoever is in charge of the box. And isn’t the suggestion box system designed, in part, to enable that layer of control? If they didn’t want the ability to filter, they might have just invited suggestions openly during a meeting with everyone present.</p> A Brief History of Communication <p>Before modern technology, or really before the development of written language, communication was generally transmitted by unenclosable carrier. Oral traditions were the norm in prehistoric times, and they are preserved today in indigenous cultures around the world — cultures we often respect for their ways of reaching alignment quickly, resolving tensions directly, and treating their members with honor. (Consider our postmodern fascination with the talking stick and council of elders.) This social wisdom is surely related to the unenclosable medium of communication they used.</p><p>The point at which direct oral communication reaches its limits is the point at which it becomes important to communicate at scale, across distance or time. Want to rally a crowd? You’ll need amplification. Want to coordinate troops in the field? You’ll need some form of written communication. Want to operate a nation or empire? You’ll need carriers of all different sorts: messengers, letters, telegraphs, whatever.</p><p>And yet, all of the carriers we have successfully used to extend the reach of communication have also introduced more potential for enclosure, which in turn has led to power imbalances. Writing gave rise to the literate class, the clerical class, who by virtue of privilege or position suddenly had outsize power, with access to libraries and information and the ability to make deals or even laws that others couldn’t understand without the help of the literate. The printing press gave rise to the editors, publishers, and booksellers who determined which books were published or promoted. Broadcast media gave rise to the media empires who could then influence what was broadcast. The ability to control the carrier results in the ability to control the message.</p> Covert and Overt Control <p>What’s actually true about oral cultures is not that control over messaging is impossible, but rather that the available control mechanisms are more overt. You can stop someone from speaking up around a fire if you physically attack them or try to shout over them. But then everyone knows you’re doing that, which means that your actions are subject to whatever social feedback mechanisms exist to temper abuses of power. So, really, what carrier enclosure gives rise to is covert power. The manager filtering the suggestion box; the allocation of FM bandwidth to someone over someone else; the private understandings between interest groups and politicians.</p>Really, what carrier enclosure gives rise to is covert power. Awash in Enclosable Carriers <p>As the speed and scale of communication has increased, so have the layers of enclosable carriers on which our communication relies. In newsprint and on television, it’s the advertisers, as well as executives who are bound to the interests of boards and shareholders, who exert (largely unseen) control over the content we receive. Our phone lines are subject to a variety of costs, controls, and oversights that we don’t have much of a choice about. Even getting on a plane (or flying one’s own) to a distant land — which is another way to communicate across distances — is highly constrained by licenses, airspaces, borders, passports, airport fees, and so on.</p><p>And of course we have the internet, which has given us a taste of radical participation and democratized access to information, but whose filters on access and information have begun to cause increasing alarm. There are centralized entities controlling the allocation of web addresses, domain names, and root servers. ISPs have the ability to block access to the internet altogether. Facebook, YouTube, and the like decide what content is inappropriate, and, perhaps more importantly, what content appears in your feeds. Amazon determines which products you can use the convenience of its site to buy, as well as which to promote. And, of course, Google steers you to some web sites over others, according to its secret algorithms.</p><p>Our ability to coordinate activity at scale has never been greater, but that coordination is also subject to centralized control and corruption like never before — and really to an unknown degree, because it is largely covert. Do we have any way of knowing the extent of Russian influence on recent U.S. elections? We don’t. We also don’t know the degree to which our ‘real’ news is adulterated and filtered, which is part of what makes fake news such an intractable problem: when all news is vulnerable to corruption to some degree, it’s hard to tell the difference between legitimate and falsified sources.</p><p>If we want to move into an era of intelligent, mutually beneficial, worldwide coordination, we will have to address the problem of communication enclosures. But first, a word about money.</p> The Enclosability of Money <p>Monetary systems are special cases when it comes to enclosability and covert control. We all have the capacity to produce value, but we have allowed our exchange of value to be mediated through money, which we’re not allowed to produce. (If we do, it’s called counterfeiting.) The few who are allowed to issue money use that privilege to constrain our participation in the marketplace.</p><p>In principle, a financial transaction could be as simple as two people exchanging value through a direct agreement, but in our world of enclosable carriers, transactions are controlled by many third parties that we don’t get to choose.</p><p>By way of example, let’s look at transacting through PayPal, which claims to offer peer-to-peer payments to ‘anyone with an email address’. But if you want to pay your friend for something, you’re subject to many layers of control you cannot opt out of:</p>  You must connect to the internet via a semi-monopoly of telcos/ISPs.  The connection must supply an IP address, which is under the control of ICANN, the international body that delegates ranges of addresses to specific licensees of their choosing.  You need to establish an HTTPS connection, which requires certificates issued by a root authority.  Your email must be routed to and stored on an email server, which is typically not under your control.  The email address uses a domain name, which is subject to central control via ICANN, domain registrars, root servers, and nameservers.  You must go through the PayPal app or website, which is under their corporate control (as well as all the aforementioned domain handlers and routers).  Your PayPal account must be active and in good standing, at their discretion.  You transact in a currency, whether dollars, euros, or yen, that is fundamentally out of your control. Governments can freeze accounts, limit international transactions, and garnish wages, not to mention influence the money supply in ways that affect what your currency is worth.  You use a central payment source, such as a bank or credit card, that can reverse transactions, charge fees, block access, and close accounts.  <p>Does that sound like peers interacting directly with each other? Or does it sound like a bunch of people got invited to your party who you’d have preferred to leave out of the mix?</p> But What About My Favorite Blockchain Project? <p>And so we come to the blockchain and, more broadly, the whole decentralization movement. If you’re a participant in this ecosystem, you might be thinking that blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and other blockchain applications, at least the ‘best’ ones, are precisely the antidote to the problem of carrier enclosability.</p><p>It’s true that blockchain applications have, in many cases at least, offered an exciting means of collaborating outside the reach of outsized government and corporate middlemen. But how unenclosable are they really? Blockchain protocols all rely on some mechanism of global consensus to determine which transactions are considered legitimate enough to be added to the shared record. This means that many nodes – computers on a given network – must agree with one another before officially adopting any information, then storing it as a global state, meaning that all nodes hold all the same data. It’s an understandable approach: replicating data globally might seem like the only way to coordinate at scale without being subject to centralized authority or being susceptible to data-tampering.</p><p>One problem with this approach, though, is that global consensus mechanisms turn out to be a form of carrier enclosure, since they necessarily give power to some people over others to determine the legitimacy of transactions. Ordinary users like you and me do not write directly to the blockchain, nor do we participate in the consensus mechanism that results in data being written to the blockchain. We defer to miners and stakers do those things on our behalf, and in doing so we turn over our authority to them to say what’s written to the record.</p><p>What’s more, not all miners and stakers have equal power. In proof-of-work (PoW) protocols, those who own more computing resources have more say. In proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, which have become more popular in recent years, those who put up more money as betting stakes have more say. The more computing resources or the more betting stakes you own, the more money you make, which earns you the ability to buy more of those things. Thus, both protocols have a rich-get-richer effect and converge toward greater and greater consolidation of wealth and power over time.</p><p>Even more carrier enclosure has resulted from blockchain’s attempts to solve its efficiency problems. It turns out that achieving global consensus and managing global state require a tremendous amount of processing power and storage capacity, resulting in wait times and fees for every transaction, as well as <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">posing an obstacle to blockchain’s ability to scale to the needs of real-world challenges</a>. Blockchains and blockchain-related projects have tried to address these issues in various ways: so-called ‘layer-1’ solutions attempt to increase the efficiency of global consensus, generally by concentrating authority to some nodes more than others in determining the global state (EOS has 21 ‘block producers’, Cardano has ‘slot leaders’ and ‘pool representatives’, and TRON has 27 ‘super representatives’), while ‘layer-2’ solutions perform computations or store data off-chain on more centralized networks or more concentrated ‘side chains’, then periodically merge records into the blockchain. Both layer-1 and layer-2 solutions channel control through an increasingly narrow club of authorized representatives who are empowered to accept (or refuse) our transaction.</p><p>And real communication enclosures can happen and have happened in blockchain projects. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">Ethereum hard fork in 2016</a>, right-minded as it may have been, was a means of invalidating transactions that had occurred. EOS has also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-reverses-previously-confirmed-transactions-as-pundits-decry-centralization">reversed transactions</a>, as has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-cash-miners-undo-attackers-transactions-with-51-attack">Bitcoin Cash</a>.</p><p>So, even though the very intention of many blockchain projects is to address intermediation and the centralization of power, they are actually subject to the same kinds of power imbalances we see in other mediums. It’s a tilted playing field, and even a slightly tilted playing field results in a <a href="https://artbrock.medium.com/blockchain-blind-spots-1904d490218d">self-reinforcing feedback loop</a> that eventually leads to massive wealth imbalances – which is a fair narrative for what’s happened in economies around the world over the course of the last 500 years.</p><p>So we’re back to our original question: is it possible to have a system of communicating and transacting that 1) is truly unenclosable and 2) is capable of massive scale?</p> Having It Both Ways <p>In considering how a communication system might be both unenclosable and scalable, let’s look at the evolution of language itself. How does language arise? Who gets to change the rules of language? We do. Any one of us can create a new word, turn of phrase, or other language pattern that may or may not spread based upon whether others freely adopt it. If it spreads far enough, it becomes part of a language. There is no central committee that determines what you can say or not, or what gets adopted or not.</p>A new ecosystem of communication might look something like the spaces of language itself.<p>So, a new ecosystem of communication might look something like the spaces of language itself. We can imagine a scenario in which anyone can spin up new protocols for interacting — protocols that can be voluntarily adopted by those who choose to participate in them. Anyone is free to transfer the rulesets of any given space into another space, just as anyone is free to populate an uninhabited island, start speaking any particular language there, and invent new words.</p><p>This does not mean an absence of rules. Protocols are essential within any given space for filtering signal from noise, and to avoid the gaming of that space. People need to be free to create any kind of space on the network, but that doesn’t mean that all the activities within voluntarily joined spaces must also be unrestricted. To continue with our analogy: maybe on a certain island there’s a protocol that new residents introduce themselves at a weekly meeting, or post a bio on a bulletin board or profile page. Maybe there’s a social norm not to interrupt one another at certain meetings, and there might be corrective protocols activated if someone repeatedly violates that norm. Notice, though, that these rulesets only pertain to the particular scope of this island (which people can choose to join or not), rather than being built into the language itself or governing migration among islands in general.</p><p>So, one key ingredient in making any system fundamentally unenclosable is free association: the ability for anyone to create segmented spaces that people can join or not, with rulesets that are particular to those spaces. An unenclosable version of Wikipedia would be free of the centralized servers that host the data today, but it would still have protocols that say how articles are written. An unenclosable version of Twitter would still have a character limit. It wouldn’t make sense for someone to be able to post a tweet on Wikipedia or an encyclopedic article on Twitter. Within the scope of each app, people are free to express themselves according to the parameters they opted into when joining the app.</p><p>Many apps will even need to have centralized aspects of control, such as moderation by individuals or groups. But if the underlying carrier system is unenclosable, everyone owns and controls their own data (versus having it held in centralized or third-party enclosure points), so everyone always has the option of leaving the application space for any reason, including if they don’t like some new rule or the way the space is being moderated.</p><p>Which leads us to another fundamental aspect of an unenclosable system: forkability, which is the freedom for anyone to spin up alternative application spaces, based on the same (or similar) source codes and rulesets, and invite people to the new version. For true forkability, users need to be able to migrate easily between versions, taking their data from one version — such as their complete activity history on a social network or search engine — and load it into the new version. This is, of course, very much not the case with the likes of today’s Facebook and Google, who own and control your data, making only a fraction of it available to you.</p> A Natural Selection <p>With free association and forkability in place, an evolutionary phenomenon emerges: the spaces themselves, each with their own patterns and protocols, enter into a process of natural selection. The ones that solve problems better or serve people better will gain greater adoption, while the ones that don’t do as good a job will die off. To return to the island analogy again: if people can move freely between islands, bringing language patterns from one to the other, the dialects that are most suitable to people’s needs will be the ones that thrive and spread.</p>With free association and forkability in place, an evolutionary phenomenon emerges. Holochain Is Unenclosable by Design <p>Holochain is designed to foster this kind of evolution. It’s a framework for building and running applications in a truly peer-to-peer way, with zero centralized infrastructure and therefore no vulnerability to corruption over time. Wealth and influence can still flow within the application spaces according to patterns mutually agreed to within those spaces: reputation systems, ownership systems, subscriptions, sales, badges, degrees, or whatever else makes sense for the nature of the application. But no one can gain influence by simply controlling the medium of communication itself. The work of holding and transferring the data is distributed among the regular participants within the application, with everyone hosting their own data and sharing a bit of the load of hosting the data published to the network. Same thing with the work of validating data, such as verifying account balances or making sure posts conform to formatting rules: that job is also spread equally among the regular participants within the application.</p><p>And in case you don’t like the rulesets of a given application space, Holochain guarantees, through a combination of technical and legal provisions, that you can spin up alternatives and take your data with you between applications.</p><p>(We get deeper into how Holochain works in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unleashing-the-power-of-unenclosable-carriers-and-how-holochain-can-help/">Part 3 of this series</a>.)</p> The Future of Communication	 <p>What becomes possible in a world of unenclosable carriers isn’t just better versions of Twitter or Wikipedia. It’s an explosion of entirely new ways of collaborating and transacting whose forms we can only begin to guess at. What might be possible if we didn’t have corporations, governments, or surveillance systems in the middle of our communication? Could a system of unenclosable carriers help us solve some of humanity’s most intractable problems? We turn to this very question in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">Part 2 of this series</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">first article</a> in this three-part series explored unenclosability as an essential property of non-corruptible communication channels. We suggest heading there, if you haven’t already, before reading this article.</p><p>This piece explores what becomes possible in a world of unenclosable carriers. Which is not an easy thing exactly, because really what becomes possible in such a world is an explosion of innovations, the evolution of entirely new social patterns that are beyond what we can predict through the lens of existing ideas. Just as it’s hard to speculate on the kinds of biological organisms that will thrive a million years from now, we can’t really guess at what social organisms will be most useful in the next 10 or 20 years once no holds are barred.</p><p>Still, if we can’t fully paint a picture, maybe we can at least offer a palette sufficient to inspire a sense of what’s possible. As we do, we’ll find out that the prospect of a world built on unenclosable carriers (Holochain or otherwise) isn’t just exciting; it’s completely necessary for people and planet to thrive in the coming generations. Maybe that’s a bold claim, because it amounts to saying that an unenclosable carrier system is a key ingredient in, well, saving the world. And yet it’s what our analysis indicates, so we’d be amiss if we didn’t state the matter clearly and directly. If the boldness of the claim intrigues you to read on, all the better. </p><p>We offer the palette by considering well-known, far-reaching challenges in four domains: food production, energy production, money systems, and planetary stewardship. Within each, we look at how the challenges may actually be symptoms of broken or outdated underlying architectures – patterns of carrier enclosure that were created for good reasons but have actually painted us into a corner such that there’s no way out except to shift the architectures themselves. We then consider a number of alternatives, either experiments already underway or ones we can easily imagine, that gesture in the direction of what’s possible in a world of unenclosable carriers.</p><p>Alright, let’s dive in.</p> 1. Restoring the Quality of Our Food  The problem: <p>The nutritional content per calorie of the modern diet has declined significantly over the last 100 years, thanks to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/05/16/723693839/its-not-just-salt-sugar-fat-study-finds-ultra-processed-foods-drive-weight-gain">predominance of ultra-processed food</a>, the <a href="https://directorsblog.nih.gov/tag/low-quality-carbohydrates/">filling of many mass-produced products with simple carbohydrates and non-nutritional fillers</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15637215/">changes in varieties of crops grown to increase yields</a>, and a decline in the quality of fresh food as a result of soil depletion [<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/soil-depletion-and-nutrition-loss/">1</a>] [<a href="https://soils.wisc.edu/facstaff/barak/poster_gallery/minneapolis2000a/">2</a>] [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/may/15/foodanddrink.shopping3">3</a>] and possibly even <a href="https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511">increased carbon in the atmosphere</a>.</p> But what if… <p>…these problems are actually symptoms of structural issues with the very mechanisms by which food is created, sold, and distributed? What if the soil is depleted and the food is overprocessed because of enclosed-carrier dynamics that have created <a href="https://www.tharawat-magazine.com/facts/top-ten-agribusiness-companies/#gs.xknwd5">big-ag</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/10-companies-control-the-food-industry-2016-9">big-food</a> giants who control much of the market — and whose incentives are directly misaligned with our nutritional needs?</p><p>Independent family farming used to be much more common [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/16/the-decline-of-the-small-american-family-farm-in-one-chart/">1</a>] [<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2018-04-04/family-farms-pushed-to-get-big-or-go-bust">2</a>] [<a href="https://www.salon.com/2015/02/10/what_nobody_told_me_about_small_farming_i_cant_make_a_living/">3</a>] [<a href="https://www.t-g.com/story/2646155.html">4</a>] [<a href="https://www.thedailystar.com/news/local_news/number-of-family-farms-continues-to-decline/article_7b3c5532-e02e-5e07-8c62-5881899f616c.html">5</a>]. But increased centralization throughout the food markets have <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/08/small-farms-big-business-family-farms-struggle-against-industrial-agriculture/">made it more difficult for farmers to survive</a> without growing big. “Get big or get out,” said Earl Butz, Richard Nixon’s Secretary of Agriculture <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/04/usa.obituaries">said in 1973</a>. Today, it’s the largest growers — or at least the ones that subscribe to the big-ag programs for seed, feed, fertilizer, and distribution — that enjoy reliable access to the financing needed to compete at scale. And garnering space at grocery chains, even at the more principled ones such as Whole Foods, often <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/getting-your-product-on-shelves-at-whole-foods-just-got-harder-1518085801">requires 6-figure slotting fees</a> and the ability to produce at massive scale.</p><p>Want to ‘buy local’? Good luck: you’re limited to what’s available during the growing season in your area, and you’ll pay <a href="https://www.fdrsinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JFDR_49.1_4_Curtis.pdf">more than at the supermarket</a> because local growers generally can’t come close to matching mass-produced pricing. Want to go organic? Studies suggest that the herbicides known as glyphosates — which Monsanto markets as Roundup, and which the World Health Organization has concluded is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)70134-8/fulltext">“probably carcinogenic to humans”</a> — make their way <a href="https://toxics.usgs.gov/highlights/glyphosate02.html">into water supplies</a> and even <a href="https://www.producer.com/2019/01/glyphosate-residues-snare-organics/">organic crops</a>.</p>Shelves at supermarket chains display the products that most serve the interests of the industry’s major stakeholders, and those products are filled with ingredients that do the same.<p>Our access to food is controlled by centralized market players that we don’t get to choose. Mega-corporations like Kraft &amp; Nestle control companies up and down the whole supply chain. Shelves at supermarket chains display the products that most serve the interests of the industry’s major stakeholders, and those products are filled with ingredients that do the same. Farmers are paid simply for pounds of yield, so they understandably favor the cheapest way to achieve high outputs, without regard to the nutritional content of the food or the harmful effects of chemical herbicides or fertilizers.</p><p>And regulators and legislators, many of whom are former big-ag executives or at least receive campaign funding from them, naturally favor centralized interests over those of independent growers.</p><p>Food quality inevitably declines as profit-driven companies race to the bottom in a quest for ever-cheaper sources and ingredients, with governments incentivized to cheer them on.</p> An alternative future is possible. <p>The explosion of labels and certifications like “organic/bio”, “fair trade”, “free-range”, “hormone-free”, “cage-free”, and so on point to the info-age demand for more visibility into the flows and processes that define our food production. A newer generation of certifications focus on “<a href="https://www.scsglobalservices.com/services/sustainably-grown-certification">sustainable</a>” growing practices and even “<a href="https://regenorganic.org/">regenerative</a>” ones, meaning they restore the health of ecosystems that have been degraded through industrial farming or other industry.</p><p>Labels may be only partial indicators — organic food can still come from depleted soil, for example — but at least they move the industry in the right direction. And they point to an opportunity to create massively greater accountability in our food supply chains, incentivizing producers through market dynamics to do right by the consumers.</p><p>Yet supply-chain transparency and consumer information really only works at scale in the case of carrier unenclosability. Without it, certifications themselves can easily become stale or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/organic-milk-may-not-be-organic-2017-5">corrupt</a>. The ability to create a new certification standard needs to be like creating a new turn of phrase in a language: anyone can do it, and the expression spreads if it’s useful, rather than being subject to centralized (government or corporate) oversight over what takes hold. This way, any community can invent, evolve, and enforce the kind of quality assurance that it needs.</p><p>One promising example is the <a href="https://justoneorganics.com/pages/mission-arc-4">Just One Organics Living Economy System </a>(JOOLES), which plans to incentivize regenerative, high-nutrition growing practices by creating a feedback loop directly within the economics of food production. Growers who maintain high soil standards (as verified by spectroscopic analyses of the nutritional content of their produce) gain access to valuable contracts for their grade-B produce known as ‘seconds’ as well as interest-free credit lines that they can use to increase their growing capacity.</p> The implications are game-changing. <p>Today, even as healthier growing practices become theoretically more profitable as a result of rising consumer demand, many farmers remain entrenched in low-nutrition, high-chemical growing practices because they lack access to the funding required to shift their operations. It’s the biggest agriculture companies that have access to the cheapest funding, and they make that funding available only to growers who buy the company’s products, sell the company their outputs, or both. Low-quality, high-yield agriculture remains dominant, at least in part, because existing powers have an incentive to perpetuate their already-profitable practices, despite their destructive impacts and growing consumer appetites for something different.</p><p>Projects like JOOLES have the potential to flip that script by linking quality-oriented producers directly with funding from quality-oriented consumers. And doing so using a framework like Holochain ensures that, while money can flow to companies who create value for consumers, no one will be able to concentrate power by virtue of saying who can or cannot transact or collaborate. In a world of unenclosable carriers, consumers will be empowered to continually invent new structures to incentivize the nutrition they actually want, free from the enclosures of entrenched interests that seek to extract short-term profits.</p> 2. Solving the Energy Crisis  The problem: <p>Humans are using the planet’s energy stores faster than they can replenish. This appears to be a function of our reliance on cheap, finite stores of fossil fuel to power an ever-hungrier array of industry, combined with the difficulty of bringing online alternative energy solutions in a cost-effective way. Despite massive sums spent on research and development over many years, we remain drastically ill-equipped to meet energy demands in the coming post-fossil-fuel era.</p> But what if… <p>…this problem is actually a symptom of a centralized energy economy in which entrenched powers have strong incentives to keep us reliant on how we harvest and distribute energy today rather than scale up viable alternatives?</p><p>Consider, for example, how the utility monopolies have used their influence to protect themselves against competition from renewables. They have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/climate/rooftop-solar-panels-tax-credits-utility-companies-lobbying.html?_r=0">worked to curtail production of solar power in homes</a> by lobbying to eliminate tax breaks for solar installations. When ‘net-metering’ legislation has been introduced to require that utility companies pay consumers for surplus power produced at home, energy companies have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/utility-companies-lobbying-campaigns-solar-2017-7">lobbied against it</a> and successfully eliminated it in several U.S states, in some cases doing so explicitly on the grounds that solar proliferation could hurt their profits. Even U.S. government agencies have moved to protect the fossil fuel industry from competition by alternative energy sources, pursuing policies to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/business/energy-environment/wind-power-base-load.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fdiane-cardwell&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;pgtype=collection">discourage utility companies from investing in renewables</a>.</p>The utility monopolies have used their influence to protect themselves against competition from renewables.<p>Or consider how oil-industry power brokers in both the private and public sector <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F#Oil_companies">worked to undermine the development and adoption of early electric cars</a> in the early 2000s in the United States, including through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation">disinformation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturfing</a>, because electric vehicles threatened oil company profits.</p><p>These kinds of counterproductive scenarios, commonplace as they may be, are not necessary. They are consequences of how the flow of electricity is enclosed by centralized power brokers as it moves across the world. There may have been good reasons to allow for those enclosures at the time, such as reliability and scalability, but when building on unenclosable systems like Holochain, it’s actually possible to have it both ways: clean-energy projects that have the resources for large-scale impact and are immune to corruption by proprietary business interests.</p> An alternative future is possible. <p>There is actually an abundance of innovative energy solutions in existence today, and there is promising research into new solutions for tomorrow. The challenge is circumventing the destructive grip the leading energy corporations have on the market that keeps innovations from proliferating. If communities of consumers, researchers, property owners, and entrepreneurs were able to collaborate and transact with true freedom, we could rapidly evolve new approaches to our energy problems.</p><p>Here are just a few kinds of solutions waiting to spread their wings in an unenclosable system:</p><p>A. Self-owned, self-generated power: the production of power on one’s own property, for one’s own use. One recent study found that residential solar production alone <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/70901.pdf">could supply around a quarter of the United States’</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_of_the_United_States#Electricity_consumption">total energy needs</a>. Add in the rest of usable rooftop space nationwide and <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65298.pdf">you get to 39%</a>, while California, where it’s especially sunny, could produce 74% of its power just through solar on existing rooftops.</p><p>B. Peer-produced power and micro-exchanges: the sharing of self-generated power across peer networks, with payments made through unenclosable currencies from those who net-consume power to those who net-provide power. Imagine if everyone were simply buying and selling electricity to one another – harvested from sun, wind, and rivers – &nbsp;with absolutely no centralized entity brokering or extracting value from those transactions. This ‘Internet of Energy’ is what <a href="https://redgrid.io/">Redgrid</a>, <a href="https://holo.host/project/redgrid/">powered by Holochain</a>, aims to create.</p><p>C. Smart grids: comprehensive restructuring of power grids to increase efficiency and decrease fuel usage, required infrastructure, and pollution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid#Load_adjustment/Load_balancing">Smart grids</a> involve different components (such as appliances, meters, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_conditioner">power conditioners</a>) ‘talking’ to each other and taking actions that reduce or balance system loads across time. For example, a smart grid might cause air conditioners at neighboring buildings to ‘take turns’ cycling on and off, thereby reducing spikes in overall usage and, in turn, reducing the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_demand">peak power</a> that the grid needs to be built to provide. Today, energy companies have incentives to suppress smart-grid technology since it threatens their current business models, but in a world of unenclosable carriers and open energy exchanges, micro-markets could emerge where small players compete to establish healthier patterns of energy use.</p><p>D. Novel developments in energy production. In a climate of unfettered research and development, resources could also flow to a variety of promising energy research frontiers (beyond wind and solar) that make sense to pursue but are today disregarded as fringe by centralized economic channels. Waves, tides, geothermal sources, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hawaii-first-to-harness-deep-ocean-temperatures-for-power/">deep ocean water</a>, and even <a href="https://medium.com/predict/no-longer-30-years-away-two-new-major-fusion-breakthroughs-bcb65106a013">fusion</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion">cold fusion</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy">zero-point energy</a>, and <a href="https://topmagneticgenerator.com/mit-experiments-with-overunity/">over-unity devices</a> have yielded promising discoveries which have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_encumbrance_of_large_automotive_NiMH_batteries">shelved or blocked</a> within today’s centralized energy climate. With peer-production and smart grids in place, it could become economically feasible to create a ready evaluation path and an open market for every garage inventor’s creative energy solutions.</p> The implications are game-changing. <p>The very idea that energy production needs to be centralized is actually fairly new. During the early industrial age 150 or 200 years ago, you didn’t need to plug into a centralized, monopoly-owned grid to run your factory; you just needed a river to turn your belts. Even steam engines that ran trains and turned heavy equipment could run on wood harvested and renewed within the local forest.</p><p>As foreign as it may sound today, decentralized power production was once the norm and could easily be again, sending centralized facilities the way of industrial-age relics like broadcast TV service, print-newspaper conglomerates, and the U.S. Postal Service. This is especially true now because we have technologies not just for producing large amounts of energy locally, but also for efficiently distributing and transacting for it across peer-to-peer networks. Add in the possibility of major funding sources being directed to mainly support, rather than suppress, the scaling of clean energy solutions, and we have a whole new ball game when it comes to powering humanity for centuries to come.</p><p>Of course, all of this would require a complete dismantling of the current enclosures around our energy systems. Existing patterns perpetuate because existing incentive structures perpetuate them. The future of energy production, like the future of nutrition, must be underpinned by the ability for groups to spin up new patterns of coordination at will.</p><p>And spinning up new patterns at will, it turns out, requires unenclosability not just in our communication systems but also our transacting systems. So let’s turn next to money.</p> 3. Creating Financial Systems That Work for Everyone  The problem: <p>The millennial generation is the first to be worse off than their parents economically [<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/millennials-are-much-poorer-than-their-parents-data-show/">1</a>] [<a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/national/studies-find-millennials-are-worse-off-than-their-parents-represent/article_c368cabe-03c5-11e9-85aa-1bf441595d2d.html">2</a>] [<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencelight/2018/11/19/heres-why-millennials-are-trailing-behind-financially/#6e4263575ed0">3</a>].

In the recent past it was common to comfortably raise a family and save for retirement on one decent salary, but today, second incomes, second jobs and side businesses are often needed to have the same quality of life that we used to [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/mar/18/more-people-than-ever-need-a-second-job-to-help-pay-the-bills">1</a>] [<a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/12/pf/side-hustle/index.html">2</a>] [<a href="https://stats.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1997/04/art1full.pdf">3</a>]. Is this the death knell of the modern dream?</p> But what if… <p>…running ever faster on the hamster wheel (but still struggling to get by) is a consequence of our money system being enclosed for the benefit of the few? What if our financial system is less like a level playing field where anyone can work hard and reliably succeed, and more like slot machines at a casino, rigged so the house always wins?</p>What if running ever faster on the hamster wheel (but still struggling to get by) is a consequence of our money system being enclosed for the benefit of the few?<p>In our enclosable, centralized system of currency, money is issued as debt by the banks [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/18/truth-money-iou-bank-of-england-austerity">1</a>] [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nBPN-MKefA&amp;list=PLmpODdsfprYH4Fhsso8PVPQBNxVDQSgb_&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s">2</a>] [<a href="https://positivemoney.org/how-money-%20works/how-banks-%20create-money/">3</a>] [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001434">4</a>] [<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022416/why-banks-dont-need-your-money-make-loans.asp">5</a>], with more debt always being created than money issued. This forces the issuance of more money each year than the previous (and thus more debt) in order to keep up with interest and avoid collapse due to foreclosures, defaults, and bankruptcies. Through compounding interest, this debt grows exponentially, ever widening the gap between money owed and the money supply available to repay it. The debt is owed by individuals, corporations, and governments who rely on borrowed money in order to invest in homes, infrastructure, and so on — all of whom then need to earn even more each year as interest compounds. The economy is literally forced to grow, or collapse.	</p><p>If this doesn’t already <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-wall-street-ponzi-scheme-called-fractional-reserve-banking/11600">sound a lot like a Ponzi scheme</a>, consider it from the angle of the bankers: as they issue money through loans, the debt owed to them on that money compounds, so in order for borrowers to repay the debts on the money issued last year, bankers need to issue even more money as debt this year. Just like in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme">Ponzi Scheme</a>, this cycle continues and builds exponentially until it reaches its limits of growth, at which point it collapses. </p> An alternative future is possible. <p>We may have so taken for granted that our currency is issued by central authorities and used to manipulate commerce that it’s hard to imagine alternatives taking hold at any kind of scale. And we previously explored how blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, despite their rhetoric, are actually enclosable and are ultimately subject to the same pitfalls of centralized power as corporations and governments. But if we toss out all of our assumptions, we can actually imagine currency taking on entirely new forms. Here are two.</p><p>A. Mutual credit.<br>In a mutual credit system, currency is issued not by a central authority, but by participants granting each other credit according to mutually agreed-upon rules. Money is issued when someone spends into the negative, thus borrowing against the system, while others keep positive balances by receiving revenue before they spend. Since every transaction involves offsetting positive and negative balance adjustments, the currency supply is net-zero, meaning that the sum of all the outstanding positive and negative balances in the system is always zero, just like on a balance sheet.</p>In a mutual credit system, the currency supply is net-zero, meaning that the sum of all the outstanding positive and negative balances in the system is always zero.<p>The rules for who can draw credit vary among mutual credit systems, but one favored approach is to allow only established producers of value to borrow money. In <a href="https://files.holo.host/2017/11/Holo-Currency-White-Paper_2017-11-28.pdf">HoloFuel</a>, for example — the currency system of the <a href="https://holo.host/">Holo hosting network</a>, which is powered by Holochain — users who have demonstrated past capacity to provide hosting power receive lines of credit backed by their future hosting. Thus, not only are “loans” backed by actual value being created, but the very size of the active currency supply — the sum total of the positive balances (which is the inverse of the sum total of debt) — is grounded in the actual size, the actual supply and demand, of the hosting economy.</p><p>Similarly, JOOLES, which we mentioned earlier in this article, is a mutual-credit currency backed by the production of food, with the money supply growing or shrinking proportionally to the supply and demand for produce.</p><p>With the currency supply grounded in the economic output it represents – and with no debt created beyond what’s issued directly for value-creators – there’s no ‘economy’ that needs to keep growing just to feed itself. And with currency issued directly by the value producers, no one can extract value just by virtue of having a monopoly on money issuance. A mutual-credit currency based on an unenclosable carrier such as Holochain is truly peer-to-peer, completely free of any centralized components.</p><p>A bonus benefit of mutual credit is that it may bypass the challenges that many cryptocurrencies face with regard to securities laws (which are themselves a form of carrier enclosure). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in particular has a penchant for shutting down blockchain-based projects that issue speculative tokens, but because mutual credit is issued only in the moments when value is actually exchanged, it is not a future-based investment and, as such, may be difficult to classify as a security.</p><p>B. Triple-bottom-line currencies.<br>Triple-bottom-line currencies are another way of optimizing currency, and thereby the economy, for wide collective benefit. You may have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line#People,_the_social_equity_bottom_line">triple-bottom-line (TBL) accounting</a>, which some companies use to evaluate their performance on the basis of not only profit but also people, which is the well-being of everyone impacted by the business, and planet, which is the business’s impact on the natural environment. (Profit, people, and planet are sometimes known as the three ‘P’s.) TBL accounting is an attempt to account for, or ‘internalize’, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">externalities</a> of transactions, which is to say the costs (or benefits) of doing business that are not reflected in revenues. It’s a noble idea, but it’s impossible to accurately account for a transaction’s externalities, given all the hidden and chain reactions that take place in the complex systems of human dynamics and planetary ecosystems.</p><p>Another way of stating this problem is that any company’s internal assessment of their external effects is skewed by the company’s limited perspective (which is a kind of enclosure in its own right) even if it has the best intentions.</p><p>In an unenclosable financial system, however, there’s a way around the problem: incorporating external feedback loops into the currency itself, based on input from people who are in a position, from vantage points outside the company, to assess its external impacts. This way, instead of expecting companies to care about people and planet and also do impossible accounting, a TBL currency enables a much simpler thing, which is to allow a company’s reputation for doing good or harm to impact its overall cost of doing business.</p><p>This approach is actually similar to what we know today as credit ratings, which are essentially reputation currencies that act in conjunction with today’s money systems to affect the cost and availability of money. But credit ratings factor in only your payment history, which corresponds to just one of the P’s: your ability to earn money (profit) and, in turn, reliably make profit for the bankers who lend you money. A ‘triple credit rating’, which could drive a ‘triple-bottom-line currency’, would also factor in your effects on people and planet. One possible approach could be:</p><p>(i) Your people rating affects your interest rates, in order to make it more attractive for you to borrow money if you’re deemed to affect people positively through your commerce, and less attractive if you’re not.</p><p>(ii) Your planet rating affects your transaction fees, with the idea being that polluters and extractors pay a tax to the system to offset the environmental costs borne by everyone. If you have a reputation for positively impacting the planet, you could actually incur a negative tax, which means you’re essentially being paid to transact by the system, in reflection of the good you externalize.</p><p>(iii) Your profit rating affects your credit limits, similar to existing credit ratings, with the idea being that your likelihood to pay back funds ought to remain a central factor in how much you can borrow.</p> The implications are game-changing. <p>Today, business is driven by the short-term imperative of financial profit and staying ahead of ever-compounding debt. Of course such an extractive system is driving a pattern of cancerously consuming the planet’s natural resources in the almighty name of Economic Growth. Of course we’re burning cheap but limited energy stores instead of building renewable infrastructure. And of course we’re farming in ways that maximize pounds of yield over soil health and more sustainable growing practices.</p><p>One mechanism by which today’s debt-driven economy has such a troubling effect is through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money">time cost of money</a>, which means that a dollar now is worth more than a dollar later. With debt everywhere, compounding interest is everywhere, so carrying a negative balance is expensive, while carrying a positive balance can be lucrative. The time cost of money incentivizes everyone to liquidate physical assets for cash as soon as possible. A tree is worth more dead than alive, goes one saying.</p><p>In other words: no matter what business asset you own — a forest, a website, a factory — you have an incentive to convert that asset into numbers on a balance sheet as quickly as possible, even if it could produce more cash on a longer timeline. The more cash you can get now, the more you can put that cash to work in high-return financial instruments. Plus, if you’re like most business owners, you’re paying interest on the loans you took to capitalize your business — as well as on your personal debt (home, cars, college, and so on) — and cash could help pay off those costly loans.</p><p>It’s no wonder that long-term sustainability (of a business model or a planet) is such a low priority for most businesses. Extracting more fossil fuel, catching more fish, and selling more plastic is not just profitable but compoundingly profitable, even if we are completely outstripping the carrying capacity of our ecosystem.</p>Extracting more fossil fuel, catching more fish, and selling more plastic is not just profitable but compoundingly profitable, even if we are completely outstripping the carrying capacity of our ecosystem.<p>Speaking of which: the fact that it’s even possible to outstrip the carrying capacity of our ecosystem is, in part, a function of our currency supply being disconnected from the limits of the physical systems upon which the economy operates. Reconnecting these two phenomena is actually imperative for having a sustainable economy: if we don’t, we have no guardrails against outstripping the planet’s capacity to regenerate itself.</p><p>Mutual credit systems have a particularly seamless ability to connect to the carrying capacity of an economy, since the creation of currency can be strictly a function of spending into the negative by those who have demonstrated the ability to produce actual value, and the currency is backed by their future production of that value. Such a system also shifts the power away from the bankers who derive influence from their ability to create and charge for the money supply, allocating power instead to the value-creators themselves (those who are actually able to provide for people’s needs). Add in a triple-credit rating system and you bring greater good into the equation as well.</p><p>Imagine if the most powerful individuals on the planet were those who demonstrated the capacity to create the most benefit, rather than those who can extract the most resources.</p><p>It’s a good thing that we can imagine such a scenario, because this is exactly what it will take to tackle perhaps the most intractable problem we’re facing today.</p> 4. Saving the Planet  The problem: <p>There are, of course, many human-caused problems related to our natural ecosystem. We are currently causing the sixth major extinction event in biological history, we are polluting the oceans and atmosphere beyond what may be reversible, and we are rapidly outstripping the carrying capacity of our ecosystem.</p><p>For the purpose of illustration, let’s narrow things down and focus on the destruction of the rainforests, which are clearly disappearing at a rate faster than they can renew [<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/deforestation/">1</a>] [<a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/11/18/20970604/amazon-rainforest-2019-brazil-burning-deforestation-bolsonaro">2</a>] [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/world/americas/amazon-rainforest.html">3</a>]. Reasons appear to include narrow-minded policies in many tropical nations that are out of touch with the importance of rainforests to our planet’s health, along with the desirability of rainforest land for industrial farming and oil exploration.</p>Rainforests are disappearing at a rate faster than they can renew. But what if… <p>… these are actually symptoms of a deeper cause: that our enclosable systems have led us to account for the value of rainforests in short-term and shallow ways, making it inevitable that their stewards would choose to liquidate them now versus reap their benefits over time?</p><p>What is the true value of an acre of rainforest? It may be difficult to place a number, but any true-value calculation would have to account for the myriad ways the forest contributes to the greater ecosystem (and the economy) by continuing to exist: the carbon storage that keeps the planet from overheating, the oxygen supply that keeps us breathing, the rare tropical hardwoods which might be harvested sustainably over time, the utility of plants as food and medicine, the biodiversity that took billions of years to evolve and helps sustain food chains worldwide.</p><p>But try comparing the value of a thousand chairs or ten thousand gallons of milk this year to the value of keeping a million tons of carbon out of the atmosphere over the next 100 years, or to the survival of a certain salamander species that could keeping eating bugs and being food for birds for millions of years. That’s a challenging task in any case, but it’s completely impossible when our financial systems account for only the most shallow and short-term benefits: X dollars for the lumber, Y dollars for the drilling rights, and Z dollars for agricultural leases.</p><p>Which means there’s (at least) two issues at play here, if we break things down. One is the oppressive time cost of money: it’s better to get $10M now than $20M over the next 20 years. The other is that financial accounting is an inadequate representation of wealth in a complex system. Without proper accounting for externalities, it’s inevitable that we continue to eat the world for profit, unsustainably extracting natural resources for their cash value.</p> An alternative future is possible. <p>We’ve already looked at mutual credit and triple-bottom-line currencies as ways to foster sustainability and positive feedback loops at the level of currency design. Both would help bring incentives more in line with rainforest preservation. Now we look at an approach one layer up: the ways that assets are owned and shared.</p><p>Sharing economies.<br>Is it necessary for us to outright own as much as we currently do? Is it beneficial?</p><p>For example: How many hours of use per year does the average suburban lawnmower see? Maybe an hour a week for part of the year? That means they sit idle more than 99.7% of the time… yet it’s typical to have one in every household, causing all manner of negative externalities through their manufacturing, raw materials, waste, and (often) indoor storage space. Conventional accounting celebrates the manufacturing, sale, and maintenance of all these lawnmowers as positive numbers in “the economy”, but there’s a bigger picture badly missed by that perspective. Can you imagine the massive net benefit if neighborhoods could easily coordinate their use of lawnmowers through a shared-ownership, shared-use system built on unenclosable carriers?</p><p>Expanding outward, cars also seem ripe for this kind of exploration, as do, say, many kitchens and laundry spaces. Maybe someday even land might not need to be individually owned, but rather commonly owned and privately leased. This is the basis of Georgist economics, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">Georgism</a>, which also imagines that lease-holders could reap benefits from improving the land and be taxed for extracting resources from the land.</p><p>But we don’t need to go full Georgist to imagine hybrid systems – ‘sharing economies’ – that would retain basic property ownership but still lead to more efficient use of resources. One version is a kind of <a href="http://artbrock.com/blog/new-kind-commons-land-weaving-society">land-weaving society</a> in which owners permit the use of their property for a variety of beneficial purposes, using reputation and certification to authorize access. If I have a permaculture certification, for example, I might be invited to farm your land, perhaps for a fee or a share of yield, or maybe because it benefits you in other ways, like soil improvement or social rewards. Other certifications might permit me to sustainably harvest wood, gather food or medicinal herbs, hunt, or graze your livestock. “No Trespassing” signs could be replaced by technologically enabled “Enter Here” checkpoints, with RFID or smartphone-based tracking – and with micropayments transferring automatically in cryptocurrencies as agreed upon.</p>“No Trespassing” signs could be replaced by technologically enabled “Enter Here” checkpoints.<p>For a land-weaving type of approach to remain effective at any kind of scale, it would be critical that the systems for granting and tracking access — and for tracking reputations and certifications — be guaranteed to always remain fully decentralized, which means being built on an unenclosable carrier framework like Holochain.</p> The implications are game-changing. <p>What’s typical today is that only those who own or fully rent a piece of land can make much use of it. But this tight coupling of ownership and stewardship makes holding natural resources unlucrative as compared to liquidating them, due to the costs of ownership and the time cost of money. But we can begin to imagine how, if we decouple ownership from stewardship, the balance could tip such that growing the capacity of the land is more beneficial to the landowner than depleting it.</p><p>The closest analog we have today to what something like this might look like might be national parks, but these exist mainly as nature preserves reliant on government subsidies (and a bit of tourism revenue). As a result, they are subject to all the complications of centralized power, including <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/07/who-wants-disposable-plastic-water-bottles-in-national-parks/399113/">lobbying</a>, politically motivated <a href="https://www.npca.org/articles/2029-how-is-the-partial-government-shutdown-affecting-national-parks">government shutdowns</a>, and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/trump-bears-ears.html">declassification from protected status</a> by unilateral action.</p><p>In order to truly tip the balance such that stewarding a rainforest on an ongoing basis is more advantageous than destroying it for cash, multiple land uses need to be allowed to occur: not solely ecotourism, or harvesting edibles, or gathering medicinals or wood, but all of these and more, all gated through the appropriate membranes of access such as certifications, reputation systems, and fee structures.</p><p>And because each of these land uses are complex in their own right, it might not be one enterprise operating all of them, but various enterprises doing work within their zones of core competency, choreographing their operations with one another to maximize efficiency. For instance, the group permitted to harvest lumber might mark the trees they plan to cut down with three months’ notice, so that the gatherers could prioritize harvesting food, herbs, and other materials from those trees in particular. The type of coordination this requires is what makes unenclosable carriers so important: to whatever extent the coordination is channeled through central points of control, the system will corrupt over time, with power and money flowing to those who control the means of coordination.</p>There might be various enterprises doing work within their zones of core competency, choreographing their operations with one another to maximize efficiency.<p>Growing What’s Ours<br>Extrapolating from the idea of sharing economies, we might begin to completely reimagine what it means to solve for scarcity in general. As the naturalist Paul Krafel has pointed out in his enlightening (if productionally spartan) short film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuBMpc_3S04">The Upward Spiral</a>, there are basically two responses when faced with limited resources: one is to compete to maximize your own personal gain at the expense of others’, and the other is to act and interact in patterns that expand the amount of usable resources for everyone (including yourself).</p><p>We call the first strategy ‘get mine’, and we call the second ‘grow ours’. And what’s fascinating is that if you look across natural history, it’s ‘grow ours’ that evolution selects for over time, contrary to what we might infer from the ‘survival of the fittest’ narrative dominant within our cultural understanding of evolution (and in nature documentaries). Natural selection might actually be better understood as ‘<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Nature-Deliberate-Encounters-Visible/dp/189013242X">survival of the fit</a>’, as in “those whose characteristics are most fit for their environs are most likely to survive”. And a great way of being highly fit to one’s environs is to treat existing resources regeneratively, using the ones that exist to produce even more valuable resources.</p><p>Plants are great as this. They combine the abundant resources of sunlight, air, and water and produce all the carbon-sugars that comprise our planetary food chain. And look at how well that works out for them: they have literally spread to most of the surface area on earth, and they make up a vast majority of biomass on the planet. Carnivorous mammals, which need to employ more ‘get mine’ than plants to compete for limited food, are far more rare. But even they typically take only what they need, and not more than can be renewed, from their surroundings and from prey populations.</p>Plants combine the abundant resources of sunlight, air, and water and produce all the carbon-sugars that comprise our planetary food chain.<p>Growing ours is a good strategy in part because most of the resources we need to survive are actually renewable, meaning there’s an infinite supply if we treat them regeneratively. When we’re only competing against one another for how quickly we can extract those resources and short-term-profit from them, we outstrip the carrying capacity of the incredible engine of life that is our sun-fueled natural ecosystem, and the engine stops. On the other hand, when we take on a posture of enhancing the regenerative behaviors of ecosystems, the engine thrives, and so does humanity.</p><p>It’s not that ‘get mine’ is not useful in the right context and scale; individual agents within a market often need to compete for shares of a pie. But that’s precisely why it’s so critical that, at a collective level, we have feedback loops that check and balance our overall consumption, or else we’re just like a yeast colony that overconsumes its environment and causes its own demise. We must have systems that track our impact and make it visible, facilitate and reward the sharing of resources, and incentivize working together to leave the pie at least as big as we found it. And these systems must be built on unenclosable carriers or they will get hijacked again and again for the benefit of only a few, and the story plays out once more – different cast maybe, but same outcome.</p> A ‘Holocene Explosion’ of Social Organisms <p>Starting 541 million years ago, a remarkable thing happened: a period of just 20 million years gave birth to most of the biological diversity that exists today. It’s known as the Cambrian Explosion, and it was catalyzed by the information carrier known as DNA.</p><p>Here at the beginning of the 21st century, we are standing at the outset of a similar explosion, only this time, it’s social organisms, not biological ones, that are emerging. And it’s social DNA, not biological DNA, that is powering it. </p><p>Just as biological organisms are more than the sum of their cellular parts, with the whole living on as the cells die and are replaced, social organisms (or social patterns) are forms of collective coordination that live on beyond the participation of particular individuals. Corporations and governments are the most familiar examples, having dominated the human systems landscape for centuries, with religious groups, tribes, and all kinds of community structures also in the mix along the way.</p><p>Early challenges to that dominance began decades ago with experiments in more participatory ownership (such as different kinds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative">cooperatives</a>) and more participatory governance (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy">liquid democracies</a>), but it’s really the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web2</a>’ era of user-generated content, with its social networks and online marketplaces, that kicked the explosion into higher (second?) gear.</p><p>Now, ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a>’ organisms like decentralized marketplaces and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) use blockchain-based smart contracts to eliminate the need for corporate or government intermediaries entirely. Even though these new organisms end up giving power to new intermediaries (as we discussed in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">Part 1 of this series</a>), they are still shaking the snow globe and enabling us to at least imagine a world without centralized power.</p><p>The aim of this article has been to hint at such a world. Mutual credit, peer energy exchanges, sharing economies… these are examples of the kinds of social organisms that might emerge in an era of truly peer-to-peer communication and collaboration, built on a system of unenclosable carriers. But there are so many more unknowns than knowns about this new era. When any two or two billion people can invent new ways of interacting, unfettered by anyone moderating their behavior without their permission, the DNA of social organisms evolves with unprecedented speed. New ideas are encoded and tried, with the most fit being refined, combined, iterated, and propagated.</p><p>It’s an explosion of new social organisms like we’ve never seen before, a complete reimagining of how humans interact and organize. We call it the Holocene Explosion, named for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene">current geological epoch</a>, and it begins now.</p><p>Let’s tune in to one more thought experiment that might (barely) hint at the scope of something like this. Imagine you’re the CEO of a huge multinational corporation, and it’s your job to keep a pulse on the whole organization and to identify, diagnose, and resolve issues as they arise. Today, you get the information you need periodically in dense reports containing financial statements and other long-form statistics. The report has taken time to compile from all the different departments and field locations, so by the time you receive it it’s not very current. Plus it takes you time to read it, digest it into a mental model, and hopefully draw some kind of useful conclusions about the complex system the data represents.</p><p>But let’s say that this is the future, and you get your information very differently. What you’re looking at is not a 400-page report, but rather a nature scene depicted on a screen — maybe an aquarium of fish, a bit like the old screensavers. Each type of fish represents some part of the massive, complex system you’re managing, while the fishes’ behavior — like how fast or high they’re swimming, or how coordinated a school’s movements — represents some metric, interpreted and compiled by the sort of advanced intelligence that’s already available today.</p>What you’re looking at is not a 400-page report, but rather a nature scene depicted on a screen — maybe an aquarium of fish, a bit like the old screensavers.<p>What works so well about this scenario is not just that the data is delivered in real time, but also that it’s delivered in a format that is consistent with how the human perceptual system is designed to operate. You have on the wall in your office not paragraphs, charts, and graphs, but a simulated ecosystem acting as the real-time health monitor of a complex system, displayed in such a way that you can take in large amounts of information at a glance, millions of simultaneous data points even, by observing patterns among the fish or their environs: the rippling seaweed, the blooming algae, the bubbles, the water’s cloudiness, the current, the light. When something seems ‘off’, you open up an interface on your computer, click on the item of interest, and drill in for more information.</p><p>Imagine how effective you would be at taking the pulse of a system and adapting to it under these conditions.</p><p>Now imagine that it’s not just the CEO who has access to this monitor, but actually everyone in the company as well, in corners of their screens or on the walls in their departments, maybe with their views adapted according to what’s most relevant for their work. Now instead of only a few executives being responsible for managing everything, the whole is holding the whole. Everyone can see the system they’re impacting, feel a direct relationship to it, and problem-solve for its optimal health. Can you imagine how the spirit of ‘grow ours’ could spread across an organization if all the people who were actually doing the work to bring about change could see the effect of their activities on the system?</p><p>Now consider applying these kinds of feedback mechanisms to all manner of global conditions: intercontinental trade, harmony among peoples, and, yes, the health of rainforests, oceans, and the atmosphere. How much faster might we solve humanity’s most intractable problems if we were all seeing the impact of our collective action in real time? If we were problem-solving not through marching-in-the-streets social activism that tries to compel power brokers to act against their own economic interests, but rather by tapping into humankind’s collective creativity to invent new social and economic patterns that incentivize everyone to grow the whole?</p><p>What we’re talking about here is a quantum leap in coordinative capacity that doesn’t actually require a vast leap in technological capacity, at least not in the ‘high-tech’ sense. It’s more like the arising of language than advancements in nuclear fusion or space travel. Sure, there’s complexity in building an unenclosable framework for decentralized software applications, but the leap is mainly about arranging building blocks into new, more eloquent, more sustainable forms.</p><p>The fundamental technology needed, therefore, is a coordinative technology, one that facilitates the mashing up and remixing of components quickly and with as few barriers as possible. We need an efficient, tamper-proof, and resilient carrier for social DNA.</p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unleashing-the-power-of-unenclosable-carriers-and-how-holochain-can-help/">next and final article in this series</a>, we look at how Holochain is designed to be just such a technology.</p><p><br></p>

At GlobaliD, we see DeFi as a core pillar to the future of web3 with the potential to democratize finance.</p><p>That massive growth has also shone a light on issues such as fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing.</p><p>Money laundering spiked 30 percent in 2021, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401">according to Chainalysis</a>, with DeFi protocols receiving $900 million from illicit addresses.</p><p>DeFi projects typically rely on non-custodial wallets that aren’t tied to an identity and forgo KYC (know your customer) protocols altogether. Part of the issue is that relying on traditional identity frameworks undermines the decentralized vision for DeFi. Ignoring those procedures has driven DeFi’s frenetic growth, but it’s also attracting increasing attention from regulators.</p><p>SEC chief Gary Gensler has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401">stated on more than one occasion</a> that projects are still required to follow relevant regulations — no matter how “decentralized” they&nbsp;are.</p><p>Allowing any unidentified wallet to connect to and participate with the platform also opens DeFi projects up to bot attacks and bad&nbsp;actors.</p><p>This is where the natural symbiosis between decentralized finance and decentralized identity comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>GlobaliD’s self-sovereign identity solution allows DeFi projects to address their identity needs while maintaining the decentralized spirit of their&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Meanwhile, DeFi users used to being anonymous or pseudonymous can rest easy knowing that they control their digital identity, and that no one — including GlobaliD — can access their encrypted data without their permission.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/why-self-sovereign-identity-matters-8fd2c982ca2e">Why self-sovereign identity&nbsp;matters</a>  <p>From the XDC Network press&nbsp;release:</p><blockquote>As Layer 1 networks, like XDC Network, continue to roll out mainstream solutions, there is an increasing need for users to be able to bridge identity with on-chain solutions for fast and secure verification. This is where the GlobaliD integration can address today’s identification challenges by providing self-sovereign ID (SSI) for passwordless login to XDC Network’s leading dApps, protecting users from bots, scams, and bad actors. By combining GlobaliD’s reliable, trusted SSI with the XDC Network’s array of decentralized finance (DeFi) and dApps services, users now have a more safe and secure way to access XDC’s growing web3 ecosystem with a pathway for regulatory compliance.</blockquote><p>And here’s Billy Sebell, Head of Ecosystem Development for the XDC&nbsp;Network:</p><blockquote>As Web3 matures, enabling users to roam across networks without constant identification holdups is going to be crucial. Mainstream users shouldn’t have to understand the complexities of safe IDs and network bridging — nor should they bear the responsibility of complex identity management. Integrating GlobaliD with our new XDC Observatory creates the foundation for a streamlined user experience and represents a big step forward towards chain interoperability</blockquote><p>GlobaliD users will also have access to a brand new feature called the XDC Observatory, a block explorer that enhances data management and accessibility on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>This integration with XDC Network and DeFi is just the beginning at GlobaliD. We’re looking forward to working on a slew of upcoming applications of self-sovereign identity for financial tools, NFTs, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Given web3’s nascent state, we believe these partnerships are the key to building a web3 ecosystem that stays true to our values while building bridges to the rest of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>If your DeFi project is looking to incorporate decentralized identity, we encourage you to reach out to us: <a href="mailto:info@global.id">info@global.id</a></p><p>See also:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/trusted-airdrops-with-globalid-cf7cd6b51797">Trusted Airdrops with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-globalid-enhances-trust-for-xrpl-labs-xumm-wallet-d397cc836cf7">How GlobaliD enhances trust for XRPL Labs’ XUMM&nbsp;Wallet</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/defi-enabled-xdc-network-integrates-globalid-8eddac93fbc">DeFi-enabled XDC Network integrates GlobaliD</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 GiD Report#198 — How stablecoins break the monetary&nbsp;system <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-197-how-solana-makes-web3-possible-24a8acc23a96">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  How stablecoins break the monetary&nbsp;system  When regulators get it&nbsp;right  9 things you need to know about&nbsp;web3  This week in&nbsp;Solana  Tweet of the week — Wormhole&nbsp;edition  Stuff happens   1. How stablecoins break the monetary&nbsp;system Image: Sefa&nbsp;Ozel<p>When people think of money printing, they typically think of central banks like the Federal&nbsp;Reserve.</p><p>But outside of extreme circumstances such as quantitative easing in response to once in a generation disasters like the financial crisis in 2008 and the recent global pandemic, the Fed has historically outsourced the creation of money to&nbsp;banks.</p><p>Which makes sense. Banks have branches and customers. They have closer ties to the community. Banks are better positioned to understand where new money should&nbsp;go.</p><p>It’s a way to decentralize money creation.</p><p>That new money is created through a process called fractional reserve banking, which is really just a fancy term for how really boring banking works. Banks take in deposits. They also lend money. The amount of money they lend is greater than the number of deposits they take in — hence, their reserves are only a fraction of their&nbsp;lending.</p><p>When banks lend out more money than they have, they’re essentially creating new money out of thin&nbsp;air.</p><p>The Fed is generally happy with this system. It’s also why they’re worried about stablecoins. Unlike fractional reserve banking, many stablecoins are set up with 1-to-1 reserves. That’s not an issue in and of itself — some people prefer their coins to be&nbsp;stable.</p><p>The problem is the potential impact on the rest of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-02-01/hedge-funds-are-a-job-now">Matt Levine</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a>):</p><blockquote>A less obvious risk of stablecoins is that they might be too stable. A stablecoin is, among other things, a substitute for putting money in a bank. Banks are generally very safe places to put money, but they are not perfectly safe. There can be runs on banks; banks can fail. For most U.S. retail bank accounts this is not a very salient problem, since they are backed by government deposit insurance, but many large institutional pools of money (corporate cash accounts, money-market funds, etc.) park their money in short-term bank instruments and are sensitive to risk. If a bank gets riskier, it will lose deposits. And if a stablecoin is so stable that it is safer than a bank, then banks generally will lose deposits.</blockquote><blockquote>Why is this a risk? Well, banks do useful stuff. Classically, they take people’s deposits and lend them out to other people to start businesses and buy homes. The provision of credit by banks helps the economy grow. More to the point, the withdrawal of credit by banks hurts the economy, and the risk here is wrong-way. If people get nervous about banks and pull out all their money to put it in safer stablecoins, then (1) that will probably happen at a time when the economy is shaky and (2) that will definitely make the economy shakier. The bulk of the response to the 2008 financial crisis involved preventing runs on banks, because those would have made all of the problems of the crisis much&nbsp;worse.</blockquote><p>In other words, the existence of stablecoins could potentially exacerbate a retreat in money supply during economic downturns. It would also generally undermine the way modern money&nbsp;works.</p><p>Adding fuel to the fire are the returns being offered for stablecoins on certain platforms, which far exceeds what you’d get with a typical bank savings&nbsp;account.</p><p>(On the other hand, the world’s biggest stablecoin, Tether, doesn’t <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">appear all that&nbsp;stable</a>.)</p><p>Of course, none of these means that we should be writing off stablecoins. It just means there’s plenty to consider in the context of what this means for our monetary system going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>(The U.S. Senate will be looking at just that next week in <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/132540/us-senate-slates-hearing-on-stablecoins-for-february-15">a hearing scheduled to discuss stablecoins</a>.)</p><p>As Matt&nbsp;adds:</p><blockquote>I should say here that my sympathies are with the Fed researchers: I think that fractional reserve banking and credit intermediation are good, and accidentally getting rid of them would be bad. But I am also aware that lots of crypto people disagree; they got into crypto specifically because they are suspicious of the existing financial system and of fractional reserve banking. And while “U.S. regulators want to crack down on crypto to protect banks” sounds a bit like a conspiracy theory, it has some truth to&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb </a>— Matt Levine: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-02-01/hedge-funds-are-a-job-now">Hedge Funds Are a Job&nbsp;Now</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/132540/us-senate-slates-hearing-on-stablecoins-for-february-15">US Senate slates hearing on stablecoins for February&nbsp;15</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/31/silvergate-bank-confirms-diem-tech-acquisition/">Diem Confirms Shutdown as Silvergate Acquires the Project’s Assets</a>   2.

Naturally, it’s from an Ethereum-centric perspective, but the high level points are&nbsp;good:</p>  Web3 is the new trendy name for the decentralized web.  Web1 is read-only, Web2 is read-write, Web3 is read-write-own.  Web3 is a money layer for the internet.  Web3 is an identity layer for the internet.  Web3 is a reaction to social networks not keeping our data secure, and selling it for their own&nbsp;profit.  Web3 is a way for artists and creators to not only own what they produce on a platform, but the platform&nbsp;itself.  Web3 is a new patron model for the internet.  Web3 makes it easy to set up cooperative ownership and governance structures.  Web3 is still not entirely decentralized.  <p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-web3-here-are-some-ways-to-explain-it-to-a-friend/">What is Web3?

   by Martin Kuppinger Success in the Digital Age depends on many factors.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p>Success in the Digital Age depends on many factors. Bringing the right digital services to the market on time is the foundation for differentiating in today’s volatile competitive landscape. However, when businesses become more and more digital, identity and security move to the forefront. Cumbersome customer journeys as well as security weaknesses and incidents can quickly erode what has been achieved by creating modern digital services.

 As tensions mount with Russia, we examine the use of cryptocurrency by Ukrainian NGOs and volunteer groups to crowdfund war.&nbsp; Our analysis shows that hundreds of cryptoasset donations totalling several hundred thousand dollars have been made to these groups – increasing by over 900% in 2021.  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>[Updated 10/2/2022, to reflect additional information provided by the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance.]</p> 
<p>Volunteer groups have played a critical role in the Ukraine conflict over the past decade. During the Maidan Revolution – which led to the ousting of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014 – volunteer organizations emerged to support the protesters and assist the wounded. <br><br>Shortly afterwards, Russia seized Crimea and triggered a war in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine. After decades of corruption and neglect, the Ukrainian military could not cope, and again volunteer groups stepped in. They provided soldiers, weapons and medical supplies to fill the gap.<br><br>These groups are funded by private donors, who have used bank wires and payment apps to donate millions of dollars. Bitcoin has also emerged as an important alternative funding method, allowing international donors to bypass financial institutions that are blocking payments to these groups.<br></p> 
  
 &nbsp; 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>Elliptic has identified several cryptocurrency wallets used by these volunteer groups and NGOs, which have collectively received funds totalling just over $570,000 – much of it over the past year. Here, we examine some of these groups.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Come Back Alive  
<p>One of the largest organizations providing support to the Ukrainian army is <a href="https://savelife.in.ua/">Come Back Alive</a>. Founded in 2014, the group takes its name from the inscriptions on the bullet-proof vests that were its first donations to the army. The group now provides a range of military equipment, training services and medical supplies. It even funded the development of a drone-based <a href="http://gisarta.org/">reconnaissance and targeting system</a> for Ukrainian artillery units.</p> 
 
  &nbsp;

  &nbsp; 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>Come Back Alive began accepting cryptoassets in 2018, and it has seen a recent surge in Bitcoin donations – with close to $200,000 received in the second half of 2021.</p> 
 
  &nbsp;

  &nbsp; 
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Ukrainian Cyber Alliance  
<p>Ukraine’s conflict with Russia extends into the cyber realm, and here too volunteer groups are active and funded through cryptocurrency donations.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://cyber.org.ua/">Ukrainian Cyber Alliance</a> is a collective of activists who have engaged in cyberattacks against Russian targets since 2016. The group's operations have reportedly included attacks on propaganda websites, the Russian Ministry of Defence and various individuals linked to Russia’s activities in Ukraine. Intelligence collected during these operations is reportedly <a href="https://www.5.ua/nauka/kibervoin-jeff-tse-persha-u-sviti-kiberviina-i-my-u-nii-voiuiucha-storona-video-137476.html">shared</a> with Ukrainian law enforcement and intelligence agencies.</p> 
<p>Unlike the other groups described here – which rely heavily on bank wires – the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance’s public fundraising relies exclusively on cryptoasset donations. In January 2020 the group requested donations through a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220209091318/https://m.facebook.com/UkrainianCyberAlliance/photos/a.1827960854182302/2395900657388316/?type=3&amp;source=54">post on Facebook</a>, with the title "Toss bitcoin to your hacker". Donations were requested to be sent to <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/19fMSv8ULjoBR7UNgNGuTrqoQmwiZEa63v">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://blockchair.com/ethereum/address/0x34b5593122bae35c54a066e93317cef214f4f224">Ethereum</a> and Litecoin addresses. These addresses have received transactions totalling close to $100,000.</p> 
<p>The Ukrainian Cyber Alliance have stated that they have only received "$3,000-$4,000" in donations, and that the other transactions received by the addresses do not constitute donations to the group.</p> 
 
  &nbsp; 
  
  
 The Ukrainian Cyber Alliance has received close to $100,000 in Bitcoin donations over the past year. 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>Cyber activists from outside of Ukraine have also been active in countering Russian aggression towards the country. The Belarussian hacktivist collective Cyber Partisans conducted an <a href="https://twitter.com/cpartisans/status/1485618881557315588">attack</a> against the Belarussian rail network in order to disrupt Russian troop movements to the Ukrainian border. This group also solicits donations – exclusively in Bitcoin. It has raised $84,000 in Bitcoin donations over the past six months.</p> 
 
  &nbsp; 
  
  
 The Cyber Partisans demand the removal of Russian troops from Belarus - following its cyber attack on the Belarussian rail network. Their Twitter profile also contains a Bitcoin donation address. 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Myrotvorets Center  
<p><a href="https://myrotvorets.center/">Myrotvorets Center</a> is a controversial, Kiev-based NGO with strong links to the Ukrainian government and law enforcement agencies. The Myrotvorets website publishes personal information about individuals considered to be “enemies of Ukraine”, including Russian “war criminals”, mercenaries, propagandists and journalists. In April 2015, a Ukrainian writer and a legislator were assassinated, just days after their home addresses were published on Myrotvorets.</p> 
 
  &nbsp; 
  
  
 The Myrotvorets website lists “pro-Russian terrorists, separatists, mercenaries, war criminals, and murderers”. (Identifying details obscured by Elliptic) 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>Myrotvorets Center has accepted cryptoasset donations since 2016, and the group found particular success when fundraising for its “IDentigraf” project. IDentigraf is a facial recognition app, which allows users to identify “militants, Russian mercenaries and war criminals” listed in the Myrotvorets database – based on a photograph.</p> 
 
  &nbsp;

  &nbsp; 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>Myrotvorets claims to have received donations from more than 40 countries, and appears to have enabled cryptoasset contributions after PayPal closed its account and seized the organization’s funds. To date, it has raised at least $268,000 through more than 100 Bitcoin donations.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Crypto Fundraising by Pro-Russia Separatists  
<p>By embracing cryptoasset fundraising, Ukrainian volunteer groups are actually emulating techniques previously employed by Russia since the very start of the Russo-Ukrainian War. A series of online campaigns <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/world/europe/russian-groups-crowdfund-the-war-in-ukraine.html">raised money</a> for Pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine, with donations channeled through Russian and overseas banks. These campaigns also accepted cryptoasset donations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For example the “Save the Donbass” campaign received at least 68 Bitcoin donations between 2014 and 2016.</p> 
 
  &nbsp;

  &nbsp; 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>Another campaign solicited Bitcoin donations for Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, a Russian army veteran and FSB officer who led a group of militants into Ukraine and participated in the Siege of Sloviansk. Dutch prosecutors later charged Girkin with murder, for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014.</p>

  &nbsp; 
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Cryptoassets: a Powerful, Emerging Tool for the Crowdfunding of War  
<p>For most of the fundraising campaigns examined in our investigation, cryptocurrencies represented a small proportion of the funds received. The majority of donations were received through traditional payment methods, such as bank wires and online payments services.</p> 
<p>However, cryptocurrency has proved to be a robust and increasingly popular alternative. In some cases, we found that financial institutions had closed accounts belonging to these fundraising campaigns - this cannot happen with a crypto wallet. Cryptocurrency is also particularly suited to cross-border donations, allowing easier access to wealthy overseas donors.</p> 
<p>Some of the Ukrainian volunteer groups and NGOs accepting crypto donations have very close links to the Ukrainian government - and this adds to a trend of nation states turning to cryptoassets as a means of raising funds. Iran is using Bitcoin mining as a way to <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/how-iran-uses-bitcoin-mining-to-evade-sanctions">monetise its energy reserves</a>,&nbsp; while North Korea is believed to be stealing cryptocurrency to support its missile development program.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>For anyone trying to keep up with “crypto” trends, good luck. Very often, articles and news around “crypto” lumps together everything that is futuristic about currency, investments and payments. As usual, the hype around new or trending concept leads to an overgeneralization of what that concept actually means. Organizations do need to decide what “crypto” means for their business, but they should be on their guard so as not to fall prey to a blind “crypto” craze. There is influence, risk, and legitimate business models to be found in the term “crypto”, but the first challenge is to understand it.</p>
 “Crypto” is a Misrepresentative Term 
<p>It’s first necessary to understand that “crypto” is a term that shouldn’t really be used to describe futuristic digital payments and currency systems. Its evolution is likely a short one, from cryptocurrency to cryptography. Cryptography, described at its simplest, is the mathematics of converting information into secrets. Cryptographic methods are used in some of the things that “crypto” tries to include: decentralized finance (DeFi), distributed ledger technology (DLT), cryptocurrencies (crypto), blockchain, Bitcoin, central bank digital currency (CBDC), and so on. Overall, “crypto” is an unsuccessful umbrella term for very different technological developments with very different risks, opportunities, and trajectories. A more suitable umbrella term for these terms could be Digital Currency, which has a wide enough definition to include the varying methods like cryptocurrency and stablecoins. The figure below lists a few of the terms most often lumped together under “crypto”, offers a very brief definition, and some of their distinctive features.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Terms Often Misrepresented by “Crypto”</p>
 Questions to Ask About Cryptocurrency 
<p>It’s worth it to keep these terms separate, but with an open eye for overarching trends. Cryptocurrency, for example, has plenty of people on edge. Cryptocurrency is intertwined with digital crime, ransomware being among the largest threats. Chainanalysis estimated that there was $14 billion worth of cryptocurrency lost to criminals in 2021, primarily from ransomware attacks, scams, and darkweb transactions. Concern is valid, as this is a <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/01/06/crypto-crime-all-time-high-2021/">79% increase over 2020</a>. But cryptocurrency should not just be a looming threat and risk to business, especially given that the overall volume of cryptocurrency transactions increased far more than criminal transactions did: <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">Chainanalysis also estimates</a> that legitimate cryptocurrency transactions reached $15 trillion in 2021, which is a 567% increase over 2020.&nbsp;Legitimate use of cryptocurrency is outpacing criminal use, and if cryptocurrency can ever get out of the speculative market there are strong opportunities for business.</p>
<p>These strong opportunities for business must be framed carefully. Cryptocurrencies in and of themselves don’t bring value to the business, but they can help to deliver business value. Their strengths lie in harnessing smart contracts to trigger payments only when certain required actions have been completed. Businesses should pay close attention to the ways that cryptocurrencies are stabilized to reduce their volatility. When this is achieved, the regulatory environment will be pressured to move quickly on issuing standards. The quickly evolving decentralized identity space will also play a role here, namely in enabling <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80792/providers-of-verified-identity">reusable, verifiable identities</a> for transacting parties. Pairing verifiable identities with cryptocurrency transactions may be a stabilizing factor for business transactions.</p>
<p>So how does the modern business reconcile itself with the astounding opportunities of a risky, crime-infused, and nonregulated technology? It begins with asking more questions:</p>
 
 What are the business models that align well with your business? 
 How do you move cryptocurrency from a private, peer-to-peer dominated space to enterprise functionality? 
 How do you separate the legitimate opportunities from risky, over speculative, or criminal use of cryptocurrency? 
 How do you secure cryptocurrencies (or do cryptocurrencies even need securing)? 
 Who can establish governance requirements and technology standards to enable successful leveraging of cryptocurrencies by enterprises? 
 
<p>Be on the lookout for future blog posts that consider these questions, and be sure to check the agenda of the European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC), coming up in May.</p>

<p>Munich, 08 February 2022, IDnow, a leading German provider for identity verification, will in future, enable every user to store their verified ID data locally on their smartphone in addition to their digital proof of vaccination in the luca app. This makes it possible to visit a restaurant, café or bar just by the luca app and without a manual ID check.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows the situation: you enter a restaurant and are asked for proof of vaccination. You pull out your mobile phone and have the QR code quickly at hand. Then the search for the wallet begins, as you must show your ID card. This annoying everyday problem will soon be a thing of the past. We are giving restaurants and other locations digital tools to work more efficiently and cost-effectively and to get back to pre-Corona levels more easily. In addition to the integration of payment services, this includes the uncomplicated ID solution that we are now providing with IDnow,” says Patrick Hennig, Managing Director of culture4life GmbH, operator of the luca app.</p>
<p>The reason for the ID check is the fact that the vaccination certificate, with whose QR code the digital proof of vaccination is generated, can also be scanned by other people. To avoid fraud, most state governments require the person to be matched by an ID document in addition to the vaccination certificate.</p>
<p>In the future, the luca app will digitize and simplify this process together with IDnow. luca users will soon be able to identify themselves once via the IDnow app and their digital identity will be stored locally on the smartphone. Within the luca app, the identity will be linked to the vaccination certificate. Only the identified person can check in at the restaurant using fingerprint or FaceID. This eliminates the need to show the ID card.</p>
<p>Technically, the identity is transmitted back to luca as so-called verifiable credentials from IDnow. The data is saved exclusively on the smartphone and encrypted with the help of the Secure Element. There is no central storage of the data. By storing the data locally, the user retains full control over his or her digital identity. From a data protection point of view, this approach is optimal because neither luca nor IDnow can access the data stored on the smartphone.</p>
<p>“With this use case, luca and IDnow are setting a positive example for the use of digital identities in everyday life. While the use of digital identities is already enjoying great popularity in other European countries, such as Belgium and Sweden, Germany is lagging behind. IDnow wants to change that and is already working with other partners on relevant use cases that use digital identity to simplify everyday situations.” Armin Bauer, Co-Founder and CTO of IDnow.</p>

 Navigating uncertainty — part&nbsp;2 <p>How three Swedish food actors coped during&nbsp;Covid-19</p><p>This is a series of two blog posts by Rapid Transition Lab, a collaboration between Stockholm Resilience Center, Dark Matter Labs, and Vinnova. <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/navigating-uncertainty-part-1-74029c9986d3">The first one</a> presents the findings from interviews with three Swedish food system actors. In this second post presents key learnings and further research.</p> Insights and takeaways <p>Based on the three cases presented in the last blog post, evidence shows that the pandemic opened up a critical ‘need for change’ for food system actors, since pre-existing operations were unable to function during parts of the crisis. The structure below outlines layers that enabled the transformational potential of each actor, along with different factors that helped them to shift and iterate their methods over&nbsp;time.</p>  Preparedness: Features of each actor that existed before the&nbsp;pandemic  Uncertainty: Emergent context with an uncertain time-frame that has a direct effect on the organization  Buffer: Cushions to reduce the emergent situation and enable a ‘softer landing’, eg., financial support for the organization  Trigger: Factor that creates space or opportunity for transformational potential  Transformational potential: Long-term strategic thinking and actions towards sustainable development  Layers of enablers for transformational potential © Rapid Transition Lab 1. Preparedness <p>Preparedness can be defined as a set of inherent organizational features each actor held before the pandemic. Depending on this foundational layer, actors were directly and indirectly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic to different extents, and so their responses were also unique. These features include actors’s defining mission[1], vision for the future[2], financial or growth strategy, network, organizational structure, or capabilities and knowledge built through experience. These features are embedded in their context and change over time, and are challenged during times of&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>All three cases revealed how financial security, such as external investors or savings, became crucial as preparedness during the crisis. But also, shared objectives and a shared belief in the vision for the future are the significant drivers that lead to secure investors and investment. For example, the shared trust in the mission that Karma experienced from their investors, gave them financial security. For Martin &amp; Servera, the owners’ belief in the long-term vision allowed them to proceed with investments towards sustainable development that were planned already before the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> 2. Uncertainty <p>Uncertainty became a critical aspect throughout the crisis period. Actors from all three cases had difficulties making decisions because they were uncertain of how long the pandemic would last, or for how long crisis packages would apply. For instance, after keeping the restaurant open for 9 months after the breakout, Debaser chose to fire all the staff and close the restaurant. When the stricter regulations were introduced, it was too hard for them to remain profitable while open. After all, the interviewee expressed a clear regret of firing all the staff, as if conditions concerning restrictions and support packages would have been known beforehand, they might have kept the staff temporarily furloughed instead.</p><p>On the other hand, uncertainty such as not knowing for how long the crisis would last could provoke actors to rethink and reinforce what the business wants to achieve in the longer term. Karma decided to expand the mission from reducing food waste to establishing a much broader mission: enabling the sustainable restaurant of the future. The restaurant (Debaser) has established a new strategic objective: to educate customers about the climate impact of food. Martin &amp; Servera kept their focus on their long-term goals despite the uncertainty, not letting it hinder them in achieving their strategic vision.</p><p>Uncertainty turned out to not only be a hindrance, but also a catalyst for change — without it, change in both operations and longer-term strategies might not have happened. In the face of unknown time-frames and uncertain conditions, actors were forced to act on what they believed to be the right decision in the present, using their existing core values or vision in order to act rapidly, and with some&nbsp;agility.</p> 3. Buffer <p>A buffer, in this case, can be thought of as a reserve that helps actors to better cope with a crisis, such as their financial security. In the three cases, the crisis package from the Swedish government provided a buffer of financial support to cover for lost income. It also gave companies the possibility to temporarily furlough staff with salary. Thus, the organization could keep the business running even if the company stopped making a profit. This assurance, in combination with existing financial savings or support from investors, unlocked certain triggering factors during the pandemic: the space to learn, self-reflect, experiment, and collaborate rapidly.</p> 4. Trigger <p>In face of the crisis and its consequent uncertainty, the actors managed to stay resilient due to their inherent preparedness in combination with external support (e.g. government packages). Triggers can be described as factors or actions which led actors to change their strategies and modes of operation in response to the altered context. From the above cases, these core triggers&nbsp;emerged:</p>  Rapid experimentation and immediate feedback  <p>Karma had an organizational culture that encouraged fast, small-scale experiments, in place well before Covid-19. This appetite for risk, in terms of trying new things, enabled them to experiment during the crisis, responding as conditions constantly changed. The actor launched two new services during this time, and the immediate feedback received helped them to make further strategic decisions, changing their service and business model. This actually re-focused the company’s mission, enabling it to become more resilient to future&nbsp;crises.</p>  Time for rapid learning and self-reflection  <p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, Debaser decided to temporarily close their business and Karma scaled-down operation to a bare minimum. This break gave the actors time for learning and self-reflection and ultimately allowed the organizations to re-evaluate their visions for the future. Karma’s strategy had previously been to focus on aggressive growth (re-investing all their earnings directly into the company’s growth agenda), something that turned out to be a vulnerability rather than a strength during the crisis. They changed their strategy to focus on a slower, more-controlled growth dynamic, including securing savings as a buffer. Debaser also took the time for self-reflection and learning about the impact of food production on climate. The owners ensured that their staff was also educated in these matters. By redesigning the menu to reduce their climate impact, and communicating this impact to their guests, the company’s new objective became to educate customers about the carbon footprint caused by different dishes and to inspire other actors to do the&nbsp;same.</p>  Opportunity for a new collaboration  <p>All three cases initiated new collaborations during the crisis. For Martin &amp; Servera, closer collaborations with other actors in the food chain became a positive effect of the pandemic and a key to coping with the crisis. From finding new logistics collaborations, as volumes became smaller, to collaborating with suppliers around receiving the right products. Debaser also initiated a new collaboration with Klimato to help make changes in their menus. For Karma, many new collaborations emerged. For example the initial collaboration with delivery companies and also with food producers as they introduced their weekly boxes of fruit and vegetables.</p><p>Each of these triggers functions as crucial conditions for building capabilities and capacities to make use of emerging opportunities for positive change. They enable, iterate and reinforce the actor’s preparedness for resilience in face of uncertainty.</p> Further research and next&nbsp;steps <p>As these cases reveal, whilst a crisis can often be overwhelmingly negative, it can also be interpreted as a time of forced experimentation. It can force the formation, refinement, and consolidation of new relationships in face of uncertainty. As we have seen from supply chains to healthcare provision to food systems, the Covid-19 pandemic revealed the fragile interdependencies that often underpin what was previously perceived as seemingly stable systems. It could be argued that the prevailing tendency to reduce food to a product or a thing — seeing it merely as an industry, supply chain, and resource flow — neglects our ability to cherish it as a richer kind of process, as embodying sets of relationships, a complex and diverse set of cultures, and a core part of our personal and collective health, and our ecosystems and environments. Covid-19 has revealed this narrow, reductive reading of food, just as it has of other fundamental aspects of our everyday&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Prior to the pandemic, we have become increasingly aware that multiple actors pursuing unsustainable social, ecological, and economic practices produce outcomes that make our whole food system unsustainable, unhealthy and un-just. However, Covid-19 has functioned as a form of ‘highlighter’, underscoring this dynamic very clearly. In coming blog posts we will further explore this relational aspect of food — as culture, ecosystem, collective health, environment — and how Covid-19 puts these more fundamental questions about food on the table. This first set of posts concentrates on only three cases from our extensive interviews conducted thus far, and on the restaurant ‘end’ of the food&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Going forward, we will continue exploring what innovative responses during the Covid-19 pandemic could have the potential to move food systems towards sustainable pathways — and how those opportunities could be harnessed. Further, we will be reflecting on other parts of the systems as it was stress-tested by the pandemic, drawing insights from other actors and their experiences. We will translate these insights, and the questions they raise, into tangible, speculative, and exploratory scenarios, highlighting possible intervention points, relationships, and systems transformations.</p><p>This blog is co-written by Aleksander Nowak and Juhee Hahm from <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>, and Jenny Norrby from <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/">Stockholm Resilience Centre</a>, with contributions by My Sellberg, Per Olsson and Garry Peterson from Stockholm Resilience Centre, Alexander Alvsilver and Dan Hill from <a href="https://www.vinnova.se/">Vinnova</a>, and Linnea Rönnquist from Dark Matter Labs.

 Navigating uncertainty — part&nbsp;1 <p>How three Swedish food actors coped during&nbsp;Covid-19</p><p>This is a series of two blog posts by Rapid Transition Lab, a collaboration between Stockholm Resilience Center, Dark Matter Labs and Vinnova. In this first one presents the findings from interviews with three Swedish food system actors. The <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/navigating-uncertainty-part-2-857e4edd4f56">second post</a> presents key learnings and further research.</p> 1. Introduction <p>The Covid-19 pandemic, as every crisis, happens unevenly in time. It both rapidly and gradually shapes the entangled relationships across the food system, forms new alignments, collaborations, and opportunities as well as challenging circumstances for its&nbsp;actors.</p><p>For some, the current crisis has meant a fight for survival. For others, as a result of ‘<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9502904">forced experimentation</a>’, it turned out to be a learning and evaluation process, leading to new ideas, new strategies.</p><p>This first blog post presents the results from interviews with three Swedish food system actors on their Covid-19 responses. These results, combined with selected official regulations introduced during the crisis, are visualized in time as an attempt to analyze their connections.</p><p>Juxtaposing the influences of the crisis on the individual system actors with the regulations, restrictions and support measures over time, allows for a better understanding of the dynamic relationship between policy and action. In the second blog post, we will analyze this further and present the key findings and takeaways.</p><p>These insights can provide important recommendations for all food systems actors, including policy makers, not only for responding to the current pandemic, but also to other crises such as climate, biodiversity, health, social justice — now and in the future. The insights can also inform the process of navigating transformations towards more resilient, just and sustainable food systems’&nbsp;futures.</p> 2. Cases <p>The cases presented below are based on interviews with three Swedish food system actors that have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in somewhat different ways. Interviews were conducted in December 2021 and are not taking into consideration events that occurred after that. We are continuing to interview food systems actors, and look through multiple different lenses on the systems around&nbsp;us.</p><p>The timelines, illustrating each case, present Covid-19 related regulations, the emerging impact the crisis had on each actor, how the actor responded and the effects it had on the organization. Actors’ responses are highlighted according to their nature; if they were results of actors adapting to the new situation or if actors used the opportunity to develop long-term strategic thinking and actions towards sustainable development and thereby show transformational potential.</p>Legend of timeline © Rapid Transition Lab Case 01 — KARMA <p>Interviewee: App service that helps restaurants to sell their leftover food to consumers at discounted price.</p><p>At the beginning of 2020, Karma was operating in Sweden, London and Paris and had about 90 employees. The business model was based on relationships with foremost urban/city-center restaurants and customers residing in that&nbsp;area.</p><p>When Covid hit Europe, in March 2020, the app service experienced its most profitable month since launching in 2016. However, due to the pandemic, the following months were the hardest since the start of its operation.</p><p>Across Europe restaurants closed down, and Karma’s operations in London and Paris stopped abruptly. In Sweden, however, most restaurants were still open. Pre-pandemic, app users were mainly people on their way home from work buying leftover meals from city restaurants to have for dinner. So, as people began to work from home, they started using the app in their local areas instead with a more dispersed supply of food. At the same time, as the pandemic hit, using the app to save leftovers was no longer a priority for the restaurants as they went into a survival mode. Due to these dynamics, the app service operations went down by about&nbsp;50%.</p><p>In order to cope with the new reality, Karma started providing home delivery through the app to ensure people could still rescue food albeit being forced to stay home. The home delivery service was launched within two weeks after the pandemic outbreak in Sweden and was made possible through the collaboration with delivery and transportations companies who were also affected negatively by the pandemic. Karma also introduced home delivery of boxes of leftover fruit and vegetables, as well as the possibility for restaurants to sell boxes of leftover meals as well as non-leftover meals through the app. After three months, they realized that delivering leftover meals was too costly. In consequence, the company decided to focus only on subscriptions of weekly delivered boxes of leftover fruits and vegetables from producers and wholesalers to customers’ doorsteps.</p><p>Initially, when Covid hit, the company put their staff on temporary furlough with support from the government. However, as the pandemic continued, they realized that in order to survive, the organization had to be slimmed down to a bare minimum. As such, nine months after covid hit only 18 of originally 90 staff members remained employed in the&nbsp;company.</p><p>The service of delivering weekly boxes of fruits and vegetables continued until the end of 2020, when the company realized they had moved too far away from their original business operations. This left the company in a situation where continuing to grow both businesses would mean building two different companies from an operations standpoint. A strategic choice that would be too costly. Hence, they phased out the service and took time to contemplate around their vision and future and then re-launched again in March&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Meanwhile, as restrictions eased and customers started going out again, restaurants were struggling to find staff. To meet this demand, Karma developed a service whereby customers can order and pay online while seated at the restaurant, to help reduce the workload on staff. This has led the company to re-formulate and expand their vision. Originally, their main focus was reducing food waste, yet now they want to be a bigger part of establishing the sustainable restaurant of the future. Saving leftover food remains highly important, but is now part of a wider, more systemic approach.</p><p>As a result of the experiences of Covid-19, the company has changed its strategy. From being a company focusing on aggressive growth rather than profitability, they are now looking to be more resilient, ensuring savings and more carefully managed growth, as well as innovation.</p>Karma’s Covid-19 response in the timeline © Rapid Transition Lab Case 02 — Debaser <p>Interviewee: A business that entails a concert arena, a nightclub and a restaurant.</p><p>When Covid-19 hit, the concert arena and the nightclub closed completely but the associated restaurant, Calexico’s, stayed open until December 2020. The concert arena was hit both by the fact that performing actors could not travel and also by limitations for public gatherings. When the government forced the concert arena and nightclub to close, they based the decision on the wrong law according to the interviewee. This hindered Debaser and other actors from using their epidemic insurance. The CEO tried to influence the government to change this decision but without any&nbsp;luck.</p><p>From 11th of March 2020 to mid/end of April the restaurant Calexico’s had practically no customers. In connection to the restaurant, Debaser has a large outdoor seating area that became particularly valuable during the pandemic. When opening this area at the end of March, unusually early in the season, customers started to return throughout spring and summer. Yet they still had only 30% of the pre-pandemic capacity.</p><p>The interviewee explains that like many others in the restaurant business, they thought the crisis would be over after that first summer. So they kept the restaurant running and kept the staff. However, as restrictions came in during autumn and finally the requirement to stop serving alcoholic drinks after 8pm and close at 8.30pm, they decided to shut down the restaurant in December 2020. They had to let go of almost all their staff. They kept the restaurant closed between the end of December 2020 until the end of April&nbsp;2021.</p><p>During this period, starting already during the autumn, they took the opportunity to self-reflect. They learned more about the climate crisis and the impact of food production during this time. This resulted in a decision to re-design their whole menu, which they did in collaboration with <a href="https://www.klimato.co/">Klimato</a>, a service that calculates the carbon footprints of specific dishes by using the <a href="https://www.ri.se/en/what-we-do/expertises/rise-food-climate-database">RISE food climate database</a>. The restaurant now wants to act as an educator for their customers and inform them about the impact that food has on climate. Their experience is that a lot of people lack this knowledge.</p><p>When opening again in April 2021, they retained half of their staff, but they regretted firing everyone in December 2020. If the company had known from the beginning for how long the restrictions would last for, and the support packages that they could apply for, they would have only temporarily furloughed their staff with salary for the whole period&nbsp;instead.</p>Debaser’s Covid-19 response in the timeline © Rapid Transition Lab Case 03 — Martin &amp;&nbsp;Servera <p>Interviewee: Wholesaler distributing food and beverages to private restaurants (incl. fast food), public restaurants, cafes, hotel chains, conference facilities, nightclubs and other businesses offering food and beverages.</p><p>When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the wholesaler had a lot of stored food, and food on the way to be delivered to their customers. But since the restaurants and hotels had no guests at that point, they canceled their orders and the wholesaler had to find other sales channels. For a while, they sold bulk packages of cornflakes and beef to supermarkets, for example, until they had managed to correct their orders towards the suppliers to match the lowered&nbsp;demand.</p><p>In this initial phase, the wholesaler was hit hard. At the lowest point, they lost 50% of their total orders. But during summer 2020 business went up again. Tourists never came to visit Sweden in any great numbers, but equally Swedes were not overseas tourists either. They stayed in Sweden and spent money on amusement parks, in hotels, and in restaurants. Restrictions were not yet limiting opening or serving hours; they were mainly focused on distancing. But in Autumn and Winter 2020, new restrictions were introduced and the situation got tougher again. Usually, a lot of the sales at this time of the year comes from the restaurants’ Christmas offer, and from New Years Eve and seasonal tourism. But little of this happened in 2020’s version of the holiday&nbsp;season.</p><p>During Spring 2021 sales recovered somewhat, and as restrictions were eased during the summer, sales improved as people again went out to eat, travel, socialize, stay in hotels and visit places and attractions. During Autumn 2021, the wholesaler was back to about 90% of their pre-Covid sales. The ‘missing’ revenue was mostly due to conferences, tourism, and traveling not returning to pre-Covid levels.</p><p>During the pandemic, Martin &amp; Servera had to fire some of their staff, but they also used the financial support provided by the government to retain the staff part-time, using flexible working patterns when needed. They also received support to cover for lost&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Despite the outbreak of the pandemic, the company still managed to pursue planned investments in electric trucks and a large solar cell park, and they also built a new, more energy-efficient, warehouse. The company owners had taken a longer-term perspective, which enabled them to conduct strategic investments even during these difficult conditions.</p>Martin &amp; Servera’s Covid-19 response in the timeline © Rapid Transition Lab Thoughts and questions — Transitioning to part&nbsp;2 <p>We can look through multiple lenses to analyze the resilience of the food system. Looking at the cases presented in this post, we can assess the conditions created by a pandemic: the direct and indirect impacts, coping and adapting strategies, the transformational potential as well as the opportunities or barriers for change that the system actors engaged with and encountered during the&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>Through this perspective, some of the critical questions emerge: How might actors navigate times of crisis towards ultimately-necessary sustainable practices? How might actors survive whilst adapting to ever-changing conditions? What are the responses that have the potential to contribute to transformations? What forms of resilience are being exhibited? And what are the multiple time-frames and paces in which change occurs? We address these, and other, questions in <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/navigating-uncertainty-part-2-857e4edd4f56">the next&nbsp;post</a>.</p><p>This blog is co-written by Aleksander Nowak and Juhee Hahm from <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>, and Jenny Norrby from <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/">Stockholm Resilience Centre</a>, with contributions by My Sellberg, Per Olsson and Garry Peterson from Stockholm Resilience Centre, Alexander Alvsilver and Dan Hill from <a href="https://www.vinnova.se/">Vinnova</a>, and Linnea Rönnquist from Dark Matter Labs.

<p>Access control in websites and web applications is a top priority for security, but how you set up access depends on how you store the data to be authenticated. This, in turn, enables user authorization. Cookies and tokens are two common ways of setting up authentication.</p>
 
 
<p>Cookies are chunks of data created by the server and sent to the client for communication purposes. Tokens, usually referring to JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), are signed credentials encoded into a long string of characters created by the server. The main difference between cookies and tokens is their nature: tokens are stateless while cookies are stateful.</p>
 
 
<p>With this in mind, why is there a need to store authentication on the browser? Because HTTP is stateless, even if you authenticate with one request, the server essentially "forgets" that authentication with subsequent requests. Therefore, you need to supply the token/cookie on every request for authentication by the server. The frontend stores the token or cookie and uses it to make subsequent requests to the server until the cookie or token expires.</p>
 
 
<p>This article will examine the use of cookies or tokens for authentication, comparing the pros and cons of each method, so that you can determine which is best for your project.</p>

 About authentication 
 
 
<p>Authentication is the act of verifying user credentials in terms of either correctness or time.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Correctness: The user credentials are verified based on existing details. At the sign-in request, an authentication token is assigned to the user. It will be used to authorize the user and authenticate subsequent interactions with the application.</p>
 
 
<p>Time: The authentication token assigned to the user is only valid for a specific period of time. If the token becomes invalid, the user needs to be re-authenticated before access can be granted.</p>
 
 
 
 






The term "authentication token" is used here to describe any form of authentication credential that might be implemented by the application, not explicitly an access token.



 
 
<p>The above instances aren’t environment-specific and could be demonstrated visually on the frontend or the backend during API testing.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Why use authentication 
 
 
<p>There are two reasons why authentication is necessary to allow full access to an application:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Authentication establishes the identity of the user and verifies that the user is who (or what) it says it is. Authentication protects your resources by denying access to unauthenticated users.</p>
 
 
<p>Authentication gives each user a distinct identity, protecting your data and theirs. Applications that require users to create an account give each user a unique profile, which is what determines the data shown to the user. For example, PayPal requires users to sign in before displaying their account balance and transactions.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Generally, the process works like this:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>You sign in.</p>
 
 
<p>The server verifies your sign-in details and assigns you an authentication token.</p>
 
 
<p>The authentication token is used to make a request to your homepage that displays your unique dashboard.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Both session cookies and access tokens allow users to make requests to the server without needing to re-authenticate at each request. The following is a comparison of the two.</p>
 
 
 
 
 What you should know about cookies 
 
 
<p>Session cookies are stateful elements. They contain data that the server sends to the browser for temporary use. The authentication data inside a cookie is stored on both the client and server. The server keeps track of active sessions in a database, while the browser holds the identifier to the active session. When a request is made to the server, the session ID is used to look up information such as user roles or privileges for authentication, in order to check if the session is still valid.</p>
 
 
 Advantages of cookies 
 
<p>Consider these key benefits:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Cookies use the same session across subdomains: They take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Domain_and_Path"><code>Domain</code></a> argument: You specify the domain name for which the cookie is valid. Setting the domain name to <code>yoursite.com</code> allows the same session for the domain and subdomains.</p>
 
 
<p>They reduce manipulation by client-side JavaScript: You can restrict client-side access by setting the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/HttpOnly"><code>HttpOnly</code></a> flag. This reduces the likelihood of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on your application, since most XSS attacks involve the use of malicious JS code.</p>
 
 
<p>They require little storage: Cookies use as little as 6 KB to store a simple user ID. Depending on what information you store in your cookie, you’ll transmit a minimal amount of bytes with every request.</p>
 
 
<p>Finally, cookies are managed by the browser: This is automatic, so you don’t have to worry about it.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 The downside of cookies 
 
<p>Some of the disadvantages of cookies include:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p> Cross-site request forgery attacks (XSRF or CSRF): CSRF attacks are only possible with cookie-based session handling. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite"><code>SameSite</code></a> attribute allows you to decide whether cookies should be sent to third-party apps using the Strict or Lax settings. A strict setting can prevent CSRF attacks, but it can also contribute to a poor browser experience for the user. For example, say your site uses a cookie named <code>tutorials_shown</code> to determine whether a user has already seen specific tutorials in order to show them new ones every time they visit. If <code>SameSite</code> is set to <code>Strict</code> and someone follows a link to your site, the cookie will not be sent on that first request, and previously viewed tutorials will be shown. This creates a less personalized user experience.</p>
 
 
<p>Scaling issues: Since sessions are tied to a particular server, you can run into issues when scaling your application. In a load-balanced application, if a logged-in user is redirected to a new server, the existing session data is lost. To prevent this, sessions need to be stored in a shared database or cache. This  increases the complexity of each interaction.</p>
 
 
<p>Not good for API authentication: APIs provide one-time resources for authenticated end-users and don’t need to keep track of user sessions. Cookies don’t work perfectly in this case, since they track and verify active sessions. Tokens, meanwhile, provide authentication with a unique identifier on every request to the API endpoints.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Cookies aren’t the only way to store session IDs; other options include URLs and form fields. Cookies are more secure than those two, but how secure are cookies?</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Cookies are only secure in an HTTPS connection. Enforcing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Secure_and_HttpOnly"><code>Secure</code></a> flag ensures that cookies are only sent via an encrypted HTTPS connection. Use of HTTPS prevents disclosure of session ID in person-in-the-middle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">MITM</a>) attacks.</p>
 
 
<p>As noted earlier, cookies can be manipulated by client-side scripts (JavaScript or Visual Basic). This can be prevented by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Secure_and_HttpOnly"><code>HttpOnly</code></a> flag.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>While cookies can be made secure by setting the appropriate attributes and following best practices, they can also be made insecure by neglecting these steps.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Structured security tokens 
 
 
<p>Tokens—or JWTs in this context—are stateless in nature, meaning the server doesn’t need to keep a record of the token. Each token is self-contained, holding the information needed for verification and identification on the server.</p>
 
 
 Advantages of tokens 
 
<p>Here are some specific advantages of tokens:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Flexibility and ease of use: JWTs are easy to use. Their self-containing nature helps you achieve what you need for verification without database lookups. This makes JWTs more suitable to use in an API, since the API server doesn’t need to keep track of user sessions.</p>
 
 
<p>Cross-platform capabilities: Because of their stateless nature, tokens can be seamlessly implemented on mobile platforms and internet of things (IoT) applications, especially in  comparison to cookies..</p>
 
 
<p>Multiple storage options: Tokens can be stored in a number of ways in browsers or front-end applications.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>If you use a browser’s local storage, tokens can’t be accessed by a subdomain. However, they can be accessed and manipulated by any JavaScript code on the webpage, as well as by browser plugins. This isn’t a recommended method: first, itposes a security risk, plus you must manage the storage.</p>
 
 
<p>Session storage is another way to store tokens. The drawback is that the token is destroyed when the browser is closed.</p>
 
 
 
 Disadvantages of JWT tokens 
 
<p>Here are some downsides of tokens to be aware of:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Revocation: A JWT cannot be revoked. Even if a JWT leaks, it remains valid until it expires, resulting in a serious security hole. As a workaround, you must implement a deny-list technique that requires a more complex setup.</p>
 
 
<p>Need more space: A JWT might need 300+ bytes to store a simple user ID, because they store other data for authentication.</p>
 
 
<p>Stale: The information inside of a JWT represents a snapshot in time when the token was originally created. The associated user may now have different access levels or have been removed from the system altogether.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>But what about the security of tokens?</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>JWTs are cryptographically signed and base64-encoded. They’re only secure when they aren’t exposed, so they should be treated like passwords.</p>
 
 
<p>A JWT can be viewed but not manipulated on the client side. You can take your token to <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, choose the algorithm you used to sign, and see the data. You just can’t tamper with it because it’s issued on the server.</p>
 
 
<p>The lifespan of a JWT should be kept short to limit the risk caused by a leaked token.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When to use cookies or tokens 
 
 
<p>In general, the choice between a session cookie or a structured token will depend on your use case.

				  The companies that make up Indicio Network Node Operators share more in common than just hosting a copy of Indicio’s public ledger. This community of global innovators share a common mission: furthering the adoption and increasing the business value of privacy-preserving ways of proving identity and authenticity to people, businesses, and even the Internet of Things.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				 <p>It is for this reason that we are thrilled to see Sumiran Agarwal, Director of Indicio Network Ecosystem, <a href="https://gbbcouncil.org/news/announcing-gbbcs-2022-ambassadors/">appointed as Ambassador to India</a> for the The Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC).</p>
<p>The Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC) is the leading global industry association for the blockchain technology ecosystem. Conceived during the Blockchain Summit on Sir Richard Branson’s Necker Island, the GBBC is a Swiss-based non-profit launched in 2017 in Davos, Switzerland that&nbsp; is dedicated to furthering adoption of blockchain through engaging regulators, business leaders, and global changemakers on how to harness this ground-breaking technology to create more secure, equitable, and functional societies.</p>
<p>Sumiran’s role as Ambassador to India for GBBC will not only bring her depth of experience and expertise to the GBBC membership, but will also help to grow the understanding of the value of decentralized identity and verifiable credentials to a wider, global community.</p>
<p>Sumiran’s work at GBBC and Indicio has already led to the inclusion of Indicio and five of our Node Operators in <a href="https://gbbcouncil.org/news/gsmi-2-0-announcement/">GBBC’s Global Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI) 2.0 summary report</a>. GSMI 2.0 is GBBC’s most comprehensive effort to map and analyze the blockchain and digital asset landscape and was spearheaded by the GBBC in partnership with 131 institutions, organized into nine working groups and one of the groups was Digital Identity.</p>
<p>GSMI 2.0 includes an Interactive map of blockchain and digital asset regulation and guidance across 187 jurisdictions and also a report dedicated to the findings and guidance of the working groups with focuses in five key areas:</p>
 
  Legislation and regulatory guidance 
  Technical standards 
  Industry standards and recommendations 
  University courses and degree programs 
  Industry consortia 
 
<p>Indicio was mentioned in several areas of the report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, in the <a href="https://gbbcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GBBC-GSMI-2.0-Report-1.pdf">main GSMI Report 2.0</a> (1) cite’s Indicio’s recommendation on the use of machine readable governance . Machine-readable governance embeds governance rules in the software for each party in a decentralized ecosystem. This allows governance rules to be cached, meaning the system can work offline, as well as providing the most effective and efficient way for managing complex information flows and conditional logic. Machine-readable governance was&nbsp; <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-decentralized-identity-revolution-is-powered-by-machine-readable-governance/">developed by Indicio</a> in collaboration with SITA and an open-source version will bedonated to Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) for use by health authorities as part of the Cardea project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the report highlighted use cases from some of Indicio’s node operators:&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.snowbridge.se/">Snowbridge</a> – Usecase is in real estate industry vertical and is based in Taiwan 
 <a href="https://snapperfuturetech.com/">Snapper Future</a> – Use case is in E-governance and education vertical and is based in India 
 <a href="https://indicio.tech/decentralized-identity-opens-the-doors-for-safe-travel-and-tourism/">Indicio for Govt</a> – Use case is in government industry vertical and is based in US 
 <a href="https://indicio.tech/cardea/">Indicio for Healthcare</a> – Use case is in healthcare industry vertical and is based in US 
 <a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a> – Use case is in hi-tech industry vertical and is based in US 
 <a href="https://idramp.com/">ID Ramp</a> – Multiple use cases in cross industry and public sector identity services and is based in US 
 <a href="https://finclusive.com/">Finclusive</a> – Use case is in financial industry vertical and is based in US 
 
<p>This section is particularly valuable for those in the Digital Identity space as it summarizes the commercial benefits of the technology with real life use cases in this space along with recommendations for adoption. Listing these solutions also helps advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 16,1— “Identity for all by 2030.”</p>
<p>Indicio is a global network for a technology that brings value to everyone. We are extremely proud to have the expertise of Sumiran helping to support the diverse community of twenty-six companies on five continents as they operate our growing global network. Each organization is an innovator. All are committed to building a better way to manage digital identity and to create the trust in data needed for the machine, spatial, and Web3 age.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Happy <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%2523HoloMonday">#HoloMonday</a> everyone! If you’re not familiar with Holo Monday, it’s an initiative our community has created to celebrate our devs — both people working on hApps and Holo team members — on the first Monday of each month.</p><p>In that spirit, I want to share updates from a number of projects building on Holochain, as well as dev tools reaching new stages of maturity and even a new project I’d never heard of! Let’s see what’s fresh.</p> Holochain Launcher 0.3.8 <p>Launcher, the user-friendly Holochain runtime and hApp runner, has been updated for Windows, macOS, and Linux to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.3.8">include Holochain 0.0.124</a>. The previous Launcher version included Holochain 0.0.119, and the HDK and network protocol have changed since then, so applications built for newer versions should direct their users to update their Launcher version.</p> Flux 0.2.16 <p><a href="https://github.com/fluxsocial/flux/">Flux</a>, the flagship communities app from <a href="https://junto.foundation/">Junto Foundation</a>, is progressing nicely. This is the first time I’ve reported on this application, so there’s a lot to talk about.</p><p>Flux is the newest iteration of Junto’s vision of healthy online social spaces. Long-time followers will know that Junto were <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/junto--a-new-breed-of-social-media-powered-by-holochain/">one of the first</a> projects to commit to building on Holochain. A few years ago, they produced a proof-of-concept app for mobile phones and learned a lot in the process. Their newest iteration, Flux, embodies their core insight: focus on community creation rather than a new social media platform, because close-knit communities are what create healthy online social spaces.</p><p>To me this feels like this takes the best parts of early Web2 — the community cohesion of old-fashioned forums and blog networks — and brings them into the hyperconnected Web3 world. Right now, Flux just gives your community a multi-channel chat server, but they plan on <a href="https://www.fluxsocial.io/">adding more features</a>, like blogs, knowledge bases, DAO-style governance, and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>This is early days for Flux, and you may notice a few bugs and speed issues, but I’m very impressed by what they’ve already accomplished. It feels like a professionally-designed, well-thought-out app.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/fluxsocial/flux/releases/tag/v0.2.15">Download Flux and create a community!</a></p> Acorn 0.6.0-alpha <p>Acorn, the collaborative goal-planning whiteboard, has gotten a cool new feature in <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn/releases/tag/v0.6.0-alpha">its newest version</a>: presence indicators! Built on Holochain’s <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/">signals</a> feature, it shows you which cards your colleagues are currently working on, giving you the comforting feeling of working in the same room as them. As the release notes point out, it’s also good for keeping you from stepping on each other’s toes!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn/releases/tag/v0.6.0-alpha">Download Acorn and try it out with your colleagues!</a></p> Electron template for hApps <p>Sprillow, the dev shop behind Acorn, have created a super useful template repo for anyone who wants to bundle their hApp, UI, and Holochain itself into a single cross-platform executable. I understand they’ve done a huge amount of work getting it usable, from taking care of cross-platform build issues to dealing with the tricky bits of getting the app trusted on macOS. If you’re planning on releasing your hApp as a standalone, you ought to check it out.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain-template">Clone the electron-holochain-template repo</a>.</p> Clutter lives again! <p>Those of you who went to a hackathon or simply checked out Holochain back in 2018 might remember Clutter. It was a demo app (written in both JavaScript and Lisp) that aimed to create a microblogging experience like Twitter.</p><p>Well, a small team of developers, headed by Moritz (a former colleague), is rebuilding Clutter for the new Holochain SDK. The project has gained attention from a number of developers (including some who weren’t previously involved in building hApps!) who are working on it ‘hackalong’-style. This means arranging regular times where they can all work on it together over a video call. This is a side project for most of them, and this format doesn’t demand much from them (and working together is more fun), so this appears to be a great format for getting things done.</p><p>If you’d like to get involved in Clutter development, head over to the <a href="https://discord.gg/wEuA2C4R">new dev.hc Discord server</a> and look for the ‘clutter’ channel!</p> New Discord server for hApp developers <p>I think the aforementioned Discord deserves a mention of its own: There already are a few Discord servers for developers, and they seem to be where the action is right now rather than the forum. Most of them have membership criteria, though. So if that feels intimidating to you, the <a href="https://discord.gg/wEuA2C4R">dev.hc server</a> is wide open to all developers!</p><p>It seems that the chat format serves a lot of developers well, especially for building community around the work they’re doing. Recently the Clutter working group is using it to coordinate meetings, share information, and generally get to know each other better.</p> Koru: a mutual credit module for your hApp <p>Recently I learned about a project called <a href="https://koru.finance/">Koru</a>, which claims that it’s building software that lets any group spin up their own customised mutual credit currency. If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you’ll know I am <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/mutual-credit-part-1-a-new-type-of-cryptocurrency-as-old-as-civilisation/">pretty excited about mutual credit</a>. I don’t think it’s the perfect design, a currency to end all other currencies, but I think it comes pretty darn close. So I was doubly excited when I discovered this project — not only did it feel like my dreams were coming true, but it turns out they’re already <a href="https://github.com/KoruProtocol/koru">prototyping on Holochain</a>!</p><p>I get the impression that it’s still early days for this project, but their lead dev is very active in our ecosystem and it seems like it has a lot of promise — in terms of development activity, plus usefulness for your own hApp and of course value to real humans. Wishing Koru lots of success!</p><p>When I discover a project like this, it makes me wonder, what other projects are building on Holochain that I know nothing about? If you know of any, please <a href="https://twitter.com/helioscomm">share them with me on Twitter</a>!</p>Imran, Koru’s lead developer, shares about the project Reusable Modules mini-site <p>Recently I came across this <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/reusable-modules/">mini-site called Reusable Modules</a>, created by the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev">Holochain Open Dev</a> group. It captures a design philosophy that appears to be very popular among Holochain devs (and really, should be popular among all devs): composability. It describes how the community feels about how to architect hApps: as collections of small, single-purpose, customisable, open-source components. It addresses both the front-end and back-end aspects this design philosophy, and is really worth reading.</p> Holochain 0.0.124: no-op <p>This release brings some compilation fixes and some documentation updates (note: we’ll be giving renewed focus to documentation in the coming months). The HDK has seen a version bump to 0.0.120, but there are no breaking changes. <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.124/CHANGELOG.md#20220126200716">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.125: DHT arc resizing stability <p>This release brings some of the gossip improvements the core dev team has been working on, and finally turns on sharding by default! It’s not the end of our improvements, though; a future release will have a lot of big improvements to both the stability of arc (AKA shard) resizing and the efficiency of syncing between nodes. <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.125/CHANGELOG.md#20220202112225">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> What’s on the horizon for Holochain? <p>That’s a good question. As we approach beta, what sorts of things should application developers expect? When will we see new features, how much churn will we have to refactor through? We intend to produce a more solid Holochain roadmap soon, but here are the most important things to know for now. (Keep in mind that most of these things are still subject to change; I just want to give you a heads-up so you can plan for contingencies.)</p>  Stabilisation of the HDK, so you can develop against a more slow-moving target. We’re currently taking a fresh look at how validation works, and there ought to be some changes soon which will make it easier for you to keep your hApp more stable. In short, we may create two separate HDKs, one with validation callbacks and one without. The idea is that your DNA will be made up of ‘integrity’ zomes which contain data type definitions (including validation callbacks) and rarely change, and ‘coordination’ zomes which contain your app’s controller logic, don’t affect the DNA hash, and can hence be changed more often.  Stabilisation of the gossip protocol — including a new DHT arc resizing algorithm and syncing algorithm. The reduced network and CPU load should make the user experience much nicer, and it should make it less necessary for you to keep recompiling your hApp for the newest and greatest Holochain.  New HDK and DHT features, including ‘baseless’ links, saving you from requiring every user to test for the existence of a base anchor at app startup; links that can have headers as their base or target; ephemeral (off-chain) storage; a pub/sub model for signals to replace the current everybody-gets-everything model; ‘true’ deletes via two new DHT operations: ‘purge’ and ‘withdraw’; and validated rate limiting to prevent DHT spamming and other time-based abuses.  More core hApps that are useful to all devs, including <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey">DeepKey</a> for distributed key management, Verifiable Credentials for people to make signed claims about others, Compository for managing shared source code and distributing binaries, Personas and Profiles for managing and syncing personal information across all your devices, and Source Chain Backup for easy recovery of lost agency.  Security and resilience features, including warrants and defensive action for warrantable offenses, plus a top-to-bottom security review of the codebase.   FOSDEM 2022 recap <p>I didn’t attend FOSDEM myself this year, but it looks like a lot of great projects presented their work. A few colleagues mentioned that it was good to hear about what others are doing, partly because it’s always valuable to learn new things, but also because there seems to be an agent-centric trend among P2P projects that validates Holochain’s approach.</p><p>Here are three of the four Holochain-related presentations. I have to say, I’m personally thrilled about all of them; I think they will be important projects in the growing Holochain ecosystem.</p>Harlan Wood shares TrustGraph, a framework for building subjective reputation in P2P networksEmaline Friendman and Michael Hueschen share Neighbourhoods<a href="https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fosdem/2022/D.web3/where.mp4"></a>Eric Harris-Braun presents Where, an app for collective sensemaking using a simple question: "Where are you at right now?"<p>Check out all the other talks in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/web3_infrastructure/">Web3 Infrastructure room</a>.</p><p>Well, I think that’s plenty for this Holo Monday!

<p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates – 7 February, 2022: IDnow, one of the leading global digital identity verification providers, has announced its launch in the Middle East, with the opening of its new office in DIFC’s Innovation Hub. This is the first IDnow office outside of Europe, adding to its headquarters in Munich, and offices across Leipzig, Düsseldorf, London and Manchester.</p>
<p>The business is targeting the huge Middle East and Africa (MEA) digital identity verification market, which is expected to reach USD 800M by 2025*. It is a rapidly expanding market, with the facial verification sector expected to grow at 20 percent CAGR for the next five years. IDnow’s regional team will be led by Oliver Obitayo, Chief Commercial Officer of IDnow Group and Head of Region – Middle East, Basil Macklai.</p>
<p>On the occasion of its Middle East launch, Oliver Obitayo commented, “The Middle East is a rapidly growing market for digital identity verification, supporting the region’s booming and innovative digital economy. We have been working in conjunction with regional regulators for more than two years, and the time is right to expand our presence with a dedicated team and office. IDnow’s combination of international experience, German-quality standards and in-depth knowledge of requirements across Middle East jurisdictions, puts us in a unique position to serve government, regulators, banks, financial services, enterprises and fintechs.”</p>
<p>More than half of businesses in the MENA region have faced new financial crime risks due to the pandemic, including payments fraud, account takeovers and identity theft. According to a study by Comparitech, in the UAE alone cyber crime claims 166,667 victims annually, losing $746 million, with identity theft and fraud key contributors. McKinsey research highlights financial services as the largest driver of identity verification services. As such, these businesses will account for around 62 percent of digital identity verification spend this year (Juniper Research).</p>
<p>For nearly a decade, IDnow has been developing quality technology that serves some of the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions. The IDnow platform provides a range of secure and seamless products, including its signature IDnow AutoIdent, an automated, AI-powered identity verification. Benefits include reducing onboarding friction, improving customer experience and automating conversion at scale. For banks and financial services, deploying IDnow enhances KYC, AML and regulatory compliance, helping to reduce risk of fraud to protect businesses and their customers.</p>
<p>Aligning with the vision of regional governments to strengthen the digital transformation of the banking sector and underline trust in Middle East financial services, IDnow facilitates greater integration with the global financial system and supports development of legislative and legal frameworks to ensure compliance with international standards.</p>
<p>IDnow is an industry leader and has set the standard for digital identity verification in the EU. It is backed by significant investors including Corsair Capital, Seventure Partners, BayBG Venture Capital, and a consortium of other financiers. The business has also received debt funding from the European Investment Bank, the European Union’s investment bank which is owned by the EU Member States.</p>

<p>Introduction: What Is GEMpay And What Are Its Intricacies?</p><p>GEMpay is a points-based payment system specialized for small business owners and entities. Instead of small business owners being plagued by brokerage fees charged in the normal terminal payment process, small business owners can become the subject of point issuance. By turning the small business entity into the focal component of the point-based system, a business can provide more benefits to loyal and new consumers alike. In the most brief manner of speaking, it is a win-win model for both the business and the consumer.</p> 🌟 First, The Dream, The Direction And Vision Of&nbsp;GEMpay <p>The direction of GEMpay, like blockchain technology, intends on eliminating the necessity of middle-men and payment intermediaries. The point discount concept has been adopted by GEMpay to increase discounts as opposed to fees, providing numerous benefits for the producer, business and consumer alike! GEMpay is a blockchain based solution as a service. With the innovation of blockchain, merchants and consumers are directly connected. Lets think if the merchant and consumer are two end points in a peer-to-peer network in the Bitcoin network; directly connected, without middle-men. This enables virtually zero commission costs. Unlike traditional financial systems, the core paradigm of the blockchain is “decentralization.” By excluding PGs and VAN companies that have gotten in the middle of the payment process, it is possible to conceive of a “double discount” with&nbsp;GEMpay.</p><p>GEMpay aims to become the subject of the service by transparently sharing the transaction process. Payment details and discount rates are shown in a direct and concise manner with GEMpay and enables users to exercise their own choice in operation. This is the ethos of decentralization that GEMpay aims to&nbsp;achieve.</p><p>GEMpay transparently shares the transaction process with users, allowing users to be the subject of payment data thereof. Rather than just sharing payment details and discount rates, you can easily check the details of why such a discount is possible through the GEMpay application. This creates efficient and easier services which allow users to exercise choice in a huge platform base created with their own data and aggregation. This will in return increase the actual benefits they will&nbsp;receive.</p><p>From the user’s point of view, it is quite burdensome to use coins that are extremely volatile and fluctuate in valuation on a second-by-second basis. BLOCKO intends on creating the AERGO Gem token on the self developed AERGO mainnet to ensure the consistent value of 1:1 value exchange with the KRW. BLOCKO will initially focus on the exchange pair with the KRW. Users can then use the AERGO Gem charged through the GEMpay app into the Korean&nbsp;won.</p> 🧐 So How Do I Use&nbsp;GEMpay? <p>To use GEMpay, it is necessary to follow these steps provided. To begin, you first must top-up your AERGO Gem tokens. AERGO Gem has the same value as the KRW, and when more users utilize the AERGO Gem on the GEMpay platform, users are able to garner more discounts. So how can individuals charge up their AERGO Gem with AERGO tokens? We want to increase user convenience by supporting the ARC-1 (based on the AERGO native token) and ERC-20 (based on Ethereum) AERGO&nbsp;token.</p><p>Since the AERGO mainnet has a Merkle Bridge function, it is possible to recharge your AERGO Gem with numerous different ERC-20 tokens, which include Ethereum. To do this, we need to pull the price for each token, and we need to have an Index for the price. However, there is no reliable index to date. The price shown on the exchange is not a reliable index because the exchange has the lead. If there is a transparent index related to Ethereum in the future, GEMpay will support various tokens through the Merkle Bridge function at any time.<br>The Merkle Bridge is a technology that enables the exchange between assets of the AERGO blockchain and assets of the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Because AERGO Gem is charged with AERGO tokens, the GEMpay app also serves as an ‘AERGO wallet’ as well. Users can transfer their AERGO tokens to the GEMpay app seamlessly for storage and recharge with AERGO GEM whenever they want. GEMpay supports both online and offline payments. At offline issuer A, a QR payment is made through the GEMpay app, and at online issuer B, payment is made with AERGO Gem by selecting ‘GEMpay’ among various payment methods such as credit card, Naver Pay, and Kakao&nbsp;Pay.</p><p>The issuing point is the subject of point issuance and can initially set the exchange rate of the issuing point points and the AERGO Gem. The moment a user pays with AERGO Gem, AERGO Gem is automatically converted into points at the point of issue. AERGO Gem is then exchanged for points which exclude brokerage fees, so a discount is automatically applied when paying with AERGO Gem. Users simply need to proceed with all payments with AERGO Gem. With this type of payment paradigm, payments become easy and seamless and you receive more discounts.</p><p>Issuers can settle accumulated points in the AERGO Gem and periodically receive AERGO Gem in the form of the Korean won currency. Through the GEMpay app, specifically on the administrator page, the issuer can glance and see the contents of the GEMpay payment and can then easily apply for a KRW settlement of the transaction. GEMpay provides consumers and businesses ample opportunities for discounts, efficient payment processes and more use-case for the AERGO token through these various mechanisms.</p> 💎 If you have a Gem double discount, you will have a lot to look forward to in the very near future! 😇 Provided is a three line summary of GEMpay for your convenience.   The AERGO Gem can be charged with AERGO tokens (ERC-20 and Native&nbsp;AERGO).  AERGO Gem can be used both online and&nbsp;offline.  Issuers can settle AERGO Gem in KRW through the GEMpay app on the admin&nbsp;page.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/gempay-so-how-is-it-written-dfbd16f5a30d">GEMpay: So How Is It Written?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

I’ll keep things short and to the&nbsp;point.</p> 🌎⚠️🔒 VaultAlert.net Release <p>With <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert</a> users can check the status of their VerusID Vault from anywhere in the world. VerusID Vault always protects your crypto assets even if your private keys are compromised. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/%EF%B8%8F-vaultalert-net-always-know-your-crypto-assets-are-safe-a20b4d537c61">Read more on VaultAlert here</a>.</p><p>Last month a lot of quiet progress was made on the development of the Verus multichain protocol. A new public testnet is on the verge of release with additional core protocol features. All effort is put into making Verus a decentralized and robust protocol that just&nbsp;works.</p> Exporting Currencies <p>Currencies on one PBaaS-blockchain can be exported to any other PBaaS-blockchain. This means that a currency can easily be made available on multiple blockchains.</p><p>An example: we have CHICKEN-currency on a PBaaS-chain and want it to be available on the Verus-blockchain as well. We export CHICKEN-currency to the Verus-blockchain for a fee and now CHICKEN-currency is available there too. It goes without saying that all fees go to the miners and stakers of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We can pay this fee in whatever currency we want, as long as it is available in the bridge-converter.</p><p>This fee is defined by the PBaaS-chain where you want the currency to be exported to, and thus can differ within all the multiple blockchains in the&nbsp;network.</p> Fee Structures <p>On the previous public testnet you could only make transactions if you had the native currency of the blockchain. Now you can use any currency that is in the bridge-converter as a fee to do operations on any PBaaS-blockchain.</p><p>Any currency on a blockchain can be used as fees to do transactions. Example: if you have USDC on the Verus-blockchain you don’t need VRSC to send the USDC around. It automatically converts a small fee of USDC to VRSC through a bridge-converter and uses that as its transaction fee.</p><p>This is an incredibly hard problem to solve. Yet it is working now on internal Verus test&nbsp;builds.</p> 🔊 Public Technical Updates from Mike Toutonghi <p>On January 8, 2022, Mike Toutonghi gave the community technical updates on the Verus Discord channel. 🔊 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6M0l0zjkQ0&amp;t=1168s">You can listen to it&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Awesome Mining&nbsp;Rigs <p>Some community members have shown their mining rigs in the #mining channel on <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discord</a> this month.

Malcolm is also the founder of InnoFi Advisory, a consulting firm supporting innovation and growth in DeFi, DAOs, and NFTs, and co-lead of the anti-money laundering (AML) working group at Global Digital Finance&nbsp;(GDF).</p><p>Read the full blog release below on Malcolm’s appointment to learn more about how he will be leading teams and all regulatory compliance and institutional strategy for upcoming extension systems of Veriscope.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/malcolm-wright-joins-shyft-network-as-head-of-strategy-for-its-global-regulatory-compliance-c599323a2af4">Malcolm Wright Joins Shyft Network as Head of Strategy for its Global Regulatory &amp; Compliance Solutions</a></blockquote> Shyft Network CEO Joseph Weinberg Op-Eds for CoinTelegraph &amp;&nbsp;CoinDesk <p>​​One month, two buzzy op-eds from our fearless leader Joseph Weinberg. Following the industry-shaking news coming out of DeFi protocol Wonderland regarding their pseudo-anonymous CFO “Sifu,” Joseph went deep on the battle between pseudonymity and trust in DeFi and crypto for Coin Desk as part of their Privacy Week series. Give it a read to learn more about the power of attested reputation and why it’s essential for the future of DeFi mass adoption!</p><p>Additionally, Joseph was quoted in another Coin Desk Privacy Week piece on the current state of Travel Rule compliance. Read it&nbsp;<a href="https://t.co/cqL2lKpaFv">here</a>.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/privacyweek/2022/01/29/wonderlands-and-defis-anonymity-problem/">Wonderland’s (and DeFi’s) Anonymity Problem</a></blockquote><p>Earlier in January, Joseph also penned an op-ed for CoinTelegraph on an essential but often overlooked topic in NFTs: compliance. Following a year of exponential growth in NFTs, Joseph looked into a couple of negative instances for the sector regarding malicious activity and fraud. Joseph explained how battle-coded compliance, on-chain KYC, and regulatory solutions can help protect NFTs buyers and exchanges from setbacks and keep the industry moving in the right direction.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nfts-and-compliance-why-we-need-to-be-having-this-conversation">NFTs and compliance: Why we need to be having this conversation</a></blockquote> Another $SHFT Giveaway Campaign to Celebrate the Lunar New&nbsp;Year <p>New year, new $SHFT giveaway for our community!

<p>Identity is a fundamental part of financial services. Identity of both individuals and organisations is critical in enabling or denying access to financial services (e.g. for payments, loans, claims) as financial institutions mitigate against fraud and risk. Given that successful/unsuccessful identification of an organisation determines whether or not it is able to do business (if transactions are legally permitted, if business loans are granted etc.), organisation identity is key to economic growth across the globe.</p>
<p>A large number of family-owned small businesses, the real job creators in most economies, struggle to get funding from financial institutions to secure their next 12 months of operation. This story is heard across all continents, and even in rich countries like the USA. In terms of access to credit from financial services, today many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) experience a familiar story of financial exclusion, often due to their identity information being deemed insufficient by financial institutions.</p>
<p>Beyond SMEs, corporations have their own pain points too. A company with a large number of resellers and suppliers knows the real risk of vast financial losses because of social engineering attacks. They could be next. The CISO can’t sleep at night knowing that the process of giving purchasing rights to authorised employees still relies on signing printed forms, and the inconsistency of old school line managers. Nothing that last quarter’s expensive pen test can help with.</p>
<p>In these two cases, building a bridge between people’s identities and organisations’ identities has the power to transform businesses digitally and deliver superior security, as well as increasing financial inclusion and growing economies. Such bridges cannot be built without strong pillars, and those pillars are the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/faq/what-is-a-legal-entity-identifier-lei/">LEIs</a> (Legal Entity Identifiers) – 20-character alphanumeric codes that identify legal entities in a global database.</p>
<p>This article explores the benefits of LEIs for financial use cases through three innovative business models pioneered by Ubisecure and our FinTech partners. Let’s define each of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. LEIs Help Fight against “Musty” Businesses 
<p>“The notes smelled musty, as if they had been stored under the floorboards” was said by the court. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/natwest-fined-264m-after-admitting-breaching-anti-money-laundering-rules">This blatant example</a> of NatWest shows how cash enters into the financial system in the millions to fund illegal activities when there are insufficient anti-money laundering checks. To mitigate against such situations, anti-money laundering regulations require banks and financial institutions to verify who exactly their customers are. Among many, one typical compliance requirement is called a <a href="https://rapidlei.com/ultimate-beneficial-ownership/">UBO declaration</a>, whereby a legal entity must declare its ultimate beneficial owners.</p>
<p>One innovative company, <a href="https://www.uboservice.com/">UBO Service</a>, is helping to streamline these declarations using LEIs. When a financial institution starts its compliance checks for a new customer, UBO Service captures information on the beneficial owners of the company. &nbsp;At this point, the LEI provides accurate entity identity information.</p>
<p>Ben Cronin, MD at UBO Service, said on the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/obliged-entities-ben-cronin-ubo-service/" title="Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast">Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast</a>: “Because there are a number of standards inherent in getting an LEI issued, that really feeds into our mantra about using official, appropriate and the best-in-class data sources when you’re onboarding a customer. So, by getting that right at that early stage, the lifecycle of that customer is much easier to manage if you capture the really accurate information at the start.”</p>
<p>An executive with the right to represent the company (e.g. a director) will then sign and confirm the full list of beneficial owners. If this matches the information captured from the registries, the financial institution (an obliged entity) has the confidence of having done the appropriate checks to onboard that customer.</p>
<p>A solution like UBO Service needs flexible APIs that allows it to generate LEIs and fetch live entity identity information from the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) repository in real time, and this is achieved by partnering with <a href="https://rapidlei.com/">RapidLEI</a>.</p>
<p>This innovative method of Know Your Business (KYB – KYC for B2B) is not exclusive to financial institutions. Other types of companies such as funds, foreign exchanges, state agents, lawyers, accountant firms can benefit from LEIs for KYB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. LEIs Help Include the Real Job Creators 
<p>Even in richer countries, small businesses can find it very hard to get access to credit. The main reason is that a company’s financial reputation is directly based on the owner’s financial score. What if the family, on top of not owning any property, never built up a good credit score to prove that they are reliable for re-payments?</p>
<p>The same anti-money laundering regulations that helped in the previous example are often a hindrance for SMEs. Due to these stricter regulations, a small company falls into a high-risk category from a bank’s perspective. What is the response from most banks? Well, they prefer not to do business with them at all. Consequently, these SMEs join the lonely island of financial exclusion.</p>
<p>So what’s the solution? FinClusive’s mission is “to bring secure, compliance-centered banking to the 2.5 to 3.5 billion people and businesses worldwide who are financially excluded or underserved”. It is <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/finclusive-validation-agent-gleis/" title="leveraging LEI issuance in its Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) solution">leveraging LEI issuance in its Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) solution</a> for financial institutions, who can in turn provide such SMEs with an affordable, verifiable identity in a simplified, digital workflow. When a new customer (e.g. an SME) wishes to open an account with a financial institution, the process of validating their identity and financial status will be done with a simplified, fully digital workflow. In this process of validating a new customer, the financial institution will generate an LEI for the new customer. </p>
<p>The power of creating an LEI for the SME at this early stage is huge. From the financial institution’s perspective, it will reduce the need to do further checks in the near future, as an LEI contains up-to-date information about both the legal entity and its owners and legal representatives, creating transparency around who is at the other side of this potential new deal and therefore reducing risk – resulting in greater inclusion.</p>
<p>Amit Sharma, Found and CEO at FinClusive, said on the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/identity-financial-inclusion-amit-sharma-finclusive/" title="Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast">Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast</a>: the LEI “legitimises them interacting with each other, which in an increasingly peer-to-peer world is hugely important for security and trust.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. LEI and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) 
<p>Among established companies who have access to financial services, it is very common to have corporate accounts with suppliers. Let’s look at an example: a large company – “Malco” – buying from a computer and electronics supplier – “eCommerce”.</p>
<p>Mike has a small bicycle accident on his way to Malco’s office (his employer). He’s safe and sound but his work smartphone gets badly damaged and inevitably has to be replaced. Mike goes to order a new mobile, logs into Malco’s supplier, eCommerce, using the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/representation-governance/">Sign in with RapidLEI</a> identification service – a service that links an individual’s identity to its verified organisation identity using the LEI. By using such a service, the supplier not only has securely authenticated Mike, but has verified that Mike has the legal right to represent Malco (in spending money on its behalf). That’s something a “Login with Google”-like service can’t offer.</p>
<p>Further, after a successful login, Mike sees that his preferred smartphone exceeds his current spending limits as originally authorised by Malco. No problem, he just clicks the “Request Higher Spending Limits” button and waits until the CFO approves it. Grace (CFO) sees the request and approves it, with every step done electronically and no cumbersome emailing back-and-forth/reimbursements etc. required. Finally, Mike receives a notification that his request has been approved, logs in again securely and completes the order.</p>
<p>Watch a video of this example:</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two key elements behind this successful scenario:</p>
 
 Authentication via Sign in with RapidLEI, which not only offers strong authentication but also gives to the service provider (eCommerce computer supplier) information on what are the user’s rights to represent their company. All this information is fetched in real time from the global repository of LEIs. 
 “eCommerce” uses advanced electronic delegation (a CIAM feature) to allow an admin user—the CFO — to transfer a set of roles and attributes to another — Mike. 
 
<p>Without this robust service that combines the best of CIAM and organisation identities, the story would involve paperwork and hand-written signatures, and it would be slower and less secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Summary 
<p>LEIs create a new spectrum of business models that bring benefits for all types of digital identity scenarios. The innovation I’ve just described delivers more than security and compliance, by ensuring that nobody is left behind in an island of financial exclusion. That’s the power of organisation identities and individual identities combined.</p>
<p>If you have your own use case that could benefit from the inclusion of LEIs/LEI issuance, find out more about <a href="https://rapidlei.com/partners/">partnering with RapidLEI</a> – the world’s leading LEI issuer, with a pioneering automated LEI issuance API that makes such use cases possible.</p>

 Let’s Replace Seed Phrases on Solana — Make Onboarding Easy for the Next Billion Users on both Wallets and Applications  Web3Auth receives Solana Foundation Grant, Launches Solana Torus Wallet, and Commits to 100% Support for all Wallets &amp; Applications <p>Along with scalability and transaction time, key management has posed a critical problem to any ecosystem gunning for mainstream adoption. And while the former two are solved on Solana, the current standard of managing keys via seed phrases is a far cry from perfect. Quantifiably, reports have shown that up to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-2-billion-lost-bitcoin-154948781.html#:~:text=Approximately%2020%25%20of%20all%20Bitcoins,billion%2C%20a%20new%20study%20says.">20% of all bitcoin in circulation has been lost</a>, users take up to 10–15 minutes to onboard onto any application/wallet and it’s almost every day that you hear stories of lost&nbsp;phrases.</p> A grant to push adoption — Eliminating seed phrases on dApps and&nbsp;wallets <p>It’s clear that in order to onboard the next billion users onto the ecosystem, something needs to change. These users need a seamless onboarding — an experience where the user can interface with the Dapp immediately without grappling with seed phrases. Fixing seed phrases has been Web3Auth’s mission and the Solana Foundation is glad to award us with a grant to help solve these gaps in onboarding for their ecosystem. Used already by Binance, Ubisoft’s NFT launch, Keplr (Cosmos), Rarible and other popular wallets/applications, we’re excited to share that today, Web3Auth’s threshold cryptography auth suite fully supports all Solana dApps and&nbsp;wallets.</p> How does Web3Auth solve the problem of onboarding for&nbsp;Solana?  1. Web3Auth Auth&nbsp;Suite <p>Web3Auth is a pluggable infrastructure that enables Web3 wallets and applications on Solana to provide seamless user logins for both mainstream and crypto native users. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets, and existing key management solutions, Web3Auth provides a familiar experience that fits every user thereby increasing conversion rates by up to&nbsp;64%</p><p>You can integrate Web3Auth into your application with a couple of lines of code. With web and mobile SDKs, you can customize its look for your application and even plug in your own existing auth/user base with the infrastructure.</p><p>Web3auth currently powers 500+ dApps and has over 8 million&nbsp;users.</p> 2. A state of the art Solana Torus&nbsp;Wallet <p>The Solana Torus Wallet is a result of months of collaboration between the development teams at Solana Labs and Web3Auth. It is a feature-rich non-custodial wallet built for users to securely store all digital assets on the Solana Blockchain and a gateway to access all dApps on Solana. The Solana Torus wallet is rich with some first-of-it’s-kind features such&nbsp;as:</p>  Meta transactions — Users can start interacting with your application without having any SOL in their wallets. Applications get to pay transaction fees on behalf of the&nbsp;users.  Fiat-to-crypto without KYC — Users can purchase crypto with credit card W/O KYC for up to a certain limited threshold.  Social logins — Users can log in straight into dApps under a min with non-custodial social&nbsp;logins.  Mobile &amp; web support — The wallet is mobile-first and supports both web and mobile flow with no need to download any&nbsp;app.   Experience the power&nbsp;yourself <p>Try out Solana torus wallet for yourself <a href="http://solana.tor.us">here</a>. You can get started with the wallet by directly integrating it <a href="https://docs.tor.us/solana-wallet/get-started">here</a> or via the Solana adapter&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter">here</a>.</p><p>You can access Web3Auth’s Whitelabel SDKs&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.web3auth.io">here</a>.</p> What’s next? <p>Web3Auth is committed to building an ecosystem and a lasting culture around the Solana blockchain to enable mainstream adoption among developers and users. You can look forward to Web3Auth supporting <a href="https://solana.com/riptide">Solana’s Riptide hackathons </a>throughout the year and for any developers looking to integrate, the Web3Auth team has been and continues to extend 100% support for dApps &amp; wallets on the Solana blockchain.</p><p>At the heart of it, this collaboration is all about empowering the developer community to onboard users into the ecosystem as seamlessly as it can get. Perhaps even better than the Web2 experience down the line. We don’t want any user to miss out on the possibilities that the world of Web3 has to offer to them just because they can’t remember their seed&nbsp;phrase.</p><p>About Solana&nbsp;Labs:</p><p>Solana is the most performant blockchain in the world.

<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p></p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p></p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p></p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Trial Dock Certs Today</a></p><p>Trial Dock Certs here and create, issue, and verify verifiable credentials without writing a single line of code. Dock Certs is the perfect tool for organizations that want to benefit from verifiable credentials without having to worry about integrating or changing current workflows. All data can be easily downloaded in various ways or can be kept in the safe platform of Dock Certs. </p><p>Dock Certs is an alpha release and we encourage users to trial the platform and feedback on the product, let us know what they like, what they don’t like as well as describe any future feature requests they’d like to see.</p><p>What are Verifiable Credentials?</p><p>Starting with the basics, Verifiable Credentials are an open standard for digital credentials. They can represent information found in physical form, such as a passport, license, or graduation certificate, as well as things that have no physical equivalent, such as ownership of an NFT. </p><p>Why Do We Need It?</p><p>The average professional presents 10 certificates to a job site. A qualified doctor, practitioner, or professional worker must present a copy of a physical certificate to a business in order to work. Today, the holders of the credentials must keep these qualification papers in order and up-to-date while the organization is left to manually verify the qualifications. Issuing, printing, and delivering these paper or PDF certificates can take weeks and months and the verifying process can take just as long to complete. There are many notable problems with paper or PDF certificates:</p>  Paper certificates and PDF credentials can be easy to tamper with creating fake credentials. This makes verifying the credentials difficult for an organization and undermines the trust in the training and educational body that issues the credentials.  If the verifying process by the employer is not done correctly, fraudulent certificates and compliance documents can go unnoticed, therefore putting the worker at risk and the organization at fault.  Paper certificates can be lost or damaged.  <p>The Use of Dock Certs</p><p>Dock Certs mitigates the risk of these incidents occurring, allowing users to create, issue, and share verifiable credentials and decentralized identities without writing a single line of code.</p><p>Users can <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">sign up to Dock Certs</a> and begin creating verifiable credentials and decentralized identities in a few simple clicks. Organizations can benefit from the functionality of Dock’s technology without requiring any coding or development work. </p><p>After creating the credential, organizations can issue these to the holder via a link in an email or by sending a PDF/digital certificate. Another option of issuing is to send the credential via a JSON file that the holder can store in their credential wallet. These verifiable credentials are different from their non-verifiable counterparts as they can be instantly verified using cryptographic methods. This leaves no room for fraudulent activity, making it easier for the job site to verify credentials and maintain the reputation of the training/education body. </p><p>The organization can store all credentials they’ve created and issued on Dock Certs. Alternatively, if the business wants to take ownership of the credentials, they can be saved via a PDF download or a JSON file. </p><p>Dock’s API for Organizations Who Have the Time</p><p>For those organizations that have in-house developers and want a more custom look and feel to the credentials they issue, Dock’s API can be integrated with current workflows. Developers can create and issue verifiable credentials that sit on the holder's device and have the option to create a decentralized identity on the blockchain which is anchored to the verifiable credential. </p><p>Even if the organization ceases to exist, the credential and decentralized identity still exist and can be instantly verified. </p><p>Verifiable credentials via Dock’s API and Dock Certs are almost impossible to tamper with allowing any third party to easily verify credentials. </p><p>More to Come</p><p>Dock Certs is the perfect tool for organizations that want to benefit from verifiable credentials without the need for coding and development. <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Trial Dock Certs today</a>.</p><p>We have more updates launching in the coming weeks, keep an eye out for the release of Dock’s credentialing wallet and verifier tool, making it easy to store and verify credentials.</p>

 Looking Forward — SocialKYC  self-owned, trustworthy social account credentials…now what? <p>Written by Paul Pomerleau — Developer Relations and Community Manager at BOTLabs GmbH, the company that initially developed KILT Protocol.</p><p><a href="https://socialkyc.io">SocialKYC</a> recently launched. In short, it’s a service that lets you get credentials which validate that you own various social accounts. Right now that means email and Twitter…although I hear rumours that Discord and GitHub are coming soon. Cool, so I have these credentials, why not just use my account directly? Because by using credentials to prove your ownership of an account you protect your data, break data silos, increase trust, portability and&nbsp;value.</p> Protect Your&nbsp;Data <p>When you share your credential, you can decide not to disclose the details. This is called selective disclosure. For example the <a href="https://clankilt.io/raffle">Clan KILT raffle</a> asked for email or Twitter credentials to trust you’re not likely to be a bot. This is enough, so it doesn’t need to know your details. But it could ask for opt-in disclosure (it doesn’t, but it could) in order to count the entries that are also registered to the newsletter or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">@KILTProtocol</a>. This puts you entirely in control and whatever you choose, no trust is&nbsp;lost.</p><p>Websites typically ask for email and password, but what happens if the database gets hacked? Data stores from multiple sources get compromised, hackers build data sets over time and build more complete pictures of you, the mark. But do sites really need email and password? The email often serves as a persistent identifier, and the password proof of ownership. With SocialKYC we can use credentials to ensure requirements, and leverage DIDs and server side secrets to generate site unique user ids. Services would get a persistent identifier unique to the user, proof of ownership and as a bonus, added trust if they want by verifying additional credentials. And if this database gets compromised? If data is a hacker’s ammunition, this just gives them&nbsp;blanks.</p> Break Silos <p>In recent years “sign-in with XYZ” has provided both developers and users convenience for signing up and signing in. What happens here is that you allow a third party access (if enabled) to your XYZ account. But you also allow (if enabled) data from the third party to feed back to XYZ. Now yes there’s more concern with user privacy these days, and yes for the most part services are compliant with giving users choice to share or not. But these are businesses and their business is data… your data, and you’ve ever tried to navigate user agreements and privacy settings, choice and data protection isn’t exactly at the forefront of the UX. SocialKYC does exactly that, it puts choice and data protection at the forefront of the UX. A service will use sign-in with XYZ because they trust their registration process. With SocialKYC none of that trust is lost but the data feed between the two parties is severed. Congratulations, your data is&nbsp;free.</p> Increase Trust <p>SocialKYC credentials are just trust transferred from other accounts… so same trust right? Maybe for one credential, but not so for many. “A single twig breaks, but the bundle of twigs is strong. — Tecumseh”. How much would you trust that the owner of an email address is human? Now how much would you trust that the owner of an email address, Twitter account, GitHub account and Discord is human? But it goes further, what if you need to know that the owner is an employee? What about requiring disclosure of corporate email, GitHub and public Twitter. The system could verify the email domain, check the GitHub username and for good measure make sure the employee is following the corporate Twitter before authenticating. Then using some DID hash identifier (or some better approach), the user can get a session and the disclosed details used for authorization are discarded.</p> Increase Portability <p>The utility of your socials increases as credentials for two reasons, portability and economic leverage. Social web2 credentials aren’t inherently portable. Right now, where can you use your Twitter? Twitter itself of course, then with services that integrate sign-in with Twitter. In other words it’s limited to a small subset of web2. Credentials on the other hand… simple maths. Okay not so simple maths. But it can be used anywhere you can prove ownership of the DID via cryptographic proof. Yes we need tools to manage these handshakes, but anyone can build them for any of our social worlds. Brick and mortar yup, web2 check, web3 sure, metaverse absolutely. Online, offline, off-chain and on. The identity is yours, it goes where you&nbsp;go.</p> Increase Value <p>When you consider a social network with a central data silos… who gets the economic value and leverage? They do; of course they have the data. With SocialKYC who has the data? You do; So who gets the economic value and leverage? Exactly. Business, employers, nonprofits… all these entities don’t want to connect with the social network, they want to connect with YOU. But the network has your data, so connecting with it is the next best thing. So these entities pay the data silo to run their algos and hope to reach their intended demographic. With SocialKYC they don’t have to hope, they can verify, and instead of paying the silo for the right to push unwanted ads, they can offer you the value. And you can seek them out based on your wants and needs and form a real relationship. Conversion rates, click-thru rates, views and shares are good, cash-in hand, real ROI and lifelong customers are&nbsp;better.</p> Looking Forward <p>I can imagine web2 login alternatives for easy data compliance, email sign-in at local membership clubs with discounts for social followers, e-sports tournaments based on university emails, corporate email smart locks, value driven advertising and a million other things we haven’t thought of. So now what? Who can say, but I’m optimistic and the possibilities are endless. Now it’s up to us the decentralised community to build it to its needs. Check out our community <a href="https://trello.com/kiltprotocol">Trello workspace</a> to find inspiration, vote and discuss ideas: join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/HztRqvzbhG">Discord</a>, a DAO-inspired community, focused on outcomes and impact. We meet every Friday to mobilize, educate, inspire and build.

  <p>Take a look in your physical wallet.&nbsp;Maybe you have some credit cards and probably identification of some kind.&nbsp;Do you have a roadside assistance card, perchance? The cards we carry and present every single day feel different than many common digital credentials (such as federated credentials) that identify us and communicate our attributes online, but that gap is narrowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the identity ecosystem looks at emerging paradigms for trust and individual agency in our online interactions, we see use cases where the federated identity model we know so well in the real world might work to provide more digital autonomy and control.&nbsp;We call this model the “presentation model” because an end user collects and controls the presentation of their credential when and where they choose.&nbsp;The presentation model does not replace online federated models, but instead, each model can be used where most valuable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part one of our series introduced our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/06/microsofts-5-guiding-principles-for-decentralized-identities/">5 guiding principles for decentralized identities.</a>&nbsp;In this and subsequential blogs, we will continue to dive deeper into the technical basics of decentralized identity. Read on for part two of this five-part series on decentralized identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part I:&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://aka.ms/identityprinciples">The Five Guiding Principles</a></p>
<p>Part II: &nbsp;The Direct Presentation model &lt;--&nbsp;You are here</p>
<p>Part III: The Basics of Decentralized Identity</p>
<p>Part IV: Deep Dive: Verifiable Credentials</p>
<p>Part V:&nbsp; Deep Dive: Anchored Decentralized Identifiers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we use identity-related credentials in the real world, they often have different properties than digital credentials. There are two separate ceremonies in most cases: issuance and presentation.&nbsp; If you have spent any time at a department of motor vehicles or a passport office, you’ve seen what an issuance ceremony can be – it is usually an intensive process, but the tradeoff is that once you have a credential like a driver’s license or passport, you can use that credential for multiple purposes, at multiple places, over a long period of time. You, the “holder” of the credential, can choose to present your credential as a (mostly) voluntary exchange, in which the verifier of your credential can grant you access to some kind of resource - for example, they might allow you into a nightclub, or allow you to check out a library book.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s use a concrete real-world scenario: roadside assistance. Many of us are members of automotive clubs which advertise national and international coverage in the case of vehicle mishaps. After a sign-up song and dance and giving them my annual fee, they issue me a card I stuff into my wallet and forget about. Until one fateful night when my car breaks down in a location I am unfamiliar with. In this case, a miraculous thing happens – I can pull my auto club card from my wallet, and present that card to a garage that has never heard of me before, and a tow truck will arrive to help me. This issue-then-present credentialling model that has long powered the physical world is ready for adoption in the digital world too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technical name for the model at work here is called the Direct Presentation model. A credential is issued, and then held for a long period of time with intermittent voluntary presentations to many different verifiers. To put that back into our example, my auto club issues me a card, which I hold in my wallet for years (maybe decades!), and I might choose to show that card to a garage when I need a tow, or possibly to a store to get a discount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s switch gears (see what I did there?) to look at the digital world as you use it today. Rather than giving me a card I can store in my wallet, websites (and other services) create a user account. My resource access is tied to this account, and I must prove I own the account by authenticating to the website. After I have authenticated, there is a limited amount of time where the website “knows” who I am and can vouch on my behalf to applications and to other domains, introducing me to resources while sharing data about me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process of an authoritative Identity Provider who redirects me to resources and introduces me as a valid account within their domain with certain attributes and entitlements is called the Federated Presentation model. Going back to my night on the highway, instead of presenting my road service card to the garage, I’d have to borrow their point of sale (POS) terminal to authenticate to the auto club website, then be redirected to the garage website - with my card information included in the redirect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these models got me my tow truck. They both have important qualities, and there are a number of use cases where either could do the job. But each has a few use cases where they can really shine. In the case of federated presentation, enterprise scenarios such as single sign-on (SSO) provide a compelling combination of convenience and security. Likewise, the digital version of the direct presentation model has great applications - where users benefit from increased agency in their dealings with businesses, governments, and even each other. We’ll cover the key qualities of the direct presentation model in the rest of this blog, and then in our next blog, we can talk through what high level architectural requirements we foresee. Remember, my car has broken down, I’m in a remote and unfamiliar place, and I need to leverage the roadside assistance that I have purchased in advance to get service from a garage that I have never previously done business with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Common qualities of the Direct Presentation model (Real-world and digital) 
<p>My choice of when and what gets presented</p>
<p>As I sit in my broken-down car, I have options. I might have roadside assistance coverage from multiple providers. I might even have a coupon for a free tow I picked up from the roadside diner or prefer to use a credit card. If I do, I can debate which offers the best deal, and present what works for me. This sounds like a simple thing, but it is tougher to do in the federated model because I can’t look through my wallet to remember which clubs I’m a member of or what coupons I’ve squirreled away. Instead, the garage would have to try to help me remember which auto clubs I might be affiliated with by showing me logos until I see one I recognize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything goes through me</p>
<p>When I interact with the garage, I’m the person presenting my credential and I’m the person getting a receipt back. No real-time interaction is needed with the auto club, which is lucky because it’s the middle of the night. But I am aware of the interactions in real time, and if I want to, I can compare my receipts from all the breakdowns my car has had, see trends in what kinds of transactions I’ve been a part of, and even find places where I’ve been overcharged or where the promises of the transaction haven’t materialized. This is because I was an agent in the direct presentation. In a federated model, the logs of what data was passed about me are likely available but I would have to collect those logs from many different places – if they’re made available to me - to see the full picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Present it anywhere</p>
<p>Imagine the case where every garage had to have a separate contract with every regional auto club whose members might want to use their services. The overhead of such a system would be high. Instead, the garages and regional clubs all agree to abide by a common association’s trust framework that establishes the rules and practices that everyone must follow. In the direct presentation model, standards help establish the rules which allow easy establishment of associations, and there’s a potential for direct presentation to make it easier to set up common trust frameworks. This is what allows me to present my membership card from Alberta on a dark highway in North Dakota – where both I and the driver can be confident in the transaction. If everyone uses a common presentation model, it opens the doors to make it easier for trust frameworks to be formed and governed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Unique properties of the Digital Direct Presentation model 
<p>There are few things that couldn’t work for me as I sit in my broken-down car with a physical auto club card, but that could work if I were using a digital credential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selective disclosure</p>
<p>When I hand my auto club card to the tow truck operator on the dark highway, I cannot prevent that person from reading everything printed on that card. If the card were to show my home address, the truck driver would know where I lived. But with a digital credential, I can choose what to release (and what not to) during presentation – in this example, I can simply release the fact that I qualify for a tow, and nothing else. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wallet has a brain</p>
<p>Another unique quality of a digital direct presentation is that because software can help, my wallet has a brain and can be a trusted advisor. As I sit in my car, shivering, I might make a bad choice about which garage to call. A digital wallet might cross-reference my choice in garages with the Better Business Bureau and suggest I choose a business with a rating higher than one star, saving me from a bad experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 But what IS the digital version of Direct Presentation? 
<p>There are several important initiatives already underway that qualify as direct presentation – including mobile Driver’s License projects based on the ISO 18013 specification, as well as various ePassport initiatives. Vaccine passports are another case where the direct presentation model is emerging, with initiatives such as <a href="https://vci.org/">VCI</a> and <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass (GHP)</a> gaining traction.&nbsp; In the identity world, we at Microsoft see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> specification as a Data format with long-term potential to let the industry move towards multi-purpose direct presentation. We hope to see some of the models converge over time as they mature, and we’ll deep dive on each of these options over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Federated Presentation and Direct Presentation are complimentary 
<p>You might be wondering: do we see the direct presentation model replacing federated models? No. We believe that federated and direct presentation models will co-exist, and that each model lends itself to solving different problems. Federated presentation is a modern workhorse when it comes to use cases like enterprise single sign-on, and there will continue to be many places where involving the user in a presentation ceremony will never make sense. The good news is that we have specifications that can help federated and direct models to co-exist, and we are working in the <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, and other standards bodies to find an interoperable balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want a sneak peek, check out Kristina Yasuda and Torsten Lodderstedt at the recent OAuth Security Workshop, talking about some of their work that leverages the&nbsp;Self-Issued Identity Provider section of the OpenID Connect specification. This work truly bridges the worlds of Direct and Federated Presentation models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 But wait, what does this have to do with Decentralization? 
<p>If you’ve noticed that we’re not talking a lot about decentralized tech here, don’t be shocked. Microsoft sees unique and differentiated value in how decentralized technology can fulfill many of the criteria listed above, and we’re excited to dig deeper into what decentralized technology can deliver in later posts! But our goals center on both human and business outcomes. As such, we can and will use decentralized technology where it’s needed and useful, and we’ll do our best to discuss with the community the trade-offs and advantages in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next? 
<p>Now that we have a foundational understanding of the Direct Presentation model and its place in the digital world, our next installment will discuss how we build a reference architecture that could deliver on our principles using the Direct Presentation model. We’ll start with a high-level architecture and slowly drill into the various parts of that architecture, describing the standards at play and how we can see those standards pushing us closer to the 5 guiding principles. There are quite a lot of standards – we’ve constructed a <a href="http://linktr.ee/decentralizedidentity">handy linktree</a> to let you easily index into the various specifications we are participating in and/or implementing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is going to be fun!</p>

<p>The fourth quarter of 2021 rounded out a year of volatility and growth <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/31/volatility-ruled-crypto-markets-in-2021-from-69k-bitcoin-to-elon-musks-dogecoin-to-the-moooonn/">across the cryptocurrency sector</a> and cemented the end of a year when <a href="https://twitter.com/reesew/status/1433524984723349507?lang=en">pop culture</a> became aware of NFTs. Governments responded to the rise of digital currency too: <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/12/09/bitcoin-miners-hashrate-record-activity-china-crypto-crackdown-kazakhstan/">Miners relocated</a> after China cracked down on cryptocurrency mining and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) provided <a href="https://t.co/t77D51EpO6">more definition</a> around rules under development. This new guidance <a href="https://twitter.com/hartcb/status/1453917982892036101">falls in line</a> with the role Civic is assuming for permissioned DeFi environments.</p>



<p>Key Milestones</p>



<p>At Civic, our Q4 2022 was all about building trust and safety within the broader blockchain ecosystem. In October, we announced our new <a href="https://docs.civic.com/">Developer Hub</a> and <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-pass-integration-guide/">Civic Pass integration guides</a>. Civic Pass is our identity layer that allows for permissioned dApp platforms for web3, whether they are DEXs, an NFT mints or marketplaces, metaverses or otherwise.</p>



<p>Headed into the Solana Breakpoint conference, we announced a new suite of tools for creators, including <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/introducing-new-tools-for-creators-to-build-trusted-communities/">free bot prevention</a> using Civic Pass technology. While at Breakpoint, Civic and Identity.com created some beautiful <a href="https://twitter.com/identity/status/1460753722552688642">Identity.com Tech Showcase videos</a>; I took to the stage for a panel about <a href="https://youtu.be/0ZimB8y8HYc">building cross-chain</a>; and we hosted a Twitter Spaces event with our new partner, <a href="https://twitter.com/civickey/status/1457771416409886721">Snowcrash Labs</a>, a premier NFT marketplace, launching Q1 2022. We made a concerted effort to embed our technology further within the Solana ecosystem by strengthening partnerships while we were there, and we’ve seen dividends across a short timespan from these efforts.</p>



<p>To close out November, Civic and Identity.com sponsored the <a href="https://twitter.com/redacted_j/status/1465364695766949888">Solana Labs Miami Hacker House</a>. During that time, our on-site crew worked together tirelessly with the Metaplex team to <a href="https://twitter.com/juamps/status/1471546856203116547">integrate bot prevention</a> from Civic Pass with Candy Machine. And, our head of product joined other NFT luminaries for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrr9DJIJuBs">panel discussion at DCentral Con about identity</a>.</p>



<p>We wrapped up December by <a href="https://allart.medium.com/announcing-all-art-ido-and-nft-drop-a92554e66962">partnering with ALL.ART</a>, which owns SolSea, to provide KYC and KYB services for their end-of-year IDO. We also announced a partnership with <a href="https://blog.magiceden.io/p/magic-eden-open-listing-nft-marketplace?">Magic Eden for trust and safety services</a>. To close out the month, we partnered with SolSea on the first-ever NFT drop for a US federal campaign, which benefited <a href="https://twitter.com/hartcb/status/1471553890893975552">Shr</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hartcb/status/1471553890893975552">i</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hartcb/status/1471553890893975552">na Kurani for Congress</a>.</p>



<p>Civic in the News</p>



<p>In the fourth quarter, Civic accumulated a total online readership of more than 73M. Though many of our partnership announcements were made via Twitter this quarter, we did make a <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/introducing-new-tools-for-creators-to-build-trusted-communities/">new product announcement</a> during Solana Breakpoint in November with our new suite of NFT creator tools. The announcement made headlines in <a href="https://decrypt.co/85492/combat-solana-bot-problem-civic-unveils-digital-id-nfts">Decrypt</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/civic-launches-free-tool-to-combat-nft-hungry-bots-on-solana">CoinTelegraph</a>, <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2021/11/08/civic-launches-ignite-pass-tool-to-eliminate-bots-in-nft-mints-and-drops/">Invezz</a> and <a href="https://www.cointrust.com/market-news/civic-launches-free-tool-for-bot-free-nft-minting-and-dropping">Cryptopian</a>.</p>



<p>And, we made great strides in compliance-related thought leadership as FATF made announcements and the DeFi space continued to grow. Our head of risk and compliance, Chris Harding, made appearances on a panel for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmUjvkPYXNs">LA Blockchain Summit</a>, at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KIhF6M3uO8">Reimagine conference</a> and on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/71VDJTahPBq4m5wfRx5Sxi">CryptoNews podcast</a>. He also penned <a href="https://thedefiant.io/crypto-regulation-defi-adoption/">an op-ed for The Defiant</a> about regulation in crypto, and interviewed with both <a href="https://www.gokhshteinmedia.com/article/where-the-worlds-of-blockchain-and-identity-verification-intersect">Gokhshtein Media</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/crypto-security-2022-prepare-for-more-defi-hacks-exchange-outages-noob-mistakes.htm">Crypto News</a>.</p>



<p>Coming Soon</p>



<p>What a ride 2021 was! We’re poised for further growth in 2022, and we’re also pruning some programs to keep up with the growth, including our Verified by Civic Pass program, which we recently closed. During Q1, expect to see more partnership announcements as we continue building out the DeFi side of our business. In fact, in Q1 2022 we’ve already integrated Civic Pass with KYB for a new partner that is attracting institutional investors, Credix. We’ve also partnered with Liquid Meta to <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/liquid-meta-partners-with-civic-technologies-to-bring-capital-liquidity-to-permissioned-dapps/">bring capital liquidity to permissioned dApps</a>. And, we’ll be adding features to our NFT products as we continue to respond to dynamic community needs.&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

 As you probably know, Anonyome Labs has created two popular products based on personas or digital identities we call&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=what+is+a+sudo">Sudos</a>: 



<p></p>



  A persona-based application (<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;consumer app)&nbsp;  A persona-based services platform (<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>), for enterprise developers to include persona-based services into their consumer products (MySudo also uses this).&nbsp;  



<p>Having multiple personas (digital identities or Sudos) means the user can compartmentalize (silo) their daily activities and gain greater&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;protection. (Read our popular deep dives on&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>&nbsp;as a data privacy protection strategy, why&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/why-data-privacy-experts-urge-businesses-to-proactively-protect-customer-data/">data privacy matters</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">what consumers want</a>.)</p>



<p>To give you some insight into the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">innovation and expertise</a>&nbsp;we bring to persona-based products, here are 17 of the patents filed during the creation of MySudo and Sudo Platform.</p>



 Persona System 



<p></p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Masking a Real User Controlling Synthetic Identities, Patent #: US9372987, June 20, 2016 (Issued)</p>



<p>This patent outlines the design of a persona application and persona services that allow a user to create personas for their own use and where only they know the identity and can operate the personas that they own. The persona services do not have the information to relate users to personas.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Administering Proxy Identities, Patent #: US10356052, July 16, 2019 (Issued)</p>



<p>This patent outlines the design for the persona services. Each user can have multiple personas, each persona fitted with identity attributes such as phone number, email address, virtual payments information, contacts, and avatar, and with capabilities such as communications, browsing, anonymous payments, and reputation. The persona services also allow for a marketplace of personas so that personas can be bought and sold between users.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Building, Extending and Managing Interactions Between Digital Identities and Digital Identity Applications, Patent #: US10931650, February 23, 2021 (Issued)</p>



<p>This is a more detailed examination of the design of the persona applications and persona services, including verifying the distribution of applications built from the persona services.</p>



 Persona Anonymity with Recourse 



<p></p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Enabling Owner Authorized Monitored Stewardship Over Protected Data in Computing Devices, Patent #: US10963582, March 30, 2021 (Issued)</p>



<p>This is a design for an anonymity with recourse system that allows a user to maintain complete anonymity, possession of cryptographic keys, possession of encrypted communication and so on up to the point where a legal process allows uncovering of that data. The blockchain-based system records the implementation of the process steps so that any collusion or misbehavior by participants can be uncovered.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Managing Digital Identities and Controlling Their Correlation to Legal Identities, Patent #: US11159578, October 26, 2021 (Issued)</p>



<p>This builds on the generic anonymity with recourse system in the above patent to focus on the use of personas for anonymity and how under legal due process the identity of the user can be uncovered. Again, a blockchain-based system ensures that any misbehavior is uncovered.</p>



 Persona Usage with Decentralized Identities 



<p></p>



<p>Digital Wallet for Digital Identities and Interactions with a Digital Identity Services Platform, US16/821,181, March 17, 2020 (Filed)</p>



<p>This patent outlines the design of how to enhance personas with decentralized identity such that each persona can access a full range of compartmentalized decentralized identity services, such as DIDComm encrypted messaging, verifiable credentials (request, hold, present), passwordless login and so on. Each persona has a decentralized identity wallet holding encryption keys, DIDs, verifiable credentials and other information specifically for that persona.&nbsp;</p>



 Persona Reputation 



<p></p>



<p>A Decentralized Reputation Service for Synthetic Identities, Patent #: US9703986, July 11, 2017 (Issued)</p>



<p>This defines a system and method to calculate ongoing persona reputation. It also uses a block chain as an immutable store of the reputation calculation.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Establishing Trust of Anonymous Identities, Patent #: US11177937, November 16, 2021 (Issued)</p>



<p>This disclosure is an extension to the reputation design outlined above. This disclosure presents a method whereby a reputation score can be calculated for anonymous online users (personas) by analyzing their public activities performed in online settings, analytics gathering, and/or other disclosed or discoverable data points. Inputs to the reputation score may come from the ratings or reviews submitted by other parties of verified transactions where an online user has participated, such as purchases, rentals, enrolments etc.&nbsp;</p>



 Persona-Based Anonymous Payments 



<p></p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Processing Virtual Credit Cards for Digital Identities, US 16/985,962, August 14, 2020 (Filed)</p>



<p>This patent outlines a design for allowing anonymous payments by providing personas each with virtual payment cards. The system outlines how these cards are created, managed and closed.</p>



 Persona-Based Browsing 



<p></p>



<p>A Persona-Based Privacy Browser, US16/877,976, May 19, 2020 (Filed)</p>



<p>This describes the design of a persona-based browser application system that allows for improved anonymization and compartmentalization of persona browsing by allowing the creation of an individual browser configuration/instance for each persona.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Persona Based Isolation Browsing, August 15, 2019 (Filed)</p>



<p>This patent extends the persona-based privacy browser application design above by allowing the creation of an individual isolation browser configuration/instance for each persona.</p>



 Persona-Based Email 



<p></p>



<p>Email Application for Synthetic Identities, Patent #: US9729519, August 8, 2017 (Issued)</p>



<p>This outlines the design for an email system for users with multiple personas. This provides compartmentalized email for each persona. The email communication is encrypted between personas.</p>



<p>Method and System for Automating Secure Email for Multiple Personas, Patent #: US10382211, August 13, 2019 (Issued)</p>



<p>This patent extends the above patent to describe the design of a standards-based S/MIME persona-based email system to allow encrypted persona-to-persona email, or encrypted persona-to-third party S/MIME email.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Managing Digital Identities, Patent #: US10511493, December 17, 2019 (Issued)</p>



<p>This extends the above patents to specifically describe the management of multiple email accounts for each persona. These are machine-generated random email accounts such that a single persona could have an account for each service that the persona interacts with, giving the user very fine-grained control of email accounts for each persona.</p>



 Persona-Based VPN 



<p></p>



<p>Method and System for Providing Persona Masking in a Computer Network, Patent #: US10320753, June 11, 2019 (Issued)</p>



<p>This describes the design of a persona-based VPN system that allows for improved anonymization and compartmentalization of persona traffic by allowing the creation of a VPN configuration for each persona.</p>



 Persona-Based Telephony 



<p></p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Supporting Telephonic Synthetic Identities, Patent #: US9374689, June 20, 2016 (Issued)</p>



<p>This outlines the design for a telephony application system for users with multiple personas. The telephony communication provides both SMS/MMS and voice calling, with each persona having one or more telephony numbers. This provides compartmentalized telephony for each persona.</p>



 Persona Protection 



<p></p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Identifying and Warning of Synthetic Identity Behavior that Reduces User Privacy, Patent #: US10178106, January 8, 2019 (Issued)</p>



<p>This patent defines methods for protection from unwittingly disclosing the relationship between a persona identity and user identity, or between persona identities. The aim is to keep strong compartmentalization and to not reduce user privacy.</p>

				  The power of decentralized identity is that it decentralizes governance—enabling flexible solutions within a privacy and security-driven framework.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By <a href="mailto:trevor@indicio.tech">Trevor Butterworth</a></p>
<p>The past year has seen decentralized identity emerge from its “talk” phase and into its market phase. At the same time, the market is increasingly aware of the need for decentralized identity solutions to manage &nbsp;immediate problems, like the privacy and security challenges in banking and finance, &nbsp;the how to share and verify personal health data in hospitality and travel, and the need for constant, frictionless authentication in zero trust security applications.</p>
<p>But there is also the growing realization that decentralized identity is the way to manage verification and security in decentralized finance, Web3, and the metaverse, while allowing each to maintain its underlying decentralized integrity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable, secure, and interoperable identities will be critical to controlling the “Internet of Everything,” otherwise known as the spatial web, where an ever-expanding range of cameras and sensors using hyperspatial markup language will allow digital objects to engage with non-digital objects. It’s not just the drone that will have a verifiable identity; the parcel it carries will have one too.</p>
<p>All of this makes 2022 the year of the decentralized identity solutions, a chance for this long-evolving and much-talked about technology to show how it can solve the verification problems inherent in Web 2.0 and create trust in Web 3.0. Now is the time for these solutions to articulate how they will save money, make money, and mitigate risk. To do that, obviously, we need products and services; less obviously, we need to understand that the role of governance is to serve the solution and the customer.</p>
<blockquote>
 Enterprises want to buy solutions that solve problems, not engage in philosophies that make deployment feel like climbing a mountain of documentation 
</blockquote>
<p>Given decentralized identity’s long gestation, it is inevitable that a lot of talk accumulated into governance documents and governance frameworks. Every new technology needs to be talked into existence while the engineers catch up: We have to talk about something to figure out how to build the solution; we have to talk about problems and pain points, standards and protocols and technical requirements. </p>
<p>But there comes a point when all this talk must recede into the background documentation. Right now, it can often seem that governance frameworks are the solutions and the technology is incidental or worse, inadequate.</p>
<p>This is a problem, and it is compounded by a miasma of confusing &nbsp;terminology, sequential processes, and technology and governance “stacks.” These &nbsp;are difficult to process into a simple “aha” if you are among the uninitiated — which is most of the potential market for this technology. Decentralized identity has not yet found its equivalent to the “1,000 songs in your pocket,” what-it-all-means message that successfully launched Apple’s iPod. That kind of messaging is critical, and governance frameworks do not, frankly, speak with that clarity and compulsion.</p>
<p>This is not to say that we don’t appreciate the importance of shared standards, clear technical requirements, and best practices: we do; but they are not the solution—no more than governance is for cloud services. They serve the solution &nbsp;and the solution serves the customer’s needs. </p>
<p>It is time for solutions to take the spotlight.</p>
<blockquote>
 Governance should be flexible, pragmatic — and decentralized 
</blockquote>
<p>You may have noticed that this article has, so far, avoided mentioning “self-sovereign identity” or SSI. SSI is what the identity community originally called decentralized identity—and still largely does. But it can be a problematic term for some audiences because it can be read as saying that in decentralized identity there is no such thing as society, there are just &nbsp;“selves”— self-sovereign identities that are all co-equal.</p>
<p>While a foundational principle of self-sovereign identity is that individuals should be in control of their own data and identity, the reality is that there are other kinds of sovereign entities besides individuals: nations, institutions, membership organizations, companies, each of which carries its own governance history and culture and which imposes rules on its subjects and negotiates and interoperates with other sovereign entities.</p>
<p>If any of these entities chooses to adopt decentralized identity, it is making a clear commitment to a privacy-preserving, secure technology, simply because that’s the technology’s function and not just a feature. But it is also going to deploy the technology in a way that accords with the goals of its existing governance because that is what sovereign entities do. </p>
<p>Some of these deployments are going to be <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/4/247949/2021-Perkins-Coie-LLP-Health-Passport-White-Paper.pdf">less than fully self-sovereign</a>, and we must recognize that governance frameworks for decentralized identity are going to be negotiations with existing governance requirements; there needs to be flexibility.</p>
<p>This is the reason why we advocate “machine-readable governance” as an architectural solution.</p>
 
 First, machine-readable governance simplifies how decentralized identity works: The user software handles the rules for information flows and authentication, which are established and published by the entities with authority for governing the use case. 
 Second, this architecture makes these rules transparent. 
 Third, and critically, it enables these rules to function offline through caching, which, when you think about it, is an essential feature in any digital identity verification system; trust can’t be dependent on a Wi-Fi signal. 
 
<p>But there’s a broader value here too. The architecture of machine-readable governance architecture enables nations, institutions, and people to set up and participate in systems that directly address their problems without having to transfer power to unnecessary intermediaries; power, instead, remains with the existing governing bodies. </p>
<p>This, we believe, makes the system more trustworthy, as we don’t need another layer of bureaucracy to ensure that we can trust the third-party trust registry from enacting tolls, excluding participants, or exercising monopolistic power.</p>
<p>We also believe it is a mistake to think that governments are going to show up and submit to governance institutions and frameworks that are not of their making or under their control. Similarly, any decentralized identity solution that posits, “first, we create a league of nations,” isn’t just doomed, it actively dissuades people from taking the technology seriously because it makes unrealistic government participation a prerequisite for the technology.</p>
<blockquote>
 Futureware is a vampire that will suck the life out of opportunity 
</blockquote>
<p>No matter how well-meaning, governance recommendations that require implementing technology or standards that aren’t presently available — and may not be available for months or years — are acts of marketing self-sabotage. There must be a path to immediate implementation. It is vitally important that this path does not foreclose better solutions in the future, but there must be a path.</p>
<p>We understand the fear of institutionalizing the wrong software solution and then being stuck with applying band-aids for years. This is, after all, what landed us with the problem decentralized identity is designed to solve — the internet’s missing identity layer for people. But the benefit of open-source software development is that it promises continuous improvement.</p>
<p>If we deliver a good open-source solution today — in the face of many terrible centralized and federated alternatives — it will keep evolving as technology improves.</p>
<blockquote>
 &nbsp;Ockam’s Decentralized Razor 
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, for all those in the decentralized identity field, we should remember the value of parsimony, famously attributed to themedieval philosopher William of Ockham: Do not multiply entities beyond necessity. In other words, don’t create rules and processes and bureaucracies without established and compelling reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>The aim of decentralized identity governance should be the greatest number of applications from the smallest number of rules and in the shortest possible number of pages. Confusion and complexity will block adoption. </p>
<p>Consider what scientists discovered about effective communication to policymakers: If you can’t explain the science in a half page, chances are you’ll lose the attention of those with the power to implement change.</p>

<p>In response to many questions about Holochain’s fitness for Web3, and in the face of growing criticisms of Web3, my colleagues and I share why we think Holochain is capable of building Web3. Not Web3 as it exists today — centralised, expensive, and finance-oriented — but a truly people-powered web built with distributed ledger tech that isn’t blockchain-based.</p><p>What are people saying about Web3? Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1473165434518224896">can’t seem to find evidence of it</a>. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey says it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098">not what it appears to be</a>. But I think the <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">sharpest critique</a> comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/moxie">Moxie Marlinspike</a>. As co-creator of the Signal protocol that protects the privacy of <a href="https://www.signal.org/">most</a> <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">of</a> our <a href="https://matrix.org/">online</a> <a href="https://messages.google.com/">conversations</a>, he knows something about cryptography, but he isn’t too excited about ‘crypto’.</p><p>Moxie’s definition of Web3 is simple: it’s the class of technologies that wants to offer the features of Web2 — services that let us easily connect, create, interact — with the decentralised freedom that we enjoyed with Web1.</p><p>To most people, Web3 means blockchain. Moxie exposes some fairly serious challenges that blockchain faces — not just its ability to handle real-world applications, but also whether people even care about the problems it’s trying to solve.</p><p>When my colleagues and I read the article, we got excited. Moxie seemed to be making the <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae">same</a> <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/perspectives-on-blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies-7ef391605bd1">diagnoses</a> <a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/cryptocurrencies-are-dead-d4223154d783">we’ve</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/decentralized-next-level-collaboration-apps-with-syn/#back-story-agent-centric-data-enables-collaboration">made</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">for</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/satoshi-nakamoto-and-the-fate-of-our-planet-2/">years</a>. We also realised — hey, Holochain addresses a lot of the problems he’s talking about! I’d like this article to be an invitation to a larger conversation both with him and the broader ‘Web3 world’.</p> A short history of tangled webs <p>True to the original spirit of the internet, Web1 was all about decentralisation. Its big innovation was the hyperlink, allowing any author to connect their work to someone else’s without permission. And because anyone could create web pages and run a server (if they had the technical skills), anyone could be a publisher.</p><p>Slowly and then suddenly, everyone wanted to join the web party — but not everybody had the technical skills. So Web2 built big servers and easy-to-use software, then invited the whole world. It spread out a generous banquet, offering the power to create not just documents and links but conversations, calendars, photos, videos, music, lists, diagrams, and more. And by getting us all together in the same room, it really did become a party — an explosion in our capacity to connect and interact with each other.</p><p>However, we know how the story has unfolded since then. Web2 looked like a good idea at the time, but it’s turned out to have a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/opinion/facebook-privacy.html">dark side</a>. We appear to have become ‘<a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/">the</a> <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/">product</a>’, as they say, not the authors of our own lives as we’d thought.</p><p>The centralisation that enabled the capture of our online lives is inherent in the design of HTTP, the protocol that powers the web. Over the years, more and more people have called for a re-decentralisation — a new web, a ‘Web3’ that avoids the mistakes of the original web by design.</p><p>Why do we need to reimagine the web? If the first web was already decentralised, why can’t we just go back to it? Moxie argues that the reason is simple: “people don’t want to run their own servers, and never will.”</p><p>Is this true? The 3000+ HoloPort owners worldwide would seem to disagree. But I think Moxie is really saying that people just want to get down to the business of doing what they want to do, not managing a bunch of tech. For most of us, the computer is just a tool, not a hobby.</p> Real reasons people don’t want to go back to Web1 and run their own servers   Setup cost: You need a domain name and a stable IP address, which are either complicated or expensive.  Technical burden: Generally, server management is extremely complicated, and getting more so every day.  Security issues: Running web server and application software can expose your machine and network to security vulnerabilities.  Fragility: You’re the sole authority for your little piece of the web, so you bear the consequences if your server suddenly gets popular — or goes offline.  Isolation: Your server is just that — yours, and yours only. The power of Web2 is that it brings everybody together in a shared space. Does anybody want to give that up?  <p>Blockchain simply doesn’t have an answer to most of these challenges. And it doesn’t need to — blockchain wasn’t designed to be the basis for Web3. It was designed to record events, particularly changes of ownership on a bunch of crypto tokens.</p><p>At best, problem #3 (security issues) is solved by the fact that blockchains ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandbox</a>’ their running code. Problems #4 (fragility) and #5 (isolation) are irrelevant, but only because everybody has to store everybody else’s stuff anyway. Here we see a new problem — “everybody else’s stuff” is a lot of stuff, so it becomes <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html">too costly</a> for all but the biggest players to run their own blockchain server.</p><p>Sounds like centralisation all over again. And Moxie describes how that’s playing out in reality — centralised, unaccountable gateways are now our windows into the supposedly decentralised ledger.</p><p>On top of that, the high operating cost puts a price tag on every online activity, which means that most Web3 applications justify the cost by being financially-oriented — currency trading, investment derivatives, property speculation, gambling, and ‘play-to-earn’ games. Moxie suggests that this is why the world is actually so excited about Web3. It’s about the money, not the decentralisation.</p> Holochain is fit for the real Web3 <p>What if you could get the benefits of decentralisation for free while you used your normal, everyday apps and services? Well, Holochain can help — it neatly addresses all five barriers to running your own server. Here’s how.</p>  Setup cost: In a Holochain app people connect securely, privately, and directly to each other’s computers, either via public IP addresses or through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT">relay</a> service. Holochain creates an ‘overlay’ on top of the underlying network, making fixed IP addresses and domain names unimportant.  Technical burden: You don’t need to care or even know you’re running a personal ‘server’. It’s just a background process that’s built into the app, running on your computer with no configuration required. Really, it’s easy to set up, and it’ll get even easier in the future — you should <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/">give it a try</a>!  Security issues: Holochain has a strictly defined network protocol that validates every interaction with your peers. It also sandboxes the back-end of every application, preventing it from gaining direct access to your filesystem and network.  Fragility: You’re responsible for the original copy of your data, along with a small slice of everyone else’s data — and only for the applications you use. If you go offline, other people serve your data for you. Everyone shares the load evenly — with a Twitter-like app, we predict that you’d only accumulate 20 MB of data per year, equivalent to three photos or five seconds of video.  Isolation: Holochain is intended to deliver apps with the decentralisation of Web1 and the connectedness of Web2. Each application has its own shared database that every participant can read from and write to. In other words, you and your peers are each other’s ‘Web2’ — not an organisation that sees you as the product.  <p>There are still a couple centralisation points — the aforementioned proxy relay and a service called a ‘bootstrap’ are both hosted on remote servers. But they are about as irrelevant as Signal’s own servers are — they’re just places for peers to find each other and pass encrypted messages back and forth. Besides, you can always run your own, and you <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/683">don’t even need them</a> if you and your peers are in the same local network.</p> Shared protocols, evolution, and innovation <p>There’s one more downside of running your own web server: it’s hard to get everyone speaking the same ‘language’. It wasn’t such a big deal back in the Web1 days when the only language was ‘documents and links’. But as we started using the web for mass-scale, real-time interaction, it became important. We needed to make sure we were all speaking the same ‘tasks and meeting invites’ language as our colleagues, the same ‘posts and likes’ language as our friends and relatives, the same ‘money transfers’ language as the stores we shopped at.</p><p>Web2 platforms give us these shared languages — let’s call them ‘application protocols’ — as well as a central place to route every interaction through. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">Attempts</a> to decentralise this have only been moderately successful.</p><p>Moxie argues that protocols evolve slowly, while platforms evolve quickly. That’s because a platform can make decisions without waiting for a whole crowd of others to reach consensus. But here’s the thing — some protocols don’t need to evolve quickly. As long as a ‘base protocol’ is versatile enough to let people create and express things in an unlimited range of fit-for-purpose application protocols, it can be as stale and boring as it likes. And it’s precisely the decentralisation, versatility, and stability of these base protocols — HTTP, email, and yes, Bitcoin and Ethereum — that allow platforms to innovate so quickly on top of them.</p><p>It’s true, though, that an application’s evolution can slow down if you try to decentralise it. So what will it take to enjoy the benefit of rapid innovation while maintaining healthy decentralisation?</p>  Users must be able to painlessly upgrade to a new application protocol across the entire network when they need to.  Users must have choice over the versions of the application protocols they use — in other words, a group must be empowered to make its own governance decisions.  <p>Holochain does all that! Its base protocol is versatile enough to build any sort of interactions people want to do online: social media, team productivity, currencies, carbon credits, micro energy grids, and so on. These are regular, real-world applications, not just applications that “[move] all aspects of life into an instrumented economy” as Moxie describes it. For these application protocols, we’ll soon be adding the ability for users to automatically download and activate an update — no manual steps needed.</p><p>Additionally, in contrast to Web2, where everyone is forced into the same experience, a Holochain application can give groups a choice about whether to accept protocol changes, while also being able to keep all their existing data. For instance, if a chat app releases an upgrade, one team in a company can upgrade because they want the new features, while another team in the same company can stay on the old version because they prefer the UI. They run the app; it’s their choice.</p> Empowering everyone <p>That only leaves one problem: how can we, as users of an app, be part of the design of the apps we use? How do we choose the rules that govern our interactions, gain a stake in the design of the protocols our apps speak? Moxie suggests that this might be the thing worth working on if we want to change our relationship to technology.</p><p>We see a lot of promise in ideas like <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/">end-user programming</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/01/07/what-is-low-code-development/?sh=76ddde41496d">low-code development</a>. Done right, they will empower people to create their own apps.</p><p>We also see an <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/reusable-modules/introduction/motivation/">encouraging trend</a> in the Holochain development community. Small, composable components are being developed, with the intention that beginning developers can reuse them easily without having to become experts in Holochain application design.</p><p>And projects like Neighbourhoods’ <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/low-code-marketplace.html">low code marketplace</a> are another important step in that direction. It aims to offer a place where developers can offer generic, customisable parts that users can connect like Lego blocks into applications that suit their needs, without requiring any programming knowledge at all.</p><p>Finally, the developers behind <a href="https://youtu.be/6ZiUekVAg3A">Generative Objects</a>, a low-code development tool, are working on adding Holochain support so that people can create their own applications from scratch, again without a line of code.</p><p>But we believe that digital tools are useful for more than just everyday apps, as important as they are. Traditional modes of governance are <a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/the-future-of-governance-is-not-governments-9c894e17b1cd">failing us left and right</a>. We intend to help spark a Precambrian explosion of innovation in collective governance patterns. This requires an upgrade of humanity’s ability to create, express, and practice those patterns together. And we think that a software toolkit like <a href="https://holochain.org/">Holochain</a> will be a crucial part of making that happen.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Phillip Messerschmidt</a></p><p>As advisors, we at KuppingerCole Analysts have regular contact with our customers. The topics discussed range from strategic directions to operational challenges in different IT security and IAM topics. We often encounter similar, ambitious questions and challenges - an example from the Zero Trust environment: How can we implement Zero Trust? What do we need to do in order to have implemented the Zero Trust initiative to a large extent by the end of the year? This attitude is not limited to Zero Trust, but can be found in almost all subject areas.</p>
<p>Even if the ambitions behind it are respectable, it is nevertheless always equally concerning how often buzzwords are chased without understanding their substance and creating the appropriate basis. Let's stay with some Zero Trust examples: Does device management exist? Are all identities that want access known and recorded? How is the zoning of the networks done? It is not uncommon to get questioning faces in reaction to these questions.<br><br></p>
<p>The realization of trend themes often requires operational excellence</p>
<p>In the resulting discussion of the experiences listed above, it often turns out that the customer has not yet dealt with the topic well enough. In fact, this is not a problem, because it is our task to sensitize our customers accordingly and to provide them with the necessary knowledge. Nevertheless, organizational, functional, and technical weaknesses are uncovered in this process. Customers have discussions with us about Cloud Identity and Access Management with third party involvement, but they have not yet managed to execute an end-to-end joiner-mover-leaver-process for internal employees without any media discontinuity and without manual activities. Another example is application onboarding, which is often planned without a list of all applications and their responsibilities. Such circumstances make it not only significantly more difficult but also more dangerous, as sensitive information can be exposed. Therefore, the realization of trend topics often requires that companies have operational excellence or at least a high level of maturity in the corresponding areas.<br><br></p>
<p>Automation is the operationalization of formulated structures and rules.</p>
<p>When designing their IT landscape, many companies claim to be individual and special. However, this attitude does not stand in the way of successful automation to increase overall efficiency. Regardless of the degree of individuality of a company, decisions are always made according to certain rules and contexts in both manual and technology supported implementations. As soon as a context can be captured by a rule, it can be operationalized and automated. Technically, nothing stands in the way of such automation!<br><br></p>
<p>Use case: Policy based access control (PBAC)</p>
<p>A classic example of automation in the IAM environment, is the move to Policy Based Access Control (PBAC). Historically, many applications that were previously hosted on-premises were managed locally by an administrator. This type of access management is typically very costly, difficult to keep track of, and prone to error or manipulation. In line with the complexity and workload, departments were also made accountable and empowered to manage themselves via a Role based access control (RBAC) approach. The delegation relieved the administrators, but only shifted the workload and further increased the complexity. To relieve complexity, attribute-based access control (ABAC) is used to assign access rights based on functional decisions, which are based on attributes of identities, in an automated way. This is the first step towards automation!</p>
<p>Rapid digitalization has made it increasingly easy for companies to obtain more information and data about users. User Behavior Analytics (UBA) are capturing more and more processable context about users that can be used in automation. Location and time of a login, device of access, destination of the request can all be captured, processed, interpreted and used to make an informed and rule-based decision. If this decision is mapped technically, a policy is created to control access (PBAC). Operationalizing and organizing these policies not only dramatically increases efficiency, transparency and agility, but also sustainably reduces costs and risks.<br><br></p>
<p>Identity &amp; Process Automation: Where and How to Find Efficiencies?</p>
<p>If we return to the initial question, the answer is relatively simple and yet difficult to grasp: Automation potential can be found everywhere!</p>
<p>The challenge is often to identify and formulate the implicitly applicable rules that may already exist and have applied for a long time. The actual automation of a formulated rule is then usually the smaller step.</p>

  <p>11ty is a fantastic tool for quickly creating static sites using a variety of templating languages. 11ty makes designing and developing static sites simple. It supports HTML, Markdown, JavaScript, Nunjucks, Handlebars, and many other template styles, along with built-in support for layouts, pagination, and slugify. 11ty aims to compete against other frameworks such as Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, Gatsby, and Nuxt. The framework is indeed as simple and powerful as its creators claim.</p>

<p>This tutorial will teach how to secure your 11ty site using Okta. 11ty will produce static pages, which means you won’t have the luxury of servers and states to help manage your authentication. But Okta still has a solution for this. To authenticate users, you will use the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget/">Okta Sign-In Widget</a>. Then you will store the <code>id token</code> returned from the Okta authentication server. You can then use that <code>id token</code> to query Okta’s servers for many operations, including <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#introspect">verifying if the token is valid</a> or obtaining user information.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js 10 or newer</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
 

 Create your Okta application 

<p>Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8080/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/vue/create-okta-application/">Create a Vue App</a> for more information.</p>



 Create your 11ty site 

<p>If you wish to follow along using the completed project you can <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-website-eleventy-example">check out the GitHub repository here</a>.</p>

<p>The first step is to create your 11ty site. Create your project directory.</p>

   <code>mkdir okta-website-eleventy-example
cd okta-website-eleventy-example
</code>   

<p>Next, create your node application and install 11ty.</p>

   <code>npm init -y
npm install --save-dev @11ty/eleventy@1.0.0
</code>   

<p>At this point, your 11ty site is ready to run. You can test it out by adding a new page.</p>

   <code>echo '&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Page title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;' &gt; index.html
</code>   

<p>Enter the following command to start 11ty:</p>

   <code>npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
</code>   

<p>By default, 11ty will attempt to use port <code>8080</code> on localhost, so navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, and you can see your Hello World page.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you are using Windows, you will need to open the index file you just created and resave it with <code>UTF-8</code> encoding, as 11ty uses <code>UTF-16 LE</code> by default.</p>

 Add a couple of static pages 

<p>Now you can add some content to your site. Your site will consist of the following pages:</p>

 
   An index page to greet users (<code>index.html</code>) 
   A login page (<code>login.html</code>) 
   A readme to demonstrate the usage of markdown (<code>README.md</code>) 
   A page that is under authentication (<code>protected.html</code>) 
 

<p>First, open the <code>index.html</code> file you just created and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>---
layout: _layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js
---

&lt;div class="row align-items-md-stretch"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
        &lt;div class="h-100 p-5 text-white bg-secondary rounded-3"&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Using Okta with 11ty&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A small tutorial on writing static sites with 
                &lt;a class="text-dark" href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank"&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt;, 
                secured by &lt;a class="text-dark" href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt;
                written by &lt;a class="text-dark" href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Nik Fisher.&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;a class="btn btn-outline-light" role="button" href="Login"&gt;Login Now&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;a class="btn btn-light" role="button" href="README"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>You will notice the <code>layout</code> variable at the top of the file. You have not added this file to your project yet and will need to do that. But you can assign the layout page to this file, so you don’t have to add it later.</p>

<p>Next, create a file for <code>login.html</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>---
layout: _layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js
---

&lt;div id="okta-login-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  oktaSignIn.authClient.token.getUserInfo().then(function(user) {
    window.location='/protected';
  },function(error) {
    oktaSignIn.showSignInToGetTokens({
      el: '#okta-login-container'
    }).then(function(tokens) {
      oktaSignIn.authClient.tokenManager.setTokens(tokens);
      oktaSignIn.remove();
      window.location='/protected';
    }).catch(function(err) {
      console.error(err);
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>The only HTML in this page here is a <code>div</code> with <code>id="okta-login-container"</code>. You call the <code>OktaSignIn</code> features and display the login screen to the user with the JavaScript code on this page. Okta will create the login form and handle the actual authentication. All you need to do is call the <code>showSignInToGetTokens</code> method and handle the promise to set the token using the <code>tokenManager</code>. Once you have done that, you will redirect the user to the <code>protected</code> page.</p>

<p>You can add the <code>protected.html</code> page now. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>---
layout: _layout_authenticated.11ty.js
---

&lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    function loadPage(){
        //replace with API call 
        document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = "&lt;h2&gt;Congrats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h5&gt;You've reached a protected page&lt;/h5&gt;"
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>Since you haven’t seen the <code>_layout_authenticated.11ty.js</code> page yet, this will need some explanation. After verifying that the user has authenticated, the <code>loadPage</code> function is called by the layout.</p>

<p>There’s a comment to replace the code here with an API call. You can add an API call to verify the ID token on the server-side before displaying any content to the user.</p>

<p>Finally, add a page for <code>README.md</code> and add the following markdown to it.</p>

   <code>---
layout: _layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js
---

# Okta Eleventy website example

This repository shows you how to use Okta on a static site built with 11ty.

**Prerequisites:**

- [Node.js 10 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)
</code>   

<p>The <code>README.md</code>you’ve just added is a truncated version of the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-website-eleventy-example/blob/master/README.md">README file</a> that you can see in the GitHub repository for this project.</p>

 Add layout pages 

<p>It’s now time to add the layout pages for your static files. 11ty enables you to write layouts in several templating languages. For this project, you will use the stock <code>11ty.js</code> format. Create a new folder called <code>_includes</code> using the command <code>mkdir _includes</code>.</p>

<p>Add a file called <code>_layout_base.11ty.js</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>exports.data = {

};

exports.render = function (data) {
  return `&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
        integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
        integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p"
        crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/5.14.1/js/okta-sign-in.min.js"
        type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;link href="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/5.14.1/css/okta-sign-in.min.css" type="text/css"
        rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;${data.title}&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        const oktaSignIn=new OktaSignIn({
            baseUrl: "https://{{yourOktaDomain}}",
            redirectUri: 'http://localhost:8080/callback',
            clientId: "{{yourClientId}}",
            authParams: {
                issuer: "https://{{yourOktaDomain}}/oauth2/default"
            }
        });     
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        ${data.content}
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;`;
};
</code>   

<p>Be sure to replace the placeholder variables with your actual Okta information.</p>

<p>This file will be the base layout for all of your pages.  It loads <code>bootstrap</code> into all of your pages and also initializes the <code>OktaSignIn</code> widget on each page.  In this way, you can access it in the JavaScript of your file no matter where you are.</p>

<p>Next, add a file for <code>_layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js</code> and then add the following code.</p>

   <code>exports.data = {
  title: "11ty And Okta",
  layout:  "_layout_base.11ty.js"
};

exports.render = function (data) {
  return `
     &lt;header class="d-flex flex-wrap align-items-center justify-content-center justify-content-md-between py-3 mb-4 border-bottom"&gt;
      &lt;a href="/" class="d-flex align-items-center col-md-3 mb-2 mb-md-0 text-dark text-decoration-none"&gt;
       Home
      &lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;div class="col-md-3 text-end"&gt;
        &lt;button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary me-2"&gt;&lt;a href="Login"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;

    ${data.content}
        
        `;
};
</code>   

<p>This file extends the base layout you created by creating a header with a <code>Home</code> button and a <code>Login</code> button that will direct the user to the <code>Login</code> page with your Okta sign-in widget.</p>

<p>Finally, add a new file called <code>_layout_authenticated.11ty.js</code>. Then, add the following code.</p>

   <code>exports.data = {
title: "11ty And Okta",
layout: "_layout_base.11ty.js",
};

exports.render = function (data) {
return `

&lt;header
    class="d-flex flex-wrap align-items-center justify-content-center justify-content-md-between py-3 mb-4 border-bottom"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/" class="d-flex align-items-center col-md-3 mb-2 mb-md-0 text-dark text-decoration-none"&gt;
        Home
    &lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;div class="col-md-3 text-end"&gt;
        &lt;button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary me-2" onclick='logout()'&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

${data.content}

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    function logout() {
        oktaSignIn.authClient.signOut();
        location.reload();
    }

    if(!oktaSignIn?.authClient?.token) {
        window.location='/Login';
    }

    oktaSignIn.authClient.token.getUserInfo().then(function(user) {
        if(loadPage) {
            loadPage();
        }
    }).catch(function(e) {
        console.log(e);
        window.location='/Login'
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
`;
};
</code>   

<p>Again, this file will extend the base layout, while adding some additional functionality to each page that uses this layout. When the page loads, it will attempt to contact the Okta authorization server for information about the user with the ID token stored in the browser. If the contact request is successful, it will call the <code>loadPage</code> function implemented in those pages. Otherwise, the code redirects the user to the <code>Login</code> page. This page also contains a header with a <code>Logout</code> button and a method for <code>logout</code> that uses the sign-in widget to log the user out.</p>

 Start your 11ty website 

<p>If you are still running the site, then 11ty will have hot reloaded the site, and you should see the home page. If not, run the following command:</p>

   <code>npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
</code>   

<p>The command will build your templates into static pages and then serve the site on <code>localhost:8080</code>. Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to see the home page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click the login button to see the Okta Sign-In Widget in action. You can log in with your Okta credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If everything goes well, you should see the protected page.</p>

<p></p>

 Count Calories Better, Diet Healthier — Guide Of All What You Need To&nbsp;Know  The Dos and Don’ts of Counting&nbsp;Calories  Do: <p>When it comes to counting calories, there are a few dos that will help you stay on track and achieve your weight loss&nbsp;goals.</p>  Use a <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator/">diet calories calculator</a> app or website to track your intake. This will ensure accuracy and make it easier to stay on&nbsp;track.  Read the nutrition labels of all foods you eat. This will help you know how many calories are in each&nbsp;serving.  Create a calorie budget for yourself, and try to stick to it. This will help you lose weight gradually and&nbsp;safely.  Do make sure to include all foods and beverages in your calorie count. This includes those pesky little extras like condiments and sugar-free beverages.  Do be honest with yourself about how many calories you need to lose weight. If you want to lose 1–2 pounds per week, then aim to consume 500–1000 fewer calories than you burn each&nbsp;day.  Do adjust your calorie intake as needed. If you hit a plateau or if you start gaining weight, then adjust your calorie intake accordingly. A good rule of thumb is to reduce your intake by 100–200 calories per day until you start seeing results&nbsp;again.  Do focus on healthy foods that are low in calories but high in nutrients. This will help ensure that you are getting the most out of your diet while still losing weight. Some great options include vegetables, fruits, lean protein, and whole&nbsp;grains.”  <p>Check also: <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/benefits-of-red-beans/">Red bean&nbsp;benefits</a></p> Don’t: <p>If you’re trying to lose weight, counting calories is a great way to do it. But there are a few things you should avoid if you want to see results. Here are four don’ts of counting calories:</p>  Count calories without also considering other factors such as protein, carbohydrates, and fat. All of these nutrients play important roles in your health and should be taken into account when counting calories.  Skip meals or go too long between meals. This can cause you to become ravenous and overeat later&nbsp;on.  Obsess over every little calorie that you consume. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and obsessing over every calorie will only lead to stress and unhealthy eating&nbsp;habits.  Don’t forget about fiber. Fiber is another important nutrient, and it’s especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough fiber each day to help keep you full and support your weight loss&nbsp;goals  Don’t forget about carbs. Carbs are also an important part of a healthy diet, and they’re especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough carbs each day to help burn fat and fuel your workouts.  Don’t forget about protein. Protein is an important part of a healthy diet, and it’s especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough protein each day to help burn fat and build&nbsp;muscle.  Don’t overdo it. It’s important not to eat too few calories, as this can actually slow down your metabolism and make it more difficult to lose weight. Try to find the right balance for you, and don’t cut more than 500–750 calories per&nbsp;day.   The Pros and Cons of Calorie&nbsp;Counting <p>Calorie counting is a popular way to keep track of the number of calories you eat each&nbsp;day.</p><p>This can be an effective way to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. However, there are some pros and cons to calorie counting. The Pros of Calorie&nbsp;Counting</p>  You are in control of your food choices. When you are calorie counting, you are able to choose the foods that fit within your daily calorie budget. This can help you make healthier food choices and avoid unhealthy foods.  <p>2. It is an easy way to track progress. By keeping track of the number of calories you consume each day, you can see how your diet changes over time. This can be helpful in monitoring your progress and seeing if your current diet is working for&nbsp;you.</p><p>3. It helps you become more aware of portion sizes. Often when we don’t count calories, we tend to underestimate how much we are actually eating. Calorie counting can help teach you about proper portion sizes and how much food constitutes a serving&nbsp;size.</p><p>4. It may increase your metabolism&nbsp;. Some research has shown that people who calorie count may have a higher metabolic rate than those who do not count calories&nbsp;. This could lead to more successful weight loss in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>The Cons of Calorie&nbsp;Counting</p><p>1&nbsp;. It can be time consuming&nbsp;. Keeping track of every calorie that goes into your mouth can be a tedious process&nbsp;.</p><p>2&nbsp;. You may become obsessed with numbers&nbsp;. Focusing too much on numbers can lead to eating disorders and unhealthy relationships with food&nbsp;.</p><p>3&nbsp;. You might develop restrictive eating habits&nbsp;. Restricting yourself from certain foods can cause negative thoughts about food and body image&nbsp;issues</p> How to make Calorie counting effective   Make sure you’re accurately counting your calories. A lot of people make mistakes when counting, either by underestimating or overestimating the number of calories in their food. Use a calorie tracking app or website to get an accurate estimate of the calories in your&nbsp;meals.  <p>2. Don’t obsess over every little thing. If you eat a cookie or have a slice of pizza, don’t worry — just adjust your calorie intake for the rest of the day to make up for it. Trying to be perfect can be counterproductive and lead to feelings of guilt and frustration.</p><p>3. Find a method that works for you. Some people prefer to track their calories manually, while others find it more helpful to use an app or online calculator. Figure out what works best for you and stick with&nbsp;it.</p><p>4. Be patient. Losing weight takes time, so don’t expect results overnight. Stick with it for several weeks before deciding if calorie counting is right for&nbsp;you.</p><p>5. Make a list of foods that you enjoy and that are healthy. This will help you stay on track with your diet and make it more enjoyable.</p><p>6. Try to stick to healthy, nutrient-rich foods as much as possible. This will help you meet your nutritional needs while keeping your calorie intake in&nbsp;check.</p><p>7. Avoid processed foods whenever possible. These tend to be high in unhealthy fats, sugars and sodium, which can sabotage your weight loss&nbsp;efforts.</p><p>8. Drink plenty of water and avoid sugary drinks. Water is essential for good health and helps keep you feeling full throughout the day. Sugary drinks are packed with empty calories and can quickly derail your diet&nbsp;plans.</p> conclusion <p>We do Counting Calories for three purposes:</p><p>If you’re trying to lose&nbsp;weight:</p><p>Counting calories is a great way to help achieve your goals. There are many online tools and apps that can help with&nbsp;this.</p><p>Second, make sure you’re burning more calories than you’re eating. This can be done through exercise and physical activity.</p><p>Finally, give yourself time. It may take a while for your body to adjust to your new calorie intake, so be patient and keep up with your healthy&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Check also: <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/best-parsley-tea-brands/">Best parsley tea&nbsp;bags</a></p><p>If you are looking to gain&nbsp;weight:</p><p>You need to consume more calories than you burn. The average person needs around 2,000–2,500 calories per day to maintain their weight, so if you want to gain weight, you’ll need to eat more than&nbsp;that.</p><p>It’s best to spread your extra calories throughout the day, with three main meals and a couple of snacks in between. You can use a calorie calculator to help you determine how many calories you should be eating each&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are looking to maintain&nbsp;weight:</p><p>By simply eat as much as you&nbsp;burn.</p>

<p>Buying a home in today’s market is challenging from start to finish for many consumers. Reduced supply, increased demand and competitive bidding wars riddle the path to homeownership. The struggle doesn’t end there, according to recent homebuyers who responded to Finicity’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/2021-mortgage-report/">2021 Mortgage Survey</a>, which is available now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many are still struggling with the decades-old headache of collecting mountains of paper documentation for underwriting. This antiquated holdover from a bygone era continues to add unnecessary stress and anxiety to processing, underwriting and closing a mortgage.</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of what borrowers are going through in this white-hot market, Finicity surveyed over 1,000 consumers who have purchased or refinanced a home in the last year and compiled the insights into <a href="https://www.finicity.com/2021-mortgage-report/">High Demand, Higher Hurdles in the Mortgage Market</a>, which details these pain points and provides a window into how the mortgage lending industry can evolve to meet the shifting needs of today’s homebuyers and refinancers.</p>
 Big Opportunities for Change in the Mortgage Process 
<p>Many consumers approach their home purchase with excitement and, understandably, a bit of trepidation. But while today’s homebuyer grits their way through a challenging shopping and bidding environment, any excitement can quickly turn to angst when they are met with a cumbersome and laborious mortgage loan process.</p>
<p>Refining the mortgage process means identifying and removing pain points for homebuyers. Our survey uncovered that 89% of borrowers believe the loan application experience was as stressful if not more than the home buying experience itself. Eliminating friction during the mortgage process is a critical step in building loyalty and meeting the expectations of today’s homebuyer.</p>
<p>Many homebuyers were surprised to learn that physical documents still make up a large portion of mortgage documentation. Seventy-two percent of respondents were surprised or very surprised at the volume of paper that’s still used during the mortgage process.&nbsp;</p>
 Going Digital Means Reduced Stress 
<p>The majority of today’s homebuyers are accustomed to navigating life digitally, and the mortgage experience should align with this.</p>
<p>Only 12% of respondents indicated that they were uncomfortable permissioning their personal financial data to a lender. Meeting consumers where they feel most comfortable helps save them time and reduces unnecessary stress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Borrowers who used digital verifications were less likely to say the loan process was the most stressful part of buying or refinancing a home, and 83% of respondents using digital verifications said their loan processing time was shorter than expected or met their expectations.</p>
 Embracing Change 
<p>For many industries, the COVID-19 pandemic has been the catalyst to transition to digital solutions. While the mortgage industry has started down this path as well, there is still work to be done. Reducing friction through digitization of manual loan documentation and minimizing the document-chasing between lender and borrower is a key component of this transformation.</p>
<p>Consumer-permissioned data delivered through our open banking platform allows for digital verifications throughout the mortgage process, significantly reducing the time it takes to close. In today’s mortgage landscape, this can mean the difference between consumers stepping into their dream home after a quick, seamless loan process, or losing out to a buyer who is using digital lending for a quick close.</p>
<p>The complete findings are now available in Finicity’s most recent mortgage survey, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/2021-mortgage-report/">High Demand, Higher Hurdles in the Mortgage Market</a>.</p>

 GiD Report#197 — How Solana makes web3&nbsp;possible <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-196-how-crypto-is-changing-the-central-banks-72586652b6d2">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  How Solana makes web3&nbsp;possible  Tweet of the week — It’s time to&nbsp;build  The U.S. approach to regulations and innovation in a&nbsp;nutshell  The IRS learns that people care about their identity frameworks — a&nbsp;lot  Stuff happens   1. How Solana makes web3&nbsp;possible Anatoly Yakovenko, Photo:&nbsp;Solana<p>The arrival of the SMTP protocol in 1981 — based on a proposal by Jon Postel — allowed people to directly communicate with each other via email. Later, the invention of Tim Berners-Lee’s world wide web in 1989 and corresponding protocol HTTP allowed people to access websites through a&nbsp;browser.</p><p>These developments from the early internet allowed people to easily share information.</p><p>Satoshi’s 2009 white paper on Bitcoin took that one step further — describing an elegant system combining cryptography, consensus mechanisms, and networked computers that would enable people to directly exchange value online without an intermediary for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>The next breakthrough would come in 2015 — the year Ethereum went live. Building on Satoshi’s core concepts, Vitalik Buterin conceived a system that enabled decentralized computation. Smart contracts are essentially programs or applications that run directly on the blockchain.</p><p>That framework would set the stage for use cases such as NFTs and DeFi, which came of age last&nbsp;year.</p><p>This concept of decentralized computation would plant the seeds for&nbsp;web3.</p><p>What if we could build an entire generation of decentralized applications on the blockchain?</p><p>Pioneers in the space immediately ran into roadblocks.</p><p>When Alameda Research and FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried assessed Ethereum as a platform for building a global, decentralized exchange, it was a nonstarter.</p><p>SBF — as he’s often referred to — earned his stripes at Jane Street Capital, one of the most storied prop shops on Wall Street. As such, the bar for their decentralized exchange was high. Coming from a world where high-frequency trading is the norm, your trades have to move as fast as information flows. Cost is also a major concern as fees directly eat away at your trading model. Scalability is&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>In other words, Ethereum’s technology was too slow and too expensive.</p><p>That’s where Solana came&nbsp;in.</p><p>As Peter Thiel described in his book, Zero to One, you’re not moving the needle unless your offering is an order of magnitude better than what came&nbsp;before.</p><p>A host of so-called “Ethereum Killers” had been floating around that were potentially better than Ethereum but objectively, not that much&nbsp;better.</p><p>Released in 2019, Solana was different. Co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko would incorporate learnings from his time as an engineer at Qualcomm working on cell networks into his development of the Solana blockchain.</p><p>The result is a blockchain that can process 50,000 transactions per second (tps) compared to Ethereum’s 15 tps for a fee that’s fractions of a penny. Given the massive growth in Ethereum’s ecosystem in recent years, computation fees can cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars during peak usage — something anyone who’s tried to mint a popular NFT drop on Ethereum intimately understands.</p><p>For SBF, Solana was fertile ground for developing his vision around decentralized finance.</p><p>Here’s Sam <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/yahoo-finance-live-nov-09-144954467.html">speaking at Yahoo Finance and Decrypt’s Crypto Goes Mainstream back in November</a>:</p><blockquote>“Solana is one of the few currently existing public blockchains that has a really plausible road map to scale millions of transactions per second at, you know, fractions of a penny per transaction, which is a scale that you need for&nbsp;this.”</blockquote><blockquote>“That is not where a lot of other blockchains have been focusing, including ethereum.”</blockquote><p>For the industry at large, Solana’s throughput and cost profile has taken decentralized computing from zero to one, paving a path forward where web3 is a legitimate reality.</p><p>Naturally, developers have followed suit — including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who announced last fall that he would <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/reddit-cofounder-ohanian-invests-100-million-social-media-solana-blockchain-2021-11">invest $100 million in decentralized social media projects built on&nbsp;Solana</a>:</p><p>Today, much of the NFT and DeFi ecosystem lives on Ethereum, but what we’re seeing in the market is the product of the last few&nbsp;years.</p><p>If Github commits are any indication, much of the next generation stuff — what will emerge in the market in this next cycle — will likely live on&nbsp;Solana.</p><p>The rise of Solana’s futures and derivatives markets also suggests growing institutional participation:</p><p>Solana is not without its issues. With development only starting in 2017, the network is still going through growing pains given its explosive growth.</p><p>In a rocky start to the year, the blockchain <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/01/25/solana-founder-anatoly-yakovenko-crypto-crash-blockchain-instability/">suffered 6 outages in January alone</a>. There’s clearly plenty more work to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Competition is also heating up as other next generation chains vy for market share including Avalanche, which offers its own scalability promises.</p><p>For end users, that can only be a good&nbsp;thing.</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about Solana, you can check out this <a href="https://twoprime.io/is-solana-the-next-institutional-crypto-investment/">report published last week by Two Prime</a> (via /gregkidd).</p><p>It’s where we got these nifty charts&nbsp;from.</p><p>You can also check out <a href="https://youtu.be/wx6ZvC91n4Y">Greg’s conversation with Anatoly from our YouTube channel here</a>.

Tweet of the week — It’s time to&nbsp;build <p>The stock market — with crypto in tow — is having a rocky start to 2022, apparently the worst&nbsp;ever.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/stock-market-2022-worst-start-year-ever-73c15533-b443-4290-8693-c215df7a44ab.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>State of play: As of the end of trading yesterday — the 16th session of the year — 2022 is now, officially, the worst-ever start in the history of the S&amp;P 500, according to data from Ned Davis Research, a stock market research&nbsp;shop.</blockquote><p>The silver lining?

The firms are able to pay customers rates higher than most bank savings accounts by lending out their digital coins to other investors, a practice that the SEC and states including New Jersey and Texas have said raises concerns about investor protection.</blockquote><p>Here’s also what happened — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-27/you-get-the-crypto-rules-you-want">Matt&nbsp;Levine</a>:</p><blockquote>The other story is about&nbsp;… well, see, there’s a billion-dollar Ponzicoin called Wonderland, 1 which as of about 11 a.m. today was advertising an annual percentage yield on staked deposits of EIGHTY-THREE THOUSAND, SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY-SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT (83,687.5%), and it is in the news today because one of the pseudonymous people running its treasury is allegedly a famous convicted serial scammer who previously co-founded Quadriga CX, which was the biggest Canadian crypto exchange before it collapsed in an exit scam in which the other co-founder apparently stole most of the money and may or may not have faked his&nbsp;death.</blockquote><p>And here’s Matt Levine aptly summarizing the current state of affairs when it comes to crypto regulation in the U.S. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-27/you-get-the-crypto-rules-you-want">his Money Stuff newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Man, come on. Read that sentence. If you were an SEC enforcement lawyer and you had the choice of (1) calling up the “revolution needs rules” guys to tell them that under SEC precedents interest-bearing crypto accounts paying 8.05% have to be registered as securities or (2) looking into the very popular billion-dollar Ponzicoin run by an exit scammer that is offering an 83,000% APY to U.S. investors&nbsp;… just&nbsp;… what are we doing&nbsp;here?</blockquote><blockquote>What is the difference between Gemini and Wonderland? I think two critical differences are:</blockquote>  Wonderland is hilariously riskier and less compliant than Gemini in every&nbsp;respect.  Gemini answers the phone when the SEC&nbsp;calls.  <blockquote>There is a certain drunk-under-the-lamppost element to current U.S. crypto regulation. If you incorporate a company in the U.S. and walk into the SEC’s office and ask “hey what are we allowed to do,” the answer is “almost nothing.” If you just launch the wildest thing in the world pseudonymously, call it “decentralized,” and advertise eye-popping investment returns to U.S. investors, then, I mean, I don’t want to give you legal advice, but look&nbsp;around.</blockquote><p>As Matt points out, it’s also why Facebook/Meta’s crypto project failed to&nbsp;launch:</p><blockquote>Or we talked yesterday about stablecoins. Specifically we talked about the fact that Facebook Inc. (now Meta Platforms Inc.) announced in 2019 with enormous fanfare that it was going to launch a stablecoin and work closely with all of the relevant regulators blah blah blah, and it went to the Federal Reserve and said “what do we need to do to launch a stablecoin,” and the Fed said “you must bring me the egg of a dragon and the tears of a unicorn,” and now the Facebook stablecoin is shutting down. One of the largest companies in the world devoted millions of dollars to figuring out how to launch a stablecoin and concluded that it was impossible. It is demonstrably not impossible! Tether did it! Tether has a hugely successful stablecoin! Tether does not care at all about working closely with all of the relevant regulators! That’s&nbsp;why!</blockquote><p>So there you have it, the U.S. approach to regulation and innovation in a nutshell.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-26/crypto-lending-firms-celsius-network-gemini-face-sec-scrutiny">Crypto Lending Firms Celsius Network, Gemini Face SEC&nbsp;Scrutiny</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-27/you-get-the-crypto-rules-you-want">You Get the Crypto Rules You&nbsp;Want</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb </a>— <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/zuckerberg-s-stablecoin-ambitions-unravel-with-diem-sale-talks">Mark Zuckerberg’s Stablecoin Ambitions Unravel With Diem Sale&nbsp;Talks</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-27/crypto-s-cloak-of-anonymity-makes-defi-a-wonderland-for-felon">Crypto Secrecy Makes DeFi a Financial Felon’s Wonderland</a>   4. People care about their identity frameworks — a&nbsp;lot <p>People’s trust in institutions are at an all-time low. They’ve also become increasingly cognizant of and educated on what’s at stake with the ever-expanding digitization of their lives, accelerated by the pandemic.</p><p>And so what the IRS likely expected to be a lowkey update regarding new digital identity requirements has boiled over into a firestorm of controversy.</p><p>It started with <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/irs-will-soon-require-selfies-for-online-access/">a blog post by Brian&nbsp;Krebs</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-be2ba817-5ac9-4f10-a17b-53c32dc21747.html">a quick overview from&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>The IRS’ move to require some taxpayers to use facial recognition to identify themselves is reigniting a debate over how the government should use such technology.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Critics warn that, without sufficient guardrails, information collected by one agency for a seemingly benign purpose could easily be re-used in other&nbsp;ways.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: The IRS will soon require taxpayers to provide a third-party company — ID.me — with a combination of documents and a video selfie to verify their identity before undertaking certain online interactions with the&nbsp;agency.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>What they’re saying: “This announcement signals one of the largest expansions of facial recognition technology in the U.S. and there is no question that it will harm peoples’ privacy,” says Caitlin Seeley George, campaign director at Fight For the&nbsp;Future.</blockquote>  “This will essentially create a new, massive database for law enforcement to use to track people without their knowledge,” Seeley George&nbsp;said.  ID.me’s terms of service, she notes, give the company the right to share peoples’ data with police, government and “select partners.”  <p>And the latest — <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-a1ca9ca9-57da-4a9a-aa1f-cd601dd0b8ae.htm">Axios</a>,&nbsp;again:</p><blockquote>A growing number of civil rights groups are calling on the IRS to sever ties with ID.me over concerns about the company’s face recognition technology as well as its lack of transparency.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: A coalition of groups, including Fight For the Future, the Algorithmic Justice League and EPIC, have launched Dumpid.me, an online petition urging individuals to indicate their opposition to the agency using the private company’s video selfie-based technology to verify identity.</blockquote>  Meanwhile, as Bloomberg reported on Friday, the IRS is weighing alternatives to ID.me. “Treasury and the IRS are constantly in search of ways to improve taxpayers experience, and are looking into alternatives to ID.me,” the agency confirmed in a statement to&nbsp;Axios.  <blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Catch-up quick: The IRS plans to require taxpayers who want to do certain online transactions to use ID.me’s video selfie-based authentication system.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote>  Those concerns were exacerbated after revelations that ID.me compares selfies to a database of those who have previously used its service, despite previously denying using so-called one-to-many face recognition.  In an interview with Axios, [ID.me] CEO Blake Hall <a href="https://link.axios.com/click/26544683.7501/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXhpb3MuY29tL2lkbWUtY2VvLWFwb2xvZ2l6ZXMtbWlzc3RhdGVtZW50cy1pcnMtZmFjaWFsLXJlY29nbml0aW9uLTg4Y2UyZWUyLTlhZTktNDI2Yy1iNjllLWMwYjQyYWQ4MmY2MS5odG1sP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1uZXdzbGV0dGVyX2F4aW9zbG9naW4mc3RyZWFtPXRvcA/5873ef138cc2b2045d8b45dcB91b404ff">apologized</a> for misleading the public, but defended the practice as an important step in fighting&nbsp;fraud.  <p>To be clear, we’re not taking shots at ID.me here — or any identity service provider at&nbsp;that.</p><p>The big takeaway here is that people are wisening up to their individual needs when it comes to their digital identity, their data, and their privacy.

				  The Indicio TestNet is a robust platform that’s free to use for developers, making it the best way to dive into the powerful technology behind decentralized identity.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>The Indicio Network contains three networks: a MainNet for hosting solutions, a DemoNet for demonstrating products, and a TestNet for development and experimentation. We’ve made the TestNet free for developers to use — making it ideal for exploring, building, testing, and demonstrating your ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the open-source technology of Hyperledger Indy, Ursa, and Aries, the Indicio TestNet has a stable 100% uptime, is monitored by professional staff, and offers limited technical support (for greater technical support we offer a range of highly competitive plans).</p>
<p>Why Indicio?</p>
<p>There are several decentralized networks that offer some form of testing network. But here’s why the Indicio TestNet is the best option:</p>
 
 It’s free: The Indicio TestNet is and always will be free to use.&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
 
 It’s professionally staffed and monitored: We don’t rely on volunteers to keep our networks running — our networks are supported by engineers whose job is to ensure they are always stable and accessible.<br> 
 
<p></p>
 
 It’s stable: We understand the critical importance of network stability; the Indicio TestNet clocks at 100% uptime. 
 
<p></p>
 
 Tools are already set up for ease of use: We have a monitoring tool and a scanning tool already implemented; they can tell you which nodes are live and what has been recently written to the network at a glance. 
 
<p></p>
 
 Cross-network test ready: We see a future of interoperable credentials and networks. Our TestNet is ready to test your interoperability with other products from other networks. Issue and verify on multiple networks, explore the possibilities! 
 
<p></p>
 
 Straightforward governance: We believe in simple and streamlined governance with clear principles and rules. You’re here to build — not hear us philosophize! 
 
<p></p>
 
 Node Operator Program: For those that want to really dive into decentralized identity we offer the unique opportunity to host a node on the network. This will give you hands- on experience running part of the network as well as significantly more technical support. See the perks here: <a href="https://indicio.tech/node-operator-program/">https://indicio.tech/node-operator-program/</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
 
 Community resources: Because our network is based on open-source technology, we have a repository of additional resources we can point new users to for general information and assistance. This provides a more immediate place to seek help with your project in addition to the more hands on support offered by our technical team.&nbsp;

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p>Because the Identity Fabric describes a set of connected enabling IT components that work together as a single entity rather than a concrete tool, there are infinite possible implementations of an Identity Fabric. Decentralized identities offer compelling advantages for organizations to benefit from increased identity assurance levels, interact securely and with higher confidence with partners, suppliers, and other ecosystem members, and reduce the administrative load during onboarding or ongoing verification and/or validation of credentials. This guide supports organizations by showing how decentralized identity can fit into an Identity Fabric, exemplified in the KuppingerCole IAM Reference Architecture.

<p>While the ethos of cryptocurrency was partly driven by anonymity at its inception (see <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin White Paper</a>), mass adoption and subsequent fraudulent activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing conducted by both individuals and institutional investors forced legislators to fill the regulation void in cryptocurrency. Thus, cryptocurrency had to adapt to KYC regulations and implement such policies in order to screen properly their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance and Coinbase, both leaders in crypto trading worldwide now enforce strong KYC policies, in order to comply with main AML and KYC regulations. While registering in one of those platforms, a law-abiding cryptocurrency user is likely to provide a government-issued ID, comply to a photo identification through a selfie, as well as provide additional personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 However, some people are looking to beat KYC requirements for multiple reasons:&nbsp; 



<p>• Some users believe that identity verification goes against the ethos of cryptocurrency;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Other individuals may want to avoid sanctions, embargo, PEP or SDN lists screenings;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Illicit organizations looking to access crypto exchanges to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">launder money</a>;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Other users may just want to evade tax;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Finally, some of them are simply underage looking to trade cryptocurrencies although not legally allowed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the different reasons mentioned, some users may appeal to dubious methods in order to avoid <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC checks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>User behaviour to bypass KYC checks and identity verification may not only have serious consequences for crypto users, but rather also cause serious (regulatory) difficulties for crypto platform operators.&nbsp;</p>



 A strong regulatory risk in case of failing KYC procedures&nbsp; 



<p>While KYC processes prevent most users from signing in without proper screening, these restrictions created a business opportunity on black markets. Indeed, marketplaces on different dark webs (Tor network primarily) now offer vetted accounts on crypto exchanges and other payments services for a small amount of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For prices ranging from US $150 to $500, you can now buy an approved account on peer-to-peer trading platforms, professional crypto exchanges, or mainstream payment services. Those accounts are either provided with a fake name, address, and identification documents, or with genuine data obtained by any means.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an investigation from the specialized news outlet CoinDesk, sample accounts were purchased between US $170 and $250 and reviewed by a reporter. The accounts were on the exchanges Binance US, Coinbase Pro or Kraken, and payment services Cash App and Wirex. The analysis showed that most of them belonged to genuine United States and European Union citizens, and came along with instructions for VPN networks usage; however, it was also found that the credentials for email addresses were linked to the exchange account and Google Voice numbers. The latter appears to be a tool for fraudsters aiming to create fake accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They even adopted specific behavioral patterns, matching the geolocation of a victim, respecting transactions amounts, etc. Therefore, it is likely that a certain number of users are able to access crypto wallets on exchanges by using other individual’s accounts, thus evading KYC checks themselves. It must be taken into account that crypto exchange accounts are just a subset of the global black ID market. As reported by the <a href="https://resources.digitalshadows.com/whitepapers-and-reports/from-exposure-to-takeover">cyber consultancy firm Digital Shadows</a>, more than 15 billions of credentials would be for sale online, giving many opportunities for fraudsters to leverage data for illicit purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such activities may represent a major risk for cryptocurrency platforms and service providers, as regulators such as the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), already fined cryptocurrency exchanges like BitGo for apparent violations of multiple U.S. sanctions programs. Indeed, the platform had allowed – even though not knowingly – individuals from Syria, Iran, Sudan, Cuba and probably North Korea, to access and use its trading services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another platform exchange, BitPay, was forced to pay US$507,375 to settle its liability in a similar case. Finally, the crypto giant Coinbase may also face an investigation by OFAC, after having voluntarily disclosed alleged violations, in order to avoid major fines and sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, users who prefer to stay anonymous have other options such as peer-to-peer crypto marketplaces or Bitcoin ATMs, and do not always have to evade KYC checks. Indeed, peer-to-peer platforms enable transactions between private actors without having to disclose its identity. Thus, users would avoid to put themselves at risk, as their black market acquired account could be flagged by a platform as not genuine, consequently jeopardizing their assets.&nbsp;</p>



 KYC as a support for crypto market development&nbsp; 



<p>Although platforms are aware of black markets trading of verified accounts, it is possible to mitigate those risks by leveraging robust KYC processes. However, it must remain as simple as in any other financial services. In conjunction with threat intel teams deployed within major cryptocurrency companies, the robustness of KYC processes must be analysed and put to the test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although crypto enthusiasts might see KYC processes as a diminishing factor for adoption, Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao, known as “CZ” declared to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-16/binance-ceo-cz-zhao-advocates-for-fundamental-crypto-rights">Bloomberg</a> that implementing such rules had only little impact on his business. In fact, CZ declared that only 3% of its customers were lost after improving its KYC robustness: “we have chosen to go with full compliance, full mandatory KYC for global users, for every feature. We feel that being compliant will allow more users to use us. Most people do feel more comfortable using a licensed exchange. Most people – 97 per cent of users – go through KYC. We lose only 3 per cent of users.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using a layered approach and combining different identification methods, KYC processes can be drastically improved. While a simple selfie is not cutting it anymore to keep fraudsters at bay, other means such as video identification, in addition to collecting official documents may provide a more solid KYC approach for crypto actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Straightforward and rapid, this procedure must also be painless for the user, crafted in a user-friendly environment, to keep the onboarding experience intact. Automated systems with fast response time, powered by artificial intelligence and combined with screening mechanisms and geolocation checks, provide an unparalleled solution to mitigate risks brought by fraudsters trying to circumvent KYC processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respecting these conventions will allow exchanges to participate in the democratization of cryptocurrencies and mass adoption by non-initiated, along with deterring fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



 Cryptocurrency platforms must be aware of the risk of poor KYC mechanisms&nbsp; 



<p>KYC processes in crypto community are still fighting their way in, as adoption increases. Although it is possible to buy crypto without submitting to a KYC check, it is more complicated and a risky thing to do, conversely to using an exchange complying to KYC requirements. Regulations aside, KYC processes allow user confidence to grow, whether it is in the market, or in crypto exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an onboarding process, KYC can be transparent and painless without harming conversion rate, as many other fintechs and crypto exchanges have already proven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto actors evolving on the European market now have to comply with the European Union’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5)</a>. For this reason, it may be the best time for these platforms to re-think and enhance KYC and AML procedures (see our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Crypto KYC Page</a>), which will ultimately bring a benefit to both the users and the platform itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>London and Manchester, February 1st, 2022: Leading Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity proofing and verification, IDnow, has appointed a new Director of Customer Success to lead its global customer success programme.</p>
<p>Based in the UK, Doug Pollock has joined IDnow following several years in the identity verification sector where he held similar roles, all centred on developing best practice around managing enterprise clients. Doug’s immediate priorities will be on building up IDnow’s customer success programme to deliver increasingly efficient service levels as well as growing his team with the right talent to support organisational growth. He will also focus on the IDnow value proposition to ensure the company can demonstrate effective ROI to its customers.</p>
<p>With more than three decades’ experience in the tech sector, most recently spent in the identity verification space, Doug has worked across a range of sectors including e-commerce and banking systems.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, Doug said: “No matter what sector you are working in, as long as a business puts customers front and centre, then customer success should follow. Throughout my career, customers have always been at the forefront of my mind, and I look forward to bring that customer-first approach to IDnow.</p>
<p>“IDnow is already a European powerhouse in its field. Our next steps will be to expand beyond Europe and to build out our identity proofing platform with NFC-based identity methods and self-sovereign applications. It’s an incredibly exciting time to join IDnow as we continue to invest in growth and innovation.”</p>
<p>Co-founder and Chief Customer Officer at IDnow, Sebastian Bärhold, added: “We’re delighted that Doug has joined IDnow, bringing with him a wealth of knowledge around scaling international customer success and service organisations. I am sure that our customers and partners will benefit from his vast experience.</p>
<p>“This is an important time for us as a business and as we continue to grow, we must ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent service. Doug’s focus on putting the customer first will ensure we deliver highly efficient and exemplary service levels to our customers. His deep experience will guide our customers as they embark on or continue their identity proofing journey.”</p>
<p>Doug’s appointment marks the start of a major recruitment drive in the UK as the firm looks to meet the growing demands of businesses, often in highly regulated industries, seeking highly secure ways to verify customer identities. This follows its news last year which highlighted an eightfold growth in the UK compared to 2020 as more companies look to switch to fully digital customer onboarding processes. </p>

Community Growth &amp;&nbsp;Bounty   This month, DuMont, an outstanding Harbinger from our English community, published <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/staking-vs-candidate-node-ownership-9191bfbd5661">Staking vs Candidate Node Ownership</a>, which outlined the Ontology staking strategy for community members in great detail. The article answered questions like “How to participate in Ontology staking”, “How to launch a candidate node”, and more. Community members have expressed that they benefited a lot from the&nbsp;article.  This month, Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to join an AMA held by <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1481824177879273477?s=20">BingX</a>. He shared Ontology’s long-term efforts and future goals, with a focus on DID and data. He explained how users will be on-boarded into the Ontology experience for secure, self-sovereign control over their digital existence. Humpty also highlighted the Ontology 2022 Roadmap: From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not&nbsp;changed.  This month, the <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1484246853189193729?s=20">Ontology Community Call</a> on Discord and Telegram was held as usual, focusing on topics such as “EVM” and “Staking”. Ontology Harbinger Polaris, and Atherton Hoge discussed those issues with community members, sharing the latest development of Ontology EVM, the the upcoming Ontology EVM launch will help Ontology attract more decentralized applications, and be a key step to realize the rapid expansion of the Ontology ecosystem. About staking, they believed that it is necessary to pay more attention to the revenue distribution ratio of each&nbsp;node.  We held our Telegram Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about “ENS”, “DID” and more. The Ontology community believes that DID will be an indispensable foundation in Web3; by comprehensively deploying DID, Web3 will realize the protection of identity and privacy, and truly return data ownership to&nbsp;users.

<p>The Boys Club is a DAO-in-training that is building products, resources, and communities to make the crypto space a more welcome place for women. Crypto has traditionally not been a particularly women-friendly place, with a sub-culture of basement-dwelling libertarian bros.

  <p>Spring Cloud Contract was created as a way to help test interconnected microservices. Generally speaking, there are two options when testing microservices: 1) you can deploy the entire mesh of services in your integration tests and test against that, or 2) you can mock each service in your integration tests. Both of these options have serious drawbacks.</p>

<p>The first, deploying the entire mesh of microservices for testing, has the obvious drawback of being difficult, if not impossible, in many environments. It’s simply not always feasible to deploy a whole mesh of services just for integration testing. The second solution, writing separate mocks for each projects’ integration tests, has the problem of being potentially unreliable. This is because integration tests are written in a separate service from the code actually governing the function that the test is modeling, and as such, can easily drift away from the desired behavior.</p>

<p>Imagine a simple microservice with a producer and a consumer. When writing tests in the consumer project, you have to write mocks or stubs that model the behavior of the producer project. Conversely, when you write tests in the producer project, you have to write mocks or stubs that model the behavior of the consumer project. As such, multiple sets of related, redundant code have to be maintained in parallel in disconnected projects.</p>

<p>For every change made to the producer project, the developer needs to go to the consumer project – a totally separate code base – and make sure that the integration tests there reflect the new behavior producer. Keeping this up across a complex system with many different services, at best, requires a lot of discipline, and at worst, is unlikely. It’s very easy for integration tests to give a false sense of security and not actually reflect the reality of the service being tested.</p>

<p>What is needed is a way to ensure that the mocked (or stubbed) behavior of the test objects is connected to the actual behavior of the objects being modeled. Ideally, these mocked objects would be defined in the project they represent.</p>

<p>Spring Cloud Contract does exactly this. It provides a way of specifying specific behavior for a service – the “contract” – and testing for compliance with this contract within that project itself while allowing other projects to load these contracts as stubs that can be mocked for integration testing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A brief aside on “mocks” and “stubs”. “Mock” gets used in ways online that is somewhat generic, meaning any fake object used for testing, and this can get confusing when differentiating “mocks” from “stubs”. However, specifically, a “mock” is an object that tests for behavior by registering expected method calls before a test run. In contrast, a “stub” is a testable version of the object with callable methods that return pre-set values. Thus, a mock checks to see if the object being tested makes an expected sequence of calls to the object being mocked, and throws an error if the behavior deviates (that is, makes any unexpected calls). A stub does not do any testing itself, per se, but instead will return canned responses to pre-determined methods to allow tests to run. (Of course, a stub can throw an error if unexpected calls are made as well, so stubs do constrain behavior in that sense as well.)</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you’re going to create a simple Spring Boot producer that serves hats and a Spring Boot consumer that presents hats to the user (really hat specification object instances). The consumer will retrieve the hats from the producer before presenting them. You will use Spring Cloud Contract to write a contract that describes what the producer service should return based on certain resource queries. Spring Cloud Contract will automatically generate integration tests from the producer contract, which will verify that the producer is behaving according to the specification of the contract. It will also generate stubs that can be imported into other projects to assist in integration testing. Next, on the consumer side, you will import these stubs into the consumer’s integration tests as a mocked object that can be used in testing the consumer. You will also see how Okta can be used as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider to add security to the Spring Boot project.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

<p>Before you get started, you’ll need to make sure you have a few tools installed.</p>

 
   
    <p>Okta CLI: The Okta CLI is an easy way to create projects that use Okta for security. Follow the installation instructions on the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI project website</a>. You should log in to your existing account or register for a new account using the CLI before continuing with the tutorial.</p>
   
   
    <p>Java 11: This project uses Java 11. OpenJDK 11 will work just as well. Installation instructions can be found on the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/">OpenJDK website</a>. OpenJDK can also be installed using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Alternatively, <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> is another excellent option for installing and managing Java versions.</p>
   
   
    <p>HTTPie: This is a powerful command-line HTTP request utility you’ll use to test both Spring Boot resource servers. Install it according to <a href="https://httpie.org/doc#installation">the docs on their site</a>.</p>
   
 

 Bootstrap the producer project using Spring Initialzr 

<p>You’ll use the Spring Initializr project to bootstrap the Producer project. Open <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.6.3&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.example&amp;artifactId=producer&amp;name=producer&amp;description=Producer%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot%20Contract&amp;packageName=com.example.contract&amp;dependencies=web,cloud-contract-verifier,lombok">this link</a> to access the pre-configured starter project.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You are creating a Java project – Java 11 – using Maven as the build system. The Spring Boot version was 2.6.3 when I wrote this tutorial. You are including three dependencies:</p>

 
   <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html">Spring Web</a>: adds the basic HTTP/web capabilities to build a REST API. 
   <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-contract">Contract Verifier</a>: brings in Spring Cloud Contract project by enabling Consumer Drive Contracts and stub generation. 
   <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Lombok</a>: is a helper project that will generate some getters, setters, and constructors. 
 

<p>When you’re ready, click Generate and save the zip file in an appropriate parent directory. You’ll be making two Spring Boot projects (as mentioned, a producer and a consumer), so it probably makes sense to have a parent directory named something like <code>Spring Cloud Contract Tutorial</code> or <code>spring-cloud-contract-tutorial</code> (if you dislike spaces in directory names).</p>

<p>Unzip the file and open the directory in your favorite editor or IDE. (I’m an IDE/IntelliJ man myself – hopefully that’s not disappointing to y’all – because in the immortal words of Buckaroo Banzai “Life is too short for vim”.)</p>

<p>Let’s start by building the hat producer. Both the producer and consumer projects will be Spring Boot resource servers that use Spring MVC to implement a simple REST API.</p>

<p>Create a <code>Hat.java</code> file that is the data model for the hats the producer will serve.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/contract/Hat.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.contract;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;

@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Hat {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private Long size;
    private String color;
}
</code>   

<p>The hat has four attributes, an <code>id</code> as well as <code>name</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>color</code>. Notice the two annotations. These are what Lombok helps us with. The <code>@Data</code> annotation generates getters and setters as well as a <code>toString()</code> and a constructor for all required arguments (<a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/Data">check out the docs</a>). The <code>@AllArgsConstructor</code> annotation generates a constructor for all fields in the class. I really like it because it de-clutters the data model classes and saves some time generating all of the ‘ceremony’ methods.</p>

<p>Next create a <code>HatService.java</code>. This is in lieu of using JPA and an actual database to persist the Hat object instances. It’s just for demonstration purposes and simply creates two hats –  a large, red sombrero and a smaller blue beanie – and serves them by ID.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/contract/HatService.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.contract;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@Service
public class HatService {
    private final Map&lt;Long, Hat&gt; hatMap;
    public HatService() {
        hatMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        hatMap.put(1L, new Hat(1L, "Sombrero", 30L, "red"));
        hatMap.put(2L, new Hat(2L, "Beanie", 5L, "blue"));
    }
    Hat findHatById(Long id) {
        return hatMap.get(id);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Lastly, create a <code>HatController.java</code> that is what exposes your single resource endpoint.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/contract/HatController.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.contract;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.server.ResponseStatusException;

@RestController
public class HatController {
    private final HatService hatService;

    public HatController(HatService hatService) {
        this.hatService = hatService;
    }

    @GetMapping("hat/{id}")
    public Hat findHatById(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
        Hat hat = hatService.findHatById(id);
        if (hat == null) {
            throw new ResponseStatusException(
                    HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, "Not Found"
            );
        }
        return hat;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The HatController uses Spring’s dependency injection to get the HatService as a bean. It then uses the service to lookup hats by ID and serve them to the consumer of the REST service endpoint at <code>/hat/{id}</code>.</p>

<p>You now have a working hat producer. Start the project with the following command:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Once the service has started, you can open a second terminal and use HTTPie to test it.</p>

   <code>http :8080/hat/1
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 
...
{
    "color": "red",
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sombrero",
    "size": 30
}
</code>   

 Create the producer contract 

<p>Next, you need to write the contracts that define the interservice agreement to govern the behavior of the producer. This is where Spring Cloud Contract comes in and things get interesting.</p>

<p>You’re going to create three contracts under <code>src/test/resources/contracts</code>. The contracts can be written in YAML or as a Groovy, Java, or Kotlin DSL script. In this tutorial I’ve chosen to go with the <a href="https://groovy-lang.org/">Groovy</a>. These contracts could also be in a single file instead of separate files. See <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/docs/current/reference/html/project-features.html#contract-dsl-multiple">the docs</a>.</p>

<p>Create the first contract in your <code>src/test/resources</code> directory.</p>

<p><code>src/test/resources/contracts/find_hat_by_id.groovy</code></p>

   <code>package contracts

import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

Contract.make {
    description "should return hat by id=1"

    request {
        url "/hat/1"
        method GET()
    }

    response {
        status OK()
        headers {
            contentType applicationJson()
        }
        body (
                id: 1,
                name: "Test Hat 1",
                size: 10,
                color: "striped"
        )
    }

}
</code>   

<p>In the <code>request</code> block, this contract defines the request method at <code>GET</code> and the request URL as <code>/hat/1</code>. In the <code>response</code> block, this contract specifies that the status should be <code>OK</code>, the headers should be <code>applicationJson</code>, and the attributes of the red sombrero should be returned. This contract is pretty simple, but the DSL has a lot of power. <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/reference/html/project-features.html">Take a look at the docs</a> to dig deeper.</p>

<p>The second contract is similar, except for the blue beanie.</p>

<p><code>src/test/resources/contracts/find_hat_by_id2.groovy</code></p>

   <code>package contracts

import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

Contract.make {
    description "should return hat by id=2"

    request {
        url "/hat/2"
        method GET()
    }

    response {
        status OK()
        headers {
            contentType applicationJson()
        }
        body (
                id: 2,
                name: "Test Hat 2",
                size: 7,
                color: "green"
        )
    }

}
</code>   

<p>The last contract defines a 404 error message for hat ID 3.</p>

<p><code>src/test/resources/contracts/find_hat_by_id3.groovy</code></p>

   <code>package contracts

import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

Contract.make {
    description "should return 404 for hat id=3"

    request {
        url "/hat/3"
        method GET()
    }

    response {
        status 404
    }

}
</code>   

<p>For the integration tests generated from these contracts to work, you need to define a base class and add the base class to the <code>pom.xml</code>.</p>

<p>Create a <code>BaseClass.java</code> test class (notice that this is in <code>src/test</code> not <code>src/main</code>).</p>

<p><code>src/test/java/com/example/contract/BaseClass.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.contract;

import io.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.mockito.Mockito;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.MockBean;

@SpringBootTest(classes = ProducerApplication.class)
public abstract class BaseClass {

    @Autowired
    HatController hatController;

    @MockBean
    HatService hatService;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setup() {
        RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(hatController);
        Mockito.when(hatService.findHatById(1L))
                .thenReturn(new Hat(1L, "Test Hat 1", 10L, "striped"));
        Mockito.when(hatService.findHatById(2L))
                .thenReturn(new Hat(2L, "Test Hat 2", 7L, "green"));
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the <code>pom.xml</code>, you need to define the configuration entry for the base test class. Add the following entry:</p>

   <code>&lt;baseClassForTests&gt;com.example.contract.BaseClass&lt;/baseClassForTests&gt;
</code>   

<p>… in the <code>&lt;configuration&gt;</code> block of the <code>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</code> plugin.</p>

   <code>&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;extensions&gt;true&lt;/extensions&gt;
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                ...
                &lt;baseClassForTests&gt;com.example.contract.BaseClass&lt;/baseClassForTests&gt;
            &lt;/configuration&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;
</code>   

<p>You might notice that the stubbed service created in the base test class above is returning different hats than the hats served by the producer application itself. Don’t get confused. The contract and the base test class define testing behavior. The application is defining live, production behavior (of course, here it’s pretty simplistic and test-like since the implementation is really just for demonstration purposes). Thus integration tests will be expecting <code>/hat/1</code> to return <code>Test Hat 1</code> while, as you’ll see below, when you run the application, the same endpoint will return <code>Sombrero</code>.</p>

 Generate the stubs and test the producer 

<p>To generate the stubs and the integration tests for the contracts, run the following Maven command.</p>

   <code>./mvnw install
</code>   

<p>The most important thing this command does (in the context of this tutorial) is that it generates the stubs and installs them in the local <code>.m2</code> (Maven) repo. In a production scenario, you might want to install the stubs in a remote repository instead. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/docs/3.1.0/reference/html/">the Spring Cloud docs</a> to see how that is accomplished.</p>

<p>If you read through the console output, you’ll see a lot of information about the generated integration tests and the stubs. For example, look at the following lines.</p>

   <code>[INFO] --- spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin:3.1.0:generateTests (default-generateTests) @ producer ---

<p>These lines tell you that Spring found the contracts in the <code>src/test/resources/contracts</code> folder, used the base test class defined in the <code>pom.xml</code>, and generated integration tests based on the contracts.</p>

<p>If you look at the generated integration tests, they’ll look like the following. The Groovy DSL contract has been turned into testable assertions. This is where the producer contract is tested against the actual behavior of the producer.</p>

<p>You’ll also see lines like the following, showing that the producer stubs have been created from the contracts.</p>

</code>   

<p>And toward the end of the console output, you’ll see that the stubs jar has been installed in the local Maven repo along with the producer application jar and the POM.</p>

   <code>[INFO] Installing /home/andrewcarterhughes/Development/okta/2021/spring-cloud-contracts/QA1/producer/target/producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar to /home/andrewcarterhughes/.m2/repository/com/example/producer/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

</code>   

<p>These stubs are what you will, in a few minutes, import into the consumer application for integration testing. Notice how, because of the autogenerated integration testing, the behavior of the stubs is guaranteed to match the behavior tested and defined by the contract. This is awesome. However, bear in mind, “the devil is in the contract,” as they say.</p>

<p>This tool will only be as good as the quality of the contract (and thus the tests derived from the contract). It provides a lightweight way to test and link behavior between two services without having to link their code or maintain redundant, separate code bases (mocks and stubs vs the actual object). But still, you have to be intelligent about what you define in the contract and ensure that the contract reflects the required behavior of the service.</p>

<p>Start the service by running the following command.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>You should see console output that ends with something like the following.</p>

   <code>...

</code>   

<p>In a separate window, use HTTPie to make a few requests on the service.</p>

   <code>http :8080/hat/1
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 
...
{
    "color": "red",
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sombrero",
    "size": 30
}
</code>   

   <code>http :8080/hat/2
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 
...
{
    "color": "blue",
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Beanie",
    "size": 5
}
</code>   

   <code>http :8080/hat/3
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 404 
...
{
    "error": "Not Found",
    "path": "/hat/3",
    "status": 404,
    ...
}
</code>   

<p>Remember that here you are seeing the “live” data, not the test data that is defined in the base test class and the contracts. In production, this live data would likely be complex data structures residing in a database and would not be so easily generated as is being done in the <code>HatService</code> class.</p>

 Add identity with Okta 

<p>Now you are going to add Okta JSON Web Token (JWT) auth to the application. You should have already installed the CLI and signed up for a free Okta developer account. If you have not, please follow the installation instructions on the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI project website</a> and run <code>okta register</code>.</p>

<p>Add the dependency for Okta’s Spring Boot starter to the <code>pom.xml</code> file. This project adds the necessary dependencies to use Okta as an OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">the project’s GitHub page</a> for more info.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependencies&gt;
    ...
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;okta-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;2.1.4&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    ...
&lt;/dependencies&gt;
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>ProducerApplication.java</code> class to the following. This will configure the producer service to use JWT authentication and to authenticate all requests.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/contract/ProducerApplication.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.contract;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ProducerApplication {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpringApplication.run(ProducerApplication.class, args);
   }

   @EnableWebSecurity
   public class OAuth2ResourceServerSecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

      @Override
      protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
         http.authorizeRequests()
             .anyRequest().authenticated()
             .and()
             .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
      }
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, you need to add the Issuer URI to your <code>application.properties</code> file. You need to replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> in the line below with your Okta domain.</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code></p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=/oauth2/default
</code>   

<p>You can find your Okta URI by typing <code>okta login</code> from the command line. It should print out something like the following.</p>

   <code>Okta Org already configured: https://dev-123456.okta.com/
</code>   

<p>You can also find your Issuer URI by opening your Okta Admin Console and navigating to Security &gt; API and looking at the Issuer URI for the <code>default</code> authorization server.</p>

<p>Start the application (or, if it is still running, use <code>control-c</code> to stop it and restart it).</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

 Generate a JWT and test the secure app 

<p>To generate a valid JWT, you need to create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) application on Okta and use the OIDC Debugger application to request a JWT from the OIDC application.</p>

<p>Run  <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Single-Page App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>An easy way to get an access token is to generate one using <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a>. First, you must configure your application on Okta to use OpenID Connect’s implicit flow.</p>

<p>Run <code>okta login</code> and open the resulting URL in your browser. Go to the Applications section and select the application you just created. Edit its General Settings and add Implicit (Hybrid) as an allowed grant type, with access token enabled. Then, make sure it has <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> in its Login redirect URIs. Click Save and copy the client ID for the next step.</p>

<p>Now, navigate to the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> website. Fill in your client ID, and use <code>/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> for the Authorize URI. The <code>state</code> field must be filled but can contain any characters. Select token for the response type.</p>

<p>Once you have the token value, save it in a shell variable (in the terminal window where you are going to run the HTTPie command to test the authenticated application).</p>

   <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJDVkdzamc2MDBCNVFXR3VSdVRDckJuLVhLa2J...
</code>   

<p>Test the authenticated application using the token.</p>

   <code>http :8080/hat/1 "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

<p>Make sure you use double quotes in the command above, otherwise the variable will not be expanded.</p>

<p>You should get the first hat returned.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 
...
{
    "color": "red",
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sombrero",
    "size": 30
}
</code>   

<p>One of the benefits of the Spring Cloud Contract project is that the mocked and stubbed test objects bypass authentication. This is super helpful (as long as you are not testing application security, of course). You can run <code>./mvnw clean install</code> or <code>./mvnw test</code> and you will see that the integration tests still pass and that the stubs are still being generated and deployed.</p>

 Create the consumer application 

<p>The next step is to create the consumer application. This will simulate a public-facing service to retrieve hats from the producer and serve them to the clients. The key point in this tutorial is to see how the stubs generated from the producer project can be imported into the consumer project and used to verify application behavior.</p>

<p>Use the Spring Initializr to create the starter project by following <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.6.3&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.example&amp;artifactId=consumer&amp;name=consumer&amp;description=Producer%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot%20Contract&amp;packageName=com.example.consumer&amp;dependencies=web,cloud-contract-stub-runner,lombok">this link</a>.</p>

<p>The project is very similar to the producer project except that the included dependencies are different. Here you are including Spring Web and Contract Stub Runner (in place of the Contract Verifier).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Unzip the project and open it in the IDE or editor of your choice.</p>

<p>Create a <code>Hat.java</code> class that will model the hat returned from the producer.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/consumer/Hat.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.consumer;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor // needed for Jackson serialization
public class Hat {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private Long size;
    private String color;
}
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>ConsumerApplication.java</code> class.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/consumer/ConsumerApplication.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.consumer;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder;
import org.springframework.http.HttpEntity;
import org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders;
import org.springframework.http.HttpMethod;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestHeader;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ConsumerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ConsumerApplication.class, args);
    }

    @RestController
    public class HatConsumerResource {

        @Value( "${producer.port}" )
        private Integer producerPort;

        private final RestTemplate restTemplate;

        HatConsumerResource(RestTemplateBuilder restTemplateBuilder) {
            this.restTemplate = restTemplateBuilder.build();
        }

        @RequestMapping("/wearhat/{hatId}")
        String getMessage(@PathVariable("hatId") Long personId, @RequestHeader("authorization") String authorizationHeader) {

            HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
            headers.set("Authorization", authorizationHeader);
            HttpEntity&lt;Void&gt; requestEntity = new HttpEntity&lt;&gt;(headers);

            ResponseEntity&lt;Hat&gt; response = restTemplate.exchange("http://localhost:"+producerPort+"/hat/{hatId}", HttpMethod.GET, requestEntity, Hat.class, personId);
            Hat hat = response.getBody();

            return "Enjoy your new " + hat.getName();
        }

    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a line to the <code>application.properties</code> file to change the application port from the default, 8080, to 8081 so that it does not conflict with the producer application. You’re also going to specify the producer port in the properties file so that the integration tests can use a different port for the mocked service. (You’ll see why in a bit.)</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code></p>

   <code>server.port=8081
producer.port=8080
</code>   

<p>This is a very simple consumer service. It makes a request to the producer for a hat by ID, simply passing along the <code>Authorization</code> header. The project could be made more realistic by adding security to the consumer as well. (The process would be exactly as described above for the producer.) And in a live scenario, this service would probably be pulling data from multiple other services and performing some sort of business logic before returning a value. However, here, the goal here is to demonstrate the stubs and integration testing, so I’m keeping the consumer itself as basic as possible.</p>

<p>Make sure your producer application is still running. In a new shell, run the consumer application.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Once the application is running, you can use the access token you created earlier to make a request on the consumer (which will pass along the request to the secured producer).</p>

   <code>http :8081/wearhat/1 "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

<p>You should see the following.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 
...

Enjoy your new Sombrero
</code>   

 Import the producer stubs into the consumer project and create integration tests 

<p>Now, the exciting part. You’re going to import the stubs generated from the producer project into the consumer project and use them for integration tests.</p>

<p>First, create an <code>application.properties</code> file in the <code>src/test/resources</code> folder. Notice that you are changing the <code>producer.port</code> to <code>8100</code>. This is the port on which the stubbed producer will run. It’s helpful if this is different than the actual port on which the producer runs.</p>

<p><code>src/test/resources/application.properties</code></p>

   <code>server.port=8081
producer.port=8100
</code>   

<p>Create your first test file called <code>ContractIntegrationTest.java</code>.</p>

<p><code>src/test/java/com/example/consumer/ContractIntegrationTest.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.consumer;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.spring.AutoConfigureStubRunner;
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.spring.StubRunnerProperties;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.client.HttpClientErrorException;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:producer:+:stubs:8100"}, stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL)
public class ContractIntegrationTest {

    @Test
    public void get_hat1() {
        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
        ResponseEntity&lt;Hat&gt; responseEntity = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://localhost:8100/hat/1", Hat.class);
        assertThat(responseEntity.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);
        Hat hat = responseEntity.getBody();
        assertThat(hat.getId()).isEqualTo(1);
        assertThat(hat.getName()).isEqualTo("Test Hat 1");
        assertThat(hat.getSize()).isEqualTo(10);
        assertThat(hat.getColor()).isEqualTo("striped");
    }

    @Test
    public void get_hat2() {
        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
        ResponseEntity&lt;Hat&gt; responseEntity = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://localhost:8100/hat/2", Hat.class);
        assertThat(responseEntity.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);
        Hat hat = responseEntity.getBody();
        assertThat(hat.getId()).isEqualTo(2);
        assertThat(hat.getName()).isEqualTo("Test Hat 2");
        assertThat(hat.getSize()).isEqualTo(7);
        assertThat(hat.getColor()).isEqualTo("green");
    }

    @Test
    public void get_hat3() {
        try {
            RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
            ResponseEntity&lt;Hat&gt; responseEntity = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://localhost:8100/hat/3", Hat.class);
        }
        catch (HttpClientErrorException ex) {
            assertThat(ex.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The producer stubs are imported with this line:</p>

   <code>@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:producer:+:stubs:8100"}, stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL)
</code>   

<p>You’re specifying the <code>com.example:producer</code> project, with the latest version, the stubs (not the jar), and telling the stub runner to start the stubbed service on port <code>8100</code>. Putting the stub runner in <code>LOCAL</code> mode means that it will look in the local Maven repo instead of looking online, which can be configured using the <code>REMOTE</code> value here. With that single annotation, Spring will create a service on port <code>8100</code> based on the stubs and generated from the contracts in the producer project.</p>

<p>You also define three tests that match the expected behavior defined in the contracts.</p>

<p>Next, create a more realistic integration test on the consumer in a new file, <code>ConsumerIntegrationTest.java</code>.</p>

<p><code>src/test/java/com/example/consumer/ConsumerIntegrationTest.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.consumer;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.AutoConfigureMockMvc;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.containsString;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.get;

import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.content;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.status;

@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:producer:+:stubs:8100"}, stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL)
public class ConsumerIntegrationTest {

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @Test
    public void shouldReturnDefaultMessage() throws Exception {
        this.mockMvc.perform(
                get("/wearhat/1").header("authorization", "dummyvalue"))
                .andDo(print())
                .andExpect(status().isOk())
                .andExpect(content().string(containsString("Enjoy your new Test Hat 1")));
    }

}
</code>   

<p>This is why you specified the producer port in the <code>application.properties</code> file. By using different ports in <code>src/test/java</code> and <code>src/main/java</code> you are able to direct the tests to the stubbed producer, which allows you to create a true integration test. In the test above, the mocked consumer calls the stubbed producer and returns the result, which is checked against the expected value. Otherwise, when you ran the test above, it would try and call the producer on port <code>8080</code>, which would call the actual producer running on that port.</p>

<p>You can run these tests in your IDE or from the command line with <code>./mvnw test</code>. All tests should pass.</p>

 What Is Really Matters to Make Diet Calories Calculators Work <p>To use a <a href="https://bit.ly/3HgH1uz">calories calculator</a>, you need to know how many calories you need per day and how many calories are in the food you’re&nbsp;eating.</p><p>While it’s important to know how many calories are in the food you’re eating, it’s even more important to make healthy choices when it comes to what you’re eating. A calories calculator can be a helpful tool, but it’s not everything. Here we will cover what really&nbsp;matters.</p> How many calories do I need each&nbsp;day? <p>This is a difficult question to answer without knowing more about your lifestyle and activity&nbsp;level.</p><p>The recommended calorie intake for the average, sedentary person is about 1200–2000 per day. If you are moderately active, you may need closer to 2000–2500 per&nbsp;day.</p><p>And if you are very active, you may need upwards of 2500–3000 or more. To calculate your specific calorie needs, use an online calculator or speak with a registered dietitian. Also we are going to cover the topic in&nbsp;depth.</p><p>In general, your daily caloric intake should include: 45–65% carbohydrates, 20–35% protein, and 10–30%&nbsp;fat.</p> What are macros and why do they&nbsp;matter? <p>Macronutrients are the three main nutrients that our body needs in order to function: carbohydrates, protein, and&nbsp;fat.</p><p>Each of these nutrients play different roles in our health and metabolism, so it’s important to make sure we are getting enough of all of them. Tracking your macros can be a helpful way to make sure you’re hitting your nutrient goals for the&nbsp;day.</p><p>There are many online calculators and apps that can help you track your macros. A good starting point is calculating what percentage of each nutrient you should aim for each day (see question #1). From there, you can adjust as needed depending on your specific goals and preferences.</p> (USDA) guidelines: <p>Calorie and macronutrient guidelines can be helpful in determining how many of each nutrient to eat each day. However, it is important to remember that everyone’s body is different and what works for one person may not work for another. It is also important to listen to your own body and make adjustments as needed. A good place to start when calculating calorie and macronutrient intake is to use the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines. The USDA recommends that adult women consume 2,000 calories per day, adult men consume 2,500 calories per day, and children between the ages of 4 and 8 years consume 1,400–1,600 calories per day. Regarding macronutrients, the USDA recommends that 45–65% of daily caloric intake come from carbohydrates, 20–35% from protein, and 10–35% from&nbsp;fat.</p> Formulas diet calories calculator uses (exposing the back end&nbsp;algos) <p>The Harris Benedict&nbsp;formula:</p><p>The Harris Benedict Formula is a mathematical equation that calculates someone’s basal metabolic rate&nbsp;(BMR).</p><p>This is the number of calories a person needs to consume each day to maintain their current weight. It takes into account a person’s sex, height, weight, and&nbsp;age.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>There are a number of ways to calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), but the Harris Benedict Formula is one of the most&nbsp;common.</p><p>To use the Harris Benedict Formula, you’ll need to know your weight in pounds and your height in&nbsp;inches.</p>  multiply your weight by&nbsp;703  divide that number by your height in&nbsp;inches  add 655 4. if you’re a woman, subtract 456 5. if you’re a man, add 68&nbsp;Your  BMR is then the result of this calculation.  <p>Mifflin-St Jeor&nbsp;formula:</p><p>The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is a formula used to calculate the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its current weight. The equation takes into account your sex, age, and&nbsp;weight.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>To calculate BMR, you use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, which takes into account your sex, age, weight and&nbsp;height.</p><p>To use the equation, you first need to determine your basal metabolic rate factor (BMRF), which is a number that reflects how many calories your body burns at&nbsp;rest.</p><p>You can find BMRF by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters&nbsp;squared.</p><p>Once you have your BMRF, you can use the following equation to calculate BMR:</p><p>BMR = 10 x BMRF +&nbsp;665</p><p>For example, if you weigh 60 kg and are 1.7 meters tall (68 inches), your BMR would be: 10 x 0.924 + 665 =&nbsp;1,608</p><p>Owen formula:</p><p>The Owen equation is a mathematical formula used to calculate the cardiac output, or the amount of blood pumped by the heart each&nbsp;minute.</p><p>The equation is named for Dr. John H. Owen, who developed it in the early 1900s. The equation takes into account a number of factors, including the heart rate, the stroke volume (the amount of blood ejected from the heart with each beat), and the resistance to blood flow throughout the&nbsp;body.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>Owen equation to calculate your&nbsp;BRM:</p><p>BRM = 370 + (9.8 x weight in kg) + (6.8 x height in cm) — (4.7 x age in&nbsp;years)</p><p>For example, a 30-year-old woman who weighs 70 kg and is 170 cm tall would have a basal metabolic rate of 1,537 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>Katch-McArdle formula:</p><p>You can use the Katch-McArdle formulas to calculate your BMR if you know your lean body&nbsp;mass.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>The Katch-McArdle formulas are: BMR = 370 + (21.6 x lean body mass) or BMR = (9.8 x weight in kilograms) + (4.7 x height in centimeters) — (4.7 x age in&nbsp;years)</p><p>Now what?!</p><p>After you find your BMR use one of these multipliers to find the amount of calories you need to stay at the same&nbsp;weight</p><p>The American Council on Exercise (ACE) has developed the following activity factor multipliers:</p><p>sedentary lifestyle =&nbsp;1.2</p><p>light activity =&nbsp;1.375</p><p>moderate activity =&nbsp;1.55</p><p>heavy activity =&nbsp;1.725</p><p>A sedentary lifestyle means you lead a relatively inactive lifestyle, with light physical activity only a few times a&nbsp;week.</p><p>If you have a light activity level, that means you engage in some exercise or physical activity on most days of the week but it’s not very&nbsp;intense.</p><p>Moderate activity means you are regularly active and heavy activity means you are very active — you probably have a physically demanding job or workout intensely several times a&nbsp;week.</p> The Key To Make It&nbsp;Work: <p>Now a note, all Calorie Counts Are Wrong as scientific american explained <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-reveals-why-calorie-counts-are-all-wrong/">Why</a>. But its not wrong to relay on them in the condition of you now they are just guessing efforts by great scientists. The wise decision is to use numbers generated by <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator">diet calories calculator</a>s as a starting point. If you do so you can make them&nbsp;work.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with online calorie calculators. First, they can be inaccurate. Second, they can be difficult to use. And third, they can be expensive.</p><p>If you don’t get enough calories, your body will start breaking down muscle tissue to use as&nbsp;energy.</p><p>This can lead to a loss of muscle mass, which can make it harder to stay active and healthy. Additionally, if you don’t eat enough calories, you may not have enough energy to do the things you enjoy or to work hard at your&nbsp;job.</p> Where did the humble calorie come&nbsp;from: <p>The calorie is a unit of energy that was first defined by the French scientist Nicolas Leonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. A calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree&nbsp;Celsius.</p><p>The calorie calculator can help you determine how many calories you should eat each day to reach your weight loss goals. It takes into account your basal metabolic rate (the number of calories your body burns at rest), as well as the number of calories you burn through physical activity. If you use application doing so then be sure that you are getting right information about your calorie&nbsp;needs.</p> How do you figure out how much calorie you need per&nbsp;day <p>To figure out <a href="https://bit.ly/3AKhFmi">how many calories you need per day</a>, you’ll need to first calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR). This is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its current weight at&nbsp;rest.</p><p>You can use an online BMR calculator to estimate this number. Once you have your BMR, you’ll need to multiply it by an activity&nbsp;factor.</p><p>This number accounts for the amount of activity you do on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p><p>If you’re sedentary, use a multiplier of 1.2; if you’re moderately active, use 1.3–1.4; if you’re very active, use 1.5–1.7; and if you’re extremely active, use 1.8 or&nbsp;higher.</p><p>Now add in any extra calories you burn from exercise or other activities throughout the day. The resulting number is your approximate calorie intake for the&nbsp;day.</p><p>Basal metabolic rate:</p><p>Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its basic functions while you are at rest. This includes functions like breathing, circulating blood and keeping your heart&nbsp;beating.</p><p>How to Calculate Your Basal Metabolic Rate:</p><p>To calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR), you’ll need to know your weight, height, and&nbsp;age.</p><p>You can use this online <a href="https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html">BMR calculator</a> to do the math for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Once you have your BMR, you can use that number to help you determine how many calories you need each day to maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To lose weight, you’ll need to eat fewer calories than your BMR; to gain weight, you’ll need to eat&nbsp;more.</p><p>Remember that these are general guidelines, and everyone’s needs vary. If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, for example, you’ll likely need more than 2,000 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you’re very active, you may need even more. Talk with a healthcare professional if you’re unsure about how many calories you should be&nbsp;eating.</p> How to Use the Diet Calories Calculator <p>The <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator">diet calories calculator</a> is a handy tool for figuring out how many calories you need to eat each day in order to lose weight or maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To use the calculator, simply enter your sex, weight, height, and age into the corresponding fields.</p><p>The calculator will then provide you with your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories you need to maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To lose weight, you’ll need to consume fewer than this number of calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>To maintain your current weight, you’ll need to consume the same number of calories as your&nbsp;BMR.</p> General Tips: <p>The number of calories in food is determined by the amount of energy that the food provides.</p><p>When you eat, your body breaks down the food into tiny pieces that it can use for energy. This process is called digestion.</p><p>The number of calories in a particular type of food is determined by how many nutrients it contains and how easily your body can digest it. Some foods are high in calories because they contain a lot of nutrients, such as protein, fat, or carbohydrates.</p><p>Other foods are high in calories because they are not very nutritious and are easy to digest, such as candy or processed snacks. If you eat something and then poop it out, the number of calories in that food would not be counted. However, if you ate something and it was absorbed into your body and used for energy, then the number of calories in that food would be&nbsp;counted.</p><p>If you throw up do you still count the calories?</p><p>Yes, you still count the calories! Throwing up does not get rid of the calories you consumed.</p><p>In fact, it can actually make you gain weight because you might eat more later to try to make up for what you threw&nbsp;up.</p><p>How many calories you need to eat to gain&nbsp;weight</p><p>How many calories you need to eat to gain weight depends on your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and how much you want to&nbsp;weigh.</p><p>To find out your BMR, use this calculator: <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/.">www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/.</a></p><p>Once you know your BMR, multiply it by the amount of activity you do in a day. If you are sedentary, multiply by 1.2. If you are lightly active, multiply by 1.375. If you are moderately active, multiply by 1.55. If you are very active, multiply by 1.725. And if you are extremely active, multiply by 1.9. This will give you the number of calories you need to eat each day to maintain your current weight (not including exercise).</p><p>To gain weight, add 500–1000 calories per day to this number (again not including exercise).</p><p>So if your BMR is 2000 and you are moderately active, you would need to eat 2500–3000 calories per day to gain&nbsp;weight.</p><p>How many calories should i eat for breakfast</p><p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the number of calories you need for breakfast will vary depending on your age, sex, activity level, and&nbsp;weight.</p><p>However, a good rule of thumb is to aim for around 400–600 calories for breakfast. This should provide enough energy to start your day without leaving you feeling too full or sluggish.</p><p>Some healthy breakfast options that are within this calorie range include: oatmeal with honey and banana; eggs with whole grain toast; yogurt with fruit and granola; a smoothie made with protein powder, almond milk, and frozen&nbsp;fruit.</p><p>How many calories do i need to maintain my&nbsp;weight</p><p>Maintaining weight is all about balancing the number of calories you consume with the number of calories you&nbsp;burn.</p><p>To maintain your weight, you need to eat the same number of calories that your body burns each day. This means that if you eat more than your body burns, you will gain weight; and if you eat less than your body burns, you will lose weight. There is no single magic number for how many calories everyone needs to maintain their&nbsp;weight.</p><p>It depends on factors such as age, sex, activity level, and muscle mass. However, general guidelines suggest that women need around 1,500–2,000 calories per day to maintain their weight, while men need around 2,000–2,500 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are trying to maintain your current weight, aim to consume the same number of calories each day. To do this, keep track of the foods you eat and make sure that your calorie intake stays within your recommended range. You can use a calorie calculator or app to help monitor your intake, or simply keep a food journal to track what you ate throughout the&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are looking to gain or lose weight, it’s important to adjust your caloric intake accordingly. For example, if you want to lose 1–2 pounds per week, aim to consume 500–1,000 fewer calories than your body needs each day. Conversely, if you want to gain 1–2 pounds per week, aim to consume 500–1,000 more calories than your body needs each&nbsp;day.</p> Conclusion <p>One of the most important aspects of maintaining a healthy lifestyle is controlling your calorie intake. It can be tricky, because you want to make sure you’re eating enough to fuel your body, but not so much that you’re packing on the&nbsp;pounds.</p><p>Luckily, there are plenty of ways to do this. One key is to make sure you’re eating nutrient-rich foods. These are foods that provide your body with the vitamins and minerals it needs to function properly. They’ll also help keep you feeling full longer, so you won’t be as tempted to snack between meals. Some good options include fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources like chicken or&nbsp;fish.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is portion size. When dining out, for example, order an appetizer instead of an entree, or split a main course with a friend. At home, use smaller plates and measuring spoons to help control your portions. Finally, it’s important to get regular exercise.</p><p>This doesn’t mean hours at the gym every day; even moderate activity like walking or biking can help burn calories and keep your metabolism going strong. Just be sure to stick to a routine that works for you and fits into your schedule.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> has been thinking about WEB3 lately. He just wrote a long piece about the <a href="https://blog.chain.link/what-is-the-blockchain-oracle-problem/">Oracle&nbsp;Problem</a>.</p><p>In this article we’re going to get to the bottom of the Oracle Problem, and how Mattereum’s solution to the Oracle Problem — multi party risk splitting with full legal enforceability — lets customers buy and sell valuable physical items as NFTs with strong buyer protection.</p><p>Solving the Oracle Problem in specific domains opens up huge possibilities for trade. Let’s go through Cory’s critique, and then present some answers to his questions.</p><p><a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/the-inevitability-of-trusted-third-parties-a51cbcffc4e2">The Inevitability of Trusted Third Parties</a></p><p>In one section of “The inevitability of trusted third parties” Cory Doctorow quotes extensively from one of my comments on the Well’s <a href="https://people.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/516/State-of-the-World-2022-page01.html">State of the World 2022</a>. I&nbsp;said:</p> Here is an NFT on OpenSea which gives the owner the right to<br>physically take delivery of a 1oz gold bar currently vaulted in<br>Singapore, or its financial value.  <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/47824387705324153400210554042155132922682187088261737780213014306821163188225">https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/47824387705<br>324153400210554042155132922682187088261737780213014306821163188225</a>  [...]  Here is the full legal text of one of the Ricardian contracts:<br><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.20.alpha.004.619263/06_carbon/assets/out/certification-contract.html">https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.20.alpha.004.619263/06_carbon/asset<br>s/out/certification-contract.html</a>  This one is a contract between the NFT owner and my company, which<br>guarantees that we have bought-and-retired carbon credits to cover<br>the physical mining of the gold bullion that is being sold. It also<br>covers the CO2 emissions of the NFT issuing process.  Clause 20 has the arbitration machinery.  We've worked fairly closely with the UK government on arbitration<br>rules for blockchain asset disputes.  <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/new-dispute-rules-envisage-direct-to-blockchain-enforcement-arbitral-decisions">https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/new-dispute-rules-envisage-direct-to-<br>blockchain-enforcement-arbitral-decisions</a>  The rules themselves are here:<br><a href="https://35z8e83m1ih83drye280o9d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lawtech_DDRR_Final.pdf">https://35z8e83m1ih83drye280o9d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021<br>/04/Lawtech_DDRR_Final.pdf</a>  We get a name check on page 4.  So what's being built out here is a very tightly bound legal<br>framework for buying and selling physical goods, with suites of<br>Ricardian contracts creating legally-enforceable claims about what<br>the goods are **DRAWN ON THIRD PARTIES**. Those third parties do not<br>benefit from the sale of the goods themselves, they make a living<br>providing legal warranties on the goods - they're essentially third<br>party inspectors with no economic interest in the situation other<br>than by selling insurance on the fact that something (for example)<br>contains no slave labour. <p>Cory then continues:</p><blockquote>But the more I think about this smart contract, the fewer reasons I can find for it to be a smart contract instead of just, you know, a contract.</blockquote><blockquote>As Vinay Gupta — the creator of this system and someone I have a lot of respect for — says, right there in the text, the entire system relies on third party arbiters to make sure that the parties involved don’t rip each other off, that no one uses slave labor, that the carbon is all offset through various schemes and so&nbsp;on.</blockquote><blockquote>The point is, all of that could be a deception. The only reason to trust it is that you trust the auditors who have signed the&nbsp;scheme.</blockquote><blockquote>I don’t mean to pooh-pooh the role of auditors here. Auditors are great. In fact, we’re in the middle of several kinds of serious economic crises because <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/04/aaronsw/#crooked-ref">we allowed auditors to become an oligopoly of hopelessly conflicted megafirms</a>, and they are <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/01/fallout-carillion-collapse-hits-kpmg.html">cheating like crazy</a>, and so much of the world is broken as a&nbsp;result.</blockquote><blockquote>We know that the big auditing firms are riddled with fraud. We know that <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/17/do-well-do-good-do-nothing/#greenwashing">carbon offsets</a> are among <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/26/aggregate-demand/#murder-offsets">the most fraudulent</a> instruments that companies make.</blockquote><blockquote>I don’t get how blockchain fixes any of&nbsp;this.</blockquote> How blockchain fixes some of&nbsp;this <p>So let’s talk about how blockchain improves the situation: not a blanket fix, but an economically-efficient risk reduction across the&nbsp;board.</p><p>Alan Turing named the Oracle Problem in 1937, and people have been wrestling with it in the Ethereum space since the early days of the platform.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@DelphiSystems/the-oracle-problem-856ccbdbd14f">The Oracle Problem</a></p><p>The state of the art in Ethereum Oracles is pretty sophisticated and pretty successful.</p><p><a href="https://blog.chain.link/what-is-the-blockchain-oracle-problem/">What Is the Blockchain Oracle Problem? Why Can't Blockchains Solve It?</a></p><p>Part of the reason the Oracle Problem is hard in blockchain is the old computer security adage, “things are weakest at the&nbsp;joints”.</p><p>The pathway by which information from the physical world comes into the blockchain smart contract is a potentially-weak joint between physical world systems and ultra-reliable blockchain systems. The blockchain systems are almost transcendentally reliable: this is why the strain concentrates on the Oracles, and on key management (we’ll come back to key management below). The computer does not break, but you can get at their&nbsp;inputs.</p> Blockchain reliability is not a magical&nbsp;process <p>The blockchain systems are theoretically reliable because of massive redundancy. It’s a bit like flight computers, where there are five independent systems.</p><p><a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2020/04/06/airbus-flight-control-system-single-points-of-failure/">Five Where Only One is Needed: How Airbus Avoids Single Points of Failure - Right Attitudes</a></p><p>All of the flight computers have to agree for it not to be A&nbsp;Problem.</p><p>In the blockchain space there are thousands of computers forming the consensus on the current state of the system. This is very inefficient, but it is very effective. Given inputs will produce the same outputs very, very reliably.</p><p>This redundancy method produces insulation from the statistical problems of the real world. This is a very important point. A non-redundant system can get hit by a cosmic ray or a stray particle produced by normal radioactive decay. It can go down from a power outage and go offline. Non-redundant systems are flakey. There is no cure for this. Redundant systems are inefficient. There is no cure for this either. This is the&nbsp;law.</p><p>The massively redundant blockchain systems are decoupled from the randomness of life to form a statistical approximation of a perfect system. You can program the Ethereum metacomputer — a virtual machine made of thousands of regular computers in a redundant array — as if it was perfect. You can just totally ignore how the physical world works when programming this virtual machine: does not get hacked, does not have physical hardware problems.</p><p>Any individual node in the metacomputer which develops issues drops out of the consensus. The tens of thousands of remaining machines go on. As a programmer, the massive redundancy means you completely stop worrying about hardware problems or failovers. There is no “error handling.” Nothing ever&nbsp;crashes.</p><p>It just&nbsp;works.</p><p>There is a downside to this redundancy. The archaic Bitcoin proof of work mechanism would cost about $750,000,000 to carbon offset every year, if we even thought CO2 offsetting worked. There’s good redundancy and bad redundancy. It’s unfeasibly expensive to do this the wrong way. But the Avalanche system runs on less than 500 tons of CO2 a year, it’s hundreds of times faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum, and it’s been available for a&nbsp;year.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1456329570295193601">@el33th4xor</a></p></blockquote><p>So massive redundancy is one half of what produces the effective decoupling of the blockchain from physical reality: the system is so redundant that there can be chaos in the physical world and the blockchain soldiers right on. It is not efficient (yet — we’ll cover proof of stake systems below) but it is&nbsp;elegant.</p><p>Now let’s look at the other half of what separates the blockchain from physical&nbsp;reality.</p><p>The other half of the decoupling of the blockchain from physical reality is True Names. You can download the Metamask wallet, create a key pair, and proceed to perform transactions on the blockchain without ever giving anybody any additional information about you at all: you’re an unaccountable ghost. Your legal identity is not tied to your&nbsp;actions.</p><p>This kind of power was a Cypherpunk dream for decades. <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-86207-7">Vernor Vinge’s True Names</a> explores the boundary between the cryptographic metaverse and the physical world in minute detail. It is a massively important formative work. In that world, nobody can bind your metaverse avatar to your physical body: the system protects your privacy. But if the link is made, and your True Name is cracked, you can be shut down — or even killed — in the physical&nbsp;world.</p><p>In the blockchain environment, nobody has to know your True Name. This turns out to be a lot more of a mixed blessing than it was in SF&nbsp;novels.</p><p>Of course, in practice, the True Name protection on the blockchain is weak for three&nbsp;reasons:</p>  If the actions you take benefit you in the real world (“I mail ordered this book”) then you are bound to your name and address for delivery. If you cash out money you want to spend, you’re tied by banking. If you rent an apartment, you’re tied to the&nbsp;address.  Funding a cryptocurrency wallet through crypto exchanges requires KYC/AML/CTF checks, just like regular banking or even more strict. This enables a “follow the money” approach to de-anonymizing people who later receive those funds, even if those people believe themselves to be anonymous. The crypto cash is tied to your real identity from the get&nbsp;go.  You’re still going to have to pay&nbsp;taxes.  <p>So while the blockchain space is in some abstract sense perfectly private and perfectly reliable, things are weakest at the joints. The on-ramps and off-ramps are parts of the real world, they’re tied to physical reality and KYC/AML/CTF regulations. Furthermore, when a user wants blockchain software to act on their behalf in ways which touch the real world, the blockchain’s security model breaks: the system acting as an extension of your will is no longer just the massively redundant blockchain. Now it’s a bunch of messy, regulated, human or Web2 systems. You and your software agents are no longer entirely anonymous because the real world requires named actors with&nbsp;KYC.</p><p>Any system connected to the real world is going to have some of the problems of the real world connected to it too. That’s just&nbsp;life.</p><p>Of course, there is the key management problem, and the software reliability problem. If you lose your key, or more likely somebody hacks the device on which you store your key, your blockchain identity and all its assets now belong to someone else. <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/">Hardware wallets help a lot</a>, but no system is&nbsp;perfect.</p><p>And if the software you write and upload to the chain — the smart contracts — have a bug? God help&nbsp;you.</p><p>It’s a machine, and it’s utterly unforgiving. It’s more like programming aeroplane avionics systems or satellites than web pages. Here be&nbsp;dragons!</p> The best of both worlds: Oracles that&nbsp;work <p>So we’ve looked at the problems of connecting blockchain systems to the real world: reliability and anonymity break down, and the core benefits of the blockchain are&nbsp;diluted.</p><p>But there are pragmatic systems that find advantages in connecting the blockchain and the real world. I’ll briefly cover two: Chainlink (a big Web3 project of some note), and Mattereum (my own company, as described in the Well State of the World quote&nbsp;above.)</p> Chainlink <p>Consider the Chainlink oracle&nbsp;system.</p><p><a href="https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles">What Is an Oracle in Blockchain? " Explained | Chainlink</a></p><p>A dazzling array of partner organizations with access to high quality data about things like weather conditions, stock prices and plane departures use a cryptographic and financial architecture to publish their data into the blockchain. They’re standing on their reputations: if they input bad data, they’re going to pay. There are complex “staking” arrangements coming this year which further automate this access to&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://chainlinktoday.com/staking-is-coming-to-the-chainlink-network-in-2022/">Staking Is Coming To The Chainlink Network In 2022</a></p><p>So that’s the True Names side of the bridge: in the Chainlink system, people publishing data are identified by their True Name. Only worthy partners are&nbsp;allowed.</p><p>The security side is more complex: Trusted Computing infrastructure signs transactions, multiple data feeds are integrated into an oracle feed, no data is single-pathed. It’s not quite the fully redundant system of the blockchain, but it’s a lot of cryptographic hardware and a lot of data source diversity. Not quite the same statistical guarantees as the blockchain itself makes, but a lot better than you would get with a conventional API-based price feed or other&nbsp;oracle.</p><p>It’s a bridge: not as squishy and unreliable as real-world APIs are, with lots of single points of failure that hackers could attack. But not as utterly, relentlessly infallible as the Ethereum metacomputer. Better than what we have now: Chainlink manages the Oracle Problem well enough to produce a highly functional system, without some kind of Science Fiction fix. It’s just a lot of hard work and good engineering by teams of smart people over years, building the most fraud-resistant and functional thing they&nbsp;can.</p><p>Actual Machines, not Fucking Magic, <a href="https://fritzfreiheit.com/wiki/AM/FM">as they&nbsp;say</a>.</p><p>So that’s one end of the pragmatic solutions to the Oracle Problem in the blockchain space: highly automated systems for doing things like price feeds using trusted computing hardware to guarantee data integrity.</p> Mattereum <p>Now let’s look at my own company, <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a>.</p><p>Mattereum operates all the way at the other end of the automation landscape: we rely on domain specialists such as curators, art historians and collectors to evaluate physical items. These physical items are being sold as&nbsp;NFTs!</p><p>The model&nbsp;is:</p>  An issuer puts the physical item in a vault with a set of third party evaluations provided by those&nbsp;experts  The issuer then publishes an NFT which gives the owner of the NFT the right to the item in the vault, akin to a coat check, but&nbsp;secure  The NFT owner can cash in the NFT for the item in the&nbsp;vault.  <p>It’s a system for doing real world trade in valuable things with a huge reduction in the risk of fraud: better expert opinions than one would usually get, and intermediate owners (e.g. dealers, auctioneers) are never touching the physical item. It stays securely in the&nbsp;vault.</p><p>We’ve worked on quite a few assets already, such as a selection of <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/third-millennia-collection-1">props and memorabilia</a> owned by legendary actor William Shatner, a <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/2">350,000 year-old hand axe</a>, and a <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/7">signed first edition</a> by Gonzo icon Hunter S. Thompson.</p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4aD73411CeC7D05c2EA1a17B4597E76/7">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4aD73411CeC7D05c2EA1a17B4597E76/7</a><p>These <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/mtrm.hunter.s.thompson.17082021/#01_Identity">physical asset evaluations</a> are performed by curators with relevant domain expertise and presented as legal warranty contracts — <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/mtrm.hunter.s.thompson.17082021/01_Identity/assets/out/certification-contract.html">pen and ink type legalese </a>— bound into the blockchain using a legal/technical construct called a Ricardian Contract. Not a lot of people seem to have heard of Ricardian Contracts these days: they were widely understood 5 years ago, but the number of people in the blockchain space has grown by something like 10000x since then and the Old Wisdom has become&nbsp;diluted.</p><p>Invented in the 1990s by Ian Grigg for managing a physical gold reserve with a cryptocurrency system, the Ricardian Contract is the key to understanding the new blockchain ecosystems.</p><p><a href="https://101blockchains.com/ricardian-contracts/">What are Ricardian Contracts? A Comprehensive Guide</a></p><p>Ricardian contracts are paper contracts, which use international arbitration law to appoint technically sophisticated arbitrators to manage cases involving a hybrid legal/technical system. Those arbitration laws carry hundreds of billions a year of settlements, so they’re well used and well understood and stable: <a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/english">the system has run since&nbsp;1958</a>.</p><p>Using those systems to make legalese contracts signed and paid on the blockchain arbitrable in the real world by real courts is the Ricardian Contract breakthrough. It’s another bridge: an extremely robust legal framework for getting enforceable legal rulings in complex areas like maritime law or civil engineering, carefully paired up to blockchain smart contracts.</p><p>What does the blockchain bring to the table in this instance? Well, the payments are taken on chain, using digital signatures, which are <a href="https://rightsignature.com/legality/electronic-signature-laws.html">universally accepted as legal signatures</a> these days. Actual statute legislates that in almost all countries. Those statues in each country are one part of the bridge, built out 20 years ago for general purpose use of digital signatures. But what this means is we have an instant and immediate settlement: the warranties on the physical object, and the ownership transfer, happen in a single atomic moment with the technical, legal, and financial transaction perfectly coordinated because they are the same transaction.</p><p>Remember I said “things are weakest at the joints” — well, in this case, there are no&nbsp;joints.</p><p>The legal, technical and financial transaction are a single transaction, there’s no way to wind up with a thing half-insured or stuck in an indeterminate state waiting for more paperwork. It’s a “performative speech act.” You say “make it so” and it is&nbsp;so!</p><p>That will stand up in court in 160+ countries because of the arbitration framework described above. It’s not an end-run around “the system” — it is an extension of “the system.” It’s a bridge! The legal system and the blockchain system can, with due care, work as one&nbsp;system.</p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1E65Ad4fB60844925Ed95Dec8460d8DE807B2BC4/0">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1E65Ad4fB60844925Ed95Dec8460d8DE807B2BC4/0</a><p>In the beginning, Cory asked “why isn’t this just a contract?”</p><p>The answer is “it is a contract, but it’s a contract embedded in a Ricardian context — one half in the world of automated smart contracts, and the other half in the world of&nbsp;courts.”</p><p>If you do it right, when you put legal contracts on to the blockchain, you get the best of both worlds, and that’s what we&nbsp;did.</p> Some examples of our&nbsp;work. <p>A gold mood ring, one of the first issued, recently sold as an NFT for $65,000.<br><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/goldmoodstonering.1975/">https://passport.mattereum.com/goldmoodstonering.1975/</a><br><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-mood-ring---a-cultural-icon-re-emerges-as-smart-wearable-nfts-301414759.html">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-mood-ring---a-cultural-icon-re-emerges-as-smart-wearable-nfts-301414759.html</a></p><p>An original Andy Warhol print of Alexander the Great<br><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1E65Ad4fB60844925Ed95Dec8460d8DE807B2BC4/0">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1E65Ad4fB60844925Ed95Dec8460d8DE807B2BC4/0</a><br><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/">https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/</a></p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/goldmoodstonering.1975/">https://passport.mattereum.com/goldmoodstonering.1975/</a> About Mattereum <p>London-based Mattereum was established in 2017 by a trans-disciplinary team with a track record in designing and launching nation state-level infrastructure and headed by former Ethereum release coordinator Vinay Gupta.

			 Tokeny’s 2022 Roadmap: Enhancing the Liquidity of Tokenized Assets 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in Jan 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Welcome to our monthly Product Focus newsletter, designed to keep you informed about our product developments at Tokeny. As this is the first newsletter of this year, we thought it would be good to introduce you to our product development priorities for 2022. These are:</p>
 🔰 Security and scalability 
<p>As a technology company, providing secure solutions to our customers and their end-users is fundamental, so security will remain our top priority. This year, we plan to pass more audits, certifications and cybersecurity tests than ever before.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the tokenization market evolves, we will make our solutions more resilient and scalable to ensure that the upcoming mass adoption of tokenization will be seamless for asset issuers simply by integrating our solutions into their existing systems with APIs and SDKs. For this, we plan to improve our monitoring tools and release an improved customizable blockchain indexer.</p>
 🤩 Enhanced UX for issuers and investors 
<p>New features will be added for issuers to further reduce their administrative and compliance costs via more automated and guided processes. However, the main innovations will concern the token holder side. As our customers are scaling their operations and proposing more tokenized securities to their investors, our team will release a unified, multi-token, enriched Investor Portal this year.</p>
 🌊 Liquidity enabler&nbsp; 
<p>We always considered blockchain networks as shared infrastructure. This year, we will take our solutions to another level on this infrastructure by offering asset issuers tools and networks to easily connect liquidity providers and gradually create a robust and compliant distribution ecosystem for security tokens.</p>
 🆔 Making DeFi acceptable to institutions and regulators&nbsp; 
<p>The DeFi space is full of opportunities, but a lack of compliance prevents institutions from injecting large amounts of capital into the space or involving tokenized securities. More than ever, we are convinced that onchain identities are the solution. Therefore, we will launch developer tools to easily create compliant DeFi protocols where only eligible actors can participate. As we believe that this will be the first year of the “Permissioned DeFi” wave, these tools will allow DeFi project teams to quickly catch up with the trend.</p>
<p>The year ahead promises to be exciting, as we will provide our customers and partners with more powerful tools to enhance asset liquidity and accelerate institutional adoption.</p>

<p>IMF Pressures El Salvador on Legal Tender Status of Bitcoin<br><br>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has issued a public rebuke of El Salvador’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The IMF, which serves as a major source of credit for developing countries, has asserted that the volatility in the virtual asset market – along with the potential for the facilitation of illicit activity – makes Bitcoin unsuitable for use as legal tender. Perhaps more importantly, the lender has stated that, should El Salvador continue down the path of accepting Bitcoin as legal tender, it may be deemed ineligible for receipt of credit in the future. This is particularly concerning as El Salvador has recently sought $1.3 billion in funding from the IMF.<br><br>The organization’s primary concerns appear to be related to “financial stability, financial integrity and consumer protection”. Though it has also noted that issues related to debt issuance may arise, as bonds issued by the country would implicitly be backed by Bitcoin as well as dollars. This could have a negative impact on El Salvador’s Article IV evaluation, which is the process by which “an IMF team of economists visit a country to assess economic and financial developments and discuss the country's economic and financial policies with government and central bank officials”. The results of the Article IV exam are reported to the IMF’s Board of Directors, and may have a direct impact on a given country’s ability to work with the financial institution on an ongoing basis.<br><br>While Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has been a staunch advocate for Bitcoin’s promise as legal tender, the process of adoption has not been without controversy domestically. In September 2021, protestors vandalized several of the Chivo ATMs used to convert dollars to Bitcoin and marched in opposition to the policy mandating virtual asset adoption by merchants and vendors. Nonetheless, in the intervening months, the Salvadoran populace has been widely accepting of Bitcoin, and over three million wallets have been opened since the policy took effect. More Salvadorans now have Bitcoin wallets than traditional bank accounts, and dollar inflows to BTC have far outpaced outflows, as citizens have embraced the fast and efficient transactions allowed for on the Bitcoin Lightning Network.<br><br>The IMF’s call is certainly concerning to those who would support broader adoption of Bitcoin and other virtual assets globally, though it also represents a unique and meaningful opportunity for engagement. By partnering with the IMF to develop a legal tender policy framework suitable to both parties, El Salvador may potentially help to set ground-breaking precedent concerning the supranational regulatory integration of fiat and digital currencies. In this moment, it’s imperative that the parties work together, to further the mission of financial inclusion and technological innovation, while maintaining the credit support structures that are vital to the success of developing countries across the world.</p>

<p>If you’re developing a web application, chances are you want your dev environment as close to production as possible. One of the often-overlooked differences between local development and production servers is the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). In this post, I’ll cover three different options to get your local Java app running with TLS in no time!</p>

 Start with a simple Java application 
 
 
<p>To test out these options, you will, of course, need a Java web application. If you already have one handy, skip this step!</p>
 
 
<p>Bootstrap a new application using the <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.example&amp;artifactId=demo&amp;name=demo&amp;description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&amp;packageName=com.example.demo&amp;dependencies=web,devtools">Spring Initializer</a>. Clicking on that link will automatically add the <code>web</code> and <code>devtools</code> dependencies.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Download the project using the Generate button.</p>
 
 
<p>Extract the zip file.</p>
 
 
<p>Open the project with your favorite IDE.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The last thing to do is to add a basic <code>RestController</code> in <code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/HelloController.java</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Yes, this is another Hello World...";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>That’s it! Start the application either from your IDE or by running <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Now access this boring, non-secure application in your browser at`\http://localhost:8080/`.</p>
 
 
 
 
 HTTPS using an internet proxy 
 
 
<p>One of the quickest ways to get a local application running with TLS is to use an internet proxy like ngrok.
<a href="https://ngrok.com/download">Download and install ngrok</a> and then start up the service using:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ngrok http 8080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command will expose your local service running port <code>8080</code> over the internet on a generated URL such as <code>https://abcd-11-22-33-44.ngrok.io</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>If you don’t want to install ngrok, you could use <a href="https://localhost.run/">localhost.run</a>, which works using SSH port forwarding. Try it out with:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 nokey@localhost.run</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Similar to ngrok, a temporary URL will be generated. For example, <code>https://152ccb7ac9369e.lhr.life</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>The goal of these tools is to provide a publicly available URL for your local development, which is perfect if you want to share something via the internet. If you don’t want to share, it’s best not to expose your development machine to any potential attackers online. The following two options avoid this issue.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a certificate authority with mkcert 
 
 
<p>The next two options use a tool called <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert"><code>mkcert</code></a>, which sets up a locally trusted certificate authority (CA), installed into the trust stores on your computer. Any certificates issued by this CA will be trusted by the client of your choice (Chrome, Firefox, curl, etc.).</p>
 
 
<p>On macOS, you can install <code>mkcert</code> with Homebrew; for other operating systems you can find instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation"><code>mkcert</code> docs</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>brew install mkcert nss
# nss is only needed if you are using Firefox</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create and install the certificate authority:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkcert -install</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>Created a new local CA 💥
Sudo password:
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ⚡️
The local CA is now installed in Java's trust store! ☕️</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>If you are on macOS and using <a href="https://httpie.io/">HTTPie</a>, you will need to add the CA to <a href="https://github.com/httpie/httpie/issues/480">HTTPie manually</a>:<br></p>
 
 
 
 <code>cat "$(mkcert --CAROOT)/rootCA.pem" &gt;&gt; \
$(brew --prefix)/Cellar/httpie/*/libexec/lib/python*/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem</code> 
 
 



 
 
<p>That was mostly painless, now let’s secure the application you just created!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Reverse proxy with Nginx 
 
 
<p>Many production applications terminate TLS using a reverse proxy like Nginx. This can also be an excellent option for local development and has the added advantage of working with any web application framework.</p>
 
 
<p>To run Nginx, I’ll use the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx">official Nginx Docker image</a>. To keep things organized, create a new directory to hold the configuration:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkdir localhost-tls
cd localhost-tls</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, use <code>mkcert</code> to generate the certificates Nginx will use.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkdir devcerts
mkcert -key-file devcerts/key.pem -cert-file devcerts/cert.pem localhost</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command generates a private key and certificate in the new <code>devcerts</code> directory for the host, <code>localhost</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Create an <code>nginx-default.conf.template</code> configuration file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;
    rewrite ^/(.*)$ https://$host$request_uri? permanent; (1)
}

server {
  server_name _;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:${TARGET_PORT}; (2)

    (3)
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host:443;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port 443;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
  }

  listen 443 ssl;
  ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/cert.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/key.pem;
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Redirect all http requests to https.


2
Windows and Mac hosts run Docker in a VM, the hostname <code>host.docker.internal</code> is used to point back to the "host" OS and the port.


3
Set the proxy headers, so the downstream app will know what URL the client is using.


 
 
 
 
 Tie it all together with Docker 
 
<p>Now that you have your Java application, the certificates, and the Nginx configuration ready to go, the only thing left is to start it up!</p>
 
 
<p>Use <code>docker run</code> to start Nginx with the above files as volumes that configure the service.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>docker run \
    -v $(pwd)/nginx-default.conf.template:/etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template \ (1)
    -v $(pwd)/devcerts:/etc/nginx/certs \ (2)
    -p 443:443 \
    -p 80:80 \
    --env TARGET_PORT=8080 \ (3)
    nginx</code> 
 
 
 


1
The Nginx configuration file template.


2
The path to the certificates.


3
The port where your application is running on <code>localhost</code>.


 
 
 
 






You can codify this solution using a <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/mkcert-nginx-example/blob/main/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml file</a> if you prefer!



 
 
<p>Test it out! Open up your browser to <code>https://localhost/</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Configure Spring Boot to use HTTPS 
 
 
<p>The previous options used a separate service to handle TLS; this time, I’ll configure Spring Boot’s embedded Tomcat server to terminate TLS directly.</p>
 
 
<p>Generate another set of certificates with <code>mkcert</code>. This time set the output format to <code>pkcs12</code>, which is a format the Java KeyStore understands.</p>
 
 
 
 <code># create the directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/spring-boot

# generate a certificate in pkcs12 format
mkcert -pkcs12 -p12-file ~/.config/spring-boot/local-tls.p12 localhost</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a properties file <code>~/.config/spring-boot/spring-boot-devtools.properties</code> containing the server port and newly generated keystore location.</p>
 
 
 
 <code># Set the port
server.port=8443

# configure the key store path
server.ssl.key-store=${user.home}/.config/spring-boot/local-tls.p12</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now restart your Spring Boot application, and open your browser to <code>https://localhost:8443</code> to access your newly secured application!</p>
 
 






 
<p>I didn’t need to make any changes to my application because it’s using <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using.html">Spring Boot DevTools</a>, which automatically includes the above properties file. If you are not using DevTools, you can mimic this behavior by setting an environment variable before starting your application:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>SPRING_CONFIG_IMPORT='${user.home}/.config/spring-boot/spring-boot-devtools.properties'</code> 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 Bonus: Use a different hostname 
 
 
<p>The above examples use <code>localhost</code>, which works, but you might want to use a different hostname. One easy way to do this is to add a hostname alias to your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 local.example" &gt;&gt; /etc/hosts'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>In the above examples, when generating certificates with <code>mkcert</code>, replace <code>localhost</code> with your domain name. Here’s an example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkcert -key-file devcerts/key.pem -cert-file devcerts/cert.pem local.example</code> 
 
 
 






Use a domain name that you own or that is NOT in the official <a href="https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt">top-level domain list</a> to ensure there are no conflicting or hijacked DNS entries.



 
 
 
 
 Potential problems using HTTPS for local development 
 
 
<p>It’s not all sunshine and roses. If you are a developer that works on multiple applications there are a few things to watch out for.
Your browser may automatically switch to HTTPS if you are switching between applications that run on HTTP and HTTPS prototypes, especially if one of your applications sets the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HTST) headers</a>. If you run into this type of problem you can clear the <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/getting-started-guide/internet-and-networking/clearing-a-web-browsers-ssl-state">SSL State</a> and/or <a href="https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/clear-hsts-settings-chrome-firefox/">HSTS settings</a> in your browser.</p>
 
 






Use a different hostname for each application you are working on to avoid browser caching.



 
 
 
 
 Learn more about building secure Java applications 
 
 
<p>This post has demonstrated three options for running applications locally using TLS/HTTPS. Each option has its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Using an Internet proxy exposes your application to the world; however, this could be what you want if you are testing <a>web hooks</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Running a reverse proxy will work for any application, but it’s one more service to manage (…​and remember to start 😉 ).</p>
 
 
<p>Running directly in the Spring Boot application, just works™️ once it’s set up. However, it cannot use the default HTTPS port (<code>443</code>) without some other workaround, like (<a href="https://mcaikovski.blogspot.com/2018/01/forwarding-ports-80-to-8080-or-443-to.html">iptables</a>, <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/112795/how-to-run-a-server-on-port-80-as-a-normal-user-on-linux#answer-112805">authbind</a>, <a href="https://techblog.jeppson.org/2017/12/make-java-run-privileged-ports-centos-7/">setcap</a>, etc.).</p>

				  Indicio is proud to have been named by <a href="https://www.vcnet.nyc/">New York VC Network</a> in their recently compiled list of the most exciting early-stage teams that they’ll be following closely this year!   
			  
				
				
				 <p>This exclusive list is made up of recently founded companies that are now raising their Seed or Series A and have applied to the VC matching program in the past six months. Based on the space the teams are working in, they are divided into 5 categories:&nbsp; HealthTech, Fintech, B2B Solutions, Consumer Tech, and Top Scorers in ESG.</p>
<p>The New York VC Network Rating Committee consists of current and former VCs, angel investors, exited entrepreneurs, and Fortune 500 employees in M&amp;A roles. The rating for companies is primarily based on two criteria. The first is the team’s past track record, mostly relying on founder profiles, past achievements, and their ability to gather a talented team around them. The second is the company’s current traction/scalability, based on the chosen market, current traction, and ability to scale.</p>
<p>The focus here was not on raised capital, but for insight these companies had already raised $3.4M on average (the median being $1.4M) and continued to receive more after applying.&nbsp; More information on the full list, including companies, full company profiles, and contact information are available in the <a href="https://www.vcnet.nyc/nyc-top-50/top-jan-2022">full announcement from New York VC Network.</a></p>

  DIDs and VCs are a new type of unique identifier with linked verifiable information that can be controlled solely by the user. DID-based representations for Ethereum Accounts and ENS names have been already defined.

<p>Moving past the login box using Verifiable Credentials</p><p>Visit any traditional website today and you’ll likely be confronted with a barrage of obstacles. The first thing will be those annoying cookie pop ups pushing you to consent to the countless number of 3rd parties that will track your visit. This information is peddled on exchanges around the world. Get past that, and you will eventually be pushed to share your email address or phone number, and create yet another password. All making you a likely target for phishing attacks and putting your personal data at risk of being included in the <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/96667-the-top-data-breaches-of-2021">1,291 data breaches </a>affecting <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/10/06/data-breach-2021-2020-total-hacks/">nearly 281.5 million people</a> in 2021. This approach is not going to last.</p><p>Web 3 has brought a new way to engage with websites, and dare I say, it is almost magical. No cookies, no username, no password, no sharing personal information. I can browse freely and pseudo-anonymously without having to worry about the cookies and terms I was forced to accept. When I want to transact, I connect to a website with a “wallet”. The wallet (e.g, <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>) is a browser extension or mobile app that holds a unique pseudonymous identifier, such as my Ethererum address. When I click “Connect”, my wallet proves to the website that I control the private keys associated with that address. All my data stays with me, on my device. This puts me, the user in control. </p><p>The wallet replaces the username, the password, the cookie and requires no personal data to be shared. This is great for website owners as well because they no longer need to store sensitive data about their users. No surprise then that MetaMask, for example, claims to be “trusted by <a href="https://decrypt.co/86263/ethereum-wallet-metamask-reports-21-million-users">21 million users</a> worldwide”. The Web3 community is also exploring using other identifiers like NFTs and Ethereum Name Service (<a href="https://ens.domains/">ENS</a>) that can be associated with a wallet.</p><p>The Role of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials</p><p><br>But if we do not share any personal data, how do we complete web transactions that require age verification or affordability criteria(e.g. loans). How could users prove that they meet those eligibility or qualification criteria without breaking the Web3 model or privacy and convenience?</p><p>This is where the W3C standards on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralised Identifiers </a>(DIDs)and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials </a>(VCs) come into play. DIDs and VCs are a new type of unique identifier with linked verifiable information that can be controlled solely by the user. DID-based representations for Ethereum Accounts and ENS names have been <a href="https://medium.com/uport/ens-names-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids-724f0c317e4b">already defined</a>, and with zero transaction costs, users can easily create their own DIDs. They will then be able to prove control over their DID, enable trusted third parties to “issue” cryptographically signed verifiable credentials (e.g. I am over 21) linked to the user’s DID, and allow websites to “verify” a user meets any eligibility (e.g. age verification) and/or qualification criteria (e.g. affordability checks) whilst preserving the user’s privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, these verifications can be done using selective disclosure (e.g. to prove your age, you need only disclose your date of birth versus showing your entire drivers’ license), predicates( e.g. instead of sharing your full date of birth, you can simply prove you are over 21), and zero knowledge proofs (e.g prove that I am a European citizen without sharing my passport details), using “<a href="https://blog.dock.io/anonymous-credentials/">anonymous credentials</a>”. This makes it possible for users to not have to compromise on neither the user experience nor on their anonymity within the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>Get Started with Dock</p><p>To find out more about how to implement DIDs, Verifiable Credentials and Anonymous Credentials in practice, have a look at <a href="https://console.api.dock.io/">Dock’s platform</a> or reach out to <a href="https://www.dock.io/contact">Dock directly</a>.</p><p>About Dock:</p><p>Dock is a platform designed to provide a simple solution for businesses and developers to build, manage and present digital credentials that are instantly verifiable using blockchain technology. With a standalone blockchain and seamless adoption and interoperability, Dock is part of a movement to solve universal problems with existing data and how it is captured, shared and controlled.</p>

			  Mihalis Plelis is a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p></p>
 Who are you? 
<p>I am Mihalis, Senior Software Developer at Tokeny. I graduated from the Technological Educational Institute of Crete as a software engineer. I live in Crete and I like to work remotely.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>After working for two big companies and a startup in the past, I wanted a change. After I started looking for a new challenge in my career, my ex-colleague <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-talent-story-of-jose/">José</a> who works for Tokeny referred me to the team, and this is how our journey started.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Working at Tokeny is something different. Right from the start, I was given the best welcome to date, better than any company that I have worked for in the past. We have a lot of freedom in our work, and we are free to do things the way we prefer. The team is really friendly, helpful and committed, which allows us to do things efficiently. The level of programming in our team is very high, allowing me to become a better developer and learn new things every day.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I like exploring new things, that’s why I like traveling. I’ve been to many European countries so far and I hope to continue traveling and exploring the world, experiencing new cultures and lifestyles. Also, I like to taste new kinds of food as this combines well with traveling around the world.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Being happy, like everyone else’s, I suppose. I try to have a balanced life, free of stress, close to nature and away from the noise of the big cities. I also hope I can contribute to making this world a better place via my work.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I would want everyone to have equal opportunities in personal and professional life. In addition, I would try to reduce pollution so that the next generation will have a quality place to live.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Basics first&nbsp;</p>



<p>The basics sound simple, and yet are so significant. Make sure your devices are secure: your computers, smartphones, and tablets. By that we mean, check if you have a comprehensive data security policy. That includes antivirus software, firewalls, and data recovery. To protect data in transit, all connections to your system should be on a secure platform. Emails should be encrypted, and remote desktops should be accessed via a VPN (virtual private network). At the end of the day, preventing security breaches is far less costly than curing it if it happens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Enforce password management&nbsp;</p>



<p>Did you know that weak or stolen passwords account for as much as 80% of attacks? Ensuring that you have strong passwords in force can help lower the chance of those attacks. Today there are password manager applications in use that allow you to generate strong passwords and store them securely, like LastPast. The best password is one that you can remember, but one that will be hard for other people, even malicious programs, to guess. An abbreviated sentence or passphrase is often better than a single word with numbers and symbols inserted. If possible, you can also add 2-factor authentication on most software platforms. Needless to say, everything you would do to protect your computer should be done on your mobile devices also. Update your software whenever possible, use strong passcodes, turn off Bluetooth when not in use, and verify legitimacy before you download anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. Educate yourself&nbsp;</p>



<p>Education is everything, and when considering that human errors and negligence are the major causes of data breaches, it becomes even more important. Keep up to date with the latest security best practices and do your research on how to prevent cybersecurity threats such as malware or phishing scams – it might pay off in the end! In general, it is good to follow the Better safe than sorry guideline. As multiple studies have shown time and again, many data breaches could have been prevented if we had taken better care earlier on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. Finding a good connection&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever we go online in a public place, e.g. by using a public WIFI connection, we have no direct control over its security. Before providing information, such as your bank account number, be sure that you are using a secure WIFI network – or wait for a better time. Using a secure VPN connection further enables you to have a safe connection between device and Internet server: one that no one can monitor or access the data you are exchanging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. Be sceptical&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you receive a link that looks strange from a trusted friend or family member, better contact them to ask if the link you’ve received was sent on purpose. Viruses and other forms of malware often spread because of phishing or social engineering, meaning you click on a link from someone you know. This is when you are tricked into revealing personal or sensitive information for fraudulent purposes. Spam emails, ‘free’ offers, or online quizzes all use these tactics to entice you to click on dangerous links or give up your personal information. Always be wary of offers that sound too good to be true or ask for too much information. Again: better safe than sorry!&nbsp;</p>

“None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.”- Johann Wolfgang von&nbsp;Goethe<p>Payment processing is an extremely complex system that involves several intermediaries; it isn’t as easy as sending monetary value from the consumer to the merchant. Let’s make an easy to understand example of such a notion. An office worker pays by credit card after eating at a franchise restaurant. It is evident that the transaction occurred between two people, the office worker and the restaurant owner, however many intermediaries are involved with one payment. These intermediaries can cause inefficiencies and additional costs for the business owner. This complexity is one of the focal components on why many businesses charge an additional processing fee when paying with a credit card as opposed to a cash transaction. Countless intermediaries and contracts form the basis of even the smallest of payments; at your local 711 or deli, an innocuous three dollar transaction can turn into a convoluted process where multiple systems must become involved. This creates a problem for the small business&nbsp;owner.</p><p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic specifically, small businesses in particular have seen the degradation of their businesses. This is due to a number of reasons which include shutdowns, a slowdown in economic expenditures and now, a looming supply crisis and payment processing only adds to these multiple nuisances. Many contract structures that provide convenience and risk management to the business owner in return conceive of a high commission burden to that specific small business owner. This is a fundamental flaw in the payment processing paradigm. Naturally, it is evident that the burden of this fee must be borne by the individual franchisees and the consumer. An easy and innovative payment service must be the answer, and one is on the horizon,&nbsp;GemPay.</p><p>Ask yourself this question, and answer it honestly, has fintech and big tech platforms enhanced the monetary performance of your business, or retracted upon it and left it in economic stagnation? It is an honest question that every small business owner should be asking. At the end of 2021, the fee for small merchants with annual sales of 300 million won ($250,000 USD) or less was only&nbsp;.08% for credit cards. However the percentage for Naver Pay is 2.2% (order management) and 2.0% for Kakao Pay (online), higher than the majority of card processing companies. It has been analyzed that the approximate fee is 2–3 times higher. It has become difficult to simply compare fee rates because of the broad range of services that credit card companies and simple payment operators provide. Of course, it is true that it is difficult for everyone to know transparently about the standards and specific details of processing fees. But we must ask ourselves about the fundamental maxim of big tech service companies, whose sole purpose is for-profit business. Are big tech service companies competing to provide quality services for their customers rather than financial companies that are subject to stricter audit and regulatory restrictions? Even so, it will be just a temporary marketing to dominate the market and that creates a major&nbsp;dilemma.</p><p>The fact that the development of technology has made it possible for consumers to easily consume is certainly a benefit of fintech technology; resulting from this, more people and business entities experience convenience and versatility. ‘Easier’, ‘faster’ and ‘kinder’ have become essential features of all services as technological innovation has increased astronomically over the last two decades. However, for sellers, this means higher fees and more platform dependencies which perpetuates the ability for payment processing platforms to price gouge processing fees because of the “leverage of reliancy.” We are not just satisfied with the simplicity of the service, but can actually increase the benefits that we can receive from the huge platform created with data and aggregation. This is where GemPay comes into play, developed by Blocko&nbsp;XYZ.</p><p>Blocko XYZ is an incredibly forward thinking company that creates blockchain solutions for enterprises of all sizes. GemPay is a convenient solution to the major processing fee dilemma that small business owners face. Bitcoin and blockchain technology are great solutions to these problems, but they have unfortunate dilemmas as well which include scalability, high transaction fees, exploits, slow transaction times and bottlenecks. After consistent deliberation and study of the mechanics of blockchain technology, Blocko was able to collect the following three notions to successfully integrate and amalgamate into GemPay. Beginning with the first pillar, the philosophy entailed is this “accept the notion of eliminating payment intermediaries and borrow the concept of point discounts to increase discounts instead of fees!” The second pillar highlighted is “let’s become the subject of the service by transparently sharing the transaction process, such as payment details and discount rates, and allowing users to exercise their own choice in operation!” And lastly, the third pillar is thus “keep the value 1:1 with the legal currency, so let’s focus on the points that can be easily paid rather than the investment purpose!”</p><p>The first pillar highlights the ethos of decentralized blockchain technology, comparing it to its non-traditional notions in accordance with the existing financial system. The core principle of blockchain is decentralization. Through blockchains the fee dilemma can be resolved by excluding electronic payment agencies (in essence, removing the oligopolist middle-men such as Payment Gate PG) and value added networks that are interconnected in the payment process. In English, buyers and sellers are directly connected through a peer-to-peer paradigm without the necessity of third parties, which results in virtually zero commission costs. Because GemPay is a blockchain based payment system, a “double discount” is possible.</p><p>The second ethos of GemPay revolves around the notion of preventing a second merge point which allows for the service to operate transparently with blockchain technology. Anonymity and paradoxically, transparency are the quintessential components of blockchain technology, and these can be utilized in an open payment system. At the time of payment, the user can clearly and easily check through the app how much discount the business received, unlike other payment methods, and that this amount of discount is possible only with the GemPay application. Instead of “you were charged x amount of won, please pay’, we become smart users by becoming the subject of payment data from consumers who used to make payments passively. This is one of the focal components of why GemPay is a practical solution in payment processing.</p><p>The third ethos of GemPay revolves around the controversy surrounding the coin price volatility. A justifiable question that small business owners ask themselves when utilizing blockchain and cryptocurrencies is “why would I accept such a volatile currency, I could make the transaction now and the value of the transaction can drop 20% in one minute”, which is a completely understandable sentiment. Afterall, a business must protect its profit and revenue streams. Blocko has conceived of an idea that will end this notion. Blocko will create AergoGem tokens on itself-developed AERGO mainnet to ensure 1:1 value exchange with fiat currency, and will initially focus on exchange with the KRW pair. Users can use the Gem charged through the GemPay app as in original currency and Gem can then be recharged with AERGO tokens, and you can also link third-party points with GemPay to exchange each point of the Gem. To conclude with a simple summary, GemPay allows for a high discount rate through its “double discount”, it enables transparency and independence through blockchain technology, and easy payments with gems that maintain 1:1 value with legal currency.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency involves substantial risk, do not invest more than you can afford to lose!

  <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) is one of the most exciting and underestimated software technologies invented in recent times. It’s a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine that aims to execute at native speeds with a memory-safe and secure sandbox. Wasm is portable, cross-platform, and language-agnostic—designed as a compilation target for languages. Though originally part of the open web platform, it has found use cases beyond the web. WebAssembly is now used in browsers, Node.js, Deno, Kubernetes, and IoT platforms.</p>

<p>You can learn more about WebAssembly at <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly.org</a>.</p>

 WebAssembly on Kubernetes 

<p>Though initially designed for <a href="https://www.w3.org/wasm/">the web</a>, WebAssembly proved to be an ideal format for writing platform and language-agnostic applications. You may be aware of something similar in the container world—Docker containers. People, including Docker co-founder Solomon Hykes, recognized the similarity and acknowledged that WebAssembly is even more efficient since it’s fast, portable, and secure, running at native speeds. This means that you can use WebAssembly alongside containers as workloads on Kubernetes. Another WebAssembly initiative known as <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)</a> along with the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a> project make this possible.</p>

 <blockquote><p>If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to created Docker. That's how important it is. Webassembly on the server is the future of computing. A standardized system interface was the missing link. Let's hope WASI is up to the task! <a href="https://t.co/wnXQg4kwa4">https://t.co/wnXQg4kwa4</a></p>— Solomon Hykes (@solomonstre) <a href="https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/1111004913222324225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2019</a></blockquote>

 

<p>WebAssembly on Kubernetes is relatively new and has some rough edges at the moment, but it’s already proving to be revolutionary. Wasm workloads can be extremely fast as they can execute faster than a container takes to start. The workloads are sandboxed and hence much more secure than containers; they are way smaller in size due to the binary format than containers.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about WASI, check out <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/">the original announcement from Mozilla</a>.</p>

 Why Rust? 

<p>I previously wrote a blog post about <a href="https://deepu.tech/my-second-impression-of-rust/">why Rust is a great language for the future</a>, Tl;Dr; Rust is secure and fast without the compromises of most modern languages, and Rust has the <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/">best ecosystem and tooling</a> for WebAssembly. So Rust + Wasm makes it super secure and fast.</p>

 Enter Krustlet 

<p><a href="https://krustlet.dev/">Krustlet</a> is a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/">Kubelet</a> written in Rust for WebAssembly workloads (written in any language). It listens for new pods assignments based on <code>tolerations</code> specified on the manifest and runs them. Since the default Kubernetes nodes cannot run Wasm workloads natively, you need a Kubelet that can, and this is where Krustlet comes in.</p>

 Run WebAssembly workloads on Kubernetes with Krustlet 

<p>Today, you will use Krustlet to run a Wasm workload written in Rust on Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Docker</a> 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl</a> 
   <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation">kind</a> or another local kubernetes distribution 
   <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started">Rust toolkit</a> (Includes rustup, rustc, and cargo) 
 

 Preparing the cluster 

<p>First, you need to prepare a cluster and install Krustlet on the cluster to run WebAssembly on it. I’m using <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/">kind</a> to run a local Kubernetes cluster; you can also use <a href="https://docs.krustlet.dev/howto/krustlet-on-minikube/">MiniKube</a>, <a href="https://docs.krustlet.dev/howto/krustlet-on-microk8s/">MicroK8s</a>, or <a href="https://docs.krustlet.dev/intro/quickstart/">another Kubernetes distribution</a>.</p>

<p>The first step is to create a cluster with the below command:</p>

   <code>kind create cluster
</code>   

<p>Now you need to bootstrap Krustlet. For this, you will need <code>kubectl</code> installed and a kubeconfig that has access to create <code>Secrets</code> in the <code>kube-system</code> namespace and can approve <code>CertificateSigningRequests</code>. You can use these <a href="https://github.com/krustlet/krustlet/tree/main/scripts">handy scripts</a> from Krustlet to download and run the appropriate setup script for your OS:</p>

   <code># Setup for Linux/macOS
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krustlet/krustlet/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | /bin/bash
</code>   

<p>Now you can install and run Krustlet.</p>

<p>Download a binary release from the <a href="https://github.com/krustlet/krustlet/releases">release page</a> and run it. Download the appropriate version for your OS.</p>

   <code># Download for Linux
curl -O https://krustlet.blob.core.windows.net/releases/krustlet-v1.0.0-alpha.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf krustlet-v1.0.0-alpha.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
# Install for Linux
KUBECONFIG=~/.krustlet/config/kubeconfig \
  ./krustlet-wasi \
  --node-ip=172.17.0.1 \
  --node-name=krustlet \
  --bootstrap-file=${HOME}/.krustlet/config/bootstrap.conf
</code>   

<p>Note: If you use Docker for Mac, the node-ip will be different. Follow <a href="https://docs.krustlet.dev/howto/krustlet-on-kind/#special-note-docker-desktop-for-mac">the instructions from the Krustlet docs</a> to figure out the IP. If you get the error <code>krustlet-wasi cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified</code>, you can allow it with the allow anyway button found at System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General on macOS.</p>

<p>You should see a prompt to manually approve TLS certs since the serving certs Krustlet uses must be manually approved. Open a new terminal and run the below command. The hostname will be shown in the prompt from the Krustlet server.</p>

   <code>kubectl certificate approve &lt;hostname&gt;-tls
</code>   

<p>This will be required only for the first time when you start the Krustlet. Keep the Krustlet server running. You might see some errors being logged, but let’s ignore it for now as Krustlet is still in beta, and there are some rough edges.</p>

<p>Let’s see if the node is available. Run <code>kubectl get nodes</code>, and you should see something like this:</p>

   <code>kubectl get nodes -o wide
# Output
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION         INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE       KERNEL-VERSION            CONTAINER-RUNTIME
kind-control-plane   Ready    control-plane,master   16m   v1.21.1         172.21.0.2    &lt;none&gt;        Ubuntu 21.04   5.15.12-200.fc35.x86_64   containerd://1.5.2
krustlet             Ready    &lt;none&gt;                 12m   1.0.0-alpha.1   172.17.0.1    &lt;none&gt;        &lt;unknown&gt;      &lt;unknown&gt;                 mvp
</code>   

<p>Now let’s test if the Krustlet is working as expected by applying the Wasm workload below. As you can see, we have <code>tolerations</code> defined so that this will not be scheduled on normal nodes.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hello-wasm
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hello-wasm
    image: webassembly.azurecr.io/hello-wasm:v1
  tolerations:
  - effect: NoExecute
    key: kubernetes.io/arch
    operator: Equal
    value: wasm32-wasi   # or wasm32-wasmcloud according to module target arch
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: kubernetes.io/arch
    operator: Equal
    value: wasm32-wasi
EOF
</code>   

<p>Once applied, run <code>kubectl get pods</code> as shown below, and you should see the pod running on the Krustlet node.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=krustlet
# Output
NAME                    READY   STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
hello-wasm              0/1     ExitCode:0   0          71m
</code>   

<p>Don’t worry about the status. It’s <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/72020">normal</a> for a workload that terminates normally to have <code>ExitCode:0</code>. Let’s check the logs for the pod by running <code>kubectl logs</code>.</p>

   <code>kubectl logs hello-wasm
# Output
Hello, World!
</code>   

<p>You have successfully set up a Kubelet that can run Wasm workloads on your cluster.</p>

 Setting up Rust for WebAssembly 

<p>Now let us prepare an environment for WebAssembly with Rust. Make sure you are using a stable Rust version and not a nightly release.</p>

<p>First, you need to add <code>wasm32-wasi</code> target for Rust so that you can compile Rust apps to WebAssembly. Run the below command:</p>

   <code>rustup target add wasm32-wasi
</code>   

<p>Now you can create a new Rust application with Cargo.</p>

   <code>cargo new --bin rust-wasm
</code>   

<p>Open the created <code>rust-wasm</code> folder in your favorite IDE. I use Visual Studio Code with the fantastic <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb">CodeLLDB</a> plugins to develop in Rust.</p>

 Create the WebAssembly workload 

<p>Let’s write a small service that will print random cat facts on the console. For this, you could use a free public <a href="https://catfact.ninja/fact">API that provides random cat facts</a>.</p>

<p>Edit <code>cargo.toml</code> and add the following dependencies:</p>

   <code>[dependencies]
wasi-experimental-http = "0.7"
http = "0.2.5"
serde_json = "1.0.74"
env_logger = "0.9"
log = "0.4"
</code>   

<p>Then edit <code>src/main.rs</code> and add the following code:</p>

   <code>use http;
use serde_json::Value;
use std::{str, thread, time};

fn main() {
    env_logger::init();
    let url = "https://catfact.ninja/fact".to_string();
    loop {
        let req = http::request::Builder::new()
            .method(http::Method::GET)
            .uri(&amp;url)
            .header("Content-Type", "text/plain");
        let req = req.body(None).unwrap();

        log::debug!("Request: {:?}", req);

        // send request using the experimental bindings for http on wasi
        let mut res = wasi_experimental_http::request(req).expect("cannot make request");

        let response_body = res.body_read_all().unwrap();
        let response_text = str::from_utf8(&amp;response_body).unwrap().to_string();
        let headers = res.headers_get_all().unwrap();

        log::debug!("{}", res.status_code);
        log::debug!("Response: {:?} {:?}", headers, response_text);

        // parse the response to json
        let cat_fact: Value = serde_json::from_str(&amp;response_text).unwrap();

        log::info!("Cat Fact: {}", cat_fact["fact"].as_str().unwrap());

        thread::sleep(time::Duration::new(60, 0));
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The code is simple. It makes a GET request to the API and parses and prints the response every 60 seconds. Now you can build this into a Wasm binary using this Cargo command:</p>

   <code>cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi
</code>   

<p>That’s it. You have successfully created a WebAssembly binary using Rust.</p>

 Run the workload locally (optional) 

<p>Let’s run the workload locally using <a href="https://wasmtime.dev">Wasmtime</a>, a small JIT-style runtime for Wasm and WASI. Since Wasmtime doesn’t support networking out of the box, we need to use the <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http#testing-using-the-wasmtime-http-binary">wrapper</a> provided by <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http">wasi-experimental-http</a>. You can build it from source using the below command.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http.git
# Build for your platform
cargo build
# move to any location that is added to your PATH variable
mv ./target/debug/wasmtime-http ~/bin/wasmtime-http
</code>   

<p>Now run the below command from the <code>rust-wasm</code> project folder:</p>

   <code>wasmtime-http target/wasm32-wasi/release/rust-wasm.wasm -a https://catfact.ninja/fact -e RUST_LOG=info
</code>   

 Run the workload in Kubernetes 

<p>Before you can run the workload in Kubernetes, you need to push the binary to a registry that supports OCI artifacts. OCI-compliant registries can be used for any OCI artifact, including Docker images, Wasm binaries, and so on. Docker Hub currently does not support OCI artifacts; hence you can use another registry like <a href="https://github.com/features/packages">GitHub Package Registry</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/container-registry/">Azure Container Registry</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry">Google Artifact Registry</a>. I’ll be using GitHub Package Registry as it’s the simplest to get started, and most of you might already have a GitHub account.</p>

<p>First, you need to log in to GitHub Package Registry using <code>docker login</code>. Create a <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">personal access token on GitHub</a> with the <code>write:packages</code> scope and use that to log in to the registry.</p>

   <code>export CR_PAT=&lt;your-token&gt;
echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u &lt;Your GitHub username&gt; --password-stdin
</code>   

<p>Now you need to push your Wasm binary as an OCI artifact; for this, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/engineerd/wasm-to-oci/releases">wasm-to-oci</a> CLI. Use the below command to install it on your machine. Download the appropriate version for your OS.</p>

   <code># Install for Linux
curl -LO https://github.com/engineerd/wasm-to-oci/releases/download/v0.1.2/linux-amd64-wasm-to-oci
# move to any location that is added to your PATH variable
mv linux-amd64-wasm-to-oci ~/bin/wasm-to-oci
</code>   

<p>Now you can push the binary you built earlier to the GitHub Package Registry. Run the below command from the <code>rust-wasm</code> folder.</p>

   <code>wasm-to-oci push target/wasm32-wasi/release/rust-wasm.wasm ghcr.io/&lt;your GitHub user&gt;/rust-wasm:latest
</code>   

<p>You should see a successful message. Now check the GitHub Packages page on your profile, and you should see the artifact listed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>By default, the artifact would be private, but you need to make it public so that you can access it from the Krustlet cluster. Click the package name and click the Package settings button, scroll down, click Change visibility, and change to public.</p>

<p>You can check this by pulling the artifact using the below command:</p>

   <code>wasm-to-oci pull ghcr.io/&lt;your GitHub user&gt;/rust-wasm:latest
</code>   

<p>Yay! You have successfully pushed your first Wasm artifact to an OCI registry. Now let’s deploy this to the Kubernetes cluster you created earlier.</p>

<p>Create a YAML file, let’s say <code>k8s.yaml</code>, with the following contents:</p>

   <code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: rust-wasi-example
  labels:
    app: rust-wasi-example
  annotations:
    alpha.wasi.krustlet.dev/allowed-domains: '["https://catfact.ninja/fact"]'
    alpha.wasi.krustlet.dev/max-concurrent-requests: "42"
spec:
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
  containers:
    - image: ghcr.io/&lt;your GitHub user&gt;/rust-wasm:latest
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      name: rust-wasi-example
      env:
        - name: RUST_LOG
          value: info
        - name: RUST_BACKTRACE
          value: "1"
  tolerations:
    - key: "node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable"
      operator: "Exists"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
    - key: "kubernetes.io/arch"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "wasm32-wasi"
      effect: "NoExecute"
    - key: "kubernetes.io/arch"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "wasm32-wasi"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
</code>   

<p>Note: Remember to replace <code>&lt;your GitHub user&gt;</code> with your own GitHub username.</p>

<p>The <code>annotations</code> and <code>tolerations</code> are significant. The annotations are used to allow external network calls from the krustlet, and the tolerations limit the pod to only schedule/run on Wasm nodes. We are also passing some environment variables that the application will use.</p>

<p>Now apply the manifest using the below command and check the pod status.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f k8s.yaml

kubectl get pods -o wide
# Output
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP       NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
rust-wasi-example   1/1     Running   0          6m50s   &lt;none&gt;   krustlet   &lt;none&gt;           &lt;none&gt;
</code>   

<p>You should see the Wasm workload running successfully on the Krustlet node. Let’s check the logs.</p>

   <code>kubectl logs rust-wasi-example
# Output
[2022-01-16T11:42:20Z INFO  rust_wasm] Cat Fact: Polydactyl cats (a cat with 1-2 extra toes on their paws) have this as a result of a genetic mutation. These cats are also referred to as 'Hemingway cats' because writer Ernest Hemingway reportedly owned dozens of them at his home in Key West, Florida.
[2022-01-16T11:43:21Z INFO  rust_wasm] Cat Fact: The way you treat a kitten in the early stages of its life will render its personality traits later in life.
</code>   

<p>Awesome. You have successfully created a Wasm workload using Rust and deployed it to a Kubernetes cluster without using containers.
If you’d like to take a look at this solution in full, check out the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-rust-webassembly-k8s-example">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

 So, are we ready to replace containers with WebAssembly? 

<p>WebAssembly on Kubernetes is not yet production-ready as a lot of the supporting ecosystem is still experimental, and WASI itself is still maturing. <a href="https://radu-matei.com/blog/towards-sockets-networking-wasi/">Networking is not yet stable</a> and the library ecosystem is only just coming along. Krustlet is also still in beta, and there is no straightforward way to run networking workloads, especially servers on it. <a href="https://wasmedge.org/">WasmEdge</a> is a more mature alternative solution for networking workloads, but it’s much more involved to set up and run than Krustlet on Kubernetes. <a href="https://wasmcloud.dev/">WasmCloud</a> is another project to keep an eye on. So, for the time being, Krustlet is suitable for running workloads for jobs and use cases involving cluster monitoring and so on. These are areas where you could use the extra performance anyway.</p>

<p>So, while Wasm on Kubernetes is exciting, and containerless on Kubernetes is definitely on the horizon. containerized applications are still the way to go for production use. This is especially true for networking workloads like microservices and web applications. But, given how fast the ecosystem is evolving, especially in the Rust + Wasm + WASI space, soon I expect we will be able to use Wasm workloads on Kubernetes for production.</p>

 🌎⚠️🔒 VaultAlert.net — Always know your crypto assets are&nbsp;safe  <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert.net</a> is a brand new service for the Verus ecosystem. Every user who set up the secure VerusID Vault can now check its status from anywhere in the&nbsp;world.  VerusID Vault: A secure place for your crypto&nbsp;assets <p>Vault is part of the <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">VerusID self-sovereign identity protocol</a>, built within the Verus multichain blockchain protocol. One of many VerusID features is that it functions as a human-readable cryptocurrency address. You can store $VRSC on your VerusID and lock them with Vault. In the future tokens and other bridged crypto-assets can also be stored and locked on a&nbsp;VerusID.</p><p>A locked VerusID can not spend, which means assets can not leave your VerusID. Even if someone has the private keys. It’s a revolutionary novel technology that will help many people from getting their crypto assets stolen. It can also be used for inheritance, trusts or vesting&nbsp;periods.</p><p>$VRSC that is locked with Vault can still stake. You can create a setup for yourself in which you won’t have to worry about your $VRSC being&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>In combination with other VerusIDs functioning as revocation and recovery authorities you can be a self-sovereign superpower. Having peace of mind and full control over your crypto assets is an incredibly powerful thing to&nbsp;have.</p> Revocation and Recovery Authorities <p>What if the private key of your VerusID is exposed? Maybe through your own fault, or a hacker that tries to steal your crypto assets. You don’t want anyone to be able to run away with your hard-earned assets. You’d want to be able to revoke access to that VerusID, so no one can do anything with the assets that are on it. And after that, you’d want to completely recover those assets into your own control. <a href="https://www.vaultalert.net/intro#RevocationAuthority">Read more here on how the revocation and recovery authorities function.</a></p> TimeLock &amp; DelayLock <p>Vault has two different options to lock your assets, TimeLock and DelayLock. You can only choose one option to lock the Vault. And the only way to circumvent a locked Vault is through revoking and recovering the&nbsp;VerusID.</p>  With TimeLock you determine how long you want the Vault to be locked. After the determined period is over the assets can be spent again. The maximum amount of time the Vault can be locked is 21&nbsp;years.  With DelayLock you determine a cooldown period. You lock the Vault and have to request an unlock. After requesting the unlock you have to wait for the determined cooldown period before the assets can be spent&nbsp;again.   VaultAlert.net <p>So how does it work? You can search for any VerusID on <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert.net</a> and it shows you all you need to know about the Vault status and&nbsp;more.</p>  LOCKED: the Vault is locked and funds can not be&nbsp;spent  UNLOCK SOON: the Vault is locked but gets unlocked within a time period of 30&nbsp;days.  NO LOCK: Vault is not active and thus funds can be&nbsp;spent.  DelayLock or&nbsp;TimeLock  Primary address: The primary address is the owner of the VerusID, as it contains the private key. It can contain more than one&nbsp;VerusID.  Identity address (also called i-address): The identity address is, next to the name, the identifier of the&nbsp;VerusID.  Revocation and recovery VerusID authorities   🌎⚠️🔒 <a href="https://www.vaultalert.net/Steal%20my%20VRSC@">Check out VaultAlert.net yourself with this example&nbsp;VerusID.</a>  Be a self-sovereign superpower <p>If you want to be at the forefront of Verus’ cutting edge technology then you should not waste any time and get yourself a VerusID for a small fee (which goes to the miners and stakers of the network). <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Download Verus Desktop</a>, or <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">join our Discord to engage with the worldwide community</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/%EF%B8%8F-vaultalert-net-always-know-your-crypto-assets-are-safe-a20b4d537c61">🌎⚠️🔒 VaultAlert.net — Always know your crypto assets are safe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Banking at the speed of now requires financial institutions to process payments quickly and maintain compliance. Today, open banking lets Financial Institutions (FIs), payment platforms and fintechs deliver payment services with the speed and ease that consumers now demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But many organizations still rely on outdated methods to process payments, forcing consumers to wait. They could and should be supporting lightning-fast, real-time payments, recurring payments, refunds and disbursements. Practices like micro-deposits and pre-notifications for account opening and funding or payment processing jam up the experience. Delays around bank account details and balance verification don’t help, either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stakes are high. According to one <a href="https://www.onespan.com/resources/cornerstone-digital-identity-verification-report">industry report</a>, twice as many consumers walk away when faced with <a href="https://www.onespan.com/resources/cornerstone-digital-identity-verification-report">slower methods</a>. “The abandonment rate for FIs that do not require micro-deposits for ACH funding is 13%–in contrast to 27% for those that do.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dissatisfied customers can overwhelm customer support channels when these methods fail. Even worse, scammers love to exploit these older practices to gain rogue access to accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter: Finicity, a Mastercard company<a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our open banking platform meets the needs of digital consumers and the digital payment ecosystem by enabling clients to verify the essential account details, owners, and balances that are needed to transfer, get paid or set up an account with confidence.</p>
<p>Digital payments just make sense. One <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">study</a> shares that close to three-quarters of consumers have or would connect their bank accounts for digital payments. In another <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2016/what-suppliers-want-checks-cards-and-ach-preferences/">survey from PYMNTS</a> of supply-side organizations, the majority (63%) said they prefer being paid electronically, specifically via ACH. Just one-quarter wanted to get paid by paper check.</p>
<p>Read more: Learn how to harness the power of open banking for secure, rapid, delivery of consumer payments –<a href="https://www.finicity.com/payment-open-banking-effect/"> Download our free eBook now!</a></p>
<p>Our platform relies on open banking innovations to support a wide range of digital payment experiences for FIs and consumers. A few popular use cases include:</p>
 
 Secure account opening and funding&nbsp; 
 Mortgage and consumer loan repayment/servicing 
 P2P money transfers 
 Direct ACH payments (P2M) 
 Funding digital wallets 
 Government disbursements 
 Recurring, account-based bill payments&nbsp; 
 Buy-Now-Pay-Later and installment-style credit 
 
 Move Money With Confidence 
<p>We designed our platform behind a driving principle: Pay Confidently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means reliably fast data and superior, API-based connections with leading financial institutions. We layered in added intelligence and deep learning which can help to mitigate fraud while reducing payment failure and pesky NSF fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each year, more of the world’s leading banks, fintechs, and payment platform providers deliver faster, more secure consumer payments with the power of open banking.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing how you’ll use open banking capabilities to exceed your customers’ expectations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously…<br><br>Staking rewards were allocated each era, but these rewards needed to be triggered in order to payout. This manual step required validators or stakers to initiate the rewards payout for each validator in each era. As soon as a validator or staker requests a payout for an era, all the stakers for that validator would receive the rewards into their accounts. </p><p>After liaising with our community and taking into account the feedback, we’ve made some changes to this process. Dock has now enabled these payments to take place automatically. </p><p>The New Process</p><p>Validators and stakers will no longer have to manually request a rewards payout. The payout will occur automatically after each era. Now validators can continue to produce blocks and validate blocks made by other validators without worrying about claiming the rewards after each era. Rewards will be paid to the winning validators and their stakers accounts after each era, automatically. </p><p>The automatic staking process also saves validators the cost of running the transactions to issue the payouts for each era. This cost will be covered by the Dock Association moving forward with funds from the Dock Treasury.</p><p>The only time the rewards payout after each era will not be automatic is when the validators commission is over 5%. If the validators commission is set to over 5%, the manual process as mentioned above will come into play. Only when the rewards payout is triggered, will the payout be made.</p><p>Start staking today and get the rewards paid to your account automatically.

<p>We had a busy fourth quarter 2021 at Northern Block working on NB Orbit, our suite of self-sovereign identity products.</p>
<p>We feel quite fortunate to be on the forefront of bringing SSI closer to mass adoption. We’re working alongside great partners and customers who have the same goal. Everything we build is to further this mission.</p>
<p>Through the NB Orbit Platform, organizations can deploy digital credentialing ecosystems, become credential issuers, accept digital credentials within workflows and use a variety of digital wallets and agents to connect and exchange credentials.</p>
<p>Note: throughout this post, when we refer to the NB Orbit Platform, we’re talking about our enterprise products (e.g., Issuer, Verifier), which you can read more about towards the end of this post</p>
<p>In this post we’ll cover some of the major items we worked on during Q4 2021 within our suite of products.</p>
 <br>
1&nbsp; B2B Interactions &amp; Credential Exchanges 
<p>Legal entities are required to be holders of credentials, just like people. We started seeing more demand for organization credentials (e.g., audit results, financial proofs, ESG credentials), so we wanted to provide a way for our customers to easily manage them through a user interface.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
We built in features on the NB Orbit Platform where a person acting on behalf of their organization can view their organization’s credentials, and interact on behalf of it with offers and proof requests. The features include:</p>
 
 Accepting connection invitations from other Organization (cloud wallets) 
 Accepting credential offers from connected Organization (cloud wallets) 
 Displaying the list of credentials stored in the cloud wallet with pagination or card layout 
 Receiving proof requests from connected Organization (cloud wallets) 
 Displaying received proof requests with pagination 
 Displaying the list of credentials available for requested proof 
 Attribute selection option while generating the proof 
 
 <br>
2&nbsp; Verified Business – Enhancements 
<p></p>
<p>With increasing compliance and AML requirements, the veracity and source of company data have become a central point in combating money laundering and other frauds. We started seeing an increasing demand from clients to validate legal entity data at source.</p>
<p>Onboarding in a self-sovereign manner to digital trust ecosystems is different than in federated models. When network operators manage a trust network and an entity connects into the network and begins transacting, it’s important to first ensure that it’s&nbsp; a verified entity, and that the claims the entity makes about itself are verified using a trusted source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enables the NB Orbit Platform to create ecosystems for trusted entities to conduct business and daily operations.</p>
 <br>
3&nbsp; Support for Multiple Verifiable Data Registries 
<p>Our customers do not want to have multiple wallets to hold their credentials. Instead they prefer to have one wallet and connect with multiple verifiable data registries from this one wallet to receive verifiable credential offers and provide proofs.</p>
<p>Therefore we added the option to select from multiple Indy-based networks on the mobile device so that it can function with other networks.</p>
<p>See below how our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a> was used to show network interoperability with the BCovrin Indy Network:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
4&nbsp; Customized Wallet Branding 
<p>Many of our customers have their existing branding that they wish to leverage for their customers, employees or vendors.</p>
<p>To enable them to provide a customized user experience to their end users, we wanted to ensure&nbsp; the process of white labeling our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet </a>was quick and easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now offer two ways to get a customized branded wallet:&nbsp;</p>
 
 We work with you to collect information we need for whitelabelling such as colour guides, assets, texts, and languages (more on the multi language support below). 
 We can provide you with a base Figma file&nbsp; and once your designs are finalized, we will quickly implement them. 
 
<p>Once assets are collected, it’s a fairly automated process from then on to have a build ready for private or public distribution via mobile app stores.</p>
<p>Below is a customer of ours, <a href="http://thrivacy.io/">Thrivacy</a>, who we worked with to quickly launch of their SSI&nbsp;Mobile Wallet &amp; Enterprise Issuer/Verifier product suite.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
5&nbsp; Multi Language Support 
<p>We now offer language selection in our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>. Being a Canadian company, it’s very important that we can offer multilingual options to Canadian citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now support two languages: English and French. We will be expanding to offer other languages based on our roadmap and needs from our partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re looking for other languages or simply to modify certain existing text copy for your branded app, the process is now extremely simple thanks to the good work put in by our wallet team to make the code modular and scalable.</p>
 6&nbsp; Verified Person – Enhancements 
<p>We use ID Proofing within our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a> for use cases where a high-level of assurance on the person is needed from a Government-issued ID perspective.</p>
<p>We added assurance to our Verified Person by including more checks and controls over the digitization process.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
7&nbsp; Digitize Any Document 
<p>There exists lots of authentic and valuable data/documents that aren’t digitally available today. Therefore, rather than waiting for various industries (source data owners/issuers) to go fully digital, we’ve decided there is a continuous need for digitization – turning physical or digital documents into machine readable data. The value of digitizing them is massive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We implemented a powerful AI-based document parser in our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>&nbsp;to support the digitization of any document with a standard structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use an AI-based algorithm that can be trained to support any structured documents.</p>
<p>The use case here is to provide attested documents without going to the attestor physically (e.g., lawyer or notary’s office). We digitized a manual process which takes a ton of time, causes friction/effort and has a cost.. With our document parser, the attestors can instead issue digital credentials remotely. Rather than a stamped seal on a document, attestors can use the NB Orbit Platform to issue cryptographic digital signatures.<br>
</p>
<p>The other value we see is that this process doesn’t have to be repeated over and over again, as verifiable credentials are reusable, once again saving cost and time.</p>
 <br>
8&nbsp; Proof Requests – Enhancements 
<p>With use cases that enable the supply of many verifiable credentials with the same schemas, it’s important that the holder can pick and choose the right verifiable credential during a proof request.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you purchased a microwave from Walmart and it’s broken – you may want to return it – and you’ll need to show your receipt credential. Or perhaps you are looking to get insurance coverage for your microwave – you will need to prove the item and purchase information to the insurer. In both of these scenarios, when the verifier asks for a proof request, you need to show your microwave credential from Walmart (issuer), rather than other credentials you have with the same schema.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We built this functionality into our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>&nbsp;to allow holders to do just that. We also worked on updates in our Mobile SDK to enable this.</p>
<p>We see this whole process as becoming more intelligent with time as smart agents become able to pull out most relevant credentials based on context, while learning over time.</p>
 <br>
9&nbsp; P2P Messaging Between Agents – Enhancements 
<p>From Kaliya’s post on <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/understanding-didcomm-14da547ca36b">Understanding DIDComm</a>:</p>
<p>“If you are reading this, you probably know already what Decentralized Identifiers (DID) are: they are “identifiers” or addresses which can be queried to return some information about the subject represented.”</p>
<p>Continued: “DIDComm is a cross-community standard that creates libraries and design patterns for two or more DID-controlling entities from diverse DID-based systems to communicate directly with one another. It creates a secure communication channel between software controlled by each of these entities, which can be people, organizations or things. This constitutes an “authenticated channel,” in that control of a given DID’s private keys is, barring a failure of design or operational security, proof of authenticity of the party represented by that DID.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIDComm messaging is such a powerful mechanism to achieve security, privacy, decentralization, and transport independence. Most messaging software today is routed through centralized servers. Although different encryption methods are used by them, there’s still an entity between yourself and the other entity you’re communicating with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wanted to give more flexibility to the multitude of use cases we are seeing by enabling chat to happen over DIDComm, independent of what role and system you’re using in the SSI trust triangle. We built in a web interface on the Enterprise Platform where organizations can now directly chat with their employees, customers, vendors, partners, etc.</p>
<p>We now support chat across these types of relationships:</p>
<p></p>
 10&nbsp; NB Orbit Mobile Wallet Demonstrates AIP 1.0 Compliance 
<p>As Canadian and European governments prepare to issue digital identities to their citizens (e.g., passports, driver’s licences, health cards), ensuring ownership, control and interoperability of data is paramount.</p>
<p>Northern Block has committed itself to compliance with open source projects which lead to the interoperability of verifiable credentials. In November 2021, we worked with the Digital Identity Laboratory of Canada to have them evaluate conformance of our wallet technology to the Hyperledger Aries Interoperability Profile.</p>
<p>The IDLab team conducted the testing of the NB Orbit mobile wallet on both iOS and Android devices, running testing within the IDLab’s technology environment.</p>

11&nbsp; General Platform Operation Enhancements 
<p>Lastly, in Q4 2021 we also continued enhancing general functionalities, infrastructure and security features of our product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To recap on our NB Orbit suite of products:</p>
 
 NB Orbit Digital Wallets – store personal credentials using our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>. Store organization-related credentials in our Organizational Cloud Wallet. Maintain high-levels of assurance around identities through integrated ID proofing solutions. 
 NB Orbit Issuer – a Hyperledger Aries cloud agent and controller that can create and issue verifiable credentials.&nbsp; It can create invitations to holders to connect and to track the status of connection invites and credential offers.&nbsp; The issuer has a web interface to provide users with the controls for handling connections and credential issuances.&nbsp; 
 NB Orbit Trust Registry – a server application used to provision new issuer and verifiers.&nbsp; It handles the process to invite, authorize and orchestrate the cloud containers for each issuer and verifier on the platform. 
 NB Orbit Verifier – a Hyperledger Aries cloud agent and controller that can create proof templates and initiate proof requests. It can create invitations to holders to connect and to track the status of connection invites and proof requests. The verifier has a web interface to provide users with the controls to handle connections and credential verifications. 
 NB Orbit Verifiable Data Registry – a Hyperledger Indy network running four nodes.&nbsp; It is used to hold credential schemas and definitions as well as the DID Documents for the public DIDs of the issuers and verifiers.&nbsp; The DID Documents contain information such as the public key and endpoints of the issuers and verifiers.&nbsp; No data pertaining to the holders is ever stored in this network. Alongside this, we also run a revocation registry – a cryptographic tails files store that provides credentials issued based on a credential definition to be revoked.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 NB Orbit Mediator – a store and forward system that provides the mobile wallets with a static endpoint. Mobile devices are not guaranteed to be available online when a cloud agent needs to communicate with them.&nbsp; The mediator acts as an answering machine for the mobile wallet and will forward on the encrypted messages it has received when the mobile device is back online.

 The Sovereign Yidindji Government (SYG) has issued and deployed the Sovereign Yidindji Dollar successfully using MetaMUI Identity-based Blockchain Sovereign Yidindji has successfully issued their own Central Bank Digital Currency(CBDC) <br>“Sovereign Yidindji Dollar” on top of MetaMUI Blockchain<p>After more than half a year of intense collaboration between Sovereign Yidindji Government(SYG) and MetaMUI, the team had successfully issued a fully functioning Central Bank Digital Currency using the revolutionary technology of MetaMUI, the world’s first Identity-based Blockchain.</p><p>While hundreds of CBCD projects are cropping up around the world, most projects are still at the research or Proof of Concept stage. Only a few, such as ‘Sand Dollar’ in the Bahamas, and ‘e-Naira’ in Nigeria, have launched CBCD so far. Yidinji Dollar has four distinctive features which differentiate it from&nbsp;others.</p><p>● Yidindji Dollar is the first Central Bank Digital Currency issued by the “CBDC Issuance Platform.”<br>● Yidindji Dollar was issued only in digital currency without any paper bills.<br>● A new payment system connected with MetaMUI’s SSID system is used in all retail stores and government offices. Payment can be processed without using the dedicated network, there is no transaction fee, sales settlement is done immediately, and cross-border payment can be made without using Visa or Mastercard.<br>● It is a convertible currency whose collateral assets are gold and silver and other minerals and natural resources such as green and blue carbon. Money issuance, backed by a digital certificate, is also backed with collateral assets. Convertible currencies ended in 1971 when President Nixon stopped the exchange between the dollar and gold. It is the first convertible currency since Nixon and the first digital currency.</p><p>MetaMUI is the first identity-based token blockchain that combines the concept of self-sovereign identity and decentralized blockchain. Self-sovereign identity is a decentralized identity that protects users’ privacy. It avoids the problem of centralized censorship and the abuse of private information. The Sovereign Yidindji Government has already built the national identity system utilizing MetaMUI’s technology. Therefore every Yidjindji citizen, Yidindji company, and Yidindji organization can create their own digital identity, own various digital assets, and make payment with Yidindji&nbsp;Dollar.</p><p>“Yidindji is the first nation to choose MetaMUI’s CBDC platform. MetaMUI platform allows any country to publish the state-of-the-art CBDC within a few days at a fraction of the cost. MetaMUI platform also provides a single integrated solution for national identity, e-Government, peer-to-peer payment, digital certificates, and cross-border payment.” said Phantom Seokgu Yun, CEO of&nbsp;MetaMUI.</p><p>“The benefits of central bank digital currencies are profound, and it is only a matter of time before they are implemented by countries around the world,” said Don Tapscott, Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute. “But they need to be done right to safeguard citizen privacy and to interoperate around the world. I am delighted to see this technology used to build a more sustainable future for the people of the Sovereign Yidindji Government in Australia.”</p><p>Loretta Joseph, an advisor of MetMUI, who connected with the Sovereign Yidindji Government, said, “I am very excited for the oldest civilization to adapt to the 21st century by embracing technology and change for a more inclusive and better&nbsp;world”.</p><p>The Sovereign Yidindji Government is an Aboriginal Australian micronation, and its territory is home to some of the world’s most pristine rainforests. Academics and scientists claim the Yidindji people have been around for more than 60 thousand years, so it is one of the oldest living cultures on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>“‘Gayaburra galin nyundu’ With the blessing of Yeshua Hamashiach, the Yidindji nation is becoming a fully digitized nation, thanks to MetaMUI revolutionary technology we made a leapfrog towards the future. The Yidindji reserve currency will stabilise and add security, it will also ensure credibility to the global economy and financial system. Yidindji’s participation not only makes sense being logical, but it is also inevitable. The world is now ready for the indigenous peoples to underwrite a new future.” said Gudju-Gudju Gimuybara, Chief Minister of&nbsp;SYG.</p> About Yidindji <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qjX1OysGbk4">Yidindji people</a> are a rainforest-based society with several clan groups in the area described as far north Queensland on the Australian continent. The Yidindji territory is home to some of the world’s most pristine rainforests and is an essential gateway to the great barrier reef. Academics and scientists claim the Yidindji people have been around for more than 60 thousand years, so it is one of the oldest living cultures on the planet. In 2014, history was made on September 20 as the official government of the Yidindji nation came into life with the launch of its coat of arms. Since then, the SYG, as it is known, has created several departments, and its parliament continues to pass laws for the peace, order, and good governance of the Yidindji territory. SYG has 17 ministers and 22 ministries and plans to be the first government to become entirely digitized in its venture towards e-governance.</p> About MetaMUI <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b-W5nwN9dMU">MetaMUI</a> is the first identity-based token blockchain. The design approach of MetaMUI is opposite to most cryptocurrencies and other anonymous token blockchains. In contrast, most token technologies follow the anonymous token design of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc. MetaMUI chose to redesign the blockchain structure based on identity entirely. The main reason for this is to satisfy the regulatory framework of current financial systems such as FATF’s travel&nbsp;rule.</p><p>[SOVEREIGN WALLET NETWORK ‘SWN’] is the genius behind the development of the MetaMUI identity-based blockchain. The Sovereign Wallet Network (SWN) has redesigned the blockchain and developed the MetaMUI blockchain. We are proud to provide the state-of-the-art 4th generation blockchain with a mainnet launched on January 3, 2021. The Sovereign Wallet is located in six (6) different countries globally, with headquarters in Singapore and offices in Korea, Sweden, the United States, India, and Uzbekistan. The MetaMUI blockchain is paving the way towards building the Internet of Sovereign Digital Currencies (IoSDC).

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Have you entered a password somewhere today? Do you wonder why you’re still having to do that? Did entering that password give you a feeling of digital safety? Did it make your consumer experience more enjoyable?</p>
<p>Cybersecurity and identity management experts have been proclaiming the benefits of and absolute necessity of Multifactor Authentication (MFA) and risk-adaptive authentication for years now.&nbsp; MFA is the leading concept for implementing strong authentication, which is defined as the combination of two or more of the following: something you know, something you have, or something you are. Indeed, you won’t hear anyone in the field deny that MFA and risk-adaptive authentication are two of the best ways to reduce cybercrime and fraud, particularly account takeover (ATO) fraud. But we enter passwords every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every. Single. Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn’t improve security, and it doesn’t make for a pleasant user experience. So why are we still doing it?&nbsp;</p>
 
 Security and user satisfaction are just not high enough priorities in some organizations yet&nbsp; 
 
<p>That’s it, there’s no need for a second bullet point. Here are some common retorts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Security and user satisfaction are important to our org, but we don’t have the budget.” Find the budget. Authentication system and service upgrades are not as expensive as you may think. The offset against potential fraud risks, especially in certain sectors, can be demonstrated to pay for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We haven’t had any security incidents tied to password breaches.”&nbsp; Are you sure? Even if that’s true, it’s only a matter of time before it does happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re a small business, the big cybercriminals aren’t targeting us.” The days when big global brands and big banks were exclusively targeted are gone. If your organization has something of value or processes transactions of any kind, then it is likely already on the radar of cybercriminals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have legacy Line of Business (LOB) applications that don’t interoperate with identity and authentication standards.”&nbsp; Admittedly, this is a tougher issue. Most IAM and IDaaS authentication services allow for customization to address compatibility for older applications. It’s probably harder to integrate old apps, but not impossible. Moreover, legacy LOB apps often reside on unsupported operating systems which are more vulnerable to exploits. A project to upgrade authentication may have additional security benefits if legacy apps on out-of-service OSes can be removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Users are used to entering passwords.” That may be true, but it doesn’t mean we like doing it. Many of us know that passwords are weak security. It makes us wonder what else you’re doing wrong. When security conscious users enter passwords into websites or mobile apps, we doubt that those organizations are committed to the security of our information and finances. Repeated entering of passwords leads to reduced trust in the organization asking for passwords. Erosion of trust leads to diminishing customer loyalty, lost business, and shrinking revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insecurity leads to doubt, doubt leads to mistrust, and mistrust leads to the dark downside of lost business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of us have been waiting for years for the promise of passwordless authentication. IAM vendors typically define passwordless as removing password databases from centralized systems, thereby improving security by reducing the likelihood of password breaches. Mobile phone-based biometrics and FIDO are good examples of passwordless authentication. It’s important to note that although password databases may be omitted in passwordless authentication systems, users may still have to enter passwords or PINs occasionally, but those factors are evaluated locally on the users’ devices.&nbsp; We have, however, fortunately observed that the number of completely passwordless solutions in the market is increasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, thanks to many excellent authentication solutions and services available in the market, it’s never been easier for organizations that still use traditional passwords with centralized databases to move away from them. For more information on authentication solutions, see <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research?q=authentication&amp;f=&amp;ref=eic22blogjohn" title="KuppingerCole Research">KuppingerCole Research</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we can’t get to fully passwordless, we’ll settle for password-fewer. Password authentication can be augmented by risk analysis. Many sites that still appear to use passwords are actually doing sophisticated examination of many attributes in the background. This is what social media, some big retailers, and other forward-looking organizations are doing. Their users have passwords “on file” but rarely have to use them because of the advanced risk analysis that going on behind the scenes. Examples of contextual information considered includes device intelligence, IP address (history and reputation), browser attributes, geo-location of request, time/day, etc. All these data points can be compared at transaction time to a per-user historical baseline. In cases like this, the password is the fallback. If the risk analysis concludes that the request context is within acceptable parameters, the user doesn’t get prompted to re-enter a password, get an email/SMS OTP, etc. It’s smooth surfing. Only if the risk analysis shows a significant deviation would the user be asked to explicitly demonstrate they are who they say they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unobtrusive nature of risk-adaptive / password-fewer authentication is a win-win for those who deploy it: they reduce their own risks of loss from fraud while providing a better experience for their customers. Happy customers mean repeat business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best of all, MFA and risk-adaptive authentication can go hand-in-hand. Risk-adaptive authentication systems can leverage MFA methods for those cases where they do sense something is amiss in the request context and need to re-authenticate or step-up authentication for certain types of transactions. Mobile push notifications, mobile biometrics, and FIDO authenticators improve usability and security concomitantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than continuing to wait on the organizations we interact with to update their authentication systems, how do we move forward?&nbsp;</p>
 
 Ask. Use available contact methods such as emailing support or chat options. At least requests are registered. Honestly this method has not met with much success.&nbsp; 
 Ask more formally. Contact CISOs of organizations that use weak authentication and respectfully request that they implement MFA and risk-based authentication to reduce their risk and protect your information and assets better. Consider having an attorney send a letter on your behalf. If the organization in question does not have a CISO, find contacts for their legal counsel, CIO, CTO, or another high-level position that has the power to make positive changes.&nbsp; 
 Look for more secure alternatives in the marketplace. If you feel that your info and assets are not being properly protected by the service providers you are currently doing business with, then look for those that do offer the kind of security that you need.&nbsp; 
 
<p>It’s time for consumers to make their concerns and desires for a more secure ecommerce ecosystem known. Join us at EIC in Berlin in May for a vibrant discussion on the latest authentication technologies and how implementing them can protect organizations, consumers, and improve business.&nbsp;</p>

 Highlights <p>In the face of the upcoming Metaverse revolution, DID has demonstrated its powerful utility: it will serve as the entrance to the Metaverse and carry the user’s trusted identity and privacy data. Therefore, we need mature DID technology for the underlying infrastructure. Ontology has been working in the DID industry for several years and has gradually reached different partnerships around the world. At the same time, ONTO, a DID-based gateway for a seamless Web3 experience, will continue to expand its multi-chain asset and dApp support, to promote the development of the Metaverse.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet. Developers are welcome to conduct various tests. Related documents can be obtained at the <a href="https://docs.ont.io/">Ontology Developer Center</a>.  We are 100% done with the survey on the improvement of the ONT and ONG decimals and we are 86% done with&nbsp;testing.  We are 80% done with the survey on the RISCV’s simplified instruction set architecture.  We are 62% done with the truebit challenge design&nbsp;survey.  We are 35% done with the Rollup VM&nbsp;design.   Product Development   ONTO App v4.1.7 was released, bringing support for dApps on Solana and adding the App Lock&nbsp;feature.  ONTO hosted a liquidity mining campaign with <a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-sil-finance-team-up-for-a-3-000-liquidity-mining-campaign-ed3aacf73725">SIL Finance</a>. The first 100 participants who used ONTO to participate in the event had the opportunity to earn rewards. ONTO Mythical NFT and Infinium NFT holders got additional rewards.  ONTO hosted an NFT lottery campaign with <a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-shambala-team-up-for-a-1-000-nft-lottery-6c537ab6109c">Shambala</a>, releasing 100 co-branded NFTs. Participants who bought one ONTO Shambalaverse NFT had the chance to win a bonus. The activity has successfully concluded.  ONTO is hosting a campaign with <a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-and-naos-finance-team-up-for-a-liquidity-mining-campaign-with-over-2-000-up-for-grabs-ac8d4ef69e1b">NAOS Finance</a>. The first 150 participants who use ONTO to participate in the event have the opportunity to earn rewards. The event is in progress, and will end at 17:00 (Singapore time) on January&nbsp;28th.  ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://gleam.io/sYhLi/onto-teams-up-with-monster-battle-for-1500-mbs-giveaway">Monster Battle</a>. Participants who completed related tasks had the opportunity to earn rewards. The event has successfully concluded, with more than 800 participants.  ONTO hosted an NFT lottery campaign with <a href="https://gleam.io/OSYKO/phoodle-bears-122124-5-nfts">Phoodle Bears</a>. Participants who completed related tasks had the opportunity to earn rewards. The event has successfully concluded.   On-Chain Activity   125 total dApps on MainNet as of January 24th,&nbsp;2022.  6,869,583 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 7,243 from last&nbsp;week.  16,980,667 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 31,049 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1484246853189193729?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “how to make the blockchain acceptable”. The Ontology community believed that in order to be accepted by the mainstream, it is necessary to guide the positive development of the blockchain industry and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent incidents. A reputation system based on DID will be one of the solutions. When everyone’s reputation is linked to their behavior, and data cannot be tampered with, people need to carefully maintain their reputation.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He talked with community members about why Ontology chose to set up an office in Berlin, Germany, and its positive impact. By opening the new office in Berlin, Ontology is excited to contribute to the continent’s ongoing efforts to create a more secure web. Benny also shared the upcoming Valentine’s Day event, community members said that they will definitely participate in this romantic and meaningful event.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.

It has redefined how technology should function and what it means to create value and utility. As the world continues to teeter on the brink of chaos because of the uneven distribution of resources and center-oriented control, Web3 technologies provide a way out.&nbsp;”</p><p>In the end, there will not be a single blockchain, but rather a collection of different chains, each with their own characteristics, benefits, and subcultures. Whilst there will be competition, there is also tremendous opportunity for collaboration for the benefit of the overall ecosystem and user experience. Ontology will continue to optimize deeper product integrations across different blockchains. With a focus on DID and data, users will be on-boarded into the Ontology experience for secure, self-sovereign control over their digital existence.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and welcome to a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity in this new year, 2022. And we have, after some time, again, our friends of the Open Identity Exchange. And today, our guest is Nick Mothershaw. He is the Chief Identity Strategist at the Open Identity Exchange, a community for all those involved in the identity sector to connect and collaborate.</p>
<p>Nick has expert knowledge of Identity and Fraud techniques, solutions and standards across a wide variety of different sectors and jurisdictions. Nick was previously Director of Identity and Fraud at Experian, where he was responsible for the development of Experian’s fraud and identity solutions for both the public and private sectors. Nick led Experian’s development, launch and operation of a full “Identity as a Service” solution, which was the first live example of a digital identity being seamlessly interoperable across public and private sector.</p>
<p>Hello, Nick.</p>
<p>Nick Mothershaw: Hello, Oscar. Hello.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s great having you, Nick.</p>
<p>Nick: It’s a pleasure to be here. And yeah, Happy New Year to you and all your listeners, very exciting to be at the start of 2022, which I think it’s going to be an amazing and transformational year for digital identity. So this is a really timely conversation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And I know you have new things to tell us. So yeah, Nick, let’s talk about digital identity. But I’d like to start hearing a bit more about yourself, so please tell us about your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Nick: Yeah, it’s been a long journey now. So I was originally involved in, I guess, in identity when I worked with law enforcement, providing crime management and intelligence management systems. And after that, we started looking at biometrics. So around the year 2000, we were using biometrics to help identify criminals from group photographs and also using facial mapping to look at, where we used to use these E-FITs, these faces that were being drawn by computer that were put out on things like crime watch programmes, so we’re using facial biometrics to match those two databases of known and suspected criminals. And that was way back in 2000.</p>
<p>So from there, I moved to look more in detail at fraud and around identity fraud, specifically, and how can identity fraud be detected and prevented. So using algorithms, anomaly detection, graph-based analysis to bind identity fraud in the finance ecosystem initially, and then into insurance and telcos.</p>
<p>And the flip side of that is, of course, identity. So if you strongly identify the individual, the risk of fraud is reduced. So this fraud and identity became two sides of the same coin. And as we put our business, Experian, around fraud and identity, we both evolved the fraud solutions to be more and more sophisticated, but also involved the identity side of the coin, to leverage data that can prove to the individual’s identity to scan documents, to bring those together into complete Identity-as-a-Service management.</p>
<p>So around 2015, we built an Identity-as-a-Service platform. And that enabled us to identify end users both of Experian systems and, in the UK, Gov.Uk Verify users. So we were able to take users through a proofing process using data, using passports and driving licenses, using – getting payments into open banking, with PINs on. And that enabled us to strongly proof an individual.</p>
<p>And alongside that we ran all the fraud controls we created as well. So we mitigated against identity fraud to create a really strongly trusted ID. There was a reusable ID, and users could use the identity to both log on to Experian’s credit management systems, credit reference systems and also in the UK, log onto government systems through the Gov.UK Verify framework. So we were the only identity provider who did that – had both a public-private interoperable login for users, which meant I only had to have one password, only one set of credentials, to access multiple different services at a high level of trust. So we’re really proud that we built that and that was delivered into UK Verify.</p>
<p>As part of that, I got involved in the Open Identity Exchange. So I was Vice Chair for a while and then became Chair. And then just over two years ago now, I decided I wanted to spend all of my time driving forward this vision of digital identity so that we could all have a digital ID that is trusted, that is accepted ubiquitously and our lives, our digital lives are made so much easier because our trusted information is available, it’s controlled by us, and is shareable by us to those who need to understand who we are and what we’re eligible to do for different use cases, different services all over the world. I really strongly believe in that vision and joined OIX as Chief Identity Strategist, so just over two years ago now to help OIX, as a members’ body, to help its members collectively pursue and achieve that vision.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, fantastic experience you had in Experian. That sounds quite exciting what you were doing there. And also, now I can hear your motivation to work here in OIX. Excellent.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned earlier, we had before, around a bit more than two years ago, we had in this podcast show and at that time, it was <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/don-thibeau-openid-foundation/" title="Don Thibeau">Don Thibeau</a> representing the OIX. And he was talking about the need for a global approach to identity. And he also has mentioned a little bit of that. But something that came to, I think everybody who is involved in the digital identity space in the last months has been the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/global-assured-identity-network-gain-elizabeth-garber/" title="GAIN">GAIN</a> white paper. And we know that both OIX and I think also yourself have been involved in that. So could you tell us a bit about that? What is the OIX’s role within GAIN?</p>
<p>Nick: Yeah, absolutely. So GAIN, Global Assured Identity Network, was a white paper that was released back in September, and was created over the summer. In the end, over 150 different authors put their name to that paper. And the vision was that – lots of people shared the vision, I’ve just articulated. This vision that an identity can be used in an interoperable way and that will work internationally. So 150 plus people, all sharing that vision, put their name to that paper.</p>
<p>The paper was collectively created; fortunately a few people held the pen, not 150, or else it would never have come. We’d never have got anything coherent out. We mostly created a collective paper that had the backing of 154 people, I think it was in the end, they all shared that same vision. And that vision is that an ID can be accepted anywhere around the globe. And that’s a massively ambitious statement. And to do that, the GAIN term was coined, the Global Assured Identity Network. To make that possible, there needs to be some kind of network on a global basis and that that work enables trust, to the number of different elements of GAIN.</p>
<p>So we released the paper, and then five organisations have kind of rallied around that vision, taking different parts and delivering it. So firstly, on the technical side, the Open Identity Foundation, the foundation is looking at OK, how do that vision achieve technically? How can we communicate trust from one domain to another, from one framework to another, from one country to another? And they’re looking at the different technical rails of how that makes possible.</p>
<p>OIX is looking at the legal, the operational, the governance elements that would sit above that technical layer. And arguably, and my other colleagues sometimes say that this is true, that’s the harder bit. So we can communicate some information about an individual. But what does that information mean? And I’ll come back to that in a minute. And that’s one of the key challenges OIX is looking at.</p>
<p>The other organisations involved in it are <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/">GLEIF</a>, Global Legal Entity Identity Foundation. So wherever we’ve got a legal actor in here, an organisation, GLEIF have a role to play in identifying who that organisation is, both in terms of parties providing information, but also consuming information and being the identity asserters themselves where it’s an organisational ID.</p>
<p>For the Cloud Signature Consortium, because this links closely into digital signing, digital signatures. And once we know who the user is, we want to legally enter into a relationship with them in many use cases.</p>
<p>And then the International Institute of Finance is looking at how, across the finance community, how can that community both be involved as consumers of identities – because finance is a key area we need to prove who you are – but also providers of identities. In many countries already in the Nordics, in Canada, we’ve got banks playing the role of identity providers, and that’s likely to happen in a lot of other countries. So IIF are playing that dual role of representing identity consuming community and providing community.</p>
<p>So these five organisations have now come together to drive GAIN forward. And so OIX’s focus area is the, as we term it, the trust framework element. So let’s imagine that I can communicate information about an individual. So that individual has a Belgian ID, for instance. And they’re trying to assert their identity in Indonesia. So I can tell that the relying party in Indonesia, who the person is. I can give them the name, the address, the date of birth, the national ID number, maybe, to identify who they are, which is relevant in Belgium, that means nothing in Indonesia. I can tell who the identity provider is that has provided that information. I tell them the standard to which that identity was proofed, which might be eIDAS substantial, for instance. And I can tell them the framework that it was done in – so it was done in eIDAS. So I can give a lot and I can communicate all of that information pretty simply in a technical package of data.</p>
<p>But the key question is what does all that mean? So can this relying party, let’s say it’s a bank in Indonesia, trust a Belgian ID? The Belgian ID is issued under this thing called eIDAS and has a level of assurance ‘substantial’. What does that mean? And how does that map into any Indonesian trust framework and rules that that relying party is subject to? How does it map into any finance rules they have that’s replicable for anti-money laundering?</p>
<p>So, they can only accept that ID if they know a lot more about the framework that is behind the information. And that’s OIX’s role to work out how do we explain the information about each framework? And how do we assess framework and interoperability, because what we’re really looking at there is the Belgian ID is operating under a framework. There’s a framework in Indonesia that dictates how ID needs to be assessed, managed, scored, levels of assurance, assessments in Indonesia. Are those two things compatible? So can that Indonesian relying party accept a Belgian-issued identity?</p>
<p>To do that, we think we need some kind of global interoperability framework. So we can take those two different frameworks in two different jurisdictions, and assess where they align, where they differ. And where they do differ, work out what those differences are, and work out how those differences can be mitigated. And is that by further alignment, by step up, by legal agreements? And to do that, we think we need a global interoperability framework, a meta framework, a framework of frameworks to compare frameworks to.</p>
<p>So, one of the things we’re going to be working on in our new global interoperability Working Group, which is kicking off on the 31st of January, is exploring precisely that question, how do we get two frameworks to interoperate? And that leaves the question of how do we get many frameworks to interoperate, which is why we think we need this global interoperability, this meta framework that sits across the top to make this happen.</p>
<p>And on top of that, we’ll be exploring how might that be governed? So how might that be done in a way that is independent, a lot of these frameworks will be government-driven, so enables government-to-government frameworks to communicate and strike agreements internationally with each other, without having to have lots of bilateral agreements from government to government, because that will take forever. That would be like doing trade agreements with every single country bilaterally, that doesn’t work. People do trade agreements in blocks, we need to leap beyond that to that entity to do identity trust agreements on a global basis. Let’s get this right, first time around.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see. So, a very good example you gave with two quite distant countries, Belgium and Indonesia, for example. And I get the idea that in different jurisdictions there are trust frameworks, but what is needed, the missing piece, is that global interoperable trust framework, and that is the – that is a piece that your team at the OIX is working right now. And both as part of the GAIN, the implementation of GAIN, but also I think this global interoperable trust framework is meant to be used also anywhere it can be used, correct?</p>
<p>Nick: Oh, absolutely. Yes, yes. So this is so – we already have a framework, which is intended as a global guide to frameworks at the moment. So you can come along to the OIX website, www.oix – sorry, <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">http://www.openidentityexchange[in full].com</a>. And on there is our <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/guide-trust-frameworks-interoperability">guide to trust frameworks</a>. And that details the contents of a trust framework, and it’s already there as a guide for those who need to understand what a trust framework is, what should be in it, and how to create it. So we already have that, so that’s been published a couple of years. That builds on the work we’ve done over the last 10 years around defining what a trust framework is. So that’s out there. We’re about to update that with the 2022 version, which I’ll talk about in a moment.</p>
<p>So the work we’re doing with GAIN is really taking that framework model we’ve got, and then using that to reason about how frameworks can interoperate. And from that, we expect to distil that there are key elements of a framework that are required for interoperability. And that’s where the term global interoperability framework is starting to come from. A lot of the things in our guide, they’re all important. But when you ask the interoperability question across frameworks, some are more important than others. And that’s the work we’re about to do with the GAIN initiative, to make that assessment. Whatever conclusions we reach there, again, conclusions are done where the Open Identity Exchange will be publishing our findings in an open way. And that framework would be able to be used by GAIN and the others looking to achieve the same objectives.</p>
<p>Our framework, though, our new framework that’s coming out, the trust framework 2022 is a massive evolution from the one that was previously published. One of the things we’ve done is taking a look at the way the markets moved over the past, I mean five years really, but in particular, since COVID, and that has emphasised the need for user-centric identity. We’ve seen a lot of self-sovereign based identities, verifiable credentials being used now to communicate the COVID certificates. We’ve seen the emergence of mobile driving licenses as a particular credential, digitised credential that can be gained by the user and put in a wallet and shared with others.</p>
<p>So we’ve moved our framework on to make sure it’s fully embracing of user-centric, self-sovereign identity. And we’ve changed some of the terminology. So we’ve moved to use, heavily use the term ‘credential’. So we talked about digitised credentials and derived credentials, that the digital identity, which could be a wallet, helps the user manage, gather, and manage those credentials and share them with others. So we’ve kind of taken a bit of a shift in our positioning and philosophy but we are remaining technology agnostic in that shift that we’ve made.</p>
<p>The other thing that we have really baked into that new version of the framework is that we see a digital identity is going to be useful for the user. If we just simply collect a set of digitised real-world credentials in a digital wallet- So if I end up with a wallet on my phone that’s got my passport and my driving license in it and my COVID certificate, that’s digitised some real-world credentials, documents, and given me them in an electronic form. That’s a great step forward.</p>
<p>But what the digital identity needs to do is really help the user in that process of both gathering that information, and more importantly, collating it to present to relying parties in a way that meets the rules of the relying party. So what you’ll see in our new trust framework, when it comes out, is an emphasis on a digital identity being able to understand the rules of the relying parties, the organisations that need to consume identity, and eligibility information, because we classed something like COVID information as eligibility information, and the digital identity can take those rules, and then work out, does the user have what they need to meet those rules?</p>
<p>So if it’s a question about, is the user COVID safe? What does COVID safe mean in this context? What is that question that’s being asked? Because COVID safe, COVID secure means different things, depending on who’s asking the question. If it’s a government wanting to let you into the country, versus a bar wanting to admit you to have some drinks, it’s a very different question. And everybody’s rules are different.</p>
<p>So the digital identity’s got to help the user through that process. It’s got to accept the request from the airline that saying, “Well, if you’re going to board me, you’ve got to be COVID safe. These are the rules. This is what I mean, by COVID safe. I mean, you’ve got to have a vaccine. And the vaccine has got to be one of these types. And you’ve got to have had a complete course of two vaccines. And it’s got to have been done with the last 14 days. And I mean, you’ve got to have a test. And that test has got to be completed in the last 24 hours. And it’s of this type, and it’s from one of these certified providers.”</p>
<p>So all of those rules, complex rules, the digital identity needs to help the user through. It needs to be intelligent, so that it can accept the request from the relying party, it can work out, well, yeah, the user’s have got the vaccine they need, that’s great. But they haven’t got the test that they need. So they need to go and get a test. So where can they go and get that test – it needs to help them through that process. It’s got to be intelligent. So you’ll start to hear us talking a lot about intelligent digital identity. And that that is going to be key to digital identity being a success.</p>
<p>Oscar: What is that intelligence – where it relies, in the application? Or…</p>
<p>Nick: So, from the user’s perspective, it needs to look to them as though it’s simply their digital identity is doing this for them. Technically, where does that sit? There are a number of options. So, if I’ve got a digital identity that’s cloud-based, or wallet-based, as part of the provision of that digital identity in the cloud, or in the wallet, that intelligence can be built in. So we’re talking there about an intelligent wallet, or an intelligent digital identity, where it has a rules engine in it.</p>
<p>So within our framework now, we’ve made it that a rules engine being present, that can interpret the rules and can work out how to answer the questions. And that can either be embedded in the wallet, or we’re talking about concepts of a rules agent. So where you can have a wallet, which is the thing that collects the information and collects derived information, and a rules agent who does the intelligent bit. So it’s the rules agent who takes the rules around being COVID safe, understands those, works out what credentials the user’s already got, helps the user get the ones that haven’t, and then derives the COVID safe status as a derived credential, enables the wallet to pass that on to the relying party.</p>
<p>So we see it’s very much as either it can all be in one intelligent digital identity, or it can be in a digital identity leveraging intelligent rules agents to achieve that goal. And again, the new framework paints both of those options as being completely valid.</p>
<p>Oscar: And all this is defined in the trust framework. That sounds powerful, I would say.</p>
<p>Nick: Yeah, we tried to make it as consumable as possible. So, at OIX, we’ve got the section on the guide, and we break the framework guide down into sections so it’s more easily consumable. So there’s a guide in there, really to what is a digital ID and how does it manage these credentials and gather them? How does it derive credentials like COVID safe from core credentials, like vaccines and tests? And then we dive into rules around things like identity assurance. Again, what are the rules around determining a level of assurance for an individual if that is required.</p>
<p>And most frameworks work on some kind of level of assurance, you’ve got low, substantial, high. In eIDAS, you’ve got low, medium, high. In the UK, you’ve got IALs and NIST… So when you get to that level of trust, and you’ve got a pre canned definitions of levels of trust, it gets quite complicated. So it’s really, there’s a whole section on that around identity assurance and how that is achieved.</p>
<p>Below the guide itself are more detailed guides. So we have a separate guide on identity assurance and authentication. We have separate guides on trust marks and how you mark, create and market a trust mark. We have guides on principles just to think, few things you should think about when creating principles. We’ve got another new guide coming out in February on everything that happens when something goes wrong. So from Help Desk to compensation, how should a digital identity ecosystem deal with those unhappy paths, and make sure all users have a good experience despite difficulties they may encounter?</p>
<p>And we also have a guide to fraud controls as well, which enables people creating identity ecosystems to understand. Unfortunately, digital identity will be targeted by fraudsters. It will become a honeypot, we’ve got to build the right flow controls at day one. So the overarching guide is really- there’s 25 different elements of the trust framework, what we’re doing is drilling into those 25 elements with more guides. There won’t be 25 of them, because we drill into several elements at once in a single guide. But we’re probably about halfway through in writing a full guide to digital identity. But the framework itself is complete and contains everything you need to do to create successful and trusted digital identities.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, it sounds very powerful as I said. And if I may, what is the ultimate name, the official name of this new trust framework?</p>
<p>Nick: The official name is OIX Trust Framework 2022. It’s the year, is the new version. So it will be launched on I’d say February the 3rd, we are planning a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/oix-2022-trust-framework-launch-tickets-245784777887">launch event</a>. So for those of you who are OIX members, or if you sort of follow on the OIX website, there’ll be a launch event coming up early next week for you to come along and hear more about what’s in that framework and why we’ve done it and the intent behind making sure we’ve got intelligent digital IDs, not just collections of stuff in a wallet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely, I’m asking because people can easily find it. And also, to dig a bit more on the details of the actual work you’re doing. So, who it’s being created for, who should read this, this work that you are going to release?</p>
<p>Nick: So, it’s aimed at multiple audiences. And we also just announced from it, other information that is relevant to relying parties. So the overarching framework guide itself – if you were to want to write a framework from scratch, it contains everything you need to enable you to do that, and to understand what needs to be in a trust framework. There’s no other global guide that does that, that tells you what is a trust framework and what’s in it and how should it be governed? So that enables those creating trust frameworks to create them and evolve them. And you know, we’re hoping with the new version is people who’ve already got trust frameworks will look at the new version and say, “Yeah, we need to evolve our existing framework to move towards this provision of intelligent digital ID.”</p>
<p>And it enables those creating self-sovereign identities to understand how that identity would fit into a trust framework. And we are talking with the Trust Over IP Foundation about a partnership where the work they do and the work OIX do is more closely aligned. So hopefully more on that as we move further into 2022. It’s designed to explain trust frameworks to identity providers who might need to go and get certified and approved into a trust framework. And we distil from it a version that enables relying parties, organisations who consume trust frameworks, to also understand what a digital identity is.</p>
<p>However, they need a simpler view of the world. They’re interested in the bits that are relevant to them. So we have a separate guide called <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/networks/87/item.html?id=503">Getting Ready for Digital ID</a> that positions what a digital ID is, why it should be intelligent, and what a framework does, in the context of a relying party that was launched back in October, and it’s available on the website now. So it’s designed to kind of multi– I mean their readership isn’t designed for its end users, really, but it’s relevant to the rest of the ID ecosystem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. That concept that you mentioned the intelligent ID that definitely intrigued me. I have to go and read that part at least and to know more. Sounds really powerful.</p>
<p>Nick: And what we’re going to use it for now. And this has always been our vision, is going back to what we’re doing on GAIN around global interoperability. So, having written it, brought it up to date, republished it, it now gives us the framework to start assessing global interoperability, and there’s already a section in it which talks about key elements for global interoperability. And we’re going to build out from that section and drill into the items we’ve highlighted in there to work out how do we create a framework that specifically enables interoperability. So enables us to do that and do that in a way that the terminology is consistent.</p>
<p>We’ve got a published benchmark to work from, because everyone’s– as frameworks have been written over the last, I guess, 10 years, OIX is proud to have influenced how a lot of them have been written, but it’s been evolutionary. So they’re all slightly different. And they’re all slightly different terms and structured things in slightly different ways. If we’re going to compare them and make them interoperable, we need something that’s standard to do that. And then so we would use the trust framework 2022 as that start point.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Makes a lot of sense. Anything else about this trust framework that you would like to share that we have not covered?</p>
<p>Nick: I think there’s a couple of things that we’re throwing out that are new. So, they move through the term credential. It does talk about these two things, digitise credentials and derived credentials. And that’s quite new. We’ve done a lot of work on this, a lot of thinking about what will those two terms mean.</p>
<p>So a digitised credential, we mean a digital version of a real-world thing like passport or driving license, a COVID vaccine, an education certificate. So these are the things that the self-sovereign world has been digitising, and is digitising. So they become part of a digital identity available in a wallet.</p>
<p>We’ve then got the term derived credential. And what that means – if we take digitised credentials, and then we derive other things from them. That might be simply deriving the person’s over 18. But we’re positioning that as a new credential that’s been derived from those other credentials. You might be determining that a person is COVID safe, which was the example earlier. We might be determining a level of assurance for the individual. So is this person eIDAS substantial? And we also position that as a derived credential, because it’s– you need to know what credentials it came from, when it was made, or what evidence was behind it, and how long it lasts. So if you have a person that’s over 18, they’re always over 18. So that’s the long-lasting derived credential. If you work out someone’s COVID safe, they probably are for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Yeah.</p>
<p>Nick: Yeah, work at a level of assurance it probably lasts months, or until something occurs that says its unsafe. So we thought it was important to have this separate type of credential, the derived credential, and it’s that those derived credentials are often the things that the relying parties need. If we’re going to do data minimisation, it’s the derived credential that data minimises the digitised credentials as they’re passed on to the relying party. So this construct digitised and derived credentials is quite key.</p>
<p>And the other thing to bring out that we’ve got is a new view on principles. So we’ve always had a user-centric view on principles in the framework. We talk about the four C’s are important for consumers, and we framed principles in terms that consumers would understand. And that’s always been really useful. But it didn’t map to more traditional principles that trust frameworks are built on. So we now got that mapping, we’ve got a set of traditional principles like data minimisation, privacy, security, and a set of user articulations on those principles around things like convenience, control, that enable a user view of the world and a ID ecosystem security, ethical view of the world to be mapped together to make sure actually, those principles are fulfilling user needs. So that’s an expanded section in the document that we’ve got at the moment.</p>
<p>We’ve also done quite a lot of work on roles. So we recognise the separate role of identity proofing provider, it’s just a specialist form of rules agent as we’ve created that in the trust framework. So all of that’s in there, as explained in the new framework. What we haven’t put in, or did debate quite a bit was the difference between centralised, decentralised and where federated fits. So we’ll be doing a subsequent piece of work in the trust framework working group to help explain those different terms of positioning to the market.</p>
<p>A lot of the questions I get from members, particularly new members are, what’s the difference between centralised, decentralised, distributed, and is federated the same as centralised? And it’s not. So we’ve done quite a bit of work on that already. It’s not ready for release just yet. But later in the year, we’ll be coming out with some views on, and hopefully clarity on, some of those terms to help the industry- to remove some industry confusion, because there’s quite a lot in the area at the moment.</p>
<p>Everything we do is members-driven, member-driven, so the need for clarity there is something our members are saying “Yeah, can you please sort this out and tell us properly what does distributed versus decentralised mean? Are they the same thing or different?” So that’s something we’re working on at the moment. So that’s something to watch out for. And you know, if you want to get involved in OIX, you can play a part in a definition of those, as well as the other things we’re working on around global interoperability. And we have a whole host of other working groups we’re just kicking off or continuing into 2022.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, this Trust Framework 2022 sounds super interesting. We’ll be following for sure. One more question for you, Nick. For all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Nick: So if you’re a business leader who is a consumer of an identity, a relying party, so if you, today, you run your own identity ecosystem to ID your customers, and are looking at moving to digital identity, then I would encourage you to start seriously thinking about getting ready for that now. Our getting ready paper is designed to help you understand what digital identity is all about, the benefits you’ll get as a business and what you should be looking for. And what you should be looking for is identity that comes from a trust framework, so that it has all the right rules, procedures, etc., around it that you can trust.</p>
<p>So a key thing we want at OIX is to try to help get that market going and help people understand what digital identity is. So if you’re a business leader in the relying party, please do have a look at that document and it’ll tell you a lot more about digital identity and what you should be looking for.</p>
<p>If you’re a business leader in the identity community, then start thinking intelligence. How can you install products that work for the user, not just user-centric, but the work for the user, help the user, assist the user? Because if we’re going to be successful, we’ve got to do that for the user, and got to make this easy. Because we know when things work for users they get adopted, when they work for the relying party, or they work for the ID provider or they work academically, they work from a security point of view. If they don’t work for the user, that’s all pretty academic. Make this work for the user to make it successful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, I couldn’t agree more. And well, thanks a lot for this very interesting conversation and guiding us through the Trust Framework 2022, please let us know how people can follow the conversation with you or learn more about what OIX is doing.</p>
<p>Nick: Absolutely. So we’ve got the launch of that is on the third of February. So please look out for that on the OIX website. So the OIX website is <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/members/anon/new.html?destination=%2Findex.html">www.openidentityexchange.org</a>. So please come along to that. There you can find the guides, there you can find the information about becoming a member if you’re not already a member, and information about the working groups we are looking at the moment, which I say include global interoperability, we’re taking a fresh look at fraud, we’re looking at can we get relying party adoption moving more quickly? So there’s a whole host of things we’re looking at in 2022, which I’m sure would be of interest. So reach out to me directly so it’s nick.mothershaw@openidentityexchange.org.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Well, thanks a lot again, Nick, and all the best.</p>
<p>Nick: Thank you Oscar. It’s pleasure to talk to you today. And yeah, really excited about what 2022 is going to bring. Thank you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you. Bye-bye.</p>

<p>Introduction: NFTs On AERGO: Tapping Into A Multi-Billion Dollar&nbsp;Industry</p>NFTs Have Sold For Millions Of Dollars And Provide Artists With Outlets For Exposure, Networking And Monetary Valuation On Their&nbsp;Art<p>AERGO has been consistent in developments, whether it be surrounding technological innovations, partnerships and NFT development on the platform. Blocko XYZ, AERGO’s technology partner, has successfully incubated a project known as CCCV, a blockchain identity management platform that has enabled the utilization and creation of NFT’s within the AERGO ecosystem, specifically highlighted by major events within South Korea over the past year. As NFT’s are linked to their designated artists through unique serial numbers, CCCV amalgamates this notion with its unique blockchain identity management service that enables individuals to manage multiple accounts and identities based on NFT technology. NFT technology, as we have seen, is still in its infancy, but is garnering major traction from major media outlets, conglomerates and monetary payment entities throughout the world; AERGO and Blocko XYZ realized this notion, and CCCV has perpetuated the utilization and creation of NFTs on the AERGO platform through a variety of ways. As NFT’s garner mainstream attention, it is important to highlight the work AERGO has been doing to assist in that ethos of NFT expansion.</p><p>CCCV Sales: Adding AERGO As A Payment For&nbsp;NFT’s</p>Within CCCV, You Can Pay For NFTs With The AERGO Token, Alongside Ethereum<p>Utility is the calling-card of a projects longevity; hype may impact price extensively, but hype is a short-term trend, and as one hype-trend begins, it fades just as quickly. Utility is the vitality of a project, whether the market dictates it or not. CCCV has enabled the AERGO token to garner utility in regards to payment options for NFT’s, as NFT sales grow, specifically in South Korea, the use-case of AERGO and it’s utilization by NFT artists will inevitably grow with the tide as well. Although there are many different NFT marketplaces that exist within the realm of blockchain technology, it is far and few between where a mid-cap project garners partnerships with major media outlets that enable NFT exhibitions throughout South Korea. It is incumbent to mention the multitudes of offline NFT enthusiasts that have contributed to NFT exhibitions in South Korea, most notably, the offline NFT exhibition with one of the largest broadcasters in Korea MBC, which held the exhibition in an NFT based format. Provided under this paragraph are pictures from that very exhibition! It is far and few between where even some of the largest NFT marketplaces are able to garner the attention of massive media companies, but CCCV, the incubation project of Blocko XYZ, AERGO’s technology partner, has done just&nbsp;that.</p><p>The Korean President Election: NFT’s Of The Nominees On&nbsp;AERGO?</p>Coindesk Korea Has Recently Shared An Article Highlighting NFT Innovation From&nbsp;CCCV<p>CCCV has recently partnered with MaskDAO, an autonomous NFT marketplace, which, in partnership with CCCV, aims to create pre-election voting polls through NFT’s for each presidential nominee in South Korea. With electioneering, fraudulent ballots and human malevolence, NFT’s have garnered a major utility when it comes to the democratization of choosing incumbents for nations, CCCV and MaskDAO emphasize that idealism through conceiving of a pre-election poll through the utilization of NFTs. Through CCCV and MaskDAO, users can “pre-vote” in advance for their presidential nominee through NFTs. The lack of participation in elections conveys a serious problem for republicanism throughout the globe and South Korea isn’t clear from this threat. MaskDAO and CCCV created this initiative to incentivized users to participate in the voting process through a familiarized setting with a robust technology: NFTs. Through this tournament, statistics can be created and analyzed surrounding who will be the next president of South Korea; prediction isn’t necessarily fact, but, this can assist the voting process by understanding voting trends among a populace through the immutable innovation of NFTs. This initiative is extremely forward thinking and amalgamates a multi-billion dollar industry with elections, which need less tampering, as we have seen with numerous elections throughout the world; AERGO and Blocko understand such an ideal, of their own volitions.</p><p>A Comparision: Upbit And Bithumb NFT Marketplaces Versus&nbsp;AERGO</p>Utility Is A Broad Spectrum When It Comes To NFT’s, However, These Exchanges Perpetuate NFT Enthusiasm For Crypto Veterans, Not Every Day&nbsp;Artists<p>It is evident that Bithumb and Upbit are some of the largest exchanges in the world for digital asset exchanges; this will also hold true with their NFT marketplaces as well. Unfortunately, these exchanges have created a concept of exclusivity among crypto and NFT veterans where only those who’re tech savvy with blockchain and cryptocurrency exchanges can participate within these marketplaces. This notion can only go so far surrounding the perpetuation of NFT maturation. AERGO and CCCV have conceived of a paradigm for NFT artists and non-NFT artists alike that enables everyday mainstream people to involve themselves with NFTs through offline brick and mortar art exhibitions throughout South Korea. Inclusivity and the introduction of this technology to the people is an important ethos for the maturity of this market, and AERGO and Blocko clearly understand that notion in its entirety.</p><p>AERGO NFT’s Go Mainstream: CCCV And Maekyung Media&nbsp;Group</p>Founded In 1966, Maekyung Media Group’s Is One Of The Largest Mainstream Media Companies In South&nbsp;Korea<p>Blocko XYZ’s MOU with Maekyung Media Group cannot be overstated, this is a massive feat for a blockchain company to partner with a half-century old media company, and one of the largest mainstream media agencies in South Korea. Did you know that Maekyung Media Group, according to the World Economic Forum “operates a newspaper, a broadcasting network, a weekly and monthly magazine, and an electronic newspaper. It published a Korean-language business newspaper with a circulation of approximately 1.2 million; its television broadcast reaches 15 million users per-day.” <a href="https://www.weforum.org/organizations/maekyung-media-group">https://www.weforum.org/organizations/maekyung-media-group</a> Yes, the article highlights 15 million users per-day, that is the entire population of many small-mid size nations throughout the world, and Blocko XYZ has signed an MOU with this&nbsp;company.</p><p>On the 24th, Blocko XYZ signed an MOU with Maeil Economic Research Institute for blockchain NFT business cooperation, propelling NFT’s into the mainstream eye within South Korea. Through this mutual understanding, Blocko will assist in NFT technical support to the Maeil Economic Research Institute and the two companies plan to participate in multiple NFT related projects together. This synergistic relationships enables AERGO to conceive of connections with mainstream media outlets for future prospects surrounding NFT exhibitions, projects and collectibles exclusive to the AERGO platform, providing a unique value proposition for the network. Mainstream validity is what will drive the adoption of networks as the maturation of blockchain continues; NFT’s are no exception to such a clause and AERGO is solidifying its base within that paradigm.</p><p>Conclusion: Setting The Stage For NFT Adoption: AERGO And&nbsp;Blocko</p>Without Mainstream Validation, This Market Will Never Mature, NFTs&nbsp;Included<p>It’s far and few between where a mid-cap project has such connections with mainstream media outlets and governmental entities. AERGO stands out in this crowd through its technology partner, Blocko XYZ which has solidified an MOU with one of South Korea’s largest broadcasting agencies: this is no easy feat. In order for NFT’s to become more than just a trend, mainstream adoption must foster this industry and perpetuate its expansion. Through initiatives such as this, conceived of by Blocko XYZ, there is hope that NFT’s are more than just a trend. This is through AERGO’s and Blocko’s own volitions and ambition.</p><p>Disclaimer: NFT’s and cryptocurrency investing involves substantial risk, I am not responsible for your trades, do not invest more than you can afford to&nbsp;lose!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/of-aergos-volition-mainstream-partnerships-the-nft-af7dd0d91598">Of AERGO’s Volition: Mainstream Partnerships: The NFT</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Cointelegraph: Experts believe that Africa is primed to lead the next wave of global crypto adoption, as the economic opportunities presented by the region are immense. This article mentions Jelurida Africa managing director, Adedayo Adebajo, expressing that African countries like to consider themselves as one group, united by their lack of tangible business opportunities and the lack to access high-quality banking alternatives. He also highlights that the key issue preventing crypto-based banking services from reaching the masses is the limited knowledge about blockchain technology and its true utility, which is one of the main objectives of Jelurida Africa.</p>

 GiD Report#196 — How crypto is changing central&nbsp;banks <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-195-can-you-trust-your-million-dollar-nft-3c578fd8707">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The Fed finally publishes its paper on&nbsp;CBDCs  The web3 wars&nbsp;continue  Tweet of the week — IG NFT&nbsp;edition  Stuff happens   1. Better late than&nbsp;never The Federal&nbsp;Reserve<p>There are already <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/">23 countries already experimenting with CBDCs or central bank digital currencies</a> — 9 of which have already officially launched, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2021/11/15/na111621-five-observations-on-nigerias-central-bank-digital-currency">including Nigeria</a>. In China, WeChat <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/chinas-digital-currency-comes-to-tencents-wechat-in-expansion-push.html">recently integrated the country’s CBDC</a> bringing it to its billion plus user&nbsp;base.</p><p>Notably lagging is the U.S. When you’re the world’s reserve currency, there’s that much more at&nbsp;stake.</p><p>But last week, the Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm">finally published (after much delay) its paper</a> weighing the upside and potential challenges of introducing a digital dollar backed by the central&nbsp;bank.</p><p>On the positives, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/business/fed-digital-currency.html">from the NYTimes&nbsp;report</a>:</p><blockquote>Such a currency “could provide a safe, digital payment option for households and businesses as the payments system continues to evolve, and may result in faster payment options between countries,” the Fed release accompanying the discussion paper&nbsp;stated.</blockquote><p>Cross-border payments are particularly slow and expensive, relying on the correspondent banking&nbsp;system.</p><p>On to the challenges, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/business/fed-digital-currency.html">from the same&nbsp;report</a>:</p><blockquote>But the paper also noted that a central bank digital currency would raise policy questions, including about its effect on the financial sector, the cost and availability of credit, the safety and stability of the financial system and the efficacy of monetary&nbsp;policy.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Commercial banks, for their part, <a href="https://bpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Central-Bank-Digital-Currencies-Costs-Benefits-and-Major-Implications-for-the-U.S.-Economic-System.pdf">have been worried</a> that the creation of a central bank digital currency and Fed accounts could take away their deposit base and upend their business model. The paper probably does not address all their concerns, but may serve to calm worries that consumers could fully leapfrog the traditional banking&nbsp;system.</blockquote><p>It’s a particular challenge for an institution that has historically preferred a hands off and decentralized approach — outside of extraordinary circumstances. The average person often considers money creation the responsibility of the Fed, but that job is actually outsourced to banks through fractional reserve lending. By loaning out money they don’t have, banks create more money. (How the Fed sets interest rates impacts all of this, but you get my&nbsp;point.)</p><p>For the Fed, decentralization of money creation makes a lot of sense. Banks are better positioned to manage the risks of their customers and communities.</p><p>The same has been true of the digital dollar. Today, most of my dollars exist in digital form, managed by my bank’s centralized ledger.</p><p>Introducing its own CBDC flips that historical framework on its head with the Federal Reserve stepping in to take a far more outsized role in how money works today. Doing so without rocking the boat too much will be a top priority.</p><p>It’s also why the Fed was crystal clear in its paper that it had no plans to offer consumer accounts at the central bank, which would further step on banks’ toes. The NYTimes&nbsp;again:</p><blockquote>The Fed paper also seemed to slam the door on several possibilities — including the idea that a central bank digital currency could be created alongside consumer bank accounts at the Fed, <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SIL20449.pdf">something Democrats</a> and proponents of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-issued-digital-dollar-could-print-money-for-the-people-174238842.html?guce_referrer=ahr0chm6ly93d3cuz29vz2xllmnvbs8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=aqaaabobubllw2plqobfnniatsw134z-654qygpll_odvlpdcnuofr4czpxjkfgb-w4b_-dfvcxxi9nlcmguzokco42iddyrqvych9vlc4fees61ebjkkgr_lysa-4rzafzdc1ci9-0xdtnaumzmjro32yh17l7xtbnh0dbckatcdoej">broader financial inclusion</a> have at times suggested.</blockquote><p>But as the Fed itself argues, the rise of crypto is already disrupting the system whether or not central banks decide to participate. Change is inevitable and it will be up to banks whether or not they sink or swim given the choices now available to consumers.</p><p>In that sense, crypto has always been a forcing function for innovation within a historically slow moving industry — just as platforms like PayPal, Venmo, and Square likely sped up the adoption of solutions like Zelle, which allowed customers to easily send money to each other (even across different bank ledgers).</p><p>Here’s the&nbsp;Fed:</p><blockquote>“A C.B.D.C. could spur innovation by banks and other actors and would be a safer deposit substitute than many other products, including stablecoins and other types of nonbank money,” the paper said. “These forms of nonbank money could cause a shift in deposits away from banks even without a C.B.D.C.”</blockquote><p>And just like that, the Federal Reserve has officially started the conversation.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/business/fed-digital-currency.html">Fed opens debate over a U.S. central bank digital currency with long-awaited report.</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/the-federal-reserve-is-open-to-creating-a-digital-dollar-5f332697-b3f5-4e59-b542-ab1f5ca79d3b.html">The Federal Reserve is open to creating a digital&nbsp;dollar</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/ceo-of-financial-services-giant-charles-schwab-calls-cryptocurrencies-hard-to-ignore/">CEO of Financial Services Giant Charles Schwab Calls Cryptocurrencies ‘Hard to Ignore’ — Blockworks</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/TravisXRP">/TravisXRP</a> — <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220120a.htm">Federal Reserve Board releases discussion paper that examines pros and cons of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency&nbsp;(CBDC)</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-13/paypal-sued-for-freezing-customer-accounts-without-explanation">PayPal Sued for Freezing Customer Accounts Without Explanation</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/proposed-russian-crypto-ban-may-push-miners-west/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Proposed Russian Crypto Ban May Push Miners West — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/yuan-s-popularity-for-global-payments-hits-highest-in-six-years">Yuan’s Popularity for Global Payments Hits Highest in Six&nbsp;Years</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/TravisXRP">/TravisXRP </a>— <a href="https://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/financial-markets/Why-Decentralised-Finance-DeFi-Matters-and-the-Policy-Implications.pdf">OECD: Why Decentralized Finance Matters and the Policy Implications</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/chinas-tech-crackdown-geopolitics-us">China’s Tech Crackdown Is a Geopolitical Play</a>   2. The web3 wars&nbsp;continue <p>Speaking of ongoing conversations, the promises of web3 continue to command vigorous&nbsp;debate.</p><p>Let’s start with a disclaimer: When it comes to human problems, technology is never the solution; it’s always just a&nbsp;tool.</p><p>And as a tool, it’s always a double-edged sword.</p><p>The arrival of Spotify meant that anyone could call themselves a published musician. The reality is that a handful of global stars (along with Spotify) rake in the majority of revenues.</p><p>(Notably, this is also the case for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncsNZacfla0&amp;t=3s">tennis</a> and golf players. The point being — this isn’t a technology problem.)</p><p>Zooming out, you can see how this applies to the greater internet. The Worldwide Web promised to democratize information — and it did. Today’s web2 version of that same internet grapples with complex social and economic issues around misinformation/fake news, deplatforming, and Big Tech monopolies.</p><p>Early in the hype cycle, new technological frameworks promise to solve human problems. But reality is a bit more complicated.</p><p>Now that web3’s 2021 honeymoon period is over, a vibrant conversation is emerging around those very complications — ignited by <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098">that juicy tweet from&nbsp;Jack</a>.</p><p>That conversation is only just beginning, but this week, we have <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/">a post from NYU professor Scott Galloway’s No Mercy No Malice newsletter</a> (via /gregkidd).</p><p>And Scott pulls no&nbsp;punches:</p><blockquote>Preaching liberation while sequestering into gated communities is endemic to tech. The “personal” computer was going to free us from the grip of IBM’s dominance in mainframes, but it fell under the even greater control of Microsoft. Apple claimed to be a revolutionary fighting Big Brother, but it erected the greatest tollbooth for creativity in history (the App Store). “Information wants to be free” was the rallying cry of earlier web company managements trying to convince fawning, idiotic content companies to exchange their content for pennies on the&nbsp;dollar.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Web3 has different-colored hair, but the same DNA as earlier web paradigms, which decentralized services at an unprecedented scale to centralize wealth and influence at an unprecedented scale. Ninety-three percent of intentions and two thirds of decisions are influenced by two firms. Is that a good thing? Pro tip: Ask someone with teen girls. So far, web3 is&nbsp;web2.01.</blockquote><p>So is web3 the solution? No.</p><p>Is it a powerful&nbsp;tool?</p><p>Certainly.</p><p>Much like the conversation around a Federal Reserve backed CBDC, it’s a question of centralization versus decentralization and there’s still plenty to be hashed&nbsp;out.</p><p>Further reading:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> — <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/">Web3 | No Mercy / No&nbsp;Malice</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd </a>— <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thatwastheweek/issues/moxie-has-moxie-975189">Moxie has&nbsp;Moxie</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — Moxie Marlinspike: <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">My first impressions of&nbsp;web3</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/18/business/dealbook/web3-venture-capital-andreessen.html">Tales From Crypto: A Billionaire Meme Feud Threatens Industry&nbsp;Unity</a>  Matt Levine — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-10/web3-takes-trust-too">Web3 Takes Trust&nbsp;Too</a>  <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-web3-debate">The Web3&nbsp;Debate</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-11/signal-founder-marlinspike-gives-web3-nfts-an-emperor-s-new-clothes-moment">Web3 Just Had Its Emperor’s-New-Clothes Moment</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-19/washing-web3">Wash Your Meebits in&nbsp;Web3</a>   3.

<p>Il progetto consiste in una iniziativa sociale itinerante che ha come obiettivo principale l’attivazione facilitata e gratuita dell’identità digitale per cittadini, nell’ottica di orientare nella dimensione digitale coloro che ne potrebbero rimanere esclusi.</p>



<p>A seguito della pandemia globale che ha avuto inizio nel febbraio 2020, la necessità di utilizzare gli strumenti digitali per sopperire all’impossibilità di svolgere le più comuni operazioni amministrative o di interfaccia con la PA, ha fatto salire vertiginosamente il bisogno da parte di cittadini e imprese di dotarsi di mezzi quali ad esempio SPID; molti cittadini però corrono il rischio di essere tagliati fuori dal mondo del digitale, poiché l’accesso a queste risorse prevede un livello minimo di conoscenza della tecnologia e dei device non sempre posseduto da tutti.</p>



<p>Con il proposito di non lasciare nessuno indietro, è nata l’associazione di promozione sociale MigliorAttivaMente, che persegue lo scopo di favorire la “salita a bordo” del cittadino nella dimensione digitale del Paese, così da fruire telematicamente, senza sprecare tempo e risorse, dei servizi offerti da aziende e pubblica amministrazione; questa idea è nata durante la pandemia, mentre l’associazione ha preso vita nel 2021, ha già all’attivo numerose iniziative di interesse sociale e si appresta a compiere ulteriori importanti passi.</p>



<p>Il progetto “SPID in ogni dove” è un’importante iniziativa che ha l’obiettivo di dotare gli utenti meno avvezzi alla tecnologia della propria identità digitale, il tutto si svolgerà durante le tappe di un tour che vedrà coinvolta InfoCert come provider per l’attivazione facilitata e gratuita del servizio, il tutto avverrà grazie all’impegno degli InfoCert partners, InfoAss, Studio Eureka, TeamService, e Unappa che si adopereranno materialmente mettendo a disposizione i referenti che avranno il compito di attivare le identità digitali, &nbsp;MigliorAttivaMente invece si occuperà di coordinare le tappe del tour e far sì che quanti più utenti in difficoltà possano avere l’opportunità di accedere al servizio.</p>



<p>Al momento sono state scelte le città che saranno tappa del tour (Roma, Milano, Napoli, Palermo, Verona, Brescia, Reggio Emilia, Perugia, Rimini, Salerno, Monza, Tento, Pescara, Cagliari), il tour avrà inizio nella primavera 2022 e MigliorAttivaMente ha già iniziato ad ingaggiare i volontari dedicati al servizio di accettazione del cittadino, InfoCert, attraverso i propri partner, metterà a disposizione l’addetto al riconoscimento e ovviamente il servizio SPID; le location per ogni città sono ancora in fase di selezione, verranno comunicate tramite i canali di InfoCert e MigliorAttivaMente non appena ufficializzate.</p>

<p>Partnership will responsibly facilitate access to DeFi for global institutional investors and enterprises</p>



<p>TORONTO,&nbsp; January 25, 2022 – <a href="https://liquidmeta.io/">Liquid Meta Capital Holdings Ltd.</a> (the “Company” or “Liquid Meta”) (NEO:LIQD) a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure and technology company, today announced a partnership with Civic Technologies, Inc. (“Civic”), a leading innovator in blockchain-powered digital identity solutions. Together, the companies will bring trusted, secure permissioned identity services to DeFi and enable Liquid Meta to provide capital liquidity to permissioned dApps. This will promote the overall adoption of DeFi.</p>



<p>“Liquid Meta’s mission is to build a bridge between Traditional Finance and Decentralized Finance,” said Jonathan Wiesblatt, CEO. &nbsp;“Our partnership with Civic Technologies will provide us with the enhanced capabilities and tools needed to expand upon this mission and to create an environment for traditional institutional investors to access this nascent and emerging industry in a more secure and trusted capacity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The partnership is timely, given interest in DeFi from institutional investors. At its core, DeFi relies on permissionless access, but this principle often runs counter to the obligations of large capital investors that must know the counter-parties they are participating with in order to reduce counter-party risk. Permissioned access through the partnership will provide a gateway into DeFi for these investors. Liquid Meta is already providing liquidity to some of the most exciting Decentralized Applications and Exchanges in DeFi.</p>



<p>As the first publicly traded, pure-play liquidity mining operation in the world, Liquid Meta is building proprietary software and tools to access, automate and unlock tremendous growth within DeFi. The Company is focused on generating cash flow in the fast-growing DeFi segment of the blockchain industry.</p>



<p>“The team at Liquid Meta has a long history in the financial services industry, public capital markets and the crypto and technology industries. The leadership team is attuned to the operational rigor that institutional investors require in order to explore investments in new categories like DeFi,” said Chris Hart, CEO of Civic. “We can’t think of a better partner that’s more aligned with our mission to open the DeFi ecosystem to new investors through permissioned markets.”</p>



<p>Civic provides a KYC and KYB solution, through Civic Pass, that a dApp provider can use as an input to their compliance program. Liquid Meta will use Civic Pass to determine which participants meet a dApp’s rigorous standards for verification prior to allowing them the ability to trade. Civic Pass is seamlessly integrated into a dApp’s onboarding flow. Once an institutional investor has completed the Civic Pass screening process, the dApp will use the results of the screening to allow trading.</p>

<p>About Liquid Meta</p>

<p>Coinpedia: NFT gaming is booming thanks to the increasing adoption of blockchain technology and the gamers’ familiarity with its potential, in terms of reward investment, functionality and gaming experience. This article lists the top 5 NFT games ready to conquer mainstream adoption and Mythical Beings, built on Ardor blockchain, is one of them. Thanks to its unique parent-child chain architecture, the Ardor platform offers native NFT support and advanced customization to the blockchain-based card collection game.

 QUESTIONS!? 
<p>There were some great questions sent in, we really value and appreciate your engagement! Our Question Period started at about 45:00 – though some questions did come in earlier and were touched on through the presentation. Here is a run down of what we covered:</p>
 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/L-sdGA8h5-g?t=1304">In regards to Trust Registries, do you foresee these registries being run in a centralized or decentralized manner? Are there any leaders? What business models have you seen?</a> 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/L-sdGA8h5-g?t=1581">Are there any sector agnostic trust registries protocols and or standards yet or is the generic concept still in its early days?</a> 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/L-sdGA8h5-g?t=2725">What scares you the most about 2022 and beyond for SSI?</a> 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/L-sdGA8h5-g?t=2981">What about Mobile Driver licenses (mDLs)? Didn’t hear you mention that Apple supports them now.</a> 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/L-sdGA8h5-g?t=3117">Did you hear about tbDEX and what Square/Block are doing?</a> 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/L-sdGA8h5-g?t=3349">Where should I look for more detail on interoperability, standards, and how things are being put together? Why are you cynical about interoperability?</a>

<p>In a post-pandemic world, food is not just our biggest challenge, but also our biggest opportunity for sustainable change.</p><p>The ways that food is produced, distributed and consumed have major negative impacts on people and the planet. Food production is the largest human pressure on Earth, causing a mass extinction of species, and accounting for 23% of annual greenhouse emissions. Food is at the core of various social justice challenges such as working conditions, access to affordable good food, cultural diversity and burgeoning food-related health crises of both malnutrition and obesity. This means that many of the broader environmental and social challenges can be addressed if the way that food is produced and managed is transformed. As Johan Rockström, Director of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in&nbsp;2016:</p><blockquote>If we get it right on food, we get it right for both people and&nbsp;planet.</blockquote><p>Food transformations will require a series of fast and slow transitions over the next decades. The world’s governments have agreed on the UN Global Goals for 2030. Here in Sweden the country plans to have net zero emissions by 2045. However, neither the world nor Sweden are on track to achieve these goals, and with every day that passes, impacts accumulate and the challenges grow.</p><p>Food is essential and a source of great pleasure. A shared meal can be a ritual or celebration, and a simple everyday pleasure. Food is a rich and meaningful expression of our shared cultural diversity, and the way we make, distribute, and enjoy it, speaks loudly as to what we stand for as a society. Food can be a generator of wealth, in numerous forms, and its cultivation can restore ecological functions. Given that food is the strongest connection humanity has with the biosphere, that most of our food systems are productive but unequal, and that food cultures can either be enriching or destructive, transforming our global food systems represent both a grand challenge and a grand opportunity. If we are able to make a just transition to food cultures that restore the biosphere rather than degrade it, we will not only improve the lives of the world’s people, and enhance the biosphere, but also learn how to become better stewards of the&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>Sweden and other Nordic countries are well-positioned to lead the way in the global transformations towards sustainable food systems. It shares many of the world’s problems, while beginning to take action to address them. Current diets in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Finland are unhealthy, carbon intensive, and harm terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, both in the Nordics and elsewhere. About half the population in Nordic countries is overweight or obese, food waste is a major problem, and meat consumption is well above amounts recommended for health or sustainability.</p><p>Sweden is also taking action to change its food system. The Nordic region has world-class dietary guidelines, strict agricultural regulations and emerging innovations to food challenges. In Sweden, diverse innovations are taking place in farming, marketing, logistics and retail. Similarly, many cities, municipalities, and national government are working to develop policy to improve the food system, for both health reasons and environmental objectives. Furthermore, there is widespread public discussion, led in particular by chefs, to build on the success of the New Nordic cuisine <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-healthy-sustainable-and-just-swedish-and-planetary-food-system-3354b72461cb#_msocom_1">[PO1]</a> to create a cuisine that is good for both people and the planet, exploring how to reverse these recent trends towards greater meat consumption and increased environmental damage. As Nordic populations diversify, the various cuisines in the region are enriched accordingly. This means Sweden has the potential to lead global food system transformations.</p><p>The unequal and often unplanned impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic have highlighted many flaws and fractures in the fabric of everyday life, not least because it moves as a complex system, as opposed to respecting the way Sweden is organised within health, mobility, urbanism, security, governance and other sectors. We believe that the responses to COVID-19 on the Swedish food systems may reveal aspects of the resilience measures needed to meaningfully address the risks and opportunities facing Swedish food&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While some of the rapid responses of food system actors to COVID-19 might accelerate a ‘just transition’ towards sustainable and resilient food systems, others may impede it. To better navigate towards sustainability, we want to understand how responses to COVID either built or eroded resilience within the Swedish food system resilience, and whether these responses enhances or reduced the transformative capacities of the Swedish food systems. Such understanding can help us better align existing and future research and innovation activities, in order to enable a ‘just transition’ of Sweden’s complex food systems; systems not defined by its territorial boundaries but the planetary flows that it is interlinked with.</p><p>Transformations require significant changes in multiple dimensions of society. These changes must take place at different levels in society, from practices and behaviours, to rules and regulations, to values (financial and non-financial), and world-views. Transformation involves changing the relationships among people, but also profoundly changing the relationships between people and nature. History shows us that crises can create openings for transformation. But while positive societal transformations may arise from crises, the consequences of crises are often not positive. The risk is that opportunities created by the crisis are missed and that crisis response — despite good intentions and innovation — fail to address accumulated problems, and restore a slightly improved or a damaged status-quo. Navigating crises requires understanding of capabilities and capacities that are needed and then developing and mobilizing those capabilities and capacities for&nbsp;change.</p><p>Our project aims to learn from the current COVID-19 crisis and support the enabling of capacities for transforming towards Swedish food systems that promote the health, equity and sustainability of people and the planet. The project will identify and map risks and opportunities emerging in the Swedish food systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic through a co-creative process with public, private and civic food system actors. This process will develop understanding and articulate alternative pathways for food system transformations. It will do this through a Rapid Transition Lab.</p> Rapid Transition Lab <p>The Rapid Transition Lab will identify opportunities and pathways for Swedish food system actors to engage in a rapid transition, in response to the COVID-19 crisis. It will assess different strategies within the Swedish food systems, and support the design of more transformative strategies, practices, and institutions. Vinnova, the Swedish government’s innovation agency who fund this work, plans to connect the learning to multiple related stakeholders in and around policymaking and practice relating to food systems in&nbsp;Sweden.</p><p>The Rapid Transition lab will consist of a sensemaking and a futuring project and be structured around three overlapping phases: First, the project will build a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of and the responses to Covid-19 in the Swedish food systems. Second, based on these insights, existing food system scenarios, and through workshops engaging multiple stakeholders, the project will build transformative food system scenarios. In the third phase, the project will use these scenarios to identify strategies and pathways and possible portfolios of experiments for actors to contribute to the transformations of the Swedish food systems. These will be accomplished by developing a process of collective sense-making.</p>  Learning from the crisis to reframe food systems: By exploring the interconnected cascading risks and opportunities that have emerged from responses to COVID-19 and the 2018 drought in Sweden, in the context of Swedish food system transformations, we will create broader views of food systems and cultures.  Suggesting strategies to support the capacity building for transformations: Building exploratory scenarios, informed by the responses to the COVID-19 crises in the Swedish food systems, can reveal capacity-building strategies that might better enable transformations in the Swedish food systems. The scenarios, will build on previous and ongoing scenarios, to develop systemic, holistic and multidimensional scenarios that will be used to identify a portfolio of pathways and experiments.  Input into strategic policymaking and innovation practice: Key stakeholders in and around policymaking and practice relating to food systems in Sweden, will be engaged to actively contribute and learn from these exploratory processes. The analysis of the crisis, and development of the scenarios should be relevant to these stakeholders.  <p>The Rapid Transition Lab will be linked to other ongoing transdisciplinary food system projects that Vinnova or the Stockholm Resilience Centre lead or are partners in. These include MISTRA Food Futures, Nordic Food Policy Lab, Sustainable Finance Lab, and NorthWestern Paths. The Rapid Transition lab will complement these projects by focusing on the responses to Covid 19 pandemic in the Swedish food systems and use these to build scenarios that in turn will be used to develop transformation strategies and identify capacities for&nbsp;change.</p> Further reading <p>More on Nordic food system transformations can be found in four policy briefs from the SRC, <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2020-11-24-nordic-countries-are-well-suited-to-collaborate-on-food-systems-transformation.html">https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2020-11-24-nordic-countries-are-well-suited-to-collaborate-on-food-systems-transformation.html</a></p><p>What can the COVID-19 pandemic teach us about resilient Nordic food systems? <a href="http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450471/FULLTEXT01.pdf">http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450471/FULLTEXT01.pdf</a></p> Who we&nbsp;are <p><a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/">Stockholm Resilience Centre </a>Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC) is an international research centre on resilience and sustainability science.

 During this conversation, we discuss: 
 
 
 
 
 Where are the opportunities to apply SSI principles and frameworks towards DAOs? 
 
 
 How do you decentralize hiring, education, and the coordination of work. 
 
 
 Are .eth good or bad identifiers? Are .eth names and decentralized identifiers (DIDs) mutually exclusive? 
 
 
 How can the decentralized discovery of professional skills happen? 
 
 
 
 And more! 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Related Content</p>
<p>DAOs will offer more interesting opportunities to workers to contribute towards meaningful work. And SSI will allow workers to build up a verifiable portfolio of knowledge and skillsets, which can be used to participate in more and more opportunities through DAOs.</p>

<p>People are happier when their work has meaning and when they can associate with peers who share similar beliefs and values. But in the face of new challenges stemming from the pandemic — everything from the shift to remote work to closures of schools and daycare centers — many people began to question the validity of their career as their identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Internet has provided us with many&nbsp;ways to discover and join likeminded communities that we can interact with. Take Reddit for example—there over one million subreddits that exist today with almost 48 million monthly active users (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/443332/reddit-monthly-visitors/">Statista</a>). You can find a niche community to join for almost any topic — and if you don’t find one you can create one yourself.</p>
<p>The web3 world takes this concept a bit further by adding economic incentives for community members to contribute. One of the earliest dreams for Ethereum was to enable “Decentralized Autonomous Organizations” (DAOs).</p>
<p>Because Ethereum enables anyone to write arbitrary rules in code, we can use those rules to design organizational or governance systems that allow groups of people to jointly make decisions through voting or other mechanisms.</p>
<p>While DAOs have existed on Ethereum since 2016, these early experiments were more science project-like rather than real product.</p>
<p>But the DAO ecosystem had a breakout moment in 2021. A simple but workable tech stack came together to enable existing DAOs to get things done, and new entrants pushed the boundaries of what a DAO can be and who can be a part of one.</p>
<p>I personally regained interest in DAOs in 2021 as I saw many opportunities to use self-sovereign identity (SSI) frameworks and principles towards unlocking further growth for decentralized systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sgershuni">Stepan Gershuni</a>&nbsp;and I started talking about the&nbsp;intersection of SSI and DAOs&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblock.io/economics-of-self-sovereign-identity/">Episode #9 — Economics of Self-Sovereign Identity and the Future of Cryptoeconomics</a>&nbsp;— and once again in&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblock.io/daos-and-ssi/">Episode #16 — How DAOs Benefit from Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p>
<p>As 2021 was coming to a close, the number of unique monthly voters who participated in DAOs exploded. Today, there are hundreds of DAOs that see daily activity from members, pay members, build products, and vote on the use of shared funds. Collectively DAOs on Ethereum govern assets worth more than $16 billion.</p>
<p>One of the new DAOs that recently has caught my attention is the&nbsp;<a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name Service (ENS)</a>. In a nutshell, ENS is a name and lookup service built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows crypto users to translate their machine-readable addresses to human-readable addresses. Think of it as an&nbsp;identifier&nbsp;for public Ethereum addresses, aiming to make crypto more accessible. So rather than sending someone tokens by using their public key (e.g., 0x400668a22A85aac272608004130fp26E8e853eBD), I can use their nickname.eth address.</p>
<p>And if you use Twitter at all, you’ll probably also notice the trend where people in are placing their ‘.eth’ in their names. Again, to show allegiance/association to a community of people who share some similar values and beliefs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has seen breakout growth, growing to hundreds of thousands of users, hundreds of integrations, and a new DAO community treasury ($1.9B) to fund continued development of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>I started questioning how&nbsp;.eth identifiers compared to decentralized identifiers (DIDs) — DIDs being the most critical element in achieving digital self-sovereignty (for those unfamiliar with SSI).</p>
<p>Although&nbsp;.eth names can enhance user experiences for crypto users, it doesn’t add any privacy benefits that DIDs do. If you broadcast your&nbsp;.eth address like Shaq did, then the whole world can view your financial transactions. That’s simply the open and transparent nature of permissionless public blockchains like Ethereum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There seems to be use cases for both types of identifiers (.eth names and DIDs) and they aren’t mutually exclusive from each other. However, I feel that at times the web3 space tries to apply blockchain to their use cases without understanding the core properties needed for their use case. For example using&nbsp;.eth names or NFTs as identifiers.</p>
<p>These are important conversation to keep having and I think the one here with Stepan starts to explain how different types of identifiers can not only co-exist, but reap value from each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The existing self-sovereign identity (SSI) frameworks are mature, more privacy-preserving and don’t force any specific technologies. For one, it they live on a specific blockchain. SSI gives people the properties of verifiability, control, portability, privacy and a slew of other ones that are important to achieve digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>I continue to strongly believe that the intersection of SSI and web3 will be extremely powerful and change the future of work.</p>
<p>DAOs will offer more interesting opportunities to workers to contribute towards meaningful work. And SSI will allow workers to build up a verifiable portfolio of knowledge and skillsets, which can be used to participate in more and more opportunities through DAOs.</p>
<p>There remains work to be done to bring SSI frameworks to the web3 space. There are some early stage projects like <a href="https://www.deepskills.io/">Deep Skills</a> attempting to do so. But as these become more mature and unlock supplies of verifiable data, people will have so much freedom and flexibility to work on passion projects.</p>
<p>To conclude this post, I want to share 5 ideas that this latest podcast conversation with Stepan has me thinking about:</p>
 
 Idea 1 — People are happier when their work has meaning and can associate with peers who share similar beliefs and values. DAOs provide opportunities to pick and choose your work communities. DAOs are open and transparent, making it easy to do your due diligence before joining one. It’s tough to truly know a corporation runs until you join it. 
 Idea 2— DAOs aren’t bound to geographical constraints or corporate policies. You can work on a DAO from anywhere in the world. You can also work on many DAOs from anywhere. 
 Idea 3— Contributing 5 hours per week of meaningful work will likely create more value than contributing 40 hours of non-meaningful work (e.g., one of the most meaningful contributors to Wikipedia does it as a side gig (<a href="https://northernvirginiamag.com/culture/culture-features/2021/11/24/steven-pruitt-wikipedia/">here</a>)) 
 Idea 4— DAOs can scale much quicker than corporations. There exists a lot of administrative overhead to onboard new talent to a corporation (e.g., register employee with government, set up payroll, etc.) — that overhead doesn’t exist in DAOs. 
 Idea 5— There is an oversupply of talent looking to join DAOs. There is an undersupply of talent available for almost every type of corporation. Corporations don’t have enough of a pipeline of talent, while DAOs are trying to figure out how to onboard the large available talent pools effectively.

<p>This week is a quiet one for news. But if you’re a developer; the following few changes are important ones!</p> holochain-conductor-api → holochain-client-js <p>After a discussion both inside the team and with key developer community members, the name of the JavaScript conductor client has been changed. Everyone feels this better reflects its purpose as a client library for the conductor admin and app APIs.</p><p>The GitHub repo can now be found at <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js">https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js</a>, and the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/client">NPM package</a> is now called <code>@holochain/client</code>.</p><p>Of course, this is a breaking change, and you’ll need to update your <code>package.json</code> file in any project that uses this library.</p><p>If you’re a Rust front-end developer, there’s a package for you as well on <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust">GitHub</a>. If you’re working on a different front-end language and are building a conductor client library for it, we’d love to tell other developers about it!</p><p>Finally, the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/happ-client-call-tutorial">hApp client call tutorial</a> has been updated to use the new NPM package name (and has been updated to work with Holochain 0.0.119 and newer too).</p> Holochain 0.0.123: unified zome calling <p>The only breaking change with this release is that <code>call_remote</code> has been merged into <code>call</code> in the host API, and the signature has changed (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1180">#1180</a>). If your hApp accesses the host API directly, you’ll need to refactor your code. If you use the HDK instead, the <code>call</code> function’s <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.119/hdk/p2p/fn.call.html">signature has changed</a> too. The <code>call_remote</code> function is still available and the signature hasn’t changed, but you will need to recompile your zome against HDK 0.0.119 if you use it.</p><p>A network-level bug has also been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1181">#1181</a>). Attempts to send validation receipts back to authors created an infinite loop; this was hanging the conductor on app startup.</p> Save the date: FOSDEM 2022 on 5–6 Feb <p>As <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fosdem-2022-is-coming-up/">mentioned</a> two Dev Pulses ago, we’re once again co-hosting the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/web3_infrastructure/">Web3 / DWeb / peer-to-peer computing room</a> at FOSDEM, Europe’s largest open-source conference. In addition to three sessions related to Holochain and two related to <a href="https://fluence.network/">Fluence</a>, our co-host, there are a lot of other exciting-looking projects on the schedule. I’ve had the pleasure of speaking to people involved with many of these projects over the past few years, and they’re all breaking ground in unique ways and contributing to the evolution of the decentralised web.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@thisisengineering?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> ThisisEngineering RAEng</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/developer?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 New Value Flows: Impact modelling and Financing neighbourhood retrofit, v0.1 <p>This is part of <a href="https://www.notion.so/darkmatterlabs/TransCap-x-CivicValue-x-CommCap-WeekNotes-4e4acb5764af4e749d6463b097d3c0f4">a series of Weeknotes</a> as part of our TransCap x CivicValue x CommCap exploration. We have republished it here in our Provocations to spark a conversation on how we can rethink value flows in neighbourhood-level climate transitions.</p><p>Neighbourhoods are facing an imminent need to transition for climate change and deal with deep-seated issues of fuel poverty and other injustices. One of the most intractable challenges is the financial cost-benefit balance in undertaking a neighbourhood retrofit programme.</p><p>Under current conventional approaches, the comprehensive range of benefits and co-benefits projects generated are often unaccounted for, with the result being some projects being deemed (reductively) unviable investments, or worse, a liability. For example, as we have seen in our TreesAI project, <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-1dd94e1cfedf">urban trees are often seen as costs to municipalities, rather than value-creating natural assets</a>, a logic that justifies trees being removed rather than nurtured.</p><p>Dark Matter Labs’ approach to the TransCap x CommCap project is based our working hypothesis, ‘Transitioning Together’, which aims to lay the framework of a system that puts streets and neighbourhoods in the driving seat of their climate transition, empowering residents to be able to sense-make, deliberate, implement, and access financing for their neighbourhood’s climate transition projects.</p><p>A fundamental part of our hypothesis is about rewiring value flows in order to make these community-driven climate transitions possible. This includes an alternative approach that attempts to account for a project’s benefits and co-benefits in a comprehensive, efficient and holistic way. This also includes wiring a project’s revenue and financing to its impact as a way of incentivising the maximisation of benefits.</p><p>While the community will be the primary beneficiary of climate transition, there will be other stakeholders/actors who too will co-benefit: such as public or philanthropic bodies who may have their liabilities reduced, nearby property-owners who may benefit from land value uplift, or local businesses that may benefit from revenue uplift. By putting in place mechanisms (e.g. <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2?gi=54aae78dd38b">Smart Covenants</a> or outcome-buying contracts / social impact bonds) to capture these co-benefits, we would provide a long-term revenue source that can shift the cost-benefit balance in favour of doing these necessary projects, and also provide a framework for stakeholders to invest in outcomes-based preventative measures to reduce their liabilities (such as investing in housing retrofit, rather than spending on healthcare system costs for dealing with the health consequences of substandard, unhealthy homes).</p>The Transitioning Together model so far: revenues from captured co-benefits replenish a city-wide evergreen fund that funds community-driven climate transition projects. Initial experiments in value modelling <p>As part of our work developing this model, Dark Matter Labs and Civic Square are engaging with the community of Link Road (in Edgbaston, Birmingham) as a pioneer community for this approach. Based on data from the tangible, real-world context of this neighbourhood in Birmingham, we have taken a first attempt at creating this value model that represents a climate transition project’s costs, comprehensive estimates of its various benefits and co-benefits, and also the potential for these co-benefits to be captured.</p><p>Some questions that are beginning to emerge from this work&nbsp;include:</p>  Is this model based on rewiring value flows and capturing co-benefits viable for funding community-driven climate transition projects?<br>In particular, we want to find out the approximate scale of the potential revenues that could derive from capturing co-benefits, and how they compare to the costs of a&nbsp;project.  Is it possible to quantify and model the comprehensive set of co-benefits being created by climate transition projects?<br>For each type of climate transition project, it is necessary to develop an understanding of the types and quantities of (co-)benefits being generated, from the perspectives of the resident, a co-beneficiary, and an investor — is there enough research to allow this to be estimated, and how can we avoid double-counting?  How can qualitative co-benefits be accounted for in the model?<br>While capturing co-benefits and outcomes requires some degree of quantification, how they are metricised and captured opens up a space for contestation. More critically, we are reflecting on how qualitative benefits can be factored into the&nbsp;model.  How do we model the value that is created beyond the projects themselves?<br>Value created by such an approach can exist beyond the projects themselves: for example, the capacity a community develops and experience they gain after successfully implementing their first project can unlock further, more ambitious projects — this has ‘sequential’ value. The coexistence of multiple projects in a neighbourhood can also create a ‘systemic’ value that is greater than the sum of its parts. How can we account for these in the&nbsp;model?  Finally, are there any ethical risks of financialisation civic or public value, including any perverse incentives created by doing so? This work also represents a transition from a model of centralised state taxation and spending, where the creation of civic value, captured or not, is considered part of the state’s remit. While this model has both its opportunities and risks, we must also consider the new set of opportunities and risks by taking a more decentralised approach to civic value creation.   Value modelling approach Diagram showing the components of the interactive value&nbsp;model.<p>The structure of our initial value model is set out in the diagram above: the model is designed to take several global inputs (e.g. assumptions on inflation, the investment horizon, base interest rate, etc.). The model also allows the selection of a portfolio of different types of civic assets and climate transition projects (e.g. home energy efficiency retrofit, urban agriculture, community-owned PV energy generation, etc.), and the scale of the project (e.g. number of homes retrofitted, m2 of gardens used for growing, m2 of PV panels, etc.). Based on these inputs, the model calculates for each civic asset/project:</p>  Costs: This calculates the upfront and ongoing costs of building and operating the project, based on fixed costs and costs that scale per unit of the&nbsp;asset.  Impacts/benefits generated: This calculates the impacts generated over a comprehensive set of factors quantified in their natural units (tonnes of carbon emissions prevented and/or sequestered, health outcomes improved through no. of avoided hospitalisations/deaths, no. of employment opportunities created, litres of stormwater retained, no. of households brought out of fuel poverty, etc.) The calculations use assumptions based on local statistics and review of academic literature, and is part of our ongoing work to refine and test these calculation methods through further research.  Revenues: This calculates the revenues generated over a comprehensive set of factors quantified in the local currency (GBP) — this includes direct revenues such as one-off or annual grants, but also potential revenues from spillover value capture. The spillover capture calculation takes each benefit generated and identifies third party liability holders who may see potential liability reductions and therefore cost savings. A percentage of these estimated cost savings can be captured as a revenue source for the project, to be negotiated with these liability holders as potential ‘outcome buyers’ (for example, the local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group may pay for the outcome of reduced cold weather hospitalisations from home retrofit, based on a percentage of savings from costs of x fewer patients not going to A&amp;E per&nbsp;year).  <p>These cost, impact, and revenues calculations will then be aggregated across the entire portfolio, giving an idea of financing requirements and potential investment returns. We are still reflecting on how secondary value, such as the ‘sequential value’ and ‘systemic value’ described above can be incorporated into the model’s current working form. Double-counting remains challenging to disentangle, especially in areas such as the mutually linked nature of physical and mental health outcomes.</p> A version 0.1 of our&nbsp;model <p>We have created a first attempt of the model based on the logic above in a spreadsheet. The estimates for costs, impacts, and revenues in this version are ‘back of the envelope’ calculations based on common sense assumptions and high-level research we have done so far. This model will be further developed as part of our next stage of work, as the types of impacts modelled are expanded, and deeper research is done to quantify and predict these impacts with more rigour. We have tried to make this modelling as tangible as possible by basing the modelling on the real-world location of Link Road, Birmingham, where Dark Matter Labs and Civic Square are working with a group of residents to test this approach.</p>Main dashboard of the interactive model, with current work being done to replace placeholder figures with more research.<p>The main interface of the model is the dashboard, which gives an overview of the neighbourhood climate transition portfolio, and the whole portfolio’s estimated costs, impacts and revenues. The dashboard allows global inputs, such as investment horizon and the assumed annual inflation rate. The dashboard also allows different civic assets/climate transition projects to be included as part of the neighbourhood portfolio, and the scale of those assets (e.g. no. of homes retrofitted, m2 of urban agriculture, etc.). By changing these inputs to model different scenarios, the user of this modelling tool, whether it is the residents themselves or their advisors, can experiment and find an ideal portfolio of projects that work for their vision of their neighbourhood, and test its viability both in financial terms and the benefits/impacts the community is&nbsp;seeking.</p><p>Beyond the dashboard, each civic asset will have its own page with a more detailed breakdown of the capital and operating costs, its impacts and co-benefits, and also potential both one-off and recurring direct revenues (e.g. government grants/subsidies) and revenues from captured spillover values, with the calculated values updated based on the scale of the asset, and also global inputs. In this version 0.1 of our model, we have begun to build out these costs, impact and revenue models for an average home retrofit (up to EPC C rating), with the ambition to refine the model with more research and sophisticated modelling methods.</p> Financial modelling assumptions and findings: <p>The key assumptions on the cost side&nbsp;are:</p>  Cost per home of retrofitting the home: This is the most significant variable and will depend on characteristics and size of existing home, lifestyle of occupants, target improvement levels and the local supply chain. The literature appears to include a wide range of costs. Most helpful for Link Road are probably the actual average costs incurred through the BEIS supply chain pilots which were mainly undertaken on owner-occupied ‘early adopters’ seeking to do whole-house retrofits. This ended up costing in the region of £20-£25k per home. We acknowledge that some homeowners would be comfortable with improving to EPC C and including a low/zero carbon heat source such as an Air-Source Heat Pump (ASHP). Therefore we’ve assumed a total cost of around £20k per home for this work, but acknowledge that it could be more expensive.  We have factored in operating/maintenance costs as a overall percentage of the capital costs, acknowledging that at regular periods and the end of the horizon (e.g. 30 years), the buildings and their retrofitted work may need to undergo periodic maintenance and upgrades. We hope to make this more granular depending on the type of intervention in future versions of the&nbsp;model.  Our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/retrofit-building-back-better-d0ce9921840a">approach to deep retrofit</a> beyond the individual house means we should consider improving the streetscape and open spaces as part of retrofit. In our model, we have treated public realm improvements as a separate civic asset. These costs tend to be modest in comparison with the domestic improvements.  <p>Key assumptions on the revenue&nbsp;side:</p>  Energy savings are hard to quantify as again they depend on the home, occupants and selected level of comfort. We have used high-level <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/932403/prs-epc-c-consultation-stage-ia.pdf">government assumptions</a> around improving to EPC level C saving around £220 per household per year. This could be an underestimate especially given rising energy costs. These can be capitalised at a suitable discount rate and a reasonable life-cycle of the elements installed to achieve these outcomes.  Carbon emissions avoided are also based on the same government assumptions, approximately 1.69 tonnes of carbon per house per year. Although these emissions reductions are not all currently traded, there is a potential for this to be financialised beyond the existing ETS system — we have used the current (possibly underpriced) value of carbon in the UK ETS market as a conservative indication of a potential source of revenue. This is subject to change based on the carbon intensity of the grid, the price of carbon, and other regulatory changes in emissions trading.  We have also started to estimate other outcomes. These include social outcomes (e.g. fuel poverty alleviation), health outcomes (e.g. excess winter mortality, respiratory hospitalisations), and environmental outcomes (e.g. reduction of NOx emissions), with more in the pipeline. These are high-level back-of-envelope estimations using data as specific to the context (Link Road / Birmingham / West Midlands / UK) as possible. We are also in the process of reviewing approaches of modelling precedents, such as the <a href="https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/The-Multiple-Benefits-of-Deep-Retrofits-A-toolkit-for-cities?language=en_US">C40 Cities model</a>, <a href="https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/what-we-do/research/research-cost-benefit-analysis/">GMCA’s Unit Cost Database</a>, or the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/energy-models/models/hideem">UK Government’s HIDEEM model</a>, as a way of informing our own modelling methodology.   Emerging findings &amp; next&nbsp;steps <p>The model is preliminary and requires substantial development as part of the second stage of work. The following points are findings that are beginning to&nbsp;emerge.</p>  Energy savings make the biggest contribution in the average household. This range could be around 15–30% of up front costs depending on capitalisation assumptions, modelled savings, lifestyle and poverty of household etc. At the time of writing, energy costs are rising and there is a general expectation that OFGEM will increase the tariff cap. Without further intervention this will result in greater fuel poverty, but will further strengthen the case for using energy savings as part of the&nbsp;model.  Carbon emissions savings (if traded) makes up around 10–20% of the up front capital if this can be realised. Alternative avenues beyond the ETS system should be considered as a way of realising the value of these emission&nbsp;savings.  The potential revenue from other spillover values such as health appear to be small based on the first tranche of research. However, we are seeing in some implemented projects, such as Warm Homes Oldham which is co-funded by the local public health service, <a href="http://shura.shu.ac.uk/15738/">where estimated savings to public healthcare are on a comparable scale to energy savings</a>. This requires further exploration and verification and does not rule out the viability of capturing these spillover values when they are aggregated across neighbourhoods and considered at a city scale (as proposed by the Transitioning Together model). This means that the contractual, technological and other mechanisms to allow this value capture would have to be tested at a small scale, albeit with negligible returns, in order for this to be scaled. This would also help us understand if the returns on these values can be efficiently measured and distributed.  <p>We are now entering the Strategic Design phase of the project. This has a number of strands. For the impact and finance workstream we&nbsp;will:</p>  Refine and test the assumptions and modelling approach.  Improve our understanding of the scale at which different elements of the model would work best, both in terms of any internal cross-subsidy required, but also in terms of efficiency.  Shortlist the liability holders and commence discussions with them, to test the political viability of outcome contracting.  Build a legible, user-friendly model that can be used in engagement with residents and other stakeholders  <p>We’ll be posting further updates of our progress as the work progresses.

<p>Pablo Picasso was, by all accounts, a rather prolific artist. Throughout his lifetime, no fewer than 50,000 pieces of art are attributed to the Spaniard. Paintings, sculptures, prints, even tapestries, Picasso accrued an impressive body of work. Picasso passed away from natural causes at his home in France on April 8, 1973. He was 91, and died without a will. The artist’s passing marked the...</p>

   A digital wallet is a software program designed to keep your digital assets safe and secure. It can be used to store cryptocurrencies, verifiable credentials, and&nbsp;more.  These digital wallets can be broadly categorized into custodial and non-custodial wallets, depending on the level of control you have over your wallet. Specifically, this categorization is based on who stores the private keys

<p>A <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital wallet</a> is a software program designed to keep your digital assets safe and secure. It can be used to store cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/verifiable-credentials-in-bens-serendipity-b9acfa10f131">verifiable credentials</a>, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>These digital wallets can be broadly categorized into custodial and non-custodial wallets, depending on the level of control you have over your wallet. Specifically, this categorization is based on who stores the private keys of your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Before we jump into the differences, let’s recap how wallets work. Note that in this article, we will look only at <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/an-in-depth-exploration-of-self-sovereign-identity-and-verifiable-credentials-1a3eb2296004">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> wallets that store your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">verifiable credentials</a>.</p> Working of an SSI&nbsp;Wallet <p>Any credential such as your name, age, address, educational qualification, work experience, etc. can be issued in a digital format known as a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credential (VC)</a>. The obvious advantage of such a credential is that it is highly portable, easy to share, machine-verifiable, secure, and tamper-proof because it is cryptographically signed.</p><p>Here, “cryptographically-signed” means <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)</a> is used to secure the information contained in a VC, to prevent it from unauthorized viewing or tampering. The PKI has two parts, a private key, and a public key, and both these keys work only in&nbsp;pairs.</p><p>Every <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">verifiable credential</a> is signed by a public key and can be seen by anyone. But only the authorized people can access its contents as they will have the private key needed to unlock the public&nbsp;key.</p><p>The same principle applies to a wallet too. You need its private key to open the wallet and view or share the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-openbadges-vs-verifiable-credentials-d504c054d5db">verifiable credentials</a> stored in it. This is akin to a password.</p><p>From this standpoint, we can say that the entity that stores and maintains the private key of the wallet is its custodian.</p> Custodial Wallets <p>A custodial wallet is a type of digital wallet where the organization that offers this service holds the private key needed to open the wallet and access its contents. Here, the organization is the custodian of the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Advantages of Custodial Wallets <p>So, what are the advantages that come with custodial wallets?</p>  Most custodial wallets are web-based and hence, device agnostic. You can access these wallets from any part of the world, and need just a browser and Internet.  Highly convenient  The holder doesn’t have the responsibility to remember the password or the private&nbsp;key.  Extensible, as many organizations offer the same wallet for storing not just VCs, but also cryptos and other digital assets going&nbsp;forward.   Disadvantages of Custodial Wallets <p>Custodial wallets are not perfect, as they come with some shortcomings as&nbsp;well.</p>  The password is stored in the servers of a third party, and this can make it a lot less&nbsp;secure.  Requires considerable research to identify a secure and reputable wallet.  Custodial wallets come with a&nbsp;fee.  <p>In all, a custodial wallet is a convenient and extensible option for storing your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-vs-verifiable-credentials-vcs-cd0ebb13f1fb">verifiable credentials</a>. It takes the responsibility of storing and remembering passwords from the user, but at the same time, brings a third party into the transaction, thereby making it a lot less secure. Furthermore, the organization that controls the wallet’s keys can determine in the future how and where its contents can be&nbsp;used.</p> What are Non-Custodial Wallets? <p>As the name suggests, non-custodial wallets are those wallets that are solely controlled by the owner. In other words, you are the only one who knows the password to open the wallet, and hence, you’re the only one who can access it. No other entities are involved in managing your&nbsp;wallet.</p> Advantages of Non-custodial Wallets <p>The biggest advantages of non-custodial wallets are privacy and security. Since no one other than you can access the wallet, you can be assured that its contents will never be accessible to anyone and hence, offers the highest levels of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, only you can determine how your VCs can be used, and with whom they can be shared. In this sense, non-custodial wallets adhere to the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity completely.</p> Disadvantages of Non-custodial Wallets <p>The biggest disadvantage of non-custodial wallets is their inaccessibility when you lose or forget the password. Since you are the sole custodian, there is a huge responsibility on you to always remember the password of your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>The other minor disadvantage is that non-custodial wallets can be tied down to a device, depending on its implementation. This means you will always need the associated device to access the wallet application.</p><p>So, which of the two is better? Simply depends on your preference!</p> Affinidi’s Wallet <p>If you decide to go ahead with custodial wallets, note that <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-affinidis-digital-wallet-1c2a52b4d13f">Affinidi’s wallet</a> is one of the best choices today in terms of security and flexibility.

 Spherity is Partnering with Legisym Offering Joint Compliance Product for the U.S. Life Sciences&nbsp;Market.  Legisym, LLC is a trusted expert in the U.S. Life Sciences Market, providing services to pharmaceutical companies around the world since&nbsp;2009 <p>Legisym and Spherity have worked closely together to bring to maturity a joint offering that meets the security requirements of the U.S. Life Sciences Market. As part of the joint development, both companies have collaborated with SAP and Novartis, which have already subjected the product to extensive quality testing and functional validation. Spherity and Legisym are pleased to officially announce their partnership as of&nbsp;today.</p>Spherity is partnering with Legisym offering a joint compliance product, Credentialing Service, for the U.S. Life Sciences&nbsp;Market.<p>In November 2013, the U.S. congress enacted the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) in order to protect patients’ health. To ensure that only legitimate actors are part of the supply chain, the regulation requires U.S. pharmaceutical trading partners to ensure that they only interact with other trading partners that are authorized. Authorized is every trading partner holding a valid state-issued license or a current registration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>Today in 2022, U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain actors have no interoperable, electronic mechanism to validate each other´s authorized status. With more than 60,000 interacting trading partners involved in the U.S. Life Sciences Industry and a FDA recommendation to respond to data requests in under one minute, a solution that provides compliance with the regulations by 2023 is in high demand. Legisym and Spherity have decided to cooperate and offer an interoperable highly secure service to enable pharmaceutical supply chain actors to become an Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) according to U.S.&nbsp;DSCSA.</p><p>Legisym, as a trusted identity and license verification service provider, perfectly complements Spherity’s digital wallet technology for managing verifiable credentials. The verifiable credential technology is used to represent the authorized status of interacting trading partners in an highly efficient, secure and DSCSA-compliant way. To use credentialing for Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) requirements under DSCSA, trading partners need to go through a one-time due diligence onboarding process with Legisym. Once the verifiable credentials are issued, they are stored in a secure digital wallet which comes embedded with the Credentialing Service provided by Spherity. Using this technology enables U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain actors to interact with digital trust, as they now can digitally verify their ATP status in every interaction.</p><p>Georg Jürgens, Manager Industry Solutions at Spherity says, “together with our partner Legisym we focused on making the adoption of credentialing for trading partners as simple as possible. Manufacturers, wholesalers and dispensers can all acquire a digital wallet and ATP credentials within minutes without integration effort and use this innovative solution for DSCSA-regulated interactions.”</p><p>“Legisym is thrilled to be working alongside Spherity to bring the first production-level ATP Credentialing solution to the industry,” said Legisym President &amp; Co-Owner David Kessler. “With the successful completion of the ATP Credentialing Pilot in 2020 and the joint founding of the Open Credentialing Initiative in early 2021, the Spherity-Legisym partnership is already proving successful in collaboration and forward thinking.”</p><p>Legisym and Spherity founded along with other adopters, the <a href="http://oc-i.org">Open Credentialing Initiative</a> (OCI). This newly formed organization incubates and standardizes the architecture using Digital Wallets and Verifiable Credentials for DSCSA compliance for Authorized Trading Partner requirements. Besides U.S pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, and dispensers, the OCI is open for solution providers integrating the ATP solution.</p><p>For press relations, contact <a href="mailto:communication@spherity.com">communication@spherity.com</a>.

<p>A credential comprises one or more claims made by the issuer of a credential about the subject. For example; a driving license containing the licensee's name, SSN, date of birth, etc is a credential where such data and details are claims made by the license issuer about the licensee which is the subject. A credential is called a verifiable credential when its authenticity can be cryptographically checked by anyone because the credential contains a cryptographic signature by the issuer, and the issuer's public key is well known. To convince a service provider, the verifier, of the authenticity of a verifiable credential, the credential along with the signature is shared with the service provider who can then verify the signature.</p><p>However, the above approach may be harmful to the user’s privacy. The entity in possession of the credential being the holder, has to share the credential in its entirety with the verifier, which may reveal a lot more information than what was needed. As an example, the holder may have wanted to share his name and date of birth from his license, not the rest of the credential data like his SSN, all while still being able to convince the verifier that he does own a verifiable credential containing his name and date of birth. This desired property is called selective disclosure where the holder can choose to disclose only parts of the credential, rather than the entire credential. </p><p>Another problem to solve is linkability. Say the holder is able to achieve selective disclosure where it only reveals part of the credential data to the verifier (the part that is sufficient for the verifier to provide service to the holder), the holder would not want the verifier to link his previous interactions with him. This desired property is called unlinkability. There are cases however when the holder is willing to be linked across several of his interactions but that should be voluntary and we do support that.</p><p>In some cases, even the above two properties might not be sufficient, for example when the holder wants to reveal part of the data -</p>  If a holder wants to prove he is over 18 or above 65 for availing a service, he doesn't need to show his date of birth; just being able to prove those conditions, called predicates is sufficient for the verifier.  For proving that he/she is not a resident of a city/state, the holder should not need to share his exact address.  For availing of social welfare, when the holder's salary is below a certain amount, the holder should not need to reveal his salary from his bank statement, but show an anonymous credential to convince the verifier of the same.  Similarly, an investor should be able to convince a verifier that the total value of his assets is greater than some amount without revealing the actual values of his assets.  <p>One of the solutions to solve the above problem is called anonymous credentials, sometimes called Attribute-Based Credentials (ABC). The main idea in anonymous credentials is that rather than considering the credential data as arbitrary bytes which are then signed by the issuer, anonymous credentials adds "structure" to the credential. Each claim in the credential is treated as an attribute and then these attributes are signed in a specific way by the issuer to create a signature. These attributes and the signature now form anonymous credentials. For example, if a credential has 3 claims made by the issuer about the holder including, name, city, and SSN, these 3 claims correspond to 3 attributes, one for each claim. Because of the "structure" in this credential, the holder can prove to a verifier, using zero-knowledge proof, that he has this credential from the issuer without revealing any of the attributes. To be precise, the holder can disclose these attributes exist and have been signed by an official issuer, without disclosing the attributes themselves or the signature. </p><p>"The holder can also reveal one or more attributes as part of the zero-knowledge proof from this anonymous credential, thus achieving selective disclosure."</p><p>“One or more zero-knowledge proofs created from the same anonymous credential cannot be linked together thus giving us unlinkability. "</p><p>To achieve both of these properties, we use a signature scheme called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/663">BBS+</a>. A useful property of BBS+ (and similar) signatures is that when using several BBS+ signatures, attributes common to the signatures can be proven equal without revealing them. For example, if you have a driving license credential and passport, both with a BBS+ signature, you can prove that your SSN attribute is the same in both your driving license and passport without revealing your SSN. This property allows linking many credentials together and is helpful in cases when you need to prove that all credentials are about the same subject (or subject id).</p><p>Because credentials are essentially attestations made by an authority, i.e. the issuer, meaning they act as evidence or proof of something, it should be possible for the authority to permanently or temporarily renounce the attestations. These revoked credentials signal that the credential should not be accepted by any verifier. This kind of signaling requires the verifier to check the unique ID against a public list of all revoked credentials. However, revealing such a unique ID goes against our unlinkability requirement, as the unique ID of the credential ties all zero-knowledge proofs created from that credential. Therefore, we need a system in which the holder can prove that the membership of their credential ID is in a list in-zero knowledge:</p>  The verifier is assured the holder’s credential ID is not in the public list of all revoked credentials  The verifier will not have access to the credential ID  This system will ensure the holder is unlinkable.  <p>For this zero-knowledge membership, we use an accumulator which is a set-like database but with a very small size and allows such zero-knowledge membership checks. Accumulators also enable other use cases where such a membership or non-membership check is required. </p><p>Say that you have a bank details credential that contains your account number as one of the attributes. To convince a regulator that your account is not in a "suspicious-accounts" list, you can prove to the regulator that your account is not in the accumulator which contains all suspicious accounts. We use a pairing-based accumulator called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/777">VB accumulator</a>.</p><p>Some other common requirements with anonymous credentials is being able to prove conditions or predicates about the attributes like proving total income from a bank statement credential is less than the limit. Here the total income might not be a single attribute but composed of several attributes with one attribute per income source. Therefore, the attributes need to be added together before comparing to the limit amount, some cases may need more complex operations on one or more attributes. </p><p>These capabilities are not possible with BBS+ alone, and we therefore use zk-SNARK which can be used to prove arbitrary conditions on the attributes. The zk-SNARK we use is the same as used in Zcash but <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16">adapted</a> to be linked with the BBS+ signature.</p><p>Anonymous credentials offer great privacy but too much privacy can sometimes be crippling for regulators or law enforcement. Consider an exchange as a verifier that allows customers to make transactions after they prove possession of a government ID, but does not ask for any other information. At any point, a regulator or law enforcement may want to know details of who made certain transactions, but the only information the verifier has and is able to provide, is that someone made the transactions with a government ID. </p><p>This isn’t sufficient for the regulator or law enforcement, traceability is needed here. However, not everyone in this chain needs traceability, certain authorities are the ones in need of it. We solve this problem by a technique called verifiable encryption.</p><p>Using the example above, a customer who possesses a government ID should be required to encrypt their SSN for the regulator without revealing the SSN itself. Authorities can decrypt the SSN and track who the government ID belongs to, while the customer is assured the exchange is not able to track them, only the authorities who need to trace them. Note that verifiable encryption is not mandatory with Dock credentials, it’s opt-in.</p>  The <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto">core cryptographic library</a> that implements the signature schemes and proof protocols is implemented in Rust.  The library contains different primitives in separate crates. The notable ones are <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/bbs_plus">BBS+ signatures</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/vb_accumulator">accumulators</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/proof_system">composite proof system</a>.  The composite proof system allows us to combine these primitives like proving knowledge of 2 BBS+ signatures with proof of accumulator membership.  <p>Since a large part of this code needs to run in a Javascript environment like a browser or a react native app, we built a <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm">WASM wrapper</a> over the Rust code. The wrapper is quite thin and mostly does deserialization/serialization logic. It intentionally lacks abstractions like classes and is just some modules with free-floating functions. Finally, there is a <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts">Typescript library</a> that uses the WASM wrapper and provides various abstractions like creating signatures, proofs, accumulators. &nbsp;</p><p>As verification of proofs and accumulator membership/non-membership requires publicly available authenticated storage, we deployed the ability to post BBS+ and accumulator public keys on our chain and also to create, update and remove accumulators. The changes have been live on the mainnet for some time and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/src/modules/bbs-plus.js">corresponding</a> <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/src/modules/accumulator.js">modules</a> and tests are added in SDK for <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/bbs-plus.test.js">BBS+</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/accumulator.test.js">accumulators</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/demo.test.js">composite proof</a> by fetching objects from the chain.</p><p>For a more detailed explanation of the primitives, see <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#overview">the explainer</a> in the GitHub repo. The usage with examples is described <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#usage">here</a>. It is broken down into the following sections:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#bbs-signatures-1">BBS+ signature</a>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#accumulators">Accumulator</a>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#composite-proofs-1">Composite proof system</a>  <p>The composite proof subsection shows several examples like <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a>, creating proofs over <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#multiple-bbs-signatures">multiple BBS+ signatures</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#bbs-signature-together-with-accumulator-membership">BBS+ signature with accumulator membership</a>, getting <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#getting-a-blind-signature">blind BBS+ signature</a>, meaning even the issuer is not aware of certain attributes, and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#verifier-local-or-opt-in-linkability">opt-in linkability</a> where the holder chooses to be linkable across several proofs of his credential, but only at a certain verifier.</p><p>We are exploring options for predicates like range proofs, verifiable encryption, and support for arbitrary computation on credential data in general, but we have PoCs for showing that they work with BBS+ signatures.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/cp-snark-bbs">PoC</a> shows the usage of BBS+ and <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16">LegoGroth16</a>, which is an adaptation of Groth16, the zk-SNARK used in Zcash. The PoC shows how to:</p>  Prove that some attribute of a BBS+ signature satisfies some bound that can be used to prove that age is less than or greater than some number  Prove that the sum of certain attributes satisfy a certain bound which can be used to prove that the sum of liabilities is less than some number.  Prove that sum of certain attributes of 1 credential is less than the sum of certain attributes of another credential, which can be used to prove that the sum of liabilities is less than the sum of assets.  <p>This <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/saver-poc/saver">PoC</a> shows verifiable encryption based on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1270">SAVER</a>. We show in <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/blob/saver-poc/saver/src/tests.rs">this test</a>, that a user can verifiably encrypt any of his attributes for a third party, and convince the third party that the encryption has been correctly done. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/udbhav-tiwari-b4919839/">Udbhav Tiwari</a>, Public Policy Advisor at <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>, compares the lack of data privacy protection laws in certain parts of the world to the&nbsp;others.</p><p>We have often spoken about the relevance of Web3 and decentralization in our podcast. Still, it is essential to talk about pioneers in the Web2 space fighting for free internet and data privacy. They are the advocates working with governments for data regulations that protect internet users. One of such organizations is Mozilla. In this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we talked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/udbhav-tiwari-b4919839/">Udbhav Tiwari</a>, Public Policy Advisor at Mozilla. During this discussion, he explains the role of Mozilla in the free internet ecosystem, data regulations discrepancies in the Asia Pacific and particularly India, and more. Here are edited excerpts of the&nbsp;podcast.</p><p>Mozilla’s role in the internet ecosystem: 20 years of Mozilla&nbsp;Firefox</p><p>Mozilla explicitly works towards treating the internet as a global public resource that should be accessible to everyone. It does this with the help of different <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/">products such as Firefox, Pocket, and Mozilla&nbsp;VPN.</a></p><blockquote>“My role in the global public policy team at Mozilla is to also look out for laws and regulations that may impact these products. I oversee if the laws can be improved to ensure that they lead to that open Internet — I then advocate for those laws. Or if there are particularly worrying things in certain laws and regulations that would be bad, not just for Mozilla’s products, but also for the internet — I also tend to work on those issues. And so far my remit has largely been in the Asia Pacific region but I also work on some other issues globally.”</blockquote><p>The main aspects of Udbhav’s role&nbsp;are</p>  data protection and&nbsp;privacy  content regulation and intermediary liability  connectivity, encryption, and&nbsp;security  <p>The Mozilla Foundation is actually a digital rights NGO. It has fellows that work on internet health and internet security around the world. At Voices of the Data Economy, we have interviewed two fellows in the past: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/julia-reinhardt-what-do-gdpr-and-ai-regulations-mean/id1506212617?i=1000531062544">Julia Reinhardt </a>and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/anouk-ruhaak-data-trusts-and-collective-consent/id1506212617?i=1000475444072">Anouk Ruhaak</a>. The foundation has initiatives like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keb0oAMV-I4">YouTube Regrets </a>and <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/">privacy not included</a>.</p><p>Data Regulations across Asia and&nbsp;India</p><p>Udbhav mentions that Europe has had a data protection law for much longer than other parts of the world (of course, now we have&nbsp;GDPR).</p><blockquote>“Here in the Asia Pacific region, it’s quite far from being the norm even to have a data protection law in the first place. If one were to turn the clock back, I would say even ten years ago; one could easily count on two hands the number of countries in the Asia Pacific region that had a dedicated data protection law on the books. But thanks to the proliferation of technology and public demands from civil society that want better protections for users and consumers– things are changing.”</blockquote><p>Australia has had a privacy law for a fair amount of time. Still, they are actually amid re-looking at their privacy law; it’s being updated to suit modern technologies better. If one were to move a little higher up, countries like the Philippines have now had a privacy law for some time. And in fact, business imperatives around the business processing and outsourcing industry in the Philippines played a considerable role in the Philippines, even having a privacy law in the first place. Sri Lanka is also looking at a data protection law. Even countries like Indonesia have been debating data protection laws for some time, and Indonesia also now has a data protection law. However, some provisions within the law still need to be notified, or specific, like regulatory entities under the law need to be set&nbsp;up.</p><blockquote>“Even in India, the protection, the conversation around data protection has been going on for well over, I think, 12 years now, approximately, there have been different versions of different bills that different committees have proposed.”</blockquote><p>Indian data regulation law and its relation with non-personal data</p><p>The drafted data protection law in India has the following issues:</p>  The first fundamental provision is around data protection and how it applies to governments. So the law in India currently has a section, the draft law, section 35, which will allow the government to exempt any part of itself from any part of the law. Everybody understands the need for exceptions: national security for law enforcement access, and all laws worldwide contain it like the GDPR contains some exceptions. But in India, many people think it has significantly exceeded that narrow scope. Hypothetically, it can say things&nbsp;like    These 15 sections will not apply to the Reserve Bank of&nbsp;India  These five sections won’t apply to view IDI, India’s digital identity authority or  The whole law will not apply to the Intelligence Bureau OR the whole law will not apply to the CBI, India’s centralized investigation agency.    The second provision is in general, around the independence of the Data Protection Authority that this law is proposing. The Data Protection Authority is the regulator that enforces data protection laws — they are the ones you can complain to if something goes wrong with you and a Data Collector. But some individuals do proactive audits who enforce the provisions of the law. And suppose you don’t have a robust Data Protection Authority. In that case, the law becomes a toothless tiger when it comes to data protection because you can’t do anything unless there is, you know, a capable infrastructure of people who can enforce that&nbsp;law.  <p>India’s data protection law contains both the drafts and the new one as well contains some pretty strong language that splits data into three categories.</p>  Personal data  Sensitive Personal&nbsp;data  Critical Personal&nbsp;data  <blockquote>“Critical personal data isn’t defined; it’s something that the government will be able to notify, for example, they can say health data is critical, they can say that. And in these three classifications, critical data will have to stay in the country and simply cannot leave the country. Sensitive data can leave the country for a short amount of time, but a copy of that data must always be kept in the country, and personal data can currently go around when it wants to. So as you can imagine this, fundamentally like rejigs the way the internet and its infrastructure works in a very big&nbsp;way.”</blockquote><p>When it comes to non-personal data, in general, numbers, data is actually like, it has a negative definition, which is anything that isn’t personal data is nonpersonal data. So all privacy laws and data protection laws around the world fundamentally apply to personal data, right, like data that identifies an individual or has identifying characteristics. So for example, if I write a poem, right, like on a piece of paper or on Google Docs, and I don’t write any my name on it, I don’t associate it with an account, then that is actually isn’t data. Yes. Is it personal data? No. Right? Like, because, for example, imagine Amazon has the list of the top 100 products that are sold in India every day, right without who bought them without any other information, just a pure List of 100 products, top 100 products that are sold in India every day. That is an example of nonpersonal data. It is data it has its uses as inferences associated with it. But it doesn’t meet the definition of personal data, which means it doesn’t have identifying characteristics that can’t be used to identify individuals, so on and so&nbsp;forth.</p><p>India’s status in Data Regulation</p><p>India, in many ways, is trying, and some people are now openly saying it is very much trying to carve what it calls is the fourth part of internet regulation; they think that the three main dominant models&nbsp;are</p>  The United States: with the free market, very little regulation  Europe: pretty strong prescriptive regulation,  regulation in countries like China, which differs much more from the state’s&nbsp;power.  <blockquote>“I think India, in all of the issues that we have discussed, is trying to pick and choose different models from these different countries in order to be able to implement them in practice. I think it is very deliberately doing so to set an example for other similarly placed countries. So it’s not just what we do here, but it’s also how we do things in a manner that other countries can&nbsp;follow.”</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>2.20 -7.25: Mozilla’s role in the internet ecosystem</p><p>7.25–13.20: Data regulations in the Asia Pacific with a focus on&nbsp;India</p><p>13.20–28:35: What is non-personal data, and how are the regulations?</p><p>28.35–32:05: How should a data protection law in India look&nbsp;like?</p><p>32.05–43.06: How does big tech behave in&nbsp;India</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-governance-across-continents-what-does-it-mean-for-internet-users-39c771ab1f08">Data Governance Across Continents: What does it mean for internet users?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 È online il nuovo sito web di InfoCert-Tinexta Group per parlare alla platea sempre più vasta ed eterogenea di utenti dei Digital Trust Services. 



 Il progetto rientra nella più ampia strategia aziendale che punta ad arricchire e rafforzare il rapporto con i clienti con esperienze d’uso personalizzate e coinvolgenti in ogni ambito. 



<p>Roma, 20 Gennaio 2022 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, annuncia il rilascio della nuova versione di infocert.it, il sito web dedicato all’offerta di soluzioni tra cui PEC, Firma Digitale, Marche temporali, Conservazione Digitale, Fatturazione Elettronica e SPID.</p>



<p>Il radicale rinnovo di infocert.it ha grande valore strategico per l’azienda, anche per il suo ruolo di porta d’accesso della clientela, in particolare PMI e Professionisti e privati, al mondo dei trust services: sono oltre 1 milione i clienti dell’ecommerce InfoCert ed il sito ogni anno registra oltre 100 Milioni di pagine visitate.</p>



<p>Inoltre, questa prima release del sito è la chiave di comunicazione digitale di InfoCert in Europa. Infatti, le aziende del gruppo InfoCert verranno allineate a questo nuovo format, con l‘obiettivo ambizioso di rendere sempre più riconoscibile l’immagine e l’offerta del gruppo InfoCert. Questo elemento è stato fondamentale per determinare la scelta attuale di User Experience e Look&amp;Feel, in quanto ha l’importante ruolo di comunicare non solo un marchio all’estero, ma soprattutto di intercettare le esigenze di geografie e culture diverse.</p>



<p>Il progetto è in continua evoluzione: già entro il primo trimestre del 2022, è prevista la trasformazione della sezione di e-commerce nonché la creazione di aree dedicate a specifici target di clientela.</p>



<p>Il nuovo sito si distingue per quattro caratteristiche principali:</p>



  Completo: gli utenti possono trovare sul sito non solo le informazioni su tutti i prodotti dell’offerta InfoCert per digitalizzare il proprio business, ma anche lo spazio per comprendere meglio il mondo dei servizi di digital trust.  Chiaro: le informazioni sono sintetiche, precise e facilmente consultabili anche grazie a numerosi video tutorial.  Conversazionale: lo stile punta su fruibilità e informalità, anche grazie a un uso di immagini coinvolgenti e rappresentative dei principali target.  Contemporaneo: il design risponde non solo a specifiche esigenze funzionali, ma è anche in linea con i più recenti e innovativi canoni estetici e qualitativo-esperienziali.  



<p>In sintesi, il nuovo sito web è in 4C per un’esperienza inedita, personale e coinvolgente su qualsiasi dispositivo, innanzitutto mobile.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Il nuovo portale vuole essere in linea con l’evoluzione del posizionamento di InfoCert, realtà tutta italiana che si è fortemente posizionata come leader in Italia dei servizi di Digital Trust e che negli ultimi anni sta adottando una strategia sempre più globale in Europa e non solo. Questo nuovo sito è solo la prima tappa di una strategia più ampia di cui si vedranno pienamente i risultati nei prossimi mesi. Vogliamo, infatti, garantire una brand experience continua, chiara e coerente ai clienti esistenti e potenziali a prescindere dal canale o dal dispositivo da loro utilizzato. Per continuare, e addirittura accelerare, il percorso di successo intrapreso da anni. Puntiamo al consolidamento e all’arricchimento del rapporto di conoscenza e fiducia con tutti i nostri sempre più numerosi interlocutori. Questo è dovuto essenzialmente ad una vera e propria esplosione, causata in larga parte anche dall’evento pandemico, della digitalizzazione sia in ambito professionale che non. A questo si aggiunge una platea internazionale crescente, vista la nostra dimensione sempre più globale”</p>Marco Lauro, Director Web &amp; Inside Sales InfoCert – Tinexta Group</blockquote>

 Protecting customer data will continue to be an urgent issue for businesses worldwide in 2022. The risks and requirements are not going away. 



<p></p>



<p>In 2021 we saw users demanding and gaining more control over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. Big tech/ad tech took&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/16/big-tech-critics-mustered-their-forces-2021/">more hits</a> to their data-driven business models, even while introducing variously effective “privacy” measures (such as Google phasing out&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">third party cookies</a>&nbsp;and scrapping app developers access to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/google-makes-genuine-privacy-move-by-scrapping-ad-ids-for-users-who-opt-out-of-targeted-ads/">ad IDs</a>&nbsp;and Apple introducing the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">ATT</a>&nbsp;feature and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">privacy labels</a>&nbsp;in the App Store). When&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/the-whatsapp-facebook-signal-issue-explained-and-why-mysudo-is-the-best-solution/">WhatsApp</a>&nbsp;caused global outrage by demanding its 2 billion-plus users consent to sharing their personal data with Facebook, and Elon Musk switched millions of those users to private messaging app Signal with a two-word tweet, the world was never surer that consumers are tired of trading their personal information for access to services. This sentiment is only intensifying.</p>



<p>Throughout 2021, the regulatory landscape expanded, placing even greater compliance burdens on business and making cross-border data transfers more difficult.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/businesses-face-rising-cybersecurity-risks-from-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;and the mass move to remote working environments continued to demand businesses find ways to protect employee devices and secure corporate data and resources as cybersecurity threats ramped up. Contact tracing also amplified the risks of sharing and storing personal information.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/cisco-the-age-of-privacy-has-arrived-helped-by-covid-19/">Cisco</a>&nbsp;confirmed the pandemic had seriously elevated the importance of data privacy as a business priority and, as we enter the third year of the pandemic, this imperative hasn’t changed. Privacy budgets and resourcing skyrocketed among businesses in response, and governments and health authorities are still struggling to balance public health with protecting personal privacy.</p>



 Obviously, data privacy will remain firmly on the agenda in 2022, so the big trends to watch for are: 



<p></p>



<p></p>



 Privacy regulations and compliance obligations will continue to expand and tighten in the US and globally.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a>&nbsp;(IAPP) quotes Goodwin Partner and IAPP Senior Fellow, Omer Tene as saying,&nbsp;“In 2022, expect an avalanche of new laws and regulations, attempting to govern and impose order on a dizzying array of tech developments. New regulatory efforts will range from data protection laws in India and China to AI regulation in the EU to automated decision making rules in US states. Add to that a flurry of enforcement activities, and you get a perfect storm of tech regulation.”<br><br>But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/">Tene</a>&nbsp;says it’s unlikely the US will gets its long awaited national privacy law in 2022, but at least six states will move to pass their own (Maryland, Oklahoma, Ohio, New Jersey, Florida and Alaska), and it will be interesting to see whether any of those states includes a&nbsp;<a href="https://lawrina.com/blog/private-right-of-action/#:~:text=According%20to%20Federal%20law%2C%20a,legal%20violations%20under%20a%20statute.">private right of action</a>&nbsp;(PRA) —because, if they don’t, the game could change. “A couple of years ago, conventional wisdom was that the more states pass privacy laws, the greater the pressure will build on the business community, and consequently Congress, to pass preemptive federal legislation. Absent a PRA, however, an interesting dynamic may develop, where the more state privacy laws, the less appetite businesses – who are growing accustomed to complying with the emerging (PRA-less) state framework – have for federal pre-emption,” Tene says.</p>



<p>More tech legislation will flow out of Europe too. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/">Tene</a>&nbsp;calls it&nbsp;“a veritable alphabet soup of tech regulation affecting digital platforms, digital services, online marketing, data intermediaries and more …”. The&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0206">AI Act</a>, affecting algorithmic decision making across the economy, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-data-act">Data Act</a>, which broadens legal obligations, including cross-border transfer restrictions, to non-personal data will also be things to watch.</p>



 We’ll see more regulatory enforcement.  



<p></p>



<p>Governments in the US and Europe are expected to ramp up regulatory enforcement around breach reporting and risk reporting. GDPR enforcement increased in 2021 and this is set to continue. Tene says, “Importantly, regulators are expanding the lens from an early focus on data breaches to challenging companies’ legal bases for processing data and, notably, cross-border data flows. In 2022, expect an additional step up the enforcement ladder. We expect regulators to focus on issues such as protecting children’s data, restricting the use of sensitive health and financial information, and curbing the excess of digital marketing.” Of course, if greater enforcement is to happen, the regulators will need to be adequately resourced. Enforcement times are not getting any shorter on the complex cases. It will also be long overdue. For example, the Schrems II decision was in the middle of 2020 and there has been very minimal (if any?) enforcement action resulting from that change.&nbsp;</p>



 More limits on big tech/ad tech.  



<p></p>



<p>Regulators, the media and the general public have big tech/ad tech firmly in their sights and will continue to demand more privacy-first data tracking and sharing practices and business models. As we&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/consumers-could-gain-from-ftcs-stronger-focus-on-data-protection/">reported</a>&nbsp;last year,&nbsp;the Federal Trade Commission could go harder on consumer privacy protection and cybersecurity with President Biden’s recent nomination of digital “privacy hawk” and law professor&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/alvaro-bedoya-ftc-biden/">Alvaro Bedoya</a>&nbsp;and House Democrats’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/09/democrats-tech-reconciliation/">proposal</a>&nbsp;to allocate $1 billion for a new privacy and data security bureau.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tene notes: “Under the leadership of new Chair Lina Khan, the FTC has issued strong&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/jsp/eAgenda/StaticContent/202110/Statement_3084_FTC.pdf">statements and strategic plans</a>&nbsp;for broad&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202110&amp;RIN=3084-AB69">rulemaking</a>&nbsp;efforts, including rules to curb “abuses stemming from surveillance-based business models” and “lax security practices” and to “ensure that algorithmic decision-making does not result in unlawful discrimination.” But he notes this in part depends on Bedoya’s appointment proceeding in the Senate, which may not be quick.&nbsp;</p>



 Consumers will continue to favor brands that are genuinely good, honest stewards of their personal data.  



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/">Cisco</a>&nbsp;released research findings in October 2021 which it says, ”demonstrates the growing importance of privacy to the individual and its implications on the businesses and governments that serve them.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/">Eighty-six per cent</a>&nbsp;of respondents said they care about data privacy and want more control, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/">79 percent</a>&nbsp;said they’d be willing to vote with their wallet and not support businesses that don’t protect their data and would indeed pay for better data protection. This sounds like the new growing market of “<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">privacy actives</a>” we discussed last year and which no brand can afford to ignore. Cisco reminds business that data abuses have eroded trust in brands, which is one reason it has released&nbsp;its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-new-trust-standard.pdf?CCID=cc000742&amp;DTID=esootr000875&amp;OID=wprsc027437">New Trust Standard</a>, which we’ll explore in a separate article soon.</p>



<p>Clearly the opportunity for businesses to build customer trust and loyalty by responding authentically to what their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">customers want and need</a>&nbsp;are enormous. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/cybersecurity/trusted-tech.html">PwC</a>&nbsp;says, brands that get customer privacy and safety right will disrupt the market. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;privacy and cybersafety services platform can help you to rapidly develop and deploy branded customer solutions.</p>

And how decentralized are they actually?</p><p>That’s one of Moxie Marlinspike’s points from a blog post last week on his “<a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">first impressions of web3</a> (via /rcb) that’s making the rounds in the cryptosphere.</p><p>Here’s Moxie on the problem with&nbsp;NFTs:</p><blockquote>Most people think of images and digital art when they think of NFTs, but NFTs generally do not store that data on-chain. For most NFTs of most images, that would be much too expensive.</blockquote><blockquote>Instead of storing the data on-chain, NFTs instead contain a URL that points to the data. What surprised me about the standards was that there’s no hash commitment for the data located at the URL. Looking at many of the NFTs on popular marketplaces being sold for tens, hundreds, or millions of dollars, that URL often just points to some VPS running Apache somewhere. Anyone with access to that machine, anyone who buys that domain name in the future, or anyone who compromises that machine can change the image, title, description, etc for the NFT to whatever they’d like at any time (regardless of whether or not they “own” the token). There’s nothing in the NFT spec that tells you what the image “should” be, or even allows you to confirm whether something is the “correct” image.</blockquote><blockquote>So as an experiment, I made an NFT that changes based on who is looking at it, since the web server that serves the image can choose to serve different images based on the IP or User Agent of the requester. For example, it looked <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307/1">one way</a> on OpenSea, <a href="https://rarible.com/token/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307:1?tab=details">another way</a> on Rarible, but when you buy it and view it from your crypto wallet, it will always display as a large [poop] emoji. What you bid on isn’t what you get. There’s nothing unusual about this NFT, it’s how the NFT specifications are built. Many of the highest priced NFTs could turn into [poop] emoji at any time; I just made it explicit.</blockquote><p>That’s the current NFT reality. But technology has never been just about code. It’s also an inherently social endeavor — as Matt Levine <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-10/web3-takes-trust-too">points out in his Money Stuff newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>The NFT does not by itself convey ownership of the underlying thing in either a legal or practical sense. It conveys ownership in some more metaphysical sense: If you buy a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, then the people who are part of the BAYC NFT community will treat you as the owner of your ape. This is essentially a social fact and can be true even if the immutable code of the blockchain says that you don’t own the ape, because you were <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3v3ny/all-my-apes-gone-nft-theft-victims-beg-for-centralized-saviors">hacked or whatever</a>. The technology is a scaffolding on which to hang a social system, but the social system is what does or does not convey “ownership” in a meaningful sense.</blockquote><p>It’s also likely that as the space develops — web3 and NFTs really only entered the mainstream conversation last year — that new solutions will emerge to address some of those technological gaps. (For instance, your NFT might be stored on Filecoin’s Interplanetary File&nbsp;System.)</p><p>But there will also be cases where some gaps can’t be addressed or more practically, it doesn’t make sense to address them with decentralized solutions.</p><p>As Moxie points out, that’s something the industry and community as a whole will continue to grapple over going forward. There are philosophical merits to decentralization, but in order to deliver a compelling and convenient product to end users, some sort of balance will be struck between the vision of a decentralized world and the efficiency of centralized solutions. (To Moxie’s point, that’s already the case with NFTs and platforms like OpenSea.)</p><p>For Moxie, it’s about expectations:</p><blockquote>This isn’t a complaint about OpenSea or an indictment of what they’ve built. Just the opposite, they’re trying to build something that works. I think we should expect this kind of platform consolidation to happen, and given the inevitability, design systems that give us what we want when that’s how things are organized. My sense and concern, though, is that the web3 community expects some other outcome than what we’re already&nbsp;seeing.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>However, even if this is just the beginning (and it very well might be!), I’m not sure we should consider that any consolation. I think the opposite might be true; it seems like we should take notice that from the very beginning, these technologies immediately tended towards centralization through platforms in order for them to be realized, that this has ~zero negatively felt effect on the velocity of the ecosystem, and that most participants don’t even know or care it’s happening. This might suggest that decentralization itself is not actually of immediate practical or pressing importance to the majority of people downstream, that the only amount of decentralization people want is the minimum amount required for something to exist, and that if not very consciously accounted for, these forces will push us further from rather than closer to the ideal outcome as the days become less&nbsp;early.</blockquote><p>All of which is hardly a radical take. Decentralization in and of itself is no panacea — even if it is a cornerstone for where we’re evolving&nbsp;toward.</p><p>And as web3 continues to grow in prominence and end product, these conversations will only continue and new gaps will be identified.</p><p>One gap that will command increasing focus in 2022 is the question of identity. If technology is a fundamentally social endeavor, we need to know who we’re dealing with, whether from a personal, community, or regulatory perspective.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb </a>— Moxie Marlinspike: <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">My first impressions of&nbsp;web3</a>  Matt Levin e— <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-10/web3-takes-trust-too">Web3 Takes Trust&nbsp;Too</a>  <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-web3-debate">The Web3&nbsp;Debate</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-11/signal-founder-marlinspike-gives-web3-nfts-an-emperor-s-new-clothes-moment">Web3 Just Had Its Emperor’s-New-Clothes Moment</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876891/signal-ceo-steps-down-moxie-marlinspike-encryption-cryptocurrency">Moxie Marlinspike has stepped down as CEO of&nbsp;Signal</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/moxie-marlinspike-is-leaving-signal-heres-where-we-suspect-hes-headed-and-why/">Moxie Marlinspike is leaving Signal — TechCrunch</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/easwee">/easwee</a> — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/01/10/newton-signal-crypto-payments?s=09">Casey Newton on the Danger of Signal Adding Anonymous Payments</a>   2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Here’s FTX’s <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1481381452696723459">Sam Bankman-Fried’s tweetstorm on the subject</a>, referencing <a href="https://medium.com/@danfinlay/what-moxie-missed-on-web3-wallets-8dc572e7f39b">this blog post response from Dan&nbsp;Finlay</a>:</p><blockquote>I think Dan’s ‘right to exit’ is a key piece. Sure, there are centralized apps in crypto — FTX is one! But you have the right to exit: if you don’t like FTX, you can withdraw assets to another exchange, or to your private&nbsp;wallet.</blockquote><blockquote>And, in fact, everything in the crypto universe — or at least almost everything — is plugged into decentralized rails which connect all of the (sometimes centralized) pieces. It’s not perfect, from a decentralization angle. But it still helps a&nbsp;ton.</blockquote><blockquote>And those rails are not just decentralized, they’re also open to competition. Don’t like using blockchain X to transfer assets? Try blockchain Y! Banks have had the same ~2 ways of sending funds for decades, and can’t change that. Crypto exchanges generally have&nbsp;~20.</blockquote><blockquote>And, similarly, if some infrastructure provider sucks — RPC nodes, for instance — people can create a new one. That doesn’t, of course, mean that they *will* — and I think Moxie makes some really compelling points that we probably don’t do enough of that as an industry.</blockquote><blockquote>There is concentration of usage in various places, and some of those places are not really making progress.</blockquote><blockquote>In general, I really encourage people to find pieces of crypto infrastructure that seem shitty, and build competitors to them. That’s how we move&nbsp;forward.</blockquote><blockquote>And Moxie’s other point — that crypto is too profit-motivated right now — seems totally correct to me. Hopefully we can take a longer-term view of the ecosystem.</blockquote><p>Sam’s first point reminds me of something that an old friend told me (who properly introduced me to Bitcoin told me back in 2013): You can build centralized services on a decentralized framework, but that doesn’t hold true the other way&nbsp;around.</p><p>And having that decentralization layer, having that option — whether or not people decide to take it — is powerful in and of&nbsp;itself.</p><p>To Sam’s second point, it’s probably no surprise that a lot of the real work gets done during crypto winters. (After all, that’s when Solana was developed.)</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Dan Finlay: <a href="https://medium.com/@danfinlay/what-moxie-missed-on-web3-wallets-8dc572e7f39b">What Moxie Missed on Web3&nbsp;Wallets</a>   3. The question of atoms v.&nbsp;bits <p>Elsewhere in web3, here’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ddaa6b58-1ed2-40bb-bf71-642e2b9767a9">a compelling take from the FT’s Rana Foroohar</a> (via /rcb) on why we shouldn’t forget about the real world despite the froth around the metaverse:</p><blockquote>As Tim O’Reilly, a technology big thinker and one of the popularisers of the term Web 2.0, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/why-its-too-early-to-get-excited-about-web3/">wrote recently</a>: “The easy money to be made speculating on cryptoassets seems to have distracted developers and investors from the hard work of building useful real-world services.”</blockquote><blockquote>But when we step back from the dust that will eventually settle around Web3, it will be the ubiquitous, industrial changes driven by companies like Tesla that will probably be most impactful. They are transforming old industries and building real world&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><p>It reminds me of something Peter Thiel likes to say, paraphrasing: We’ve done a lot of work in the world of bits, but we need to do more work in the world of&nbsp;atoms.</p><p>(By the way, it’s not necessarily clear that those two things are mutually exclusive. And as Rana points out in her piece — referencing the laying down of fiber to set up the internet revolution — they often go hand in&nbsp;hand.)</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ddaa6b58-1ed2-40bb-bf71-642e2b9767a9">When the Web3 bubble pops, real world assets will&nbsp;survive</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/07/turkish-lira-is-now-more-volatile-than-bitcoin/">Turkish Lira Is Now More Volatile Than&nbsp;Bitcoin</a>  <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/bitcoin-could-hit-100-000-if-investors-treat-it-like-gold-goldman-sachs-says-51641407311">Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 if Investors Treat It Like Gold, Goldman Sachs&nbsp;Says</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/jpmorgan-2022-could-be-year-of-the-blockchain-bridge/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4">JPMorgan: 2022 Could Be ‘Year of the Blockchain Bridge’ — Blockworks</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/markonovak">/markonovak</a> — <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-cities-is-in-social-daos-16377fa06c9f">The future of cities is in social&nbsp;DAOs</a>  <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105462">Virtual Currencies: Additional Information Could Improve Federal Agency Efforts to Counter Human and Drug Trafficking</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/powell-says-private-coins-could-compete-with-fed-digital-dollar">Powell Says Private Coins Could Compete With Fed Digital&nbsp;Dollar</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/11/the-mnuchin-files-new-documents-shed-light-on-trump-era-crypto-policy/">The Mnuchin Files: New Documents Shed Light on Trump-Era Crypto&nbsp;Policy</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/when-the-brands-came-for-crypto-can-a-subculture-survive-the-social-media-managers">When the Brands Came for Crypto: Can a Subculture Survive the Social Media Managers?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uIllSiXVfmI">Investors Buy Up Metaverse Real Estate in Virtual Land Boom |&nbsp;WSJ</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/fidelity-report-crypto-regulation-will-be-required-in-2022/">Fidelity Report: Crypto Regulation Will Be Required in 2022 — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/when-the-crypto-founder-is-real-but-the-name-is-fake">When the Crypto Founder Is Real but the Name Is&nbsp;Fake</a>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-companies-bet-new-mayor-will-make-new-york-digital-asset-hub-2022-01-12/">Analysis: Crypto companies bet new mayor will make New York digital asset&nbsp;hub</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/TravisXRP">/TravisXRP</a> — <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3163094/china-create-own-nft-industry-based-state-backed-blockchain">China to create own NFT industry based on state-backed blockchain network</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-13/arkansas-to-tech-workers-we-ll-pay-you-bitcoin-to-move">Arkansas Tries a New Strategy to Lure Tech Workers: Free&nbsp;Bitcoin</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/irans-central-bank-ministry-of-industry-to-allow-crypto-payments-for-foreign-trade-settlements/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Iran’s Central Bank, Ministry of Industry to Allow Crypto Payments for Foreign Trade Settlements — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://decrypt.co/90443/credit-rating-agency-moodys-sounds-alarm-el-salvadors-bitcoin-policy">Credit Rating Agency Moody’s Sounds Alarm on El Salvador’s Bitcoin Policy — Decrypt</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/cftc-fines-crypto-betting-service-polymarket-1-4-million-orders-shutdown/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">CFTC Fines Crypto Betting Service Polymarket $1.4 Million, Orders Shutdown of Three Markets — Blockworks</a>   4.

Citadel Securities is interested in getting into crypto market making, but is waiting for greater regulatory clarity surrounding digital currencies, especially in the U.S., a company spokesperson told The Information.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Paradigm and Sequoia can also connect Citadel Securities to exchanges and companies that would enable the market maker to build a crypto business. Both VC firms have invested in crypto exchange FTX, for example, as well as in Fireblocks, a startup that offers a platform for market makers to manage crypto&nbsp;trading.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition to potentially securing a powerful new partner for their portfolio companies, Paradigm and Sequoia could also benefit from investing in a company that’s well-positioned to be a major player in crypto trading, in the event that the Securities and Exchange Commission recognizes digital currencies as securities. That move seems likely given SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s recent attitude.</blockquote><blockquote>Even though many crypto advocates don’t consider digital currencies to be securities, Paradigm and Sequoia seem to be betting on that to change with their investment. Citadel Securities already has two decades of experience in trading securities and established relationships with regulators, although it has recently tangled with the SEC. Its deep connections could help it quickly become a crypto market maker in compliance with emerging regulations. Citadel Securities could also let Paradigm, which helped create a digital currency lobbying group, gain better access to regulators.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/paradigm-sequoia-to-invest-115b-in-citadel-securities-bringing-trading-firm-closer-to-crypto/">Paradigm, Sequoia to Invest $1.15B in Citadel Securities</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/business/dealbook/citadel-sequoia-paradigm.html">Ken Griffin’s Trading Powerhouse Gains New&nbsp;Partners</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-ftx-sets-up-2-billion-venture-fund-11642163402">WSJ News Exclusive | Crypto Exchange FTX Sets Up $2 Billion Venture&nbsp;Fund</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/visa-partners-with-consensys-to-develop-cbdc-on-ramp-tool/">Visa Partners With ConsenSys to Develop CBDC On-ramp Tool — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/12/us-banks-form-group-to-offer-usdf-stablecoin/">US Banks Form Group to Offer USDF Stablecoin</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-07/paypal-is-exploring-launch-of-own-stablecoin-in-crypto-push">PayPal Explores Launch of Own Stablecoin in Crypto&nbsp;Push</a>  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/venmo-paypal-zelle-must-report-600-transactions-irs-rcna11260">Venmo, PayPal and Zelle must report $600+ in transactions to&nbsp;IRS</a>   6.

<p>We are thrilled to announce the launch of <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a>, a service for regaining control over your digital identity using KILT Protocol. SocialKYC is a building block for making online services in Web3 better and safer, providing a way to return your credentials to where they belong — with&nbsp;you!</p><p>KYC or “Know Your Customer” is standard practice while opening an account with a bank or exchange, where customers must prove they possess government-issued credentials like a passport. SocialKYC gives the user power to extend trust in a similar way, by building a digital identity using their social accounts.</p><p>SocialKYC and <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a>, the KILT wallet, were built by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (B.T.E.) a subsidiary of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT. Used together, SocialKYC and Sporran allow users to manage and store their personal credentials, and decide which elements of their private information they share with online services.</p><p>SocialKYC issues credentials to users confirming the ownership of their email address or social media accounts after the user proves that they control the account. Unlike sign-in processes on the internet to date, SocialKYC then forgets about the user and the credential as soon as the credential is issued. The credential, the personal information, and the control remain with the&nbsp;user.</p><p>How it&nbsp;works:</p>  SocialKYC first sends the user a simple task to verify their control of a specific account (confirm your email address; Tweet this message to prove this is your account).  After a successful check, SocialKYC issues a credential to the user. The user can save the credential in their Sporran wallet, which is installed locally on their computer. The credential states the ownership of the specific&nbsp;account.  This personal data is not stored or shared by SocialKYC. It remains in the user’s Sporran wallet under their full&nbsp;control.  Using Sporran on their local computer, users can later send their credential to any online service that accepts the credential.  Users can also choose to publish one or more of their credentials, making them accessible to anyone. Published credentials can be unpublished by the user at any&nbsp;time.  <p>Create your identity and get your first KILT credentials now! Here’s how to get&nbsp;started:</p> Get Your&nbsp;Sporran <p>The first step is setting up your Sporran, a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome that serves as a wallet for your KILT credentials and KILT Coins. Download this at<a href="https://www.sporran.org/"> sporran.org,</a> then <a href="https://support.kilt.io/support/solutions/articles/80000959735-how-do-i-create-a-kilt-sporran-identity-">follow our step-by-step guide</a> to set it&nbsp;up.</p> Create Your KILT&nbsp;Identity <p>In KILT, identity starts with a unique decentralized identifier (<a href="https://dev.kilt.io/docs/sdk/core-feature/did">DID</a>), represented by a string of numbers and&nbsp;letters:</p><p>did:kilt:light:014sxSYXakw1ZXBymzT9t3Yw91mUaqKST5bFUEjGEpvkTuckar</p><p>You will get your first DID as part of the Sporran setup. Your digital identity is built by adding different credentials like email, Twitter account, passport, certificates, etc. to this identifier. You may even want to create several digital identities; one personal, one for work, one for&nbsp;gaming.</p> Get Your KILT Credentials <p>Once your Sporran is set up, follow our guide to creating your email credential or Twitter credential via SocialKYC <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SocialKYC_How_To_Create_Identity_19Jan.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>By default, these free credentials are anchored on the KILT blockchain and are linked to a “light” DID that lives on the computer it was created&nbsp;on.</p><p>Credentials for platforms such as Discord, GitHub, and others are coming soon, which will support use cases like gaming, e-sports leagues, health care, academia, media, and decentralized social networks. We’ll announce SocialKYC partner integrations as they happen, so keep an eye on our <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> account and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a>.</p> Upgrading to a Full&nbsp;DID <p>The Sporran also provides the option to upgrade to a “full” on-chain DID. This allows you to create a service endpoint such as a url, providing a way to make your credentials public and making it easier for online services to access&nbsp;them.</p><p>Upgrading to a full DID requires a transaction fee payable in KILT (currently less than 0.01 KILT) and a deposit of 2 KILT. The deposit is designed to incentivize users to clear the data from the blockchain once it is not needed any longer, reducing wasted storage space. If you choose to delete a DID at a later date, this deposit is returned.</p><p>This could also be of use, for example, for companies who want to share their product credentials, etc. The full DID also allows the owner to set additional keys for different purposes beyond authentication, including attestation and delegation. This would allow the owner to issue their own credentials and create delegation hierarchies — useful in a company where several employees would be involved in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>On-chain DIDs will also be useful for individuals who want to publish their credentials, use key rotation for extra security, and anchor their DID anchored on the blockchain.</p><p>See how to upgrade&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SocialKYC_How_To_Create_On-Chain_DIDs_19Jan.pdf">here</a>.</p> Start Building! <p>We’ve created the infrastructure.

Community Growth   This week, DuMont, an outstanding Harbinger from our English community, published《<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/staking-vs-candidate-node-ownership-9191bfbd5661">Staking vs Candidate Node Ownership</a>》, which introduced the Ontology staking strategy for the community members in detail. The article answered questions relating to ”How to participate in Ontology staking”, “How to launch a candidate node?”, and more. Community members all said that they have benefited a&nbsp;lot.  This week, Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to join the AMA held by <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1481824177879273477?s=20">BingX</a>. He shared Ontology’s long-term efforts and future goals, with a focus on DID and data. He explained how users will be on-boarded into the Ontology experience for secure, self-sovereign control over their digital existence. Humpty also interpreted Ontology 2022 Roadmap: From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not&nbsp;changed.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1481710138624929795?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1483363542262640645?s=20">Telegram Community Call</a>, with the theme “Staking”. For those who are new to Staking, they rely more on APY when choosing a node, while Ontology Harbinger Polaris and SG Node believe that it is necessary to pay more attention to the revenue distribution ratio of each node. It is necessary to check the comparison before the start of each Consensus Round, which can reduce problems such as staking reward&nbsp;losses.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He talked with community members about DID, including its function, meaning, and the changes it brings to Web3. The Ontology community believes that DID will be an indispensable foundation in Web3; by comprehensively deploying DID, Web3 will realize the protection of identity and privacy, and truly return data ownership to&nbsp;users.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was invited to participate in an exclusive interview hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoCoinShow/status/1482817191619829762?s=20">Crypto Coin Show</a>, and shared the latest progress of Ontology EVM. He said that Virtual Machines (VMs) play a crucial role in both the aforementioned need for interoperability and in the expansion of applications built on Ontology. The Ontology EVM will be launched in Q1 2022, and aims to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform and to offer an inclusive experience to developers and&nbsp;users.  Moonstake published a series of articles to introduce their strategic partners. In the article 《<a href="https://moonstake.io/what-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-in-2022/">What You Need to Know about Ontology in 2022</a>》, Moonstake elaborated on Ontology’s plans and goals for 2022, stating that they are proud to be strategic partners of Ontology. They will continue to maintain strong support for the ever-growing and developing Ontology ecosystem in 2022, building Web3 infrastructure with Ontology together.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Finextra — 《<a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/21543/five-digital-identity-trends-to-watch-in-2022">Five Digital Identity Trends to Watch in&nbsp;2022</a>》</p><p>“In 2020, the world went online and fraudsters were quick to pounce on the opportunities as businesses rapidly digitised their operations. The wave of opportunistic fraudsters drove the rate of identity document (ID) fraud up by 41% in 2020. Given the rise in sophisticated identity fraud over the past 12 months and the staggering<a href="https://aite-novarica.com/report/us-identity-theft-stark-reality"> losses of $712 billion</a> as a result, it is critical that organisations understand the most common trends and take the necessary steps to protect themselves. ”</p><p>With the continuous development of decentralized technology, decentralized identity is getting more and more attention. Whether it is traditional Internet giants or blockchain start-ups, they are building their own decentralized identity solutions based on blockchain technology, and are committed to building a new generation of Internet with more security and privacy. Ontology has worked on bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through providing decentralized identity (DID) and data solutions.

<p>Many industries are seeing a significant increase in the use of digital services. Of course, this has been ongoing for some time, but the COVID-19 pandemic has expedited it.   &nbsp;</p>



 With more digital services comes an increased risk of fraudulent activity 



<p>As customer onboarding and verification become automated, there are new challenges with which we must deal. Regulation has been devised to address such matters through the control and use of technical solutions and the checks and processes which currently exist. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow has developed solutions that offer state-of-the-art video-based and biometric onboarding. These have been designed to meet regulations in Europe and the Middle East. They continue to do so as regulations expand and tighten, particularly as our industry evolves and becomes more engrained as a standard part of the AML / KYC process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The UAE is one of the furthest ahead countries in the Middle East. It has technology, AML, and electronic signature regulation in place. The country has also adopted full use of national identities. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">IDnow’s AutoIdent</a> product is ready to meet UAE regulations and help financial institutions realize the security and user experience benefits of automated verification.  (See also our article: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uae-accelerates-automated-identity-verification/">UAE accelerates use for automated identity verification</a>)</p>



 Growth of identity verification and regulation &nbsp; 



<p>Video and automated onboarding has increased in recent years, along with controlling regulations. Of course, there is a need to ensure secure processes, both in identity matching and in the wider area of safeguarding against fraud and money-laundering activity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Europe and the UK have been leading developers of identity regulation. The first AML laws (the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives</a>) were released in 1991, following Financial Action Task Force  (FATF) guidance. Germany – traditionally a highly regulated market – later moved to allow video-based identity verification. Many other countries have since done the same. Being more deregulated in this area, the UK is one of the most supportive.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>This use and approval of video-based verification have quickly expanded to further automated and biometric verification. Many EU countries now permit some form of electronic identification / verification, and the trend is well set for expansion. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s verification solutions have been developed alongside this growth. They aim to fully support new and evolving technology while also meeting the latest regulations. Many of such regulations throughout the Eurozone, have been promulgated with the input of IDnow and our relationships with national and international contacts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>VideoIdent was launched in 2014, largely to meet German regulators’ requirements for video-based identity verification. As regulations and technology evolved, AutoIdent was launched as a single solution offering greater user experience, faster conversion rates, and added security against fraud. </p>



<p>AutoIdent takes VideoIdent further and offers fully-automated biometric identity verification with video or agent fallback. As a fully automated or hybrid solution, Autoident encompasses current and the most recent developments in digital identity verification. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/id-verification-autoident-meeting-eu-regulations/">ID Verification with AutoIdent – meeting European Regulations</a></p>



<p>The regulatory trend to allow biometric solutions that rely on automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to onboard customers is evolving across Europe, Asia, and now the Middle East. &nbsp;</p>



 UAE regulations &nbsp; 



<p>For technical regulation, the UAE follows joint guidelines issued by The UAE Central Bank, Securities and Commodities Authority, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). They have jointly issued “<a href="https://www.centralbank.ae/sites/default/files/2021-11/Guidelines%20for%20Financial%20Institutions%20adopting%20Enabling%20Technologies%2020211107.pdf">Guidelines for Financial Institutions Adopting Enabling Technologies.</a>“   &nbsp;</p>



<p>These regulations apply to all financial institutions that are licensed and supervised under UAE law. In terms of identity verification, these are advanced and far-reaching regulations – going further than many European countries as of early 2022. They permit video onboarding as well as fully automated biometric solutions. The use of NFC technology for reading national identity cards is also permitted. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to these technical regulations, anti-money laundering laws cover monitoring and screening requirements. The primary law in the UAE is ”Federal Decree-Law No. (20) of 2018 On Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism and Financing of Illegal Organisations.” These AML regulations have been designed to follow international FATF guidance, much like the European AMLD regulations.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of electronic signatures is regulated under two separate laws. Federal Law No. 1 of 2006 (eCommerce Law) applies countrywide in the UAE, while Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has introduced separate legislation under the DIFC Electronic Transactions Law of 2017. These are more open than EU laws, however, and they do not define specific <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature</a> standards. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as AutoIdent meets European regulations and is used with several financial institutions, it also complies with UAE regulations. The following are some of the main areas to consider. &nbsp;</p>



 Use of AutoIdent to meet UAE regulations for automated identity verification &nbsp; 



<p>UAE regulations permit the use of automated and biometric identity verification. Under the UAE joint regulations, an automated solution should carry out the following steps: &nbsp;</p>



  ID Proofing Check (to check the identity document is valid and genuine) &nbsp;  Similarity Check (to match the person and the identity document) &nbsp;  Liveness Check (to ensure the person is physically present) &nbsp;  



<p>IDnow’s AutoIdent solution is designed to support these steps. Full automated identity verification is also supported by manual verification as a backup. If the AI is unsure of a case (or country regulations require a hybrid approach), <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">manual video-based verification</a> is available to ensure the completion of the process.  &nbsp;</p>



 







 Supporting NFC technology &nbsp; 



<p>The UAE is a leader in the region with its Emirates ID national identity card. This is compulsory for citizens and uses NFC technology. &nbsp;</p>



<p>AutoIdent has the functionality to read biometric data from NFC chips, developed to meet ICAO 9303 standard. NFC is currently used to read German identity cards but can work with any chips using global standards – such as the Emirates ID.  &nbsp;</p>



 Meeting AML regulations &nbsp; 



<p>AutoIdent has been developed for compliance alongside EU AMLD regulations, and it fully meets the requirements of the latest 4AMLD, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5AMLD</a>, and 6AMLD updates.  These regulations have evolved to respond to criminal behaviour changes and increasing sophistication of methods used.  </p>



<p>UAE AML regulations, despite being first released later than EU regulations, incorporate many of the main advances seen in AMLD. This includes key areas such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Political Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> and checking sanction lists.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Under AML regulations (AML-CFT Decision 4.2(b), 7.2, 15, 22, 25), enhanced due diligence must be carried out for PEPs and customers associated with high-risk countries. AutoIdent offers this functionality through add-on modules to the single platform. It handles fully compliant <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML Screening &amp; Monitoring</a>. This includes checking Politically Exposed Person (PEP) and Sanction Lists. &nbsp;</p>



 Use of Qualified Electronic Signatures &nbsp; 



<p>The use of QES is relatively new in the UAE but is permitted in many areas. Crucially, the UAE’s laws allow the use of electronic signatures and state that a contract may not be deemed invalid or unenforceable solely because it is in electronic format. However, acceptance and legal basis are more open than under European regulations.   &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/electronic-signature/">Electronic Signatures</a> can only be used in some areas. Traditional paper signatures are currently still required for transactions involving immoveable property, negotiable instruments, civil documents, and other processes that require a notary public.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>AutoIdent fully supports eIDAS regulations for the use of Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES). Neither the UAE E-Commerce Law nor the DIFC law prescribes specific technical criteria for acceptable signatures, and as such, QES would not be automatically deemed acceptable. Working to the highest QES standards with a reputable provider is the best way forward, though. With limited use to date, the area is somewhat untested. &nbsp;</p>



 Webinar: The evolution of ID Verification 



 



 <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/"></a> 
<p></p>
  



 Moving to more automation in the future &nbsp; 



<p>Many countries are rapidly moving towards greater use of automated identity verification and electronic signatures. In Europe, Germany, Austria, Spain, and the UK all permit this process, and more are moving this way. The UAE is a leader in the Middle East, but other countries will likely follow. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, in August 2021, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank reported that it had successfully implemented automated customer onboarding. This uses facial recognition techniques combined with reading NFC data from a customer’s Emirates ID card and passport.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow firmly believes that the industry is moving to document and biometric-centered identity verification – in the Middle East and elsewhere. There is growing evidence that automatic techniques are more secure than manual ones in many areas (especially facial recognition). The FATF now supports this, and many more regulators are likely to follow its guidance.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>For a more in-depth look at AutoIdent, how it has evolved, and how it offers a well-thought-out balance between security and user experience, take a look at IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/">recent webinar</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Johannes Meerloo is a co-founder of identity Trust Management AG, which was acquired by IDnow in 2021. He has spent the last eleven years as Managing Director, Board Member and Chief Operating Officer (COO) there, overseeing the company’s entry into international markets following a comprehensive rebranding. Prior to that, he was a member of the management board of ID 8 GmbH, the predecessor of identity Trust Management AG. He thus has more than 15 years of experience in the identity management sector.</p>
<p>IDnow acquired identity.TM as well as the French market leader ARIADNEXT last year. One of Johannes Meerloo’s first tasks will be to merge the operational areas as a result of these M&amp;A activities. In combination, IDnow will be able to offer customers of the combined companies an optimized service from a single source and across a broad product portfolio, setting new standards in the European market.</p>
<p>“I look forward to continuing to work with Johannes Meerloo in his new role. We have known each other for a long time and I greatly appreciate his extensive and long-standing experience in the identity sector. The restructuring and optimization of our operations area will require exactly this experience and I am glad that we could win Johannes for this task,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>

				  Indicio will upgrade Hyperledger Indy to support “did:indy” DID Method Specification, which will enable greater interoperability across Indy-based networks  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Indicio has won the&nbsp; <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace/opportunities/code-with-us/e3dd1605-cc1d-4c30-a9ee-245940bccd0d">BC Gov “Code With Us” Challenge</a> to develop the did:indy DID Method for the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> project, the open source project housed at the Hyperledger Foundation that provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledger. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge has two goals. The first is to expand the types of content that can be written to DIDDocs, documents that instruct users on which ledger they need to find and read so that they can use verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Second, the new method will align Hyperledger Indy with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifier (DID) Specification</a>. Most of Hyperledger Indy’s development occurred prior to the completion of the standard DID Specification by the W3C and, as a result, identifiers written to one network are currently not resolvable on other networks. A new did:indy DID Method will fix that and make it easier for decentralized identity products and services to interoperate across different Indy networks.</p>
<p>“Given the increasing use of Indy Networks, we are grateful to this &lt;/&gt; Code With Us challenge and to BCGov for sponsoring this important contribution,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “As a company, we are committed to open-source development, and we applaud BCGov for its leadership in sponsoring critical development needs that will make interoperability easier and lead to increased adoption. We’re excited to work with BCGov on this—and it means a lot given that several of Indicio’s developers have been contributing to the Hyperledger Indy project since its inception.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;Winning the challenge comes as Indico is about to kick off a series of&nbsp; <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2021/11/22/hyperledger-foundation-community-training-accelerate-your-decentralized-identity-skills-with-two-free-hyperledger-indy-and-hyperledger-aries-workshops">Hyperledger Community Training Workshops</a> in using the Hyperledger Aries codebases to design and develop decentralized identity solutions. Indicio has made training on all aspects of decentralized identity a key part of its mission and product offerings. Places on the free Hyperledger workshops filled rapidly, so keep an <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">eye out</a> for future events.</p>
<p>To learn more about decentralized identity training, or how to start developing decentralized identity products on the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">Indicio TestNet</a>, or how to use our products, services, and hosting to create trusted data ecosystems, please <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us</a>. </p>

<p>We have had to delay the Listing Announcement on SushiSwap due to a breach in our Eth. token contracts. The details of the contract breach have been mentioned below.</p><p>Bridging contract for Poly &lt;&gt; Eth. worked with a lock/unlock, burn/mint functionality.</p>  If the user wants to bridge their tokens from the Ethereum chain to the Polygon chain, they will have to call the [deposit()](&lt;https://github.com/getsafle/bridging-contract/blob/main/contracts/FxBaseRootTunnel.sol#L77&gt;) function in the<a href="https://github.com/getsafle/bridging-contract/blob/main/contracts/FxBaseRootTunnel.sol"> FxBaseRootTunnel contract</a>.  The deposit() function will call the [burn()](&lt;https://github.com/getsafle/bridging-contract/blob/main/contracts/eth%20token/Safle.sol#L34&gt;) function from the<a href="https://github.com/getsafle/bridging-contract/blob/main/contracts/eth%20token/Safle.sol"> Ethereum token contract</a>.  The burn(address, amount) should accept the address from where the tokens are to be burnt and the amount of tokens to be&nbsp;burnt.  The burn(address, amount) function should have a condition check to allow only the FxBaseRootTunnel contract to call that function and that check that was not&nbsp;present.  <p>On Monday January 17, 2022 we deployed test liquidity on SushiSwap Liquidity Pool.

<p>I have always given a damn about digital identity.</p>



<p>Hi. <a href="https://wider.team/team/#wolff">I’m Phil Wolff</a>. And this is a personal note to start my year. </p>



<p>I love that digital identity tries to answer deep philosophical questions. What does it mean to be human? How do we trust ourselves and each other? What is the reality we agree on? What is personal integrity? What helps civilization and a civil society endure? What is fairness and justice?</p>



<p>I love that it’s more than a technical discussion. It’s laws. Sociology. Politics and civics. Commerce. Psychology. Ethics. History. Economy. All the humanities.</p>



<p>Identity touches everything. It always will. Computation and communication continue their pervasion, and identity spreads with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity ships. I like that a few standards folks have the power to turn grand ideas into covenants into engineering protocols. To settle things for everyone for a while. To versioning something pragmatic that others can build from and evolve.</p>



<p>Shaping identity is a human endeavor. I like the geeky and artistic communities that emerge for a while around problems and opportunities. We show the best of ourselves. Comradery while tackling authenticity and the unidentified. Courage taking on concentrations of power. Conviction while building safety and security for all. Grit for persevering through long slogs to make stuff work. </p>



<p>So I’m passionate for digital identity’s formative process, its purpose, and its impact on our world.</p>



<p>That’s why I organized online for data portability as a human right (<a href="http://dataportability.org/index.html">DataPortability Project</a>). Why I literally marched on Oakland City Hall for privacy and joined police in working out a surveillance policy (<a href="https://localwiki.org/oakland/Domain_Awareness_Center">Oakland Privacy</a>). Why I promoted open data and open source in civic projects at more than 150 civic hack nights (<a href="http://OpenOakland.org">OpenOakland</a>). Why I fostered identity-centric startups (<a href="http://pde.cc/">PDEC</a>). Why I consult on identity as transformational strategy here with <a href="https://wider.team/">Wider Team</a>.</p>



<p>Since 2021, I’ve worked with standards bodies on digital identity in clinical IoT, trust governance, decentralization and fiduciaries, and biometrics. I hope to continue these efforts along with the growing cadre who focus on the intersection of technology, society, and enterprise. </p>



<p>Have a healthy and impactful 2022, y’all. </p>

<p>Picture above: SSI workshop at Decentralized Web Summit 2018, San Francisco Mint, (left to right) Kim Duffy, Christopher Allen, Jonathan Holt, Daniel Buchner, Christian Lundquist, Markus Sabadello, Eugeniu Rusu, Rouven Heck.</p>



<p>At this point, we know what self-sovereign identity (SSI) is, but where does it come from? A short timeline highlights just how quickly SSI has developed. It underlines the path and development of the evolution of Internet Identity. From a centralized to a federated to a user-centric identity, the self-sovereign identity is seen as the most recent and urgently needed step in this evolution. It is independent from any individual silo, and provides three essential elements: individual control, security, and full portability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The source goes back to the 1990s&nbsp;  



<p>Christopher Allan estimates the birth of SSI in the early 90s (cf. Allan 2016). In 1991, PGP mentions a first hint towards what could become a self-sovereign identity when introducing a ‘Web of Trust’. This was an example of a decentralized trust management, but focusing only on email addresses. Therefore, PGP can be seen as one of the first to highlight a different way, in which identity can be supported by peers instead of centralized authorities. As another early thought, Allan recognizes a paper by Carl Ellison that examined how digital identity was created, published in 1996 (‘Establishing Identity without Certification Authority’). Ellison’s main argument highlighted that there was a need for a method of establishing identity without using certificates from trusted certification authorities (Ellison 1996).&nbsp;</p>



<p>These early approaches could mark the beginning, but it is safe to say that SSI really took off in the 21st century, along with the development and further spread of the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, things have changed of course. Essentially, Sovereign is really about the individual being able to control what happens to stuff others (trusted parties) say about them. The community as a whole does not rely on web of trust infrastructure anymore for SSI, but rather connects the SSI technology with the existing trusted certification authorities (ie. the state).&nbsp;</p>



 Taking off: SSI in the 21st century&nbsp; 



<p>In 2000, the Augmented Social Network provided the groundwork for a new digital identity. Their most significant advance was ‘the assumption that every individual ought to have the right to control his or her own online identity’ (Jordan 2003).&nbsp;</p>



<p>One major contribution, paving the way for the SSI development, is the Internet Identity Workshop, which started back in 2001 and introduced on a new term: user-centric identity. It is interesting to notice that the term of self-sovereign identity itself only came into increased use in the late 2010s. At Jolocom, we used the term ‘autonomous identity’ before SSI picked up.&nbsp; One of the first references is Devon Loffreto’s blog post back in 2012, where he wrote about ‘Sovereign Source Authority’ (Loffreto 2012).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five years later, Phil Windley described self-sovereign identity as an ‘Internet for identity’ (Windley 2012). He highlights three major virtues of such: no one owns it, everyone can use it, and anyone can improve it. Ever since, SSI has grown into an ecosystem aiming to put users in control over their own personal information and data. Identity management can be expected to become increasingly significant due to the rise in digital interactions. Already, self-sovereign identity is becoming a large industry.&nbsp;</p>



 The late 2010s&nbsp; 



<p>A year to remember is 2018. Back then, the emerging SSI community agreed on a high level definition of the term SSI in the Identity Position Paper by Bundesblock for the first time. INATBA’s position paper ‘What’s at stake’ in 2020 built on exactly this foundation and furthermore highlighted possible development scenarios for SSI. These efforts helped to make SSI a priority in the digitalization process within Germany and the EU. In Germany specifically, the SDI (secure digital identities) projects are a significant effort to start an SSI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a European level, developments towards an SSI friendly legal framework were proposed by the European Commission in June 2020. The initial examples of successful SSI pilots and projects across EU member states and the international momentum on the topic have found their way into the proposal for an updated eIDAS (electronic Identification, Authentiction and trust Services) regulation. This proposal It is currently being debated by the European Council and the European Parliament&nbsp; and foresees a introduction of European Digital Identity Wallets for all European citizens. The proposed regulation is taking inspiration from self-sovereing identity principles and is a great chance for Europe. It’s main potetnial lies in the provision of a legally binding Trust Framwork, as well as associated Technical Specifications for a coherent technical infrastructure. As a result, if the European Commission has its way, all public services should be available online by 2030 and 80 percent of EU citizens should use an eID solution. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been contributing to this process on a German, European and Global level in different capacities of the past years as Jolocom and will do our best to ensure that our vision for an open- and decentralized infrastructure will be achieved.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

			 What does our new strategic partnership with Inveniam mean for issuers? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>We are off to a great start this year as&nbsp;we teamed up with Inveniam to&nbsp;unlock asset liquidity via tokenization.&nbsp;The partnership comes alongside a €5m investment from Inveniam, Apex Group, and K20 Fund.</p>
 Assets tokenized and priced&nbsp; 
<p>The most exciting part about this partnership is that <a href="https://inveniam.io/inveniamio/">Inveniam’s data solution</a> complements the T-REX ecosystem by providing tokenized assets with a valuation reference, which will fully unlock private market asset liquidity.</p>
 Covering the entire value chain of tokenization 
<p>As a result of this collaboration, securities tokenized through <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643/">the ERC-3643 standard and the T-REX suite</a> will be enriched with timestamped valuation data linked to their underlying assets. The result? High functioning securities that will unlock liquidity:</p>
 
 Issuance: We provide the enterprise-grade white-label tokenization platform – <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> – to help asset managers compliantly bring assets to blockchain. 
 Asset management:&nbsp;Tokenized assets and investors are managed via our T-REX platform. In addition, tokens are enriched by real-time data regarding asset valuation delivered by Inveniam. 
 Secondary trading:&nbsp;Peer-to-peer transfers are available through our compliance framework. With trusted pricing references provided by Inveniam, investors can then make fair deals with confidence. 
 
  
 Accelerating the tokenization adoption&nbsp; 
<p>By addressing the&nbsp;two biggest issues in private markets, which are pricing discovery and compliance, we are now making private market assets more accessible and liquid together with our partner Inveniam.</p>
<p>Additional value to the market will accrue as the partnership will ultimately enable Apex Group, Inveniam’s fund administration partner, to deliver end-to-end cutting-edge services to a broad ecosystem of private asset owners.

SWN Global &amp; MetaMUI x Blockchain Research Institute<p>We are excited to announce that SWN Global and MetaMUI became a Pioneer member of the Blockchain Research Institute(BRI).</p><p>BRI is a globally well known and most active blockchain think tank to be the catalysts of the blockchain transformation. BRI has more than 100 research projects underway to explore, understand, document and inform leaders about blockchain strategies, market opportunities and implementation challenges. All the research and programs done by BRI are funded by BRI members, including enterprise organizations, governments, universities, colleges and blockchain startups from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Here is a greeting from Don Tapscott, Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute.<br>“Digital identity and central bank digital currencies are two emerging technologies that will bring about profound changes to businesses, governments, and societies around the world. At the Blockchain Research Institute, we are pleased to collaborate with companies like Sovereign Wallet Network and MetaMUI, who are paving the way for digital transformation using these technologies,”</p><p>We are proud to be one of the members of the BRI and we are excited to do a joint research with the BRI and keep strong connection each other to build a new era of digital currency.</p><p>BRI announcement link: <br><a href="https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/blog/2022/01/17/swn-metamui/">https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/blog/2022/01/17/swn-metamui/</a></p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology.
