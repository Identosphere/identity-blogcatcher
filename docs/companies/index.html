<p>Mathieu: Okay, we’re on. Hi Jim, how’s it going?</p>
<p>Jim: I’m well, sir. How are you today?</p>
<p>Mathieu: Doing well, thanks. Before getting into all of the cool stuff that you’re doing at Lumedic and the different communities that you’re working in, I’d like to start this conversation by taking a step back to understand how you got into healthcare. It doesn’t seem as if you got into it just yesterday, so would you mind giving some background of how you got into the healthcare space?</p>
<p>Jim: Sure, absolutely. I want to be clear that I characterize my healthcare involvement as around health IT. I don’t have the privilege of being in healthcare like many frontline workers and doctors and nurses but have come into it as a technologist, going back about 12 years ago.</p>
<p>I’ve been in technology and the public sector for a little over 20 years. During my time in the public sector and public sector consulting in Washington DC, I got more involved with federal agencies in healthcare, in federal health IT, and in data efforts. I used that opportunity to work for <a href="https://www.himss.org/">HIMSS, the Health Information and Management System Society</a>. HIMSS is the world’s largest cause-based non-profit, specifically focused on healthcare technology and the use of technology for patient empowerment and patient engagement. I spent a year and a half with them as the senior director for interoperability and standards.</p>
<p>I left that job to go back into public sector consulting, supporting the State of Vermont with implementing systems as part of the Affordable Care Act. Then, I moved into another small company supporting a large enterprise software development initiative with the Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA). Following that, I worked for another small company in Maryland with a focus on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of US HHS (Health and Human Services). I stayed involved with HL7 and several other standards groups and consortia. I began working with <a href="https://www.lumedic.io/">Lumedic</a> in January of this year, specifically focused on digital identity standards, especially in self-sovereign identity, and also continuing to work in HL7. Lumedic is part of Providence Health Systems, and we play a very active role in several HL7 initiatives for health IT and data exchange. It’s very complementary to the work we’re doing with groups like <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>Mathieu: For those who aren’t familiar with HL7, like me, what is it?</p>
<p>Jim: Sure. HL7 is an international body; HL stands for Health Level Seven. I apologize for not remembering exactly when they got started, but they’ve been around for several decades. They have various international working groups and focus areas that are using standard schemas (very similar to W3C and others) to develop health data standards for interoperable health data in healthcare systems.</p>
<p><a></a></p>
<p>Mathieu: There are other organizations as well; FHIR, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Healthcare_Interoperability_Resources">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource</a>, is another one that you’re a part of. Or, at least, when you were part of HIMSS, was that a part of that too?</p>
<p>Jim: Oh. I’m glad you mentioned that. FHIR fast health information resources is, in fact, the latest JSON-based iteration of technology that HL7 has developed over the last six or seven years. The development of health standards has been iterative. Going back to the data standards and the way data was organized and used in the client-server environment; all of that has changed with web services, and with APIs, and cloud services and the internet, etcetera. Health data standards have changed as well. FHIR fast health information resources is the latest iteration for being able to capture health data from electronic health care records and make it available through web services.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Got it; thanks for the breakdown. There’s a newer act a little more recently, but I’ll just take a step back before getting to it. There was a nice representation that Michael Nash from your team put together, showing the progress of healthcare. As it started in its pre-digital era, you started to get different standards and legislation like HIPAA. Then, you started to get more digital standards and high-tech standards as the paper era moved into the digital era. Closer to today, with the 21st Century Cures Act coming into place, moving from the digital era towards more the patient era. How have you viewed that whole evolution in healthcare, and how has the 21st Century Cures Act aligned with what you guys are doing or what you’re thinking?</p>
<p>Jim: Mike Nash, our CEO, has espoused this vision, which I think is outstanding; about the healthcare in the US coming into the patient era, and how Lumedic is part of the patient era now. To walk through that evolution that you articulated; like so many other industries, we moved from paper to digital over the course of the last couple of decades.</p>
<p>Healthcare records had historically been big, thick binders of paper and faxes and notes, which would still persist today. There was a change in regulatory focus to take into account the fact that healthcare records have been more and more transitioning into the world of digital and digital records — electronic healthcare records systems. That prompted a law in 1996, called the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). HIPAA was ground-breaking in its obviousness in saying that number one, your healthcare data should be able to go wherever you want it to go; and number two, healthcare systems were responsible for how they manage, safeguard, and distribute electronic health information, which we called EHI or PHI (protected health information). Everyone appreciates the fact that the law helped to clarify and articulate that data should be available to you, wherever you need it to be, that it could be transferable, and most importantly, there are protections behind it.</p>
<p>However, it still had an organizational ‘silo’ feel to it, and that traditional client-server view. Since that time in 1996, more and more things are available through the internet, mobile apps, and electronic systems. Then, you have various middleware and patient engagement experience platforms, and use of third-party apps, and health and fitness apps. If anything, I think the term I use now is the ‘ubiquitousness’ of healthcare data; your healthcare data should be ubiquitous, in terms of your ability to get it and to combine it with other information that you’re collecting. It should be ubiquitous in its presentation and ability to be used at different places. That’s where we’re getting to with the patient era. That is: you, as the patient, have the technology, and we have the architectures to empower you to be able to collect your data and use it as you see fit. That is quite a cultural change.</p>
<p>Your ability to get access to that data, and be able to use that data as you see fit, has oftentimes been questionable just because of healthcare silos. But, we’re now at a point where the architecture and the technology no longer restrict that sort of silo of data, and you should be able to take advantage of it and use apps to do so. That is a thematic undercurrent to everything that we do with Lumedic, but in particular around the Lumedic Connect identity platform.</p>
<p>Mathieu: HIPAA provides guidance for health information exchange between organizations, which is still valid with the 21st Century Cures Act. It’s a component that fits within that act; the act makes it increasingly possible for more patient-driven, or patient-owned models, is that correct?</p>
<p>Jim: That’s a great point. The 21st Century Cures Act, as suggested when it passed in the 21st Century, goes into effect in 2021. In many ways, it layers on top of HIPAA, and I think you bring up a good point that’s worth clarifying. HIPAA was passed in 1996. In 2010 you had HITECH, the Health Information Technology for economy and community health. HITECH added another layer to HIPAA in terms of recognizing health information and promoting the use of electronic health care records. Now, you have the 21st Century Cures Act; there are many good summaries out there that your listeners can find for the 21st Century Cures Act. The most important aspect is how it takes such a broader message and regulatory guideline around the availability of health information; something called patient access APIs. This offers subsequent modification to things like the HIPAA privacy rule and others, that help to bolster the underlying message that patients should access their own information.</p>
<p>Mathieu: So, if we look at a Patient-Centric ID or the patient era moving forward; why is that the solution to fix the problems? I’m assuming there’s a lot of problems that are related; you’ve described a few of them, such as the siloed view of data and the lack of interoperability and stuff like that. What are the major benefits of Patient ID that you guys are excited about?</p>
<p>Jim: I’d say that there are a couple of things; on its surface, one can be excited about the principles of privacy-preserving architectures, and building in the concepts of self-sovereign identity. You know, the things that you and I, and other folks in the identity standards world are excited about: to allow people to control their own information, and help control how their information is shared. Even more than that, if the information is controlled by the individual and by the patients, they’re now empowered to control where that information goes.</p>
<p>I often use an analogy that culturally, healthcare in some ways is still like going to see the tribal shaman 10 000 years ago: I show up at a healthcare environment; some doctor says that there’s some issue. Maybe I understand it, or maybe I don’t, which is a patient health literacy issue. Maybe I have access to the data, or maybe he or she magically presents a lab result and says, “Hey, this is the issue, and now you have to go and do this, this, and this.” These are three other things that you’re being told to do, that change when you now have the individual able to manage how their data is collected and how their data is disseminated — how they do things in the healthcare environment with a healthcare organization. I think it now allows them to be empowered to make decisions about, “Well, I’m not only going to see this doctor here, but I’m also going to see this other doctor. When I do see this doctor, these are the things that I think they need to know about me, but I shouldn’t have to consent to share my entire life history with them if I don’t feel it’s relevant. If I’m going to a back specialist, for example, do they need to know something about substance abuse, that may or may not have anything to do with that.</p>
<p>How do I, as a patient, get more involved with how my health information moves around, in a way that I’ve never been involved in before, whether it was paper or digital.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s another interesting aspect to that; you definitely have the privacy-preserving aspects to the whole story here, but I think we’re seeing in health care and health technology that we’re getting more and more opportunities to use different methods for health data inputs. Whether it’s wearables, whether it’s going for different specialized treatments or scans or activities like that; being at the center and having control of that, and being able to amalgamate all of that information for yourself at the center. That all goes along with the whole big data story, where there are tons of opportunities to use more and more data in healthcare today. It’s probably another benefit of having this patient-centric identity management model.</p>
<p>Jim: That’s a wonderful analogy, and I’d add to it as well. I’m sure you’ve read quite a bit about the use of AI in healthcare, and AI services and chatbots, and that sort of thing. The more that you have the ability to collect your own information, and use that in support of tools such as an AI-driven application, for instance, then the more things can be customized to you or built on what we call evidence-based medicine (EBM) as a framework for decision making.</p>
<p>There’s a proliferation of health apps and advancements in technologies that allow you to monitor your own heart rate at home, and that assist you with medication adherence and how you take medication—gathering that information in your own app, having that information available to you as part of your own data, as part of clinical decision making, and deciding where your data is really where the 21st Century is going. As we discussed, the 21st Century Cures Act is your ability to get that information, to work with information from mobile apps and health applications, and then decide how that information is shared and controlled. The consent belongs to you.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Got it. We’ve been hearing more about the work you’re doing through different communities like the Trust over IP. Lumedic is an organization that was existing before, but was purchased by Providence Health Systems a few years ago. Would you mind making a distinction between those two organizations, and what both of them are up to?</p>
<p>Jim: Absolutely. Providence Health Systems is the ninth-largest healthcare system in the USA, and they are a not-for-profit Catholic hospital system located in Seattle. They support seven states under that banner. As part of Providence Health Systems, they have a for-profit portfolio of companies called Tegria. One of the companies under the Tegria portfolio is Lumedic. As you mentioned, Lumedic was acquired independently a couple of years ago, to be added to that portfolio to support new tech startups and health innovations within that portfolio, under the umbrella of a large major health care system. To add on top of that, Providence has its own digital innovation group, and they coordinate with a venture fund. It gives them a broad base of involvement for identifying healthcare technology solutions that obviously advance their mission for care delivery in the states that they support.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Within Lumedic, do you have the opportunity to leverage the ecosystem of different companies or different resources that Providence has assembled, or that Tegria has under their portfolio?</p>
<p>Jim: That’s a great point, and one I’m not afraid to advertise. As you know, there are lots and lots of health tech companies out there. Very few of them have the opportunity to daily participate in and interact directly with a health care system, beyond a traditional customer-vendor relationship; not only that, but a health care system of the size and scope of Providence. I consider myself to be very fortunate that I get to work alongside senior Providence healthcare professionals and leaders as part of what we’re doing in advancing the field. Specifically, we’ve created the Lumedic Exchange, which is a voluntary organization of stakeholders from other healthcare organizations, but including Providence. The Exchange focus is on developing use cases and workflows around this <a href="https://northernblock.io/verifiable-credentials/">concept of verifiable credentials</a>. That gives us the opportunity to tap into not only folks who are technically part of Providence Health Systems, but Providence itself has jurisdiction over the State of Oregon, and it’s got other systems in California. This gives a tremendous degree of variety and organizational diversity, each representing different healthcare organization perspectives as part of this development work. There are very few health tech companies that can offer that sort of background and diversity, in terms of their solution development and application.</p>
<p>Mathieu: What was the vision behind the Lumedic Exchange? It makes sense to have some sort of ecosystem or consortium, governing the health apps, or the data, or the different systems and what people are using. Is that the idea behind the Lumedic Exchange?</p>
<p>Jim: That’s a great question. I know we haven’t talked about it too much besides the references to the Trust over IP Foundation, but the Lumedic Connect product is based entirely on the Trust over IP Foundation <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">framework for managing decentralized identity</a>, and using the W3C (WorldWide Web Consortium) verifiable credential model.</p>
<p>If you think about what that verifiable credential trust triangle model looks like; between the issuer, the credential holder, and the credential verifier — what type of business processes and use cases are there, for using that verifiable credential in healthcare use cases? Despite what we could bring to the table for technical knowledge and engineering to develop the Lumedic Connect product as a small company, or even in conjunction with Providence Health, we couldn’t necessarily come up with every use case by ourselves. Nor could we get industry buy-in for a use case of how a verifiable credential could be used in a healthcare scenario, without the participation of as many healthcare organizations as possible. So, we created the Lumedic Exchange to allow healthcare organizations to join for free and participate in that process to get educated about verifiable credentials, and contribute their perspective. For example, if I have a patient coming in for an x-ray, and they have their insurance through Blue Cross/Blue Shield, what needs to go into a verifiable credential? What’s the registration process? How do I tie that credential to the imaging system and to the image? How does it work with their insurance eligibility and registration? That sort of thing.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I always worry about the education gap with any new technologies, but is it clicking with the health providers that are coming into the Lumedic Exchange? Are they really seeing the value of <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">portable digital verifiable credentials</a>?</p>
<p>Jim: That’s a great question. I would like to say that they see the value of it, but it is a brand new effort. We launched around November of last year. Of course, launching anything last year in the pandemic obviously complicates some of the messaging. What I can say is that we have strong participation from several folks in the payer community, from Mastercard, identity services from other representatives in Providence, and from HireRight, the human resources information company. They are consistently participating in a couple of the workgroups we’ve stood up, plus some new ones that are addressing various issues for credentials. So, I’m very optimistic that the momentum is going to build this year. I think both membership contributions and value will all be built as the year goes on.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It seems like the one opportunity, or one of the good things with COVID (if there’s any of them), driving the push towards more and more digitization. The use of proof-of-vaccines; that’s one of the first use cases that it seems you’re focused on.</p>
<p>Jim: Yes, and I like the way you paraphrase that; both fortunately and unfortunately. It’s terribly unfortunate that we have such a human toll and tragedy concerning the pandemic. On the other hand, it has prompted consideration and forced changes in business models, in ways that we’ve talked about and never been able to do. They are now a reality; whether it’s telework and now the adoption of telehealth and virtual care. In many ways, the substance around a health pass or vaccination credential was there before, and it’s something we’ve been working on as an underlying technology with Lumedic Connect and for Providence for a couple of years. However, fortunately, or unfortunately, the foundation of vaccination coverage and a vaccination credential serves as a foundation for really demonstrating a use case, in one of the most positive and fast moving ways.</p>
<p>Mathieu: People definitely understand that when they see it, and it has been interesting.</p>
<p>I remember early last year when we were in the early days of COVID, with the COVID credentials initiative starting and a lot of different efforts, trying to look at a way to use these new technologies for good, without sacrificing privacy, or any ethical considerations, and so on. Although this stuff could excite you, is there stuff that scares you about the COVID? There seem to be a lot of different COVID projects that are going on right now.</p>
<p>Jim: Absolutely. Of course, I’ll be quick to point out ours as being one of the best, but I do so in the context that the vaccination credential use case is but one of many use cases that we’re looking at, as part of the broader aspect of managing patient health information that we’ve been talking about so far, when you called out things like HIPAA and the 21st Century Cures Act.</p>
<p>You’re right, unfortunately. There are several prominent cases going on right now, or several prominent industry applications, where privacy seems like a real concern. It’s understandably very difficult for a consumer to look at these different things, and be told, “Oh, don’t worry, it’s on the blockchain.” That’s somehow supposed to mean something in terms of privacy, without underlying what a governance framework is, or what an inherent privacy-preserving architecture is. We were aiming for all of that first and foremost, even before dealing with vaccination credentials, and so that’s built on it too. In working with things like the Good Health Pass Collaborative, we’re trying to come up with that type of Good Housekeeping/UL seal of approval that shows that this credential application and mobile application have taken into account key considerations for privacy, security, interoperability, a trust framework, and so on. This would enable consumers to know that you can trust and appreciate that these apps are only working on your behalf and that they’re not representing either corporate surveillance of healthcare or some other government intrusion into your health information.</p>
<p>Mathieu: There’s a lot of good work happening, as you mentioned, at the Good Health Pass Collaborative. With the trust models or trust frameworks that you’ve been working on within the Lumedic Exchange, is there a lot of overlap there? Have you been able to contribute to that?</p>
<p>Jim: I think you make a great point; it’s entirely collaborative. If you think about the things that we’re working through in terms of privacy, and interoperability, and trust frameworks in the Good Health Pass Collaborative; while called into focus around the issue of vaccination credentials, they also pertain across the board to any other healthcare information factor. As you mentioned, there are lots of good companies in the COVID Credentials Initiative (CCI) and lots of work there; but, of course, as an organization, they’re focused on COVID credentials. Ours is a focus on health information credentials, patient-centric identity management first, with COVID credentials being a natural overlay to that.</p>
<p>Mathieu: There’s a need for trust models or trust frameworks across different industries or ecosystems. We see many developments taking place in the financial sector; that’s the area in which we work a little more. How do you describe a trust model or trust framework to someone? It’s a new concept, that wasn’t necessarily there with traditional architected systems.</p>
<p>Jim: You’re right, it is very new. When you’re advancing this model of trust, first and foremost and speaking as a Chief Trust Officer, I of course spend some time explaining what a Chief Trust Officer is. I emphasize to them that previous roles for chief this, and chief that, whether it was a Chief Information Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Data Officer; all those roles highlighted how organizations were taking a new organizational leadership around that particular concept. That is, how important information was, or how important data was. Now, we feel we’re in the era where trust has to be called out as something that is an organizational value, an organizational effort. So, with that in mind, you need a trust framework.</p>
<p>When asked how I look at a trust framework, or a trust assessment framework: digital trust is considered to be an embodiment of all the ongoing activities and areas of security and privacy, and data management or data governance. That activity manifests itself as some way that parties who may, or may not, know or like each other, can agree upon trusting each other. That generally represents a combination of things that we’re already familiar with, such as ISO standards, or GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), or in financial services, GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) and other financial securities. Acts that combine together, and lay out some way that organizations can attest, or be certified, to say, “I’m following security standards; I have security in place; I’m following privacy standards.”</p>
<p>There is a right-to-privacy for the users; there’s a right to protect their data, and a right to be forgotten. All of that is serving as a framework to be able to say, “Can I now trust that the rules in this organization, combined with the rules in that organization, will allow me to use this credential as a model to identify me?” Despite the fact that you may not know everything about me, we both agree that we’re following these rules together, and you can trust that I can do this. Or, more importantly, that I can trust you, that you can have my information, or that we can have some sort of transaction or relationship together.</p>
<p>Which, when you think about it, is the heart of where blockchain, and Bitcoin and everything started. Even in anonymous, almost adversarial, relationships, you could have rules for how transactions took place, so that two people could conduct a financial transaction without ever knowing each other. Everyone agreed to what that was, and that was, in fact, really a trust assurance framework. It was engineered into the Bitcoin code and the way in which Bitcoin operates. That serves as a foundation, to then extend that to verifiable credentials, and saying, “I present a credential that comes from someone you trust, or an organization that’s trusted. That serves as the basis for our transaction together, without having to collect and store a bunch of other information.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I remember some years ago, when blockchain was supposed to be used for everything. In the early days of <a href="https://northernblock.io/">decentralized identity management</a>, a lot of the thinking was, “Hey, let’s just throw everything on-chain.” I think we realized pretty quickly, that definitely does not hold up; you can’t put personal information on-chain. I’m definitely happy with the evolution that we’ve seen, with off-chain secure communication with verifiable credentials, and using pretty cool cryptography and protocols to allow that to happen. Does the Lumedic ecosystem publish its own trust framework, and does it use a specific blockchain as a utility to write information that’s pertinent to issuers and certain credential information?</p>
<p>Jim: Yes, and first of all, let me say I think your summary was beautiful! As someone who has been in blockchain and healthcare for about four years, I translate it from a Dilbert cartoon: blockchain is like radioactivity; you can use it for good or evil, and you don’t want to get any of it on you. I believe a lot of people had a vision about it; to simply use blockchain like bitcoin, and somehow it’s all anonymous. When, in fact, blockchain does a beautiful job of being able to eliminate anonymity, and being able to trace and associate transactions with a specific person, with specific information. However, when you abstract it out between on-chain and off-chain as you’re suggesting, then you have a new way to be able to enforce privacy, especially with the principles of decentralized identifiers. We are built on a combination of the Hyperledger Indy/Aries framework and part of the Sovrin Network. So, you have those principles and trust framework associated with Sovrin and SSI, as part of the framework for the Hyperledger Indy/Aries network or software components that we’re using. To your question; yes, the Lumedic Exchange is developing its own trust framework and own credential rules, which we intend to publish. They’re developed by the working groups, and published on our <a href="https://www.lumedic.io/lumedic-exchange">lumedicexchange.org</a> website to be available as examples for anyone.</p>
<p>We see that the most important things to do first, are culturalization, education, and adoption. We won’t necessarily be the only solution for this, although we’d obviously like to help all the patients in America. However, truly understanding it and moving it forward as a concept for how patient information should be managed, is probably the most important thing first and foremost. Therefore, we’ll publicly share all of the trust framework and governance framework documentation we develop out of the exchange. That will allow people to build upon it, and when the next thing comes along — whether it’s KERI, or Hedera Hashgraph, or the next version of Hyperledger Indy/Aries — we’ll have a framework to help support that.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s awesome. Similar to the rest of the community, it’s great to see you guys participate. I know you’re passionate about participating in different organizations; whether it’s the Trust over IP, ID2020, or other ones. Going back to that nice illustration that Mike Nash had put together; that starts at the paper era. Well, definitely not the elimination of the paper era, as we’re talking more and more about today. This technology needs to be accessible to people, and it needs to fit the different cultures and the different ways of using it.</p>
<p>Jim: Absolutely. Your commentary drives me to another point too, which is this idea of patient-centric, and patient empowerment, and consumerism. I know that’s on Mike’s graphic as well, that we have to take into account the gradual but steady building of consumerism and healthcare, in a way that hasn’t existed before. By virtue of making this technology accessible, consumers can take advantage of it as part of doing their business of daily life.</p>
<p>You know, the use of faxes and the use of paper records have still continued to persist. Nothing makes me want to stick a pencil in my eye faster than when I see an advertisement for a secure cloud-based fax platform. I’d say, “Fantastic. What a great job hedging over the cart path, and I’m going to go buy another horse.” It’s not advancing where technology can go, to help consumers and empower patients. There’s a great deal of that effort going on within HL7, of course, which is why I’m excited to make it a complementary effort. There are so many folks around the US and around the globe, who are working HL7 to advance more effective ways to exchange health information. We advance other standards from the global community around identity, to be able to make it a patient-centric way of managing that.</p>
<p>It’s nothing short of revolutionary. “Revolutionary” means that there are winners and losers, and you hope that the most important winner, of course, is the patient.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes: with the understanding, as you said perfectly, that there’s not going to be one winner — you need to be able to play within the ecosystem and add the value that you’re good at adding. It’s not that you can simply replicate the siloed models that are there today; that’s not the evolution or revolution that we’re looking for here. I’ll post Mike’s illustration in the show notes for this podcast. We’ve referred to it a couple of times, and I think it’s a great overview of the different eras within healthcare.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mike Nash, Lumedic</p>
<p>Within the Lumedic Exchange, there are different organizations that are part of this, and there are different working groups that are happening. What’s being worked on?</p>
<p>Jim: Let me highlight probably my most exciting working group, which is Health Equity. We’ve set out to try and get about seven working groups up and running. We have an Identity working group, who are looking at things like identity attributes, and binding things I’m sure you’re familiar with. These are issues that are a fundamental block-and-tackling for how verifiable credentials work. We have another working group around Registration and Eligibility, which starts to tie in the actual workflow of a patient registration process in a healthcare system, into the use of a verifiable credential. We’re also looking at some very specific healthcare opportunities, for things like skilled nursing facility, and for imaging and pharmacy applications.</p>
<p>In our Health Equity and Population Health working group, I got excited about it because I spent a lot of time working on another concept called “Social Determinants Of Health,” or SDOH. In healthcare, that concept has a lot of conversation going on. This deals with looking into non-clinical factors that make up your healthcare aspects and your lifestyle. As someone said, social determinants of health are our health factors, no matter what. We tend to look at them for things like housing security, economic security, and food security. These are social factors that weigh-in, for whoever is being considered as part of the clinical analysis. It’s not information that your doctor historically has gathered or that you typically see in a clinical record. But, we understand these factors more and more as being a critical consideration. If you live in an area where it’s challenging to get affordable housing, that’s going to factor into impacts on clinical care and your ability to get to the doctor, and just have a place to live.</p>
<p>That translates into points of digital information about you that are separate from what you have in your health care record, but have to be considered. Where should they be considered, better than in a platform that you control for where that information is available and then shared with your health care provider? Conversely, there are things about your healthcare information that may need to be taken into account when you’re being provided housing, or for mental health, or for food security. However, that doesn’t mean that you’re giving consent to everyone that you meet, to have total access to your health care record.</p>
<p>There are all of these various factors and determinants that are looked at for modern healthcare: those are sources of digital information that only the individual concerned can control. So, we’re looking at how these factors of health equity and social determinants of health get considered from a verifiable credential standpoint. How do I tie together some of the work being done in HL7, and things like the Gravity Project for social determinants of health, into the identity model that we have in using a verifiable credential? Probably most importantly, how do we ensure that using verifiable credentials doesn’t create a problem for digital health equity (the so-called digital divide), but in some way, maybe even helps to mitigate or improve health equity problems that we’re seeing in digital health right now?</p>
<p>Mathieu: Are these layers that one would see if they’re <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallets-and-internationalizing-ssi-products/">using a digital wallet</a>? There could be an agent in your wallet, like your Lumedic Connect, that is able to process this the right way. I’ve seen it differently in different use cases, where we start talking less about credentials, but more about capabilities and skills. And so, you have this translation layer; is that something that would be similar to the health equity stuff?</p>
<p>Jim: Absolutely. That’s a wonderful observation, because, for us, this effort doesn’t stop with just the credential. The patient era is about patient empowerment. I mentioned before about AI and other tools you can use; I think that there’s nothing more important than continued advancement of the presentation layer, of that user experience. So much of this is just under the covers.</p>
<p>I joke around in the blockchain and healthcare community, to say, “The first rule of blockchain, is to stop talking about blockchain.” What you’re really talking about is, what is it in the decentralized application that improves things? We have to have applications that elderly Medicare recipients can understand how to use, as easily as a 25-year-old millennial Javascript developer. Specifically, in the world of healthcare: what can be done about healthcare terms and diagnosis and treatment plans that are not only easy to understand, but can translate into things from a user experience or an engagement platform, that work with the patient to keep them informed, to help them make decisions, and at the same time, help safeguard their data and the ability to share data and provide consent.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Are there new revenue opportunities, too? Are these conversations that come up with different people within the ecosystem? You mentioned that you got to talk about the value or the benefits, rather than just saying ‘blockchain’ or just talking about the technology. I’ve been seeing this for a while now, where this is great. Once I establish myself; let’s say I’m a healthcare provider, or let’s say I’m an insurance company, let’s say I’m a lab; these are all participants that would fit within the Lumedic Exchange. Do you work with them to define what the revenue models are? Are there concerns about, “Hey, what if my credentials are reusable, and shareable, and stuff like that — do I potentially lose on future revenue? Are these issues and topics that you guys talk about?</p>
<p>Jim: You know, I can’t say that we’ve had some of those specific conversations. But, I think some of what you’re alluding to is really important; the general concern overall that so many healthcare applications are just another form of surveillance capitalism. And, saying, “Hey, what a great application to help you manage your health care,” only to find out that you’re putting all of your personal data in it, and they’re doing something with it behind the scenes. That’s clearly not something we want to have as a problem.</p>
<p>I think that in general, as you mentioned the concept of verifiable credentials and using your patient identity, we all need to be cognizant of ways that you don’t inadvertently create that surveillance capitalism, or find new ways to construe information that becomes restrictive. Nobody wants to be able to have their healthcare data present a situation for an insurance company to pass judgment on not covering them or to raise their rates. Are there ways that healthcare information is anonymous around decision-making, or anonymized, that allow you to protect your identity, limit bias or unethical approaches, and at the same time, advance how that information is used for effective quality measures or quality metrics?</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s interesting. There’s something strong about having selective disclosure. But also, beyond that, being able to control your image or your persona, and not needing to necessarily divulge all the information about yourself so that you’re not completely exposing yourself to everyone and everywhere, basically, along the surveillance capitalism lines that you just said there. As a patient, if I’m now using Lumedic Connect, I have some credentials on there. I’m able to use different services and stuff like that that you’ll have on there. But, when I show up to a doctor’s office, and they’re still using their traditional systems in there; whether it’s an EHR or whatever it is, is that how it works? Is it that I show up at my doctor’s office, I scan a QR code, and I give them consent, and I transfer certain data to their system?</p>
<p>Jim: Yes, that is the long-term vision, for sure. You’re right; those are areas that our working groups are still sorting through to understand the specific mechanics. It is being approached with the idea that you would have, basically, a QR code presented. A QR code-reader has the fundamental interface point for everyone to consider. It could be Near Field Communications (NFC) or Bluetooth as we build upon it. However, that initial point of registration, and leveraging that QR code, is where our conversations are starting, that is correct.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Got it. I saw something posted that it’s being tested internally within the Providence system. This is being piloted; it’s being tested, it’s being used, as we speak.</p>
<p>Jim: Yes, it’s being piloted and tested around the vaccination credential first, because that’s obviously the use case; the other ones are in development. I would mention again, the opportunity that we’re afforded with Providence Health Systems is a landscape of 85 million patients and 120 000 caregivers. So, we have a very broad and diverse landscape in healthcare, to be able to leverage “in our own backyard,” which will help you know demonstrate efficacy for health care overall. It’s not merely a single clinic, in one single town someplace; which makes it very exciting to show the depth of development that’s possible.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Awesome. The other projects I’ve seen in the healthcare space have been more from the doctor, or the physician side of things. I know you collaborate with NHS, and I’ve heard conversations with them before. Is there collaboration with them, too? </p>
<p>Although, they’re touching the other side within the larger ecosystem; everyone needs to be plugged in.</p>
<p>Jim: That’s a great question. We don’t actually collaborate with NHS in the UK at the moment. I’ve had the pleasure to meet some colleagues there and talk with them a bit, but our focus is on the US. The US is so large, and so diverse in terms of what we’re trying to address; I’d welcome the chance to work with the NHS in the future, but we want to conquer US healthcare first.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That makes sense. In closing, Jim, what’s on the roadmap? What should people expect from Lumedic for the rest of 2021? How could people help out?</p>
<p>Jim: A couple of key points: our work with the Good Health Pass Collaborative, as well as internally with Lumedic, will continue to advance what a secure, privacy-preserving vaccination credential is like; if, in fact, people are called upon to need it for travel, and return to work, and so on.</p>
<p>We’re building upon that to help improve and revolutionize the registration workflow, which potentially saves patients a whole bunch of time and preserves their privacy as well; it can be tremendously efficient on the part of the healthcare systems, too. Also, continued growth and participation in the Lumedic Exchange; to define new use cases, new proofs-of-concept, and being able to advance this verifiable credential patient information platform concept that much further in 2021 and into 2022.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I love the vision towards the patient era. I think you guys are at the forefront, and I look forward to keeping a close eye on what’s happening, and the progress that’s going to be happening this year and over the next few years.</p>
<p>Jim, thank you very much for doing this with me today.</p>
<p>Jim: Thank you, Mathieu. It’s been a pleasure, and I look forward to you keeping me honest in our developments, my friend.</p>

  <p>You’ve seen those iconic blue containers filled with everything from cars to TVs and stamped with the Maersk logo countless times on ships docked at ports around the world. But have you ever thought about what it takes to orchestrate the movement of that cargo?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maersk operates in 134 countries, shipping 10 million containers to 76 global ports annually with the help of 88,000 employees. A complex network of people and systems are responsible for its safe passage. Take a car battery. You can’t put a battery into a shipping container and simply say goodbye. A battery is considered dangerous cargo. It goes into a specialized climate-controlled container, requires special customs clearance, and must follow specific logistics to safely transport the batteries over land. And Maersk must keep every vendor, partner and customer updated during each point of the journey. As Maersk’s Angel Donchev, vice president of Platform Tech Lead - Web, Mobile, API/EDI, Blockchain, says, “Maersk is a fascinating company.”</p>

<p>To reduce the complexity of these operations, streamline processes and keep its various constituents happy, Maersk is leveraging a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/hybrid-iam">hybrid identity and access management (IAM)</a> and cloud strategy with identity serving as a “pivotal role,” according to Angel. In fact, he says, “The more adoption you have around the cloud, the more identity becomes critical for you because you need to authenticate services, users, partners, vendors and all kinds of different personas, as well as connected devices.”</p>

<p>Since embarking on this hybrid IAM and cloud strategy, Maersk is experiencing numerous benefits. The company has shortened authentication time by a factor of four, so customers, partners and vendors can quickly access essential information through any digital channel in less than a millisecond. The organization has also decreased onboarding time for new vendors from months to less than a week. Lastly, Maersk has reduced costs for Angel’s massive department by 45%, while at the same time increasing the engineering capacity by 45%.</p>

<p>Check out this video to hear more about how <a href="https://forgerock.com/customer/maersk">Maersk</a>’s hybrid IAM and cloud strategy is helping the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/videos/maersk-case-study">company</a> achieve its goal of becoming the leading global integrator of containers and logistics.</p>

<p>by Razia Ali, Senior Account Manager Gaming/Gambling</p>
<p>Over the past several years, Germany has become more open to innovative remote identity verification methods within the online gambling sector. These are welcome developments, and IDnow actively supports operators to meet their Know Your Customer (KYC) obligations with seamless and secure options.</p>
<p>Protecting minors from adult media content and adult entertainment has always been a top priority in Germany through the Protection of Young Persons Act (Jugendschutzgesetz – JuSchG) and the German Interstate Treaty on Gambling (ISTG), the latest being the ISTG 2021 effective July 1, 2021.</p>
<p>Licensing requirements for online gambling operators in Germany are stringent. For example, advertisements for online gambling offerings are allowed but with specific restrictions. In particular, advertising cannot be aimed towards minors; they cannot be presented as a way to solve financial problems, and there are strict limitations that ban broadcasting, or online advertising between 9 am and 6 pm when minors might be exposed. This is where strict identity verification requirements (Age Verification or AV) of players kick in to help protect minors from accessing such content and entering online gambling platforms.</p>
<p>Convenient solutions</p>
<p>Some operators have gone about enforcing AV requirements by following treaty guidelines, whereas other operators have chosen not to follow regulatory requirements and offer simple AV methods where the player picks games according to age and plays accordingly. Other operators have chosen to simply not offer certain adult games in strictly regulated markets like Germany. The solutions are simple, and service providers like IDnow are able to offer products that are compliant and easy to use.</p>
<p>To date, identity verification requirements for gambling operators fall under the German Anti-Money Laundering Act (AML Act) as well as the Interstate Gambling Treaty. The guidelines on “permissible” remote AV methods come from the Kommission für Jugendmedienschutz (KJM), the Commission for the Protection of Minors. The KJM permits online gambling operators a choice of innovative remote methods legally by evaluating whether such systems meet technical and security requirements. Once a method has been evaluated to “satisfactorily” perform an AV, an operator is able to select the appropriate service. The remote method should enable the player’s ID document to be validated and must perform a comparison of the user’s biometric data.</p>
<p>IDnow, which began offering remote identity verification according to the strictest regulatory requirements under German AML law, was one of the first remote identity providers to receive a positive evaluation for both its Videoident and Autoident products to meet AV requirements securely. Document verification is a combination of checks being performed, which includes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) check of the Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ&nbsp;-the two lines at the bottom of the passport), with&nbsp;Selfie Comparison + Liveness Detection&nbsp;(selfie of the player).</p>
<p>All players entering an online gambling site must be age verified and operators who choose to use remote KYC methods ought to ensure they have been evaluated and approved by the KJM, such as IDnow product solutions which are available 24/7. Some of the biggest operators in the gambling world rely on compliant AV methods accepted in Germany to kick in responsible gambling. One of the biggest concerns that have come up for operators time and time again is the ability to offer a seamless user experience from verifying and onboarding players without any friction while ensuring that safe and responsible players are converted into regular customers. A top priority is to create a safe space for players and operators. IDnow is committed to helping operators maintain legal AV requirements and ensure high conversion rates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Con l’accordo siglato con le due società del Gruppo Tinexta, la Confederazione punta ad agevolare la trasformazione digitale delle imprese associate a sostegno della loro competitività. Benefici concreti anche per le sue sedi territoriali.</p>



<p>Roma, 13 aprile 2021 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione a livello europeo, Sixtema (Tinexta Group), partner tecnologico di PMI, associazioni di categoria, intermediari finanziari, studi professionali ed enti, e Confcommercio, la Confederazione Generale Italiana delle Imprese, delle Attività Professionali e del Lavoro Autonomo, hanno siglato un accordo quadro per favorire una maggiore competitività delle Pmi mediante la promozione e diffusione dei servizi di Digital Trust (come ad es. identità digitale, PEC, firma digitale, fatturazione elettronica) e di soluzioni digitali innovative.</p>



<p>La partnership consentirà alle 700.000 imprese associate a Confcommercio di accedere, a condizioni agevolate, a servizi e soluzioni digitali altamente specializzati attraverso le Associazioni territoriali, che a loro volta potranno dotarsi degli stessi strumenti, ampliando e migliorando anche la loro offerta.</p>



<p>“Oggi è impensabile operare nel terziario di mercato senza adottare le soluzioni digitali più innovative che sono un’opportunità in più per le imprese per poter reggere l’urto della crisi economica scatenata dalla pandemia” – dichiara Fabio Fulvio, direttore responsabile del settore Marketing, Innovazione e Internazionalizzazione di Confcommercio – “Già da anni siamo in prima linea per offrire le migliori soluzioni tecnologiche e la formazione più efficace ai nostri associati, affinché possano integrare le soluzioni digitali nel loro business. Infocert e Sixtema sono partner ideali per le nostre Associazioni territoriali e di categoria, proprio perché offrono soluzioni all’avanguardia in ambito digitale con tutto il supporto e l’affidabilità necessari”.</p>



<p>Fino a pochi mesi fa, strumenti quali SPID, Posta Elettronica Certificata e Firma Digitale erano troppo spesso percepiti come elementi di cui dotarsi per meri obblighi normativi. Allo scoppiare della pandemia, il loro uso è diventato sempre più comune e frequente. Oggi, alle imprese, appaiono come abilitatori d’efficienza e facilitatori del business.</p>



<p>“L’Italia, con ben 19 milioni di identità SPID rilasciate, detiene il record di identità digitali in Europa. Questo è solo un esempio di quanto la trasformazione digitale stia cambiando la quotidianità di cittadini e aziende ma, ancor di più, ne determinerà il futuro prossimo” commenta Carmine Auletta, Chief Innovation &amp; Strategy Officer di InfoCert, Tinexta Group. “Il Digital Trust, cioè la Fiducia Digitale, è ormai un fattore strategico irrinunciabile di competitività delle imprese. In uno scenario complesso come quello attuale e in un mercato sempre più globale, le Associazioni come Confcommercio hanno un ruolo determinante nell’accelerazione di questo cambiamento culturale”.</p>



<p>Anche in quest’ottica, Confcommercio prevede degli specifici momenti formativi, a beneficio delle proprie rappresentanze locali, erogati in collaborazione con Sixtema che peraltro sarà il loro punto di riferimento anche per tutta l’assistenza di secondo livello.</p>



<p>“Metteremo al servizio di Confcommercio, delle sue articolazioni territoriali e delle imprese associate, la lunga esperienza maturata nella progettazione e nello sviluppo di soluzioni tecnologiche ad hoc nonché nella consulenza specializzata per PMI e associazioni di categoria. Avere l’opportunità di contribuire all’innovazione di una platea imprenditoriale e associativa così vasta, quale quella di Confcommercio, rappresenta al contempo una grande sfida ma anche un motivo di vero orgoglio” conclude Claudio Scaramelli, Amministratore Delegato di Sixtema, Tinexta Group.</p>



 InfoCert SpA 



<p>InfoCert, Tinexta Group, è la più grande Certification Authority europea, attiva in oltre venti Paesi. La società eroga servizi di digitalizzazione, eDelivery, Firma Digitale e conservazione digitale dei documenti ed è gestore accreditato AgID dell’identità digitale nell’ambito di SPID (Sistema Pubblico per la gestione dell’Identità Digitale). InfoCert investe in modo significativo nella ricerca e sviluppo e nella qualità: detiene un significativo numero di brevetti mentre le certificazioni di qualità ISO 9001, 27001 e 20000 testimoniano l’impegno ai massimi livelli nell’erogazione dei servizi e nella gestione della sicurezza.

InfoCert, infine, è proprietaria dell’80% delle azioni di Sixtema SpA, il partner tecnologico delle Associazioni di categoria.</p>



 Sixtema SpA 



<p>Sixtema è il Digital Enabler per Associazioni, Small Finance e PMI che promuove la digital transformation del tessuto produttivo e imprenditoriale del Sistema Italia.</p>



<p>Sixtema offre piattaforme verticali per la gestione a 360° degli associati alle più importanti organizzazioni di rappresentanza del paese, favorendo lo sviluppo dell’economia del territorio.</p>



<p>Grazie alle sue soluzioni rende l’innovazione accessibile per la digitalizzazione dei processi, garantendone sicurezza e piena compliance normativa.</p>



<p>Con i servizi di Consulting, affianca le imprese con attività di advisory per accompagnarle operativamente nei processi di trasformazione digitale, e di evoluzione normativa.</p>



<p>I 130 dipendenti operano dalle sedi di Modena, Firenze, Ancona e Roma.</p>

 Ancora una volta PA, Istituzioni e Università, con il patrocinio di AgID, insieme per dare risalto all’importanza strategica dei processi di digitalizzazione. 



<p>Il prossimo 16 Aprile, Assintel e il Laboratorio di Documentazione dell’Università della Calabria, in collaborazione con AssoConservatori Accreditati, organizzano gli Stati Generali della Conservazione. Con il patrocinio di AgID. Dato il prorogarsi delle restrizioni anti Covid, l’evento si svolgerà online, con numerosi ospiti di rilievo che si alterneranno in una manifestazione dal tiolo: “Recovery Fund e qualità della conservazione digitale per la competitività del paese”.</p>



 Recovery Fund e qualità della conservazione digitale per la competitività del paese 



<p>Anche quest’anno avrà luogo l’ormai nota manifestazione che riunisce i vari stakeholder sul tema della Conservazione Digitale dei Documenti. L’evento patrocinato da Assoconservatori Accreditati – la sezione di Assintel dedicata al tema della Conservazione digitale – e dall’Università della Calabria, co-organizzatrice dell’evento, ha lo scopo di riunire e portare al confronto tutti gli attori di questo complesso ecosistema rispetto ai percorsi di realizzazione e completamento della digitalizzazione, nell’ottica del miglioramento della competitività del Paese.</p>



<p>Sarà possibile partecipare all’evento on-line da questa pagina <a href="https://www.assintel.it/eventi/stati-generali-conservazione-2021/">https://www.assintel.it/eventi/stati-generali-conservazione-2021/</a></p>



 InfoCert, punto di riferimento per la Conservazione Digitale a Norma. 



<p>InfoCert è stata tra le prime aziende italiane ad essere accreditata da AgID come Conservatore, requisito normativo necessario per erogare servizi di Conservazione Digitale. Da allora, è punto di riferimento per professionisti, aziende e PA che vogliono digitalizzare i processi di conservazione con le soluzioni <a href="https://www.infocert.it/conservazione/">LegalDoc</a>.</p>



<p>InfoCert ormai da anni fa anche parte della community di Assoconservatori Accreditati, una rete che riunisce aziende del mondo ICT in una sezione dedicata alle imprese private accreditate in AgID per i servizi di conservazione digitale dei documenti. Il motivo di questa verticalizzazione è semplice: tutelare il mercato da sistemi di gare pubbliche inquinati da logiche che non tutelano la qualità e la libera concorrenza.</p>

  NFTs have great potential for provable scarcity and ownership, yet the lack 
of a verifiable identity layer limits the fulfilment of this potential. 
This article presents a case of NFT fraud and copyright infringement, and 
describes how self-sovereign identity (SSI) can be the solution to verify 
the origin and legitimacy of an NFT and its linked object.

<p>In this article, we first highlight the great potential that NFTs have in terms of provable scarcity and ownership, as well as an important shortcoming that is limiting the fulfillment of this potential: the lack of a verifiable identity layer. We describe how this lack of verifiable identity not only limits the use of NFTs for provable scarcity and ownership – it opens the gates for fraud and scams. Finally, we describe how self-sovereign identity (SSI) can be the solution to verify the origin and legitimacy of an NFT and its linked object, and we invite you to join Gimly and bitcoin artist Petek<a href="https://twitter.com/RadarRayne">@RaydarRayne</a> on our journey to fulfill the potential of NFTs for digital and physical artists alike.

 Non-fungible tokens: the basics 
<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are provably unique digital assets. They cannot be duplicated or divided creating digital scarcity. NFT's contain information that link a digital or physical object, and are recorded in smart contracts on decentralized blockchain networks which makes the record mathematically tamperproof. Ownership of an NFT is provably unique which is why investors and collectors are excited for this new digital format allowing them to have trustworthy collectables in the digital space. Under the hood, NFTs are actually software programs that exist on decentralised blockchains like <a href="https://bitcoin.org">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://ethereum.org/en">Ethereum</a> which give them their unique trust properties. Learn more about NFTs <a href="https://coincentral.com/nfts-non-fungible-tokens">here</a>.</p>
<p>This works very well with on-chain virtual objects that live on the blockchain which can be provably and uniquely linked to the NFT. Some good examples of this are digital cats on <a href="https://coincentral.com/nfts-non-fungible-tokens">Cryptokitties</a>, trading cards on <a href="https://rarepepewallet.com">Pepecard</a>, virtual land on <a href="https://decentraland.org">Decentraland</a> and video game items on <a href="https://ultra.io">Ultra</a>. </p>
<p>However, when we want to issue NFTs representing a physical or digital object that is not on the blockchain – such as a piece of art – we run into problems. Because the NFT and its object are not immutably linked, important questions arise about what it is that the NFT conveys ownership over. And is the creator of the NFT even authorized to convey such ownership? What is the legitimacy of the NFT and the creator of the NFT in the first place?</p>

 The identity problem 
<p>Petek <a href="https://twitter.com/RadarRayne">@RadarRayne</a>, a Bitcoin artist well-known for her <a href="https://www.petek.co.uk">artwork</a> representing the stock-to-flow model in collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD">PlanB</a>, recently found herself asking exactly these questions. A few weeks ago, she discovered that rarible.com listed an NFT falsely representing one of her latest prints in the limited series <a href="https://www.petek.co.uk/product-page/the-fourth-turning-s2f-print-limited-edition-of-200">"The Fourth Turning"</a>. This NFT was created by a scammer and was not actually backed by any of her artwork. It had nothing to do with Petek's art and was a serious infringement of her copyrights! So she asked herself: how could this happen? </p>
<p>Most blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are pseudo-anonymous. Accounts on the blockchain do not reveal any information about the identity that controls them. Anyone could take a screenshot from Peteks website, and NFT her artwork. There is no reliable way for the potential buyer to verify the origin and the legitimacy of the NFT creator. A buyer would need to visit Petek's website and even reach out in person to verify whether the NFT is legitimate.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in this case some of Petek's clients indeed reached out to her and Petek was able to have the NFT listing removed. But surely, there will be many more similar cases where such fraud is not detected in time. </p>
<p>This example deals with a physical piece of art, but the lack of a verifiable identity at the origin of an NFT is equally problematic for digital art. The lack of NFT verifiability also leads to intellectual property &amp; copyright infringements. Of course, it is possible to trace back the chain of custody to the creator's public address and see if similar artwork from the same artist is created using that address. But an instant and fool-proof manner to verify the legitimacy of an NFTs creator is lacking none the less. Without such verification built into the NFT, an NFT proves ownership only over that NFT itself, and nothing more.</p>
 Self-sovereign identity: verifying the origin and legitimacy of an NFT and the linked object 
<p>This is exactly the problem that self-sovereign identity (SSI) solves! SSI is a new set of standards that guide a new identity architecture for the Internet. With a focus on privacy, security interoperability, SSI applications use public key cryptography in consertion with public blockchains to create persistent identities with private and selective disclosure of information for people (and more generally, identity information for all kinds of entities - organizations, objects, IoT devices and more).</p>
<p>Because SSI is built for blockchain-based identities, it is the perfect solution to bring identity to NFTs! SSI applications enables the creator or artist to proveably sign off that a digital or physical asset was created by them. Buyers can then verifiably check they are indeed purchasing an NFT that was created by the artist.</p>
<p>Without this, NFTs of the future should not be considered legitimate, unless people don't mind them being "backed by thin air". SSI is what lends NFTs the "value beyond the token itself" immutably, and cryptographically connected to said asset in perpetuity.</p>
 Learn more about SSI and IoT with non-fungible tokens 
<p>We are currently consulting with Petek on how we can future proof her artwork from being scammed by offering SSI-backed NFTs with value that is also connected to the actual artwork through "artist approved" verification methods and proveable ownership with our <a href="https://www.gimly.io/blog/gimly-in-essif-ssi-and-nfc-smartcards">self-sovereign identity NFC chips</a>.</p>

<p>Youth Employment and the Future of Work in Bhutan and&nbsp;Beyond</p><p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eunjikangsin/">Eunji Kang</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tteslee/">Eunsoo Lee</a> (<a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>), Tshering Wangmo, Tshoki Zangmo and Bishnu Chettri (<a href="https://www.bt.undp.org/content/bhutan/en/home/about-us.html">UNDP&nbsp;Bhutan</a>)</p><blockquote>Originally <a href="https://undpbhutan2012.medium.com/breaking-the-silos-through-participatory-systems-mapping-youth-employment-and-the-future-of-work-e3ee83950ed8">published</a> by UNDP Bhutan, this blog documents the collaboration between UNDP Bhutan and Dark Matter Labs in a 3-month project investigating the systemic challenge of youth employment and the future of work in Bhutan. The intelligence report published by UNDP Bhutan can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bt.undp.org/content/bhutan/en/home/library/intelligenc-report-systems-approach-to-youth-unemployment-in-bhutan.html">here</a>.</blockquote><p>*This blog includes a link to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0">glossary</a> which defines the terms&nbsp;used.</p> Introduction  Bhutan in transition <p>Bhutan, a country of roughly 760,000 people and one of the very few <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/carbon-negative-country-sustainability">carbon-negative countries</a> in the world, faces unique challenges in designing a viable and sustainable employment market for its growing youth population. With more than <a href="https://www.nsb.gov.bt/publications/census-report/">half the population below the median age of 27</a>, it is experiencing an unprecedented demographic bulge that is projected to <a href="https://www.nsb.gov.bt/download/5006/">increase further</a> in the next couple of decades. To make matters worse, youth unemployment rates have remained consistently high over the past decades, with the highest record in 2018 when it reached <a href="https://kuenselonline.com/youth-unemployment-rate-drops-to-11-9/#:~:text=The%20Labour%20Force%20Survey%20Report,was%2012.3%20percent%20in%202017">15.7 percent</a>. Now that COVID-19 has impeded major industries such as hospitality and tourism, the economic shocks have hit young people the hardest. According to the Rapid Socio-Economic Impact Assessment on Bhutan’s Tourism Sector conducted in April 2020, the pandemic has impacted over 50,000 young people working in the tourism and hospitality sector. They made up <a href="https://thebhutanese.bt/druk-gyalpos-relief-kidu-to-be-continued-beyond-the-3rd-phase/">50% of the welfare applications received in&nbsp;2020</a>.</p><p>These demographic and economic shifts prompt questions about how Bhutan’s economy and society may develop in the 21st century, and within this, what the future of work would look like. The pandemic, while posing several challenges, also presented opportunities to redefine the country’s employment scenario with many educated, experienced Bhutanese diasporas returning home from abroad. In the midst of huge technological leaps taking place globally, there is a growing demand for new markets and business models, new jobs, the reshaping of old industries and the re-definition of work itself in Bhutan as well. Central to this is the need to unleash human potential — creating capabilities in the system for innovation, purpose, shared value creation, and the realisation of new&nbsp;futures.</p> Systems approach to youth employment — a methodology for collective sensemaking  How can we think beyond job markets, and expand our understanding of the employment issue? <p>Too often, unemployment is viewed as a supply-demand problem, where solutions are designed to trigger job creation (increasing supply) or job training (increasing employability and fulfilling demand). But what if that is not enough? The persistence of the problem in Bhutan, and elsewhere, confirms that intervening in the job market alone does not provide a sustainable solution. The behaviour of the individual, and the social and economic environments that the labour market is embedded in — are shaped by numerous interconnected factors such as, the availability of social protection, parental influence, changing expectations, stigma of certain professions, access to digital infrastructure, and so on. The sum of their complex interdependencies we call — a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A2:B2">system (or systems)</a>. This is how we — <a href="https://www.bt.undp.org/content/bhutan/en/home/about-us.html">UNDP Bhutan</a> and <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> — approached Bhutan’s youth employment issue in this 3-month project. The challenge for us was to find a methodology that would allow us to build an awareness of the systemic nature of the issue at stake, and to broaden our horizons in order to imagine new solutions.</p>Figure 1. Layering and communicating complexity through systems&nbsp;mapping How can we understand and embrace complexity? <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A3:B3">Complexity</a> begets complexity for <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01405730">wicked problems</a>. An attempt at analysing the intricacies of systems — the pain points, underlying drivers, risks, and numerous interconnected factors — can easily become overwhelming for one person. Moreover, if we have ten people attempting to do the same, we would probably end up with ten different versions of the analysis. So, how do we prevent ourselves from getting lost in this vast web of interdependencies? How do we do this collectively? How do we build a shared comprehension that can steer us towards the coveted solution&nbsp;space?</p><p>Through extensive engagement with multiple stakeholders, UNDP Bhutan and Dark Matter Labs experimented with the methodology of participatory <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A5:B5">systems mapping</a> as a process of engagement — creating a shared language and comprehension. More importantly, the systems map that we collectively developed, functioned — and still functions — as a critical storytelling tool that represents the diverse interests and experiences of the people involved in the process. Below, we share some key learnings from this&nbsp;process.</p> Complexity vs. Simplicity <p>Using data collected from <a href="https://undp-bhutan.exposure.co/looking-beyond-statistics-for-stories">prior research</a> (which involved desk research and interviews) and ideas generated through <a href="https://undp-ric.medium.com/youth-employment-why-business-as-usual-wont-cut-it-63551751df59">stakeholder workshops</a>, we mapped the connections between factors — each representing a problem — that influence individuals’ options and behaviors regarding work: from family background to market conditions, and global and regional forces. To organise and process the vast number of nodes (factors) and their connections, we created a classification system using the following domains.</p>Figure 2. Classification system for nodes, using contextual and direct&nbsp;domains<p>As we mapped the connections, we realised that the more connections there were, the more challenging it was to make sense of the data. Multiple layers of lines not only made it difficult to track connections visually, but also to see patterns and hierarchies. However, privileging simplicity might risk simplification — leaving out details and erasing the nuances that make the map authentic. So, the challenge was twofold: we needed to create a visual solution that could communicate complexity without sacrificing legibility, and devise a narrative solution that could preserve — and would allow us to exfoliate — the layers of complexity.</p><p>We did the latter by highlighting a series of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A6:B6">micro-narratives</a> that each represent a critical issue that contributes to the challenge of youth unemployment in Bhutan. Each narrative comprises a cluster of nodes (pain points) and takes into account the weight of the connections (which is determined by the number of connected nodes). Superimposed on the map itself, these micro-narratives provide an entry point into the critical issues, and allow zooming in at the numerous branching connections.</p>Figure 3. Micro-narratives composed of multiple interconnected nodes Navigating complex&nbsp;systems <p>A map is not merely a representation of a place (in this case, a system), it serves a function of navigation. Just as geographic coordinates give you a sense of location, and terrain data informs your direction — a systems map helps to orient ourselves; to find direction and make better decisions. The micro-narratives are one layer of information, the domain classifications are another. These layers were designed not to simplify information, but to provide entry points from where the full complexity of the system can be explored. And, because this is an open-ended map that has been validated and iterated constantly through the stakeholder workshops, the narratives also provoke and invite further engagement and augmentation.</p> Perspectives from within the&nbsp;system <p>While drawing inspiration from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics">system dynamics model</a> which sees the world as a complex system of feedback loops, our approach to systems mapping diverged in its method and purpose. The participatory — as opposed to the technical — approach to systems mapping invites multiple stakeholders, experts and non-experts alike, to map their knowledge, experience, and perspectives onto a collective map. Rather than the map itself, it is the process of co-creation, of collective reflection and discussion, that leads to a shared comprehension of the problem at hand. Often, it is easy to interpret the systems map as something factual, providing a holistic overview of the system from a distance. Systems maps crafted through the participatory process may not serve such an objective function. Instead, they can demonstrate the collective insights gathered from those within the&nbsp;system.</p>Figure 4. Identifying “opportunity domains”, highlighting possible interventions across the whole&nbsp;system. New possibilities of sensemaking in the digital&nbsp;age <p>During the process of mapping and synthesising, we used digital tools such as <a href="https://graphcommons.com/">Graph Commons</a> and <a href="https://kumu.io/">Kumu</a> that played a vital role in supporting human synthesis and discovering insights. By interacting with machine-generated clusters and correlations, we became more aware of the human biases involved in creating connections and causal relationships. For example, due to the nuances of language: the way in which a node was described had an effect on how we drew connections, and thus required continuous crafting and validation. The digital tools and algorithms helped us in this process and contributed to the visualisation and compounding of our very human <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A4:B4">sensemaking</a> efforts by highlighting and weighting the connections we had&nbsp;made.</p>Figure 5. Process of ‘human’ and ‘machine’ sensemaking<p>We are aware of the growing number of tools and technologies that support our human sensemaking capacity, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis">factor analysis</a>, <a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/creative-network-science-graph-commons-neo4j-graphconnect/">network analysis</a> and many more. Perhaps through these new methods of combining human and machine analysis, while acknowledging the limitations and possibilities of both, we could arrive at a more nuanced and plural understanding of the&nbsp;system.</p> The opportunity space — creating <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A9:B9">horizontal capacities</a> for innovation  Building a portfolio of experiments across the&nbsp;system <p>Complex systems require a variety of different actors: citizens, civil society organisations, research organisations, entrepreneurs/local businesses and governments working in coalition to build transformative, long-term visions, and diverse solutions. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A8:B8">portfolio approach</a> enables us to create a network of experiments — for collective learning, hypothesising, testing and validating across different sites. It can reduce information asymmetries and allow different actors to share and manage risks in the real world. The catalyst for change may not come from one organisation or one single intervention. Instead, it can emerge in the form of portfolios, and networks of portfolios, owned and developed by multiple organisations invested in and committed to the same&nbsp;mission.</p> Every actor in the system can create their solutions <p>The portfolio approach brings into perspective the possibilities of a dynamic innovation mechanism, where the number of experiments multiplies by the number of actors involved, and interventions can generate positive change across different parts of the system, simultaneously. It leads to a number of critical questions as well. How can we ensure that these experiments are not carried out in silos? How can we facilitate actors to organise around shared missions? How can ownership be distributed, equitably, regardless of the power dynamics within the system? How can we create the conditions for deep system awareness, and facilitate learning between actors? These questions prompt us to think about the capacities and capabilities that could be built into the system to enable the matters of the&nbsp;“how”.</p><p>The framework for the portfolio of experiments that we designed, partly reflects these concerns:</p>Figure 6. A framework for a portfolio of experiments developed in order to identify investment gaps. Ideas from participants from the systems map workshops were mapped on to the framework.<p>In the Y axis, we categorise types of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A7:B7">experiments</a>, ranging from governance and regulatory, to financing and cultural experiments. On the X axis, capacities are defined according to scale — ranging from individual, collective, to system capacities. Instead of seeing the experiments as direct solutions to tackle the problem (a form of product innovation), this new framework prompts us to ask what the experiments can catalyse in terms of building the capacities to innovate from within the system. Does it contribute to building individual capacities — a sense of agency, awareness, ability to imagine, and collaborate? And does it contribute to our collective capacities of shared sensemaking, decision making, generating political will and legitimacy? And/or is it about building the infrastructure and mechanisms at the system level for shared accountability, shared data, knowledge, financial structures, and metrics that could help us prioritise and measure the success of our interventions?</p><p>These perspectives and questions provide a glimpse into the potentials of shifting the focus from a service/product centred innovation (emphasis on the what) to a capacity/capability centred approach (touching upon the how) where every actor in the system can innovate and build their solutions/portfolios towards long-term transitions. It also brings to attention the role of backbone organisations such as UNDP and its partners in facilitating and provoking systems change. Perhaps a first step towards this shift is cultivating and refining the methods to build deep system awareness, allowing us to explore freely, digest, validate, and socialise the complexity of the&nbsp;system.</p> Next steps <p>Moving forward, UNDP Bhutan and Gross National Happiness Commission (GNHC) will continue the process of co-creating a portfolio of experiments with relevant stakeholders in Bhutan and beyond. Experiments will be led by different actors, but with a common portfolio logic and a common framework to support collective intelligence; as well as the capacity to support continuous learning, testing and experimentation. The portfolio space aims to institute a framework where experiments, initiatives and interventions can over time coalesce, generating more intelligence, leveraging more connections, and accelerating learning and&nbsp;impact.</p><p>The portfolio logic design is a new adventure for the UNDP Bhutan team and we look forward to more learnings from the ground.

<p>For our Thursday Tech Talk on April 8th, 2021, we were joined by Tienson Qin, creator of LogSeq. LogSeq is "a privacy-first, open-source platform for knowledge sharing and management".</p><p>The first fun surprise is that Tienson used LogSeq itself for the presentation. You can <a href="https://tiensonqin.github.io/#/page/introduction%20to%20logseq">find the content on Tienson's page</a>.</p><blockquote>The long-term goal is to help children and more people to connect their thoughts with the past and the future<br><br>— <a href="https://twitter.com/tiensonqin">@TiensonQin</a></blockquote><p>LogSeq was started in February 2020. Not as a "clone" of anything, but inspired by <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki</a>, Emacs <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>, <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam Research</a>, and more.</p><p>The logo is very basic – and the community is working on some upgraded designs – but it's meant to represent footprints in the sand: the marks you make in your life, gathering and sharing knowledge.</p><p>Supports both Markdown and Org-mode formats in the browser. You don't have to learn Emacs and you can still have all of the power of Org mode.</p><p>Doesn't quite have all of the features of Org mode implemented...yet! [1]</p><p>Tienson showed us the <a href="https://web.dev/file-system-access/">File System Access API</a>: currently a Chrome only browser API that allows for reading and writing from local file systems. This means being able to mix and match editing files in Emacs, with LogSeq editing files from the browser, or any combination. </p><p>LogSeq is written in ClojureScript, plus OCaml and DataScript, because Tienson didn't have any JavaScript experience but did have lots of experience with Clojure:</p><blockquote><p>From his background <a href="https://twitter.com/tiensonqin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tiensonqin</a> didn't have JavaScript experience, but rather Clojure. So, built using ClojureScript for the front end, plus OCaml and DataScript <a href="https://t.co/CxDqz4saG6">pic.twitter.com/CxDqz4saG6</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1380321684092149761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>We got lots of demos of the query system. Uses <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript">DataScript</a> for "raw" queries, as well as some built in LogSeq query syntax. Everything is customizable by the user, and editable from directly within LogSeq itself.</p><p>Tienson is working on this full time, and has a small team of other developers working on it too. There are 111 contributors on Open Collective, and LogSeq also supports two of their downstream dependencies:</p>  <a href="https://opencollective.com/excalidraw">excalidraw</a>: a virtual whiteboard for sketching hand-drawn like diagrams  <a href="https://opencollective.com/babashka">babashka:</a> a native scripting environment for Clojure  <p>It was very inspiring to hear from Tienson. Several times he referenced sharing knowledge and making it available to his daughter, and making LogSeq open source, privacy preserving, and available for years to come.</p><blockquote><p>So awesome to hear from <a href="https://twitter.com/tiensonqin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tiensonqin</a> about his wish for his daughter and others to keep building and sharing knowledge graphs and between all PKM tools. <a href="https://t.co/EX93tMsv6f">pic.twitter.com/EX93tMsv6f</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1380324467512012800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>As part of the final wrap up, a LogSeq user Hilary mainly just wanted to say thanks to Tienson, which was awesome to hear:</p><blockquote>No questions here, I just wanted to say that I’ve been using logseq for a while now and I love it - I’m not much of a developer, just a normal user keeping track of a lot of meetings, tasks, notes, and writing projects for work - and wanted to say thanks, Tienson, you are doing an awesome job.</blockquote><p>We're definitely interested in seeing if we can add Fission webnative support for LogSeq, so that files can be synced and optionally encrypted, without having to have a Github account.</p> Resources   Use the app right in your browser <a href="https://logseq.com">logseq.com</a>  Visit the documentation <a href="https://logseq.github.io">logseq.github.io</a>, especially the <a href="https://logseq.github.io/#/page/new%20to%20logseq%3F">New to LogSeq</a> section  Source code in <a href="https://github.com/logseq/logseq">Github logseq/logseq</a>, including <a href="https://github.com/logseq/logseq/releases">releases of the desktop Electron app</a>  Feature requests and forum discussion <a href="https://discuss.logseq.com/">discuss.logseq.com</a>  Sponsor on <a href="https://opencollective.com/logseq">OpenCollective</a>  Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/KpN4eHY">Discord chat</a>  Follow the project on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/logseq">@LogSeq</a> and Tienson <a href="https://twitter.com/tiensonqin">@tiensonqin</a>  <p>[1] We had some discussion live around how long Emacs has been around. 1976 was when Emacs created, Emacs Lisp came along in 1985, and Org mode <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/History-and-Acknowledgments.html">started relatively recently in 2003 "out of frustration over the user interface of the Emacs Outline mode"</a>.</p> <p>Sign up for more Thursday Tech Talks like this one on the <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">Fission events page »</a></p>

 À la suite d’un piratage, les conséquences peuvent être dramatiques… Sécuriser efficacement son site web sans non plus devenir « parano » est donc essentiel. D’autant plus au travers du contexte sanitaire actuel, où le nombre d’entreprises évoluant vers la digitalisation augmente de jour en jour. Ce phénomène induit par conséquent une croissance considérable des risques de piratage.

				 <p>Selon une étude menée par OWASP, l’une des failles de sécurité les plus importantes aujourd’hui (classée en deuxième position) est la mauvaise sécurisation des accès administrateurs et utilisateurs. En parallèle et grâce à PT Security, on sait aujourd’hui que les hackers peuvent prendre le contrôle de 9 sites sur 10 analysés en passant pas les accès utilisateurs, et peut-être que le vôtre en fait partie.</p>
<p>L’objectif de ce Webinar est tout d’abord de vous faire prendre conscience des risques encourus à cause de quelques maladresses, et de vous montrer comment sécuriser simplement vos accès administrateurs et utilisateurs afin de garder une longueur-d’avance sur les cyber-attaquants.</p>

          <p>FIDUCIA NELLA RACCOLTA&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>BLOKCHAIN PER LA RACCOLTA DEI RIFIUTI</p> <p>IL TRACCIAMENTO DEI RIFIUTI ATTRAVERSO LA BLOCKCHAIN</p>  <p><br>La tecnologia Blockchain può efficacemente essere impiegata per&nbsp; tracciare in modo certificato la raccolta, il trasporto e lo smaltimento di rifiuti.</p><p>In questo processo sono considerate le fasi che partono dall’immissione dell’ordine, di lavoro notarizzandone la conformità ed evitando la corruttibilità, attraverso l’utilizzo di un servizio che la tecnologia Blockchain fornisce nativamente: gli Smart Contract.</p><p>Attraverso l'utilizzo di&nbsp; Smart Contract, &nbsp;si va a verificare la congruenza del dato inserito ad ogni passaggio dell’attività eseguendo dei controlli specifici, caso per caso, e garantendo incorruttibilità ed eliminando ogni rischio di contraffazione e anomalia.</p><p><br>TRASPARENZA DELLA GESTIONE RIFIUTI ATTRAVERSO LA PIATTAFORMA<br>BLOKI</p>  <p><br>GESTIONE RIFIUTI 4.0</p><p>Il Digitale fornisce ormai da tempo nuovi strumenti per le imprese, dove la tecnologia e la digitalizzazione dei processi hanno portato&nbsp; novità incredibili per migliorare la gestione rifiuti.</p><p>Termini come Blockchain, IOT, Machine Learning e ‘Intelligenza Artificiale‘ sono sempre più utilizzate nel settore dei rifiuti. Queste tecnologie &nbsp;saranno sempre più presenti in futuro garantendo migliori prestazioni dell’organizzazione e performance più efficaci in ogni passaggio della gestione del rifiuto, a partire dalla profilazione iniziale di una nuova attività &nbsp;fino alla gestione della tariffazione puntuale. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Affidarsi alla Blockchain è un passaggio chiave; integrata con i sistemi gestionali permette di certificare e rendere disponibili, in modo non alterabile, dati, informazioni, tempistiche e processi. Permette prestazioni più veloci, minori costi di trattamento e più sicurezza e garanzia di sostenibilità e conformità.</p><p>Analizziamo un caso specifico. Il D.lgs. n. 22/1997 (cosiddetto decreto Ronchi) e successivamente il D.lgs. n.152/2006 hanno introdotto 3 strumenti fondamentali:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>· il Formulario di Identificazione dei Rifiuti (FIR)</p><p>· il Registro di Carico e Scarico dei Rifiuti</p><p>· il Modello Unico di Dichiarazione ambientale (MUD)</p><p>La scelta di utilizzare Bloki integrato nella piattaforma gestionale per certificare dati relativi ai processi interni di trattamento rifiuti è quindi motivata dalla possibilità di avere l’archiviazione e l’accesso certificato ai documenti sopra citati direttamente sulla Blockchain. Oltre questo, ogni singola operazione sarà dotata di marca temporale precisa ed immutabile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LA PIATTAFORMA &nbsp;BLOKI</p><p>VANTAGGI</p>  La piattaforma introduce diversi vantaggi per gli operatori:  &nbsp;presenza di backup delle informazioni che non è legato alla propria struttura di archiviazione, ma che si trova Bloki,&nbsp; un registro distribuito su diversi nodi (server)&nbsp;facilità nelle verifiche da parte di auditor o enti di controllo, che potranno reperire le informazioni relative ai trattamenti dell’Azienda direttamente dalla Blockchain BLOKI, grazie alle caratteristiche di immutabilità e incensurabilità delle informazioni inserite  miglioramento dell’immagine e della reputation aziendale trasmettendo una maggior fiducia, data dalla scelta di potere condividere le proprie informazioni in un modo totalmente trasparente    <p><br>TIPOLOGIE DI RIFIUTI</p><p>Grazie alla propria flessibilità, &nbsp;BLOKI &nbsp;riesce a gestire ogni &nbsp;tipologia di rifiuto e di processo. Il Tracciamento Certificato dei Rifiuti prevede che BLOKI supporti le fasi operative che possono essere schematizzate come di seguito:</p> <p>Ricezione della richiesta attività e apertura task<br>Definizione e Apposizione identificativo lotto<br>Certificazione delle varie fasi di passaggio del Task<br>Chiusura del Task</p>

 Hidden in Plain Sight — the Transformational Potential of Personal&nbsp;Data <p>This is the sixth and final in a series of blogs which provide edited extracts of key points made by Mydex CIC in its response to the UK Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">consultation around a new National Data Strategy</a>.</p><p>This blog focuses on the scale of the economic (and social) opportunity — and why it is often overlooked.</p><p>Previous blogs focused on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">how to unleash the full potential of personal data</a>, why <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/transforming-the-system-a-roadmap-for-practical-implementation-411e8821ed19">how to achieve these changes at scale</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/misconceptions-that-kill-progress-in-personal-data-4736b1d883c6">common misconceptions that derail progress</a> and a review of the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/not-just-personal-data-stores-f2070eada6be">key components needed for the overall ecosystem to&nbsp;work</a>.</p><p>To catch up on progress on our Macmillan My Data Store Pilot <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>It’s odd to the point of bizarre, but it’s true. Today, there is endless hype about the enormous economic potential of data. That is why the UK Government is developing a National Data Strategy. Yet most debate (and therefore decision-making) about it demonstrates a deep misunderstanding of where this value lies and how it can be unleashed. For a National Data Strategy to be successful, it has to get its underlying economic logic&nbsp;right.</p> Cost plus versus cost&nbsp;out <p>Currently, nearly every Government proposal and policy relating to data (including personal data) treats data as a corporate asset that the organisation has invested in. The organisation therefore needs to earn a return on this investment (it is assumed). Like any other product, data needs to be sold (or rented) for a margin. The entire focus is on measuring and the potential size of ‘the market for data’, the supposed value of different bits of data in this market, and how to enable this market to work better. It’s all about <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-curse-of-monetisation-c636da32ef08">monetisation of&nbsp;data</a>.</p><p>At first glance, this seems logical. After all, if organisations have invested a lot of time and money creating data assets, it’s only sensible that they should find a way to cover these costs. What this misses, however, is the opportunity to take cost out of the system as a whole — to move it to a different cost baseline — where new ways of sharing and using data pay for themselves many times over without anyone having the need to sell or ‘monetise’ anything.</p><p>Henry Ford’s mass production moving assembly line is a good example of the immense opportunities opened up by such system-wide ‘cost out’ approaches.</p><p>Before the moving assembly line, cars were extraordinarily expensive items, made painstakingly by craftspeople who made each component separately. Because each component was hand made and therefore slightly different, to assemble them into a working machine, they had to re-work every component to make it&nbsp;fit.</p><p>This required exquisite skill. The ability to do it well was a key source of the craftsperson’s added value. But it was also incredibly expensive. By relying on standardised components, Ford’s production lines eliminated the need for this rework. And by bringing each component to the worker when they needed it, his moving assembly line eliminated unnecessary time spent searching for, travelling to, or waiting for parts to arrive — thus reducing another layer of effort and speeding up&nbsp;outputs.</p><p>When Henry Ford first experimented with his ‘cost out’ moving assembly line, people were astonished by the efficiency gains it delivered. Before the experiment, it took 29 workers 15 minutes to make a magneto (which helps start ignition). After the experiment it took 14 workers 5 minutes: an 85% leap in productivity. Similar productivity gains followed as he applied the same methods to the rest of the car. Car output soared from 68,773 in 1912 to 735,020 in 1917. The price of his cars fell by 90%. Nobody had seen just how much waste was embedded into how the old system worked. The waste was previously invisible to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Given the extensive pollution, congestion and occasional carnage caused by the motor car, many people might say it ended up being more of a curse than a blessing. But we are not talking about the merits of the car itself here. We are talking about economic principles that powered an entire industrial revolution.</p><p>The moving assembly line eliminated huge amounts of waste that were embedded into every sinew of how the previous system worked: the waste caused by the need to rework every component and by poor logistics which meant that the right things could not get to the right people at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>Personal data stores apply the same economic logic to transform the costs of producing data driven services. <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">Verified attributes</a> are the digital equivalents of Henry Ford’s standardised parts. By enabling one organisation to instantly re-use data verified by another organisation they eliminate the need for vast amounts of duplicated effort and rework (re-creating each data point from scratch or checking its details, provenance etc).</p><p>And by enabling individuals to hold these verified attributes in readiness, and to share them safely and efficiently with service providers when they need to be used, personal data stores act as data logistics engines bringing the right data components to the right places at the right time (the equivalent of Henry Ford’s moving assembly&nbsp;line).</p><p>Our early experiments are showing similar efficiency and productivity gains to those realised by Henry Ford. There is now an opportunity to create order of magnitude reductions in the costs of providing data-driven services (initially in the public sector). Just to be clear: by order of magnitude reductions in costs, we don’t mean five or even ten per cent here or there but a complete system that is five or ten times more efficient.</p> When dogs don’t&nbsp;bark <p>In one of his famous detective stories Sherlock Holmes notices something crucial that no one else had: he notices something that hadn’t happened.</p><p>Humans are hard-wired to notice things that happen. But it’s very difficult to become aware of things that are not happening — things that could or should be happening but&nbsp;aren’t.</p><p>This happened with the motor car. Before Henry Ford’s revolution, the idea that owning and using a motor car would become a mass market open to ordinary people was literally laughable — when Ford suggested it was possible, people laughed at him. They said there was no demand for it. They were right. But the reason why there was ‘no demand’ was because cars were prohibitively expensive. The dog wasn’t barking. People weren’t noticing something that wasn’t happening: making cars affordable.</p><p>When Ford made his breakthrough, the dog started barking. Instead of being an exclusive, privileged plaything of the very rich, motorised mobility was democratised. Result? Society was transformed as people started driving to work, to shops, to leisure destinations and to new homes in newly created suburbs. The 20th century mass ‘consumer / car economy’ was built on this breakthrough.</p><p>Online search is another example. Before Google, very few people conducted searches for information because doing so was so prohibitively expensive in terms of time and effort. Another non-barking dog. Then Google made search very easy, and now most people conduct searches dozens of times a day, spawning a vast new market apparently out of thin&nbsp;air.</p><p>Waking the data&nbsp;dog</p><p>Today, it’s commonly said that individuals don’t want to manage their data. “There is no demand for it,” we are told again and again. But that’s because, under the current system, it’s prohibitively expensive in terms of time and effort to do so. How many people want to invest precious time, effort (and sometimes money) finding, collecting and presenting the information they need to get stuff done: filling in forms; proving facts about themselves; trying to join the dots created by organisations that work in isolated silos? No wonder they do it as little as possible. Until the opportunity to do things differently is presented to them, helping people handle their data better remains another non-barking dog.</p><p>By applying those same principles of standardised parts and improved logistics — by waking that dog — personal data stores have the potential to democratise how society uses personal data, spreading the benefits to every citizen. Just like ‘the great car economy’, the way services are created and delivered will be transformed while making new ones possible — services that enable citizens to use their data to organise and manage their lives much better, to make and implement better decisions and to undertake associated administration across every aspect of their lives (money, home, education and career, travel, leisure etc)&nbsp;… all at a fraction of the previous cost and effort currently involved.</p><p>Everything we’ve written in our last five blogs has been focused on waking the 21st century dog of low cost, high quality, mass produced, privacy protecting, personalised, data driven services. Yet, time and time again we are told ‘there is no demand’ for a new personal data logistics infrastructure that empowers citizens with their data, just as Ford empowered citizens with mobility.</p><p>Why is this? Because they haven’t noticed that the dog is not barking. Their attention is focused on the current system as it is, not what it could be. They are simply not seeing the huge amounts of waste embedded in its workings (or if they do, they undertake ‘red tape reduction’ initiatives that reproduce the very causes of that waste) because they are not looking at the connections between the parts, only at how to improve the efficiency of each part in splendid isolation. They have not learned the lessons of mass production.</p> A positive feedback&nbsp;loop <p>All the really big service and quality of life breakthroughs of the past 100 years — including the provision of universal running water, sewerage, electricity, education and health services — have two things in common. First, they were first and foremost infrastructure projects, making something essential universally available at low cost. Second, they directly improved individuals’ lives and, at the same time, they also improved society’s health and resilience and the efficiency and productivity of the economy as a whole. They combined personal and public&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>Providing every citizen with their own personal data store — another case of universal service provision — follows this pattern. The way it achieves this combined benefit is order-of-magnitude reductions in the friction, effort, risks and costs individuals and service providers incur when attempting to collect, store, share and use personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>In a post-Covid world trying hard to ‘build back better’ the need for infrastructure that enables verified data about people to be shared while protecting their privacy has never been more apparent. Government today has a once in a generation opportunity to do something truly transformative and rebuild in a way that benefits everyone. This is what the National Strategy for Personal Data can and should be aiming&nbsp;for.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-transformational-potential-of-personal-data-da47f666713e">Hidden in Plain Sight — the Transformational Potential of Personal Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

         FIDUCIA NEI RIFIUTI<br><br>  &nbsp;  Certezza dei&nbsp;processi&nbsp;dichiarati  &nbsp;   SMALTIMENTO  La registrazione in Blockchain&nbsp;Bloki&nbsp;del corretto protocollo per lo smaltimento&nbsp; dei rifiuti edili, passando dal corretto trasporto al centro di raccolta e smaltimento autorizzato al formulario di identificazione dei rifiuti.  ​    &nbsp;  PROGETTO  I Processi di progettazione, autorizzativi, realizzativi, di collaudo, di agibilità ecc possono essere certificati&nbsp; in modo aggregato&nbsp; e condivisi secondo le diverse competenze (Società imprese, progettisti, uffici, collaudatori) in maniera brillante dalla Blockchain e dagli&nbsp;Smarct Contract di Bloki. <br>   &nbsp;  MATERIALI  La provenienza e &nbsp;la qualità dei materiali usati.  Per ogni tipologia di materiale la sua specifica disciplina e qualificazione, e il possesso del benestare di tutte le conformità e l'idoneità tecniche. Il tutto registrato in Blockchain&nbsp;Bloki&nbsp;in modalità sicura, marcata temporalmente e di&nbsp; facile e semplice accessibilità.  Tutti i materiali possono essere tracciati e rintracciati dal momento della produzione fino alla consegna finale in cantiere. Ciò significa che un documento di dati non manipolabile verrebbe memorizzato e gestito per l’intero ciclo di vita del materiale, caratterizzando&nbsp; una profonda trasparenza <br>   &nbsp;  COSTRUZIONE  anche la fase di costruzione è caratterizzata da questa continua &nbsp;registrazione non manipolabile che concatenata a tutte le altre registrazioni crea un'unica transazione e una catena di valore, che oltre al valore della fiducia passa anche attraverso al valore economico. Uno su tutti il tracciamento dei prodotti di scarto&nbsp;&nbsp;che nell’edilizia costituisce un problema&nbsp; sia economico che ambientale. Una gestione tramite blockchain&nbsp;Bloki&nbsp;, lungo tutto il ciclo di vita, creerebbe un registro dei residui che potrebbero essere riutilizzati. Efficienza questa gemellata dalla responsabilità della persona impiegata all'uso dei materiali <br>   &nbsp;  VENDITA  Infine se la fiducia intesa come valore viene collegata al concetto di catena – tale da creare una cosiddetta catena della fiducia – si ottiene quella realtà (e quindi non più aspettativa) – sempre sotto il controllo delle parti che concorrono a una transazione – che prende il nome di catena del valore. <br>CONCLUSIONELe caratteristiche tecniche e funzionali delle Blockchain si calano positivamente nel settore delle costruzioni e delle manutenzioni degli immobili e delle opere immobiliari.I Processi di progettazione, autorizzativi, realizzativi, di collaudo, di agibilità ecc possono essere certificati&nbsp; in modo aggregato&nbsp; e condivisi secondo le diverse competenze (Società imprese, progettisti, uffici, collaudatori) in maniera brillante dalla Blockchain e dagli Smarct Contract di Bloki.Dal momento in cui l’opera è ‘pensata’ al momento in cui comincia a essere utilizzata e anche successivamente durante la vita utile (manutenzioni correttive e preventive),&nbsp; la Blockchain Bloki è in grado di certificare dati, informazioni e processi in modalità sicura, marcata temporalmente, semplice e accessibile.I. A. E.INTELLIGENZA ARTIFICIALE EDILE      VANTAGGII vantaggi di&nbsp;Bloki&nbsp;per chi progetta e costruisce, per&nbsp; gli uffici competenti e per i proprietari e locatari sono notevoli:• Risparmio dei costi<br>• Migliore qualità delle opere<br>• Ottimizzazione delle informazioni e dei processi<br>• Verificabilità e tracciabilità<br>• Supporto alla Responsabilizzazione, alla Compliance e al Tracciamento delle vicende giuridiche, finanziarie e urbanistiche degli immobili, in particolare di quelli interessati da vicende giudiziarie.&nbsp;

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is exploring a digital euro. Early October 2020, the ECB Governing Council released a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/Report_on_a_digital_euro~4d7268b458.en.pdf" title="whitepaper">whitepaper</a> discussing its initial research on such a project. One of the ECB’s clearest and most repeated messages is that a digital euro will not replace cash, but complement it. A digital euro is meant to facilitate electronic payments, while cash would remain a valid form of payment and the primary form of value storage.</p>
 The European Central Bank’s Exploration of a Digital Euro 
<p>This exploratory paper comes as a direct result of a digitalized economy whose momentum is ever growing because of new technologies, <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb80303/psd2-new-business-opportunities-and-risks/" title="legislation">legislation</a> meant to increase the competitiveness of digital competitors, and traction that digital currency projects are gaining around the world. Despite the changing world, and the changing needs and expectations of individuals, businesses, and other economic actors, a digital euro is not meant to upend the current monetary system. The paper is a painstakingly methodical exploration of how-to architect, legislate, and standardize a digital euro to maintain financial stability and preserve the ECB’s capacity to influence monetary policy.</p>
<p>The paper itself is a proactive effort from the ECB, dedicating time and resources towards determining the opportunities, risks, and costs of adopting a digital euro. This is also apparent in the scenarios that would motivate the ECB to pursue a digital euro project, the majority of them being a proactive step to maintaining competitiveness, improving efficiencies, and increase the stability of the monetary system.</p>
<p></p>




<p>Scenario</p>


<p>Proactive</p>


<p>Reactive</p>




<p>A digital euro would foster the digitalization of the European economy</p>


<p>x</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Decline of cash payments</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>x</p>




<p>A different form of money – digital currencies issued by other central banks, decentralized organizations, or private companies – becomes a credible alternative to the euro</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>x</p>




<p>A digital euro would be necessary or beneficial to strengthen European monetary policy</p>


<p>x</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>If a digital euro would mitigate the negative effects that a cyber incident, natural disaster, or other extreme event would have on payment services</p>


<p>x</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Adopting a digital euro causes the euro to gain international relevance</p>


<p>x</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Adopting a digital euro improves overall costs and ecological footprint of monetary and payment systems</p>


<p>x</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a charitable view of the ECB, whose digital euro project is still in the proof-of-concept stage with the decision whether to formally launch it being made earliest in mid-2021. This means that in the time it will take to methodically prepare a digital euro project – as it should, this is not a project to leap into lightly – the ECB may fall into a reactive position, as cash payments continue to decline and other currency options become more prominent and potentially challenge the euro.</p>
 The New Way to Exchange Value 
<p>The ECB whitepaper explores the possible architectures that a digital euro could be built on, letting the decision be shaped by solution requirements such as privacy, user access to the digital currency, or protecting its use for payments rather than investment. The architecture question will be the focus of the ECB’s future research, though we can predict that it will likely follow a centralized infrastructure with access facilitated by supervised intermediary banks. Decentralized architectures are part of the conversation, but options such as distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are relatively untested to the scale that the ECB would require and pose higher risks to the stability and security of the Eurosystem. The overall risk-adverse tone of the report and self-determined requirements that the back-end infrastructure of any digital euro project should be controlled by the central bank indicates a preference for known and/or centralized solutions, though many of the active central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects around the world are working with DLTs.</p>
<p>The interest the ECB is showing for alternative payment methods indicates two things: that the ECB has a desire to be a leader in shaping the future of payments, and that their decision whether or not to pursue a digital euro will have a strong influence on the emerging use cases for the digital exchange of value between parties. This is not simply a digital payment, but the digital exchange of a request accompanied by trusted identity, resulting in the receipt of value. For example, the user of a carsharing service unlocks the car door with a one-time key issued to their mobile app. Or a hotel booking automatically issues room keys and admission to the building upon payment. Or the owner of an electric vehicle agrees to sell back reserve power to the grid. These are use cases where a digital transaction does not end with the successful transfer of money, but where payment is the trigger for the exchange of value, making the transaction a two-way process.</p>
 Decentralized: How and Why? 
<p>The next months will be an interesting time of research and inquiry: Which of the global CBDC projects will succeed, and will it become the standard architecture of digital currencies? Will CBDCs be able to fulfill the future of two-way digital transactions to exchange value? Or is it only possible if they operate on a decentralized architecture? And how will the ECB’s goal of preserving the intermediary roles of banks in monetary system interplay decentralized payment systems, whose major outcome is to disintermediate?</p>
<p>We believe the future of payments and the exchange of value will be use-case driven. Grassroots solutions will emerge for particular use cases like carsharing to fill the time until major institutions develop their proposals and standards. There will be stiff competition to establish the platforms, architectures, and methods that gather a critical mass. And we will continually be surprised at the new use cases for the digital exchange of value.</p>
<p>Stay up to date on CBDC and the future of value exchange with our research, and join the conversation at our events.</p>

				 <p>Il est essentiel de connaître la solution Unikname Connect pour en parler et la recommander, ça va de soit non ? Pour rejoindre le programme Open, vous devez tout d’abord,&nbsp;être client Unikname et donc utilisateur de la solution !</p>
<p>L’objectif derrière cet engagement, est d’embarquer le partenaire dans l’ensemble du processus de <a href="https://account.connect.unikname.com%20">création de compte Unikname</a> et de ce que ça implique. Pour recommander un service ou un produit, il est préconisé de l’utiliser afin d’avoir la légitimité d’en parler…</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>Pas besoin de dépenser une somme mirobolante évidemment ! Commencez par sécuriser 1 site web (+ 1 offre) en souscrivant à <a href="https://www.unikname.com/tarifs/">l’abonnement One Web,</a> à partir de 150 € HT / an, soit 12,50 € par mois pour protégez vos comptes administrateurs contre le piratage. Et si vous faîtes le calcul, votre abonnement peut vite être rentabilité avec votre rétrocession !</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Par où commencer ?  
			   
				
				
				 <p>À la suite de votre inscription sur le site <a href="http://www.unikname.com">www.unikname.com</a>. qui vous permet de sécuriser vos accès web, notre relation de partenariat peut débuter ! Il vous suffit de rendre visible la solution Unikname de la manière dont vous le souhaitez et qui vous semble la plus pertinente vis-à-vis de votre communauté. Elle peut se présenter sous la forme d’un article de <a href="https://www.unikname.com/blog/">blog</a>, une page web, un Webinar, une bannière publicitaire ou encore des postes sur les réseaux sociaux par exemple.</p>
<p>Afin que Unikname identifie la source des abonnements que vous avez généré, vous devrez utiliser votre lien d’affiliation au sein des supports sur lesquels vous communiquez, et le tour est joué !</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Pourquoi rejoindre le programme Open ?  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Rejoindre<a href="https://www.unikname.com/programmes-partenaires/devenir-partenaire-open/"> le programme d’affiliation Open</a>, c’est gagner de l’argent facilement ! Faire partie de notre réseau de partenaires c’est :</p>

				  Programme Partenaire Alliance

				  Gagnez 33% de commission sur vos ventes  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Contrairement à l’offre d’affiliation Open, <a href="https://www.unikname.com/programmes-partenaires/programme-partenaire-alliance-unikname/">le Programme Partenaire Alliance</a> implique plus de responsabilités mais contient plus d’avantages !</p>
<p>Idem que le précédent programme, vous êtes invité à mettre en avant la solution Unikname Connect en la recommandant, mais vous pouvez aussi l’imbriquer dans votre offre, l’occasion de booster et compléter votre offre de services. Pour l’ensemble des ventes réalisé sur l’abonnement One Web, récupérez 33% de rétrocession, soit 50 € par abonnement dans votre poche !</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Un partenariat gagnant-gagnant  
			   
				
				
				  L’engagement de Unikname  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Dans une dynamique de réussite, Unikname s’engage à fournir l’ensemble des éléments nécessaires à la présentation de la solution. Il s’agit d’un kit partenaire, un pack clé-en-main composé de supports marketing, commerciaux et de la documentation technique accessibles depuis le dashboard Unikname.</p>
<p>Du contenu et des outils pour réussir c’est bien, mais avant de se lancer dans le grand bain, l’équipe Unikname de tient à votre disposition pour vous accompagner lors des premiers échanges clients si besoin.</p>
<p>Évidemment, la visibilté de la marque fonctionne dans les deux sens ! Une page complète répertoriée dans la catégorie des partenaires certifiés est comprise, permettant ainsi de valoriser vos services et votre domaine de compétences. Les actions promotionnelles telles que les postes sur les réseaux ou la co-animation de Webinars peuvent être envirsagées.</p>
<p>Pour plus de proximité, un channel dédié et exclusif entre les équipes Unikname et le partenaire est alors à disposition. Une question d’ordre technique, conseil, bonne pratique ou autre demande sont les bienvenus ! Le canal idéal pour partager avec le réseau partenaires des informations en avant-première !</p> 
			   
				
				
				  L’engagement du Partenaire Alliance  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>La mission du Partenaire est de prendre en charge l’intégration – la formation – le support et le maintien de la solution Unikname Connect chez son client. Et oui, rejoindre le Programme Alliance c’est devenir Partenaire Intégrateur Certifié Unikname. Vous êtes donc autonome dans la gestion du projet de A à Z !</p>
<p>Identique au Programme Open, vous devez au préalable être &nbsp;utilisateur de la solution Unikname, et l’utiliser sur vos propres environnements. Vous êtes libre de prendre l’abonnement qui vous convient le mieux, même si nous vous recommandons de souscrire au Pack Agency, qui vous permet de <a href="https://www.unikname.com/agences-web-securite-compte-administrateur/">gérer les sites ou applicatons web de vos clients</a>. À vous de voir !</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>L’une des caractéristiques de ce partenariat est que vous contribuez à <a href="https://help.unikname.com/5-security/securing-the-uns-network.html">la sécurisation du réseau UNS Network </a>! Pour rappel, la solution d’authentification Unikname repose sur la technologie de la blockchain UNS Network, maintenue aujourd’hui par 23 délégués.&nbsp;Contribuer à la sécurité de ce système consiste finalement à mettre à disposition une partie de l’un de vos serveurs au réseau. Pour en savoir plus sur vos implications, contactez nos équipes à <a href="mailto:emarketing@unikname.com">emarketing@unikname.com</a></p>
<p>C’est aussi une bonne manière d’intégrer la communauté active des utilisateurs de la solution et de participer à l’évolution du produit.</p> 
			   
				
				
				  Absorbez votre abonnement Unikname dès la première vente !  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Vendre des abonnements Unikname c’est bien, mais vous pouvez aller encore plus loin et gonfler vos revenus aisément. Quelques exemples de services sur lesquels vous pouvez facturer votre client final :</p> 
			   
				
				
				  Intégration et Maintenance  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Partons du principe que dans le deal convenu entre vous et votre client soit compris la maintenance du site web. Saisissez cette opportunité en proposant à votre client un complément de service : la gestion et la maintenance de la solution Unikname.</p> 
			   
				
				
				  Formation des équipes  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Autre contexte, imaginons que vous travaillez sur un projet interne à une organisation au travers duquel de nombreuses personnes vont être amenées à utiliser un identifiant Unikname. Vous pouvez dans ce cas, organiser une session de formation auprès des futures équipes utilisatrices ! Même si la solution est simple à prendre en main, présenter l’intérêt de la solution Unikname Connect et accompagner les utilisateurs dans cette transition est parfois utile. Alors n’hésitez pas !</p> 
			   
				
				
				  Design de la page de connexion  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Voici un autre exemple pour gagner de l’argent facilement ! Vous êtes une agence web avec des compétences graphiques et votre client souhaite installer Unikname sur son interface web ou sa boutique en ligne. Proposez dans ce cas là, la personnalisation graphique de l’espace de connexion aux couleurs de l’entreprise. Vous avez également le possibilité d’animer cette page au gré des saisons, comme Unikname tente de le faire sur sa propre interface de connexion.</p> 
			   
				
				
				  Développement de vos propres extensions  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Vous êtes un éditeur de logiciel ou une agence web évoluant sur des environnements techniques différents en fonction des besoins de vos clients. Dans le cadre d’une demande client ou de votre propre intérêt, vous pouvez développer l’extention qui permet d’implémenter Unikname sur un environnement sur lequel la solution n’est pas encore disponible ! L’occasion d’en tirer exclusivement des revenus et d’élargir le périmètre d’utilisation de la solution.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Comment devenir partenaire ?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Microsoft announced on April 5, 2020 that its Azure AD Verifiable Credentials is now in public preview. This solution enables organizations to design and issue verifiable credentials to their users, be it enterprises issuing employment credentials to their employees, universities enrolling students or issuing diplomas, governments issuing passports, ID cards, and countless other uses. This is an exciting step to meaningfully give agency back to individuals to securely hold and exchange their identity data online and in the physical world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/" title="Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> are a critical technological component to Microsoft’s solution. While there are many DID protocols, the viability of such an ambitious decentralized identity project required a scalable, independent and decentralized network. ION is the result. ION is an open source, public, and permissionless network that underpins Microsoft’s decentralized identity projects. ION is a <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an80301/demystifying-the-blockchain-what-makes-a-blockchain-useful-to-a-firm/" title="sidetree">sidetree</a> on Bitcoin mainnet, enabling anyone to generate and anchor DIDs in the public preview of Azure AD Verifiable Credentials. ION was designed by Microsoft team members in collaboration with members of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and from Transmute, SecureKey, Mattr, Consensys, and others.</p>
 From Concept to Adoption 
<p>The concept to use decentralized solutions for issuing, holding, and exchanging identity data has been viable for about 5 years now. We have seen proof of concepts, short term projects, pitches, and customers beginning to adopt working decentralized identity solutions. These have mostly been user-facing, targeting the general public with self-sovereign wallets to hold credentials, onboard their own credentials, and exchange in peer-to-peer networks. These products functioned, but stagnated without the ability to use these credentials to access many different types of services. But in the last year, momentum has picked up for solutions designed for enterprise usage to address IAM needs. And these products, Microsoft's own included, have matured to the point that widespread adoption just might be on the horizon.</p>
<p>There were many roadblocks that prevented mass adoption, and we are interested to see if Azure AD's Verifiable Credentials will dismantle them.</p>
 
 Integrations with directory services and authentication sources must be part of a solution. These are integral parts to an enterprise's IAM architecture, and even if an identity credential is held by an individual, it must be able to interoperate with the system. 
 Easy adoption in widely used systems: decentralized identity started out as a solution to be adopted based on moral principle. To reach mass adoption, it must be chosen by enterprises and organizations of all types not because it is philosophically admirable, <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/bc80050/decentralized-identity/" title="but because it makes sense">but because it makes sense</a>. While the security and privacy benefits for the individual are very clear, it must have connectors to widely used systems across many sectors. 
 Common standards must be used to create compatibility between different systems. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/" title="Verifiable Credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> are both foundational standards that enable decentralized identity solutions to remain independent of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority, and still be sharable in a trustworthy fashion. DIDComm is another emerging standard to watch out for. Read this <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80064/decentralized-identity-blockchain-id-self-sovereign-identity-solutions/" title="Market Compass">Market Compass</a> for more information on the decentralized identity space. 
 Use for employee credential issuance as well as consumer: CIAM evolved out of IAM. If enterprises begin using decentralized identity solutions for their employees and partners, there will likely be a natural overflow to CIAM if those solutions are successful. Issuing credentials for an enterprise's own use within its own ecosystem is also a less overwhelming scenario (although issuing credentials to consumers may end up being a very similar process with decentralized solutions). Additionally, employee mobility and completing remote onboarding of new employees are very compelling use cases that can lower risk and expense for enterprises. 
 The link to <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80521/providers-of-verified-identity/" title="identity verification">identity verification</a> is essential for mass adoption. The only way an enterprise can trust a credential that is issued by an unknown issuer, which the user holds on their own device, is if there is an additional verification. On top of the cryptographic verifications that accompany decentralized identity solutions, incorporating identity verification into decentralized identity solutions is a powerful way to verify in real time that the holder of a credential is indeed the one being described in the credential. 
 
 Is Mass Adoption Possible Now<a></a>? 
<p>The chances are better now than they have ever been. It's been a long journey since blockchain first became a buzzword, but it has evolved and matured into an entirely different beast, one where blockchain is still present but does not feature proximately.</p>
<p>Enterprises are also not alone when first dipping their toes into the decentralized identity space. The appeal of using a decentralized identity solution that is already compatible with existing infrastructure – Azure AD and Microsoft Authenticator, for example – is not insignificant. Microsoft is putting together a partner ecosystem of identity verification providers that give global functionality. And the list of customer references shows viability in education, health, and government sectors around the world.</p>
<p>The chances for mass adoption are higher because the use cases are more relevant, the solutions more mature, and the foundational pieces – such as identity verification – are being established. 2021 will be a decisive year for decentralized identity, perhaps for the better.</p>

<p>The last four months have gone by in a flash and the token migration that began on the 8th of December 2020 is now complete. As can be seen on <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xe5dada80aa6477e85d09747f2842f7993d0df71c?a=0x0cf75f808479c9e7d61c78f65e997b605160b0aa">Etherscan</a>, almost 963 million ERC20 tokens have been sent to the vault address. As per our <a href="https://www.dock.io/token?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=dock-token-migration-is-now-complete">token release schedule</a>, 150M of these tokens will be released as emission rewards for validators on the Dock mainnet, and to fund the treasury, during the life of the network. This will put the circulating supply of Dock’s mainnet token at <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/explorer">circa 850M</a>. </p><p>In summary, a total of 962.8M tokens (of the 1B total supply) have been migrated which equates to 96.28% of all tokens. </p><p>Exchanges were heavily involved at different stages of the migration. &nbsp;At the time of writing Dock mainnet token trading is facilitated on:</p>  Binance  Gate  Huobi  Kucoin  HotBit  <p>Now what?</p><p>With the significant milestone of the migration now complete, the network and the entire Dock ecosystem can start to benefit from the tokens utility, and of course the significantly reduced and stable fees afforded by the Dock blockchain. As a point of interest, transfers on Dock start at 2.07 tokens, increasing for larger amounts. </p><p>As a reminder, Dock’s mainnet token plays a key role in the network, it provides:</p>  An integrated payment mechanism for performing network operations including: the creation of decentralized identities (DIDs), issuing credentials, creating schemas and more.  Emission rewards for validators who provide their resources to the network by producing blocks and confirming transactions.  Decentralized governance, as detailed in our earlier <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-future-in-decentralized-governance/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=dock-token-migration-is-now-complete">post on governance</a>, DOCK will be utilized to manage changes to the network. How the mainnet is run and by whom will be decided on by voting, and Dock tokens will be the mechanism by which members of the network will vote. This functionality will become more apparent as Dock moves to Proof of Stake later this quarter.  <p>Wallets and explorers</p><p>Moving to Dock’s own blockchain has of course required the community to switch to using new wallets. The current solutions are available <a href="https://docs.dock.io/help-center/help-center/wallets-and-account-creation">here</a> as are instructions on how to set each wallet up. The Dock team have also raised a pull request with hardware wallet <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger</a> and have spoken with their integrations team. As soon as the request has been reviewed and merged, the Ledger Nano S will support DOCK. It is worth noting that discussions with their integration team have revealed that due to a high workload it could be a few months before they support DOCK. </p><p>Another change for the community has been the switch to the Polkadot-based <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/explorer">explorer</a>. While functional, it is recognised that this doesn’t have all the features that some community members would like to see. We’re happy to confirm that the mainnet will be supported by a new explorer and it is anticipated in the coming weeks that we’ll be making this publicly available.

  <p>Hi everyone and welcome to chapter 14 of 2020! It’s been a little while since we talked about standards for passwordless so we’re excited to tell you about some new enhancements and features in FIDO2 land that you'll start seeing in the wild in the next few months!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
 Specification Status 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) Level 2</a> specification is currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Process-20200915/#RecsCR">Candidate Recommendation</a> at the W3C. "Level 2" essentially means major version number 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The version 2.1 of the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-rd-20201208/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20201208.html">Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)</a> specification is a Release Draft at the FIDO Alliance. This means the spec is in a public review period before final publication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new draft versions are on their way to becoming the next wave of FIDO functionality (as of the writing of this blog, we support Level 1 of WebAuthn and CTAP version 2.0). We think you might want to hear about what we think is especially fun about WebAuthn L2 and CTAP 2.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enterprise Attestation (EA) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enterprise Attestation is a new feature coming as part of WebAuthn L2 and CTAP 2.1 that enables binding of an authenticator to an account using a persistent identifier, similar to a smart card today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO privacy standards require that "a FIDO device does not have a global identifier within a particular website" and "a FIDO device must not have a global identifier visible across websites". EA is designed to be used exclusively in enterprise-like environments where a trust relationship exists between devices and/or browsers and the relying party via management and/or policy. If EA is requested by a Relying Partying (RP) and the OS/browser is operating outside an enterprise context (personal browser profile, unmanaged device, etc), the browser is expected to prompt the user for consent and provide a clear warning about the potential for tracking via the persistent identifier being shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authenticators can be configured to support Vendor-facilitated and/or Platform-managed Enterprise Attestation. Vendor-facilitated EA involves an authenticator vendor hardcoding a list of Relying Party IDs (RP IDs) into the authenticator firmware as part of manufacturing. This list is immutable (aka non-updateable). An enterprise attestation is only provided to RPs in that list. Platform-managed EA involves an RP ID list delivered via enterprise policy (ex: managed browser policy, mobile application management (MAM), mobile device management (MDM) and is enforced by the platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spec reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-rd-20201208/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20201208.html#sctn-feature-descriptions-enterp-attstn">CTAP 2.1 - Section 7.1: Enterprise Attestation</a><br><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#enum-attestation-convey">WebAuthn L2 - Section 5.4.7: Attestation Conveyance Preference</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Authenticator Credential Management and Bio Enrollment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credential Management is part of CTAP 2.1 and allows management of discoverable credentials (aka resident keys) on an authenticator. Management can occur via a browser, an OS settings panel, an app or a CLI tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example of how the Credential Management capability is baked into Chrome 88 on macOS (chrome://settings/securityKeys). Here I can manage my PIN, view discoverable credentials, add and remove fingerprints (assuming the authenticator has a fingerprint reader!) and factory reset my authenticator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clicking on "Sign-in data" shows the discoverable credentials on the authenticator and allows me to remove them. This security key has an Azure AD account and an identity for use with <a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/">SSH</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bio Enrollment allows the browser, client, or OS to aid in configuring biometrics on authenticators that support them. This security key has one finger enrolled. I can either remove the existing finger or add more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example of authenticator credential management via a CLI tool, <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/">ykman</a> from Yubico.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Set Minimum PIN Length and Force Change PIN 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CTAP 2.1 allows an enterprise to require a minimum PIN length on the authenticator. If the existing PIN does not meet the requirements, a change PIN flow can be initiated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An authenticator can also be configured with a one-time use PIN that must be changed on first use. This is an additional layer of protection when an authenticator is pre-provisioned by an administrator and then needs to be sent to an end user. The temporary PIN can be communicated to the end user out of band. We see this being used in conjunction with Enterprise Attestation to create a strong relationship between an authenticator and a user.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Always Require User Verification (AlwaysUV) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AlwaysUV is part of CTAP 2.1 and allows the user to configure their authenticator to always prompt for user verification (PIN, biometric, etc), even when the Relying Party does not ask for it. This adds an extra layer of protection by ensuring all credentials on the authenticator require the same verification method.</p>

 Virtual Authenticator DevTool 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one is not tied to updates of either specification but we love it and wanted to share! Chrome and Edge (version 87+) now include a virtual authenticator as part of DevTools. It started as a Chromium extension back in 2019 and is now native! Oh, and the <a href="https://github.com/google/virtual-authenticators-tab">code is on Github</a>!</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a great tool for testing, debugging and learning! Try it with one of the awesome WebAuthn test sites: <a href="https://webauthnsample.azurewebsites.net/">Microsoft WebAuthn Sample App</a>, <a href="https://webauthn.io/">WebAuthn.io</a>, <a href="https://demo.yubico.com/webauthn-technical/registration">Yubico WebAuthn Demo</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access the tool, open Developer Tools ( <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts">F12 or Option + Command</a><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts">+ I</a> ), click the Menu icon on the top right (…) then More tools and WebAuthn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling the virtual authenticator environment will allow you to create a new authenticator by picking a protocol (CTAP2 or U2F), transport (USB, Bluetooth, NFC or internal), resident key (discoverable) and user verification support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As new credentials are created, you’ll see them listed and the sign count will increase as the credential is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to know more? Here’s an amazing blog by <a href="https://twitter.com/nsatragno">Nina Satragno</a> from the Chrome team over at Google who created this amazing DevTool!</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/webauthn-tab">How we built the Chrome DevTools WebAuthn tab</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Wrap Up 
<p>That rounds out the major features we believe will have the most impact. Here’s a few other enhancements and features that are important to mention!</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-iframe-guidance">cross-origin iFrame usage</a> 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-apple-anonymous-attestation">Apple’s anonymous platform attestation format</a> 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-large-blob-extension">Large blob storage extension</a> to support storing a small chunk of encrypted data with a credential to support use cases like SSH certificates 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’d like to hear more about any of these enhancements/features (or anything else identity related, let's be honest), leave us a note in the comments.</p>

<p>We're proud to announce the latest release of our command line tool for developer app publishing: Optimus Prime. </p> Account Linking for Desktops <p>The big new feature in this update is account linking between the browser and desktop. </p><p>Before the update, users had two separate accounts -- one they used in the browser as a webnative/WNFS user and another used to publish apps at the CLI. Now, if you already have an	 account you created in the web browser, you can link that account and use it at the CLI.</p><p>In this update, we also added a few great quality of life improvements include:</p>  Better handling of the managed IPFS daemon  More log messages at the CLI, which helps you to see exactly what is happening when you run a command  More emoji, which makes those log messages more colorful and fun. 🙂  <p>Here's an image that shows the account linking feature nicely (It also demonstrates many log messages in all their emoji glory). </p><p>Full details are<a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/fission/releases/tag/2.10.2"> on the release page on GitHub</a>.

<p>Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, have suddenly become rather popular. I don’t exactly know why now is their time — maybe it’s because <a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/nft-celebrity-non-fungible-tokens-crypto-grimes-paris-hilton/">celebrities are beginning to sell them</a>, or maybe it’s because recent price increases of BTC and ETH have given hodlers a lot of new money to play with. Whatever the cause, the world is taking notice. And not just the crypto world — traditional auction house Christie’s recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/most-expensive-nft-ever-sold-auctions-for-over-60-million.html">sold an NFT for $69 million USD</a>.</p> What is an NFT? <p>If you don’t know what an NFT is, it’s a record that tracks ownership of some special digital object, from its creation to its current owner. This record lives on a blockchain or other distributed ledger. The object, on the other hand, lives somewhere else, usually a traditional web server or decentralised file storage system. It might be a piece of digital art, an <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/">algorithmically generated cat</a>, an item of <a href="https://market.decentraland.org/">digital clothing</a> for your favourite virtual world, or (my favourite, on account of its subtle-yet-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania">undeniable</a> comment on the nature of crypto-trading) a tulip. That can <a href="https://ethertulips.com/">fight other tulips</a>.</p><p>The important thing to know is that, unlike normal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility">‘fungible’</a> crypto-tokens such as ETH, each NFT represents ownership of something special, unique, one-of-a-kind.</p><p>There’s a funny thing about that one-of-a-kind something. Because it’s a digital object, it can be cheaply copied and shared a zillion times, and there’s not much the owner can do about it.</p><p>But surprisingly, that’s what makes it so valuable.</p> What’s really interesting about an NFT? <p>If you buy a painting from a famous artist, you can do a few things with it. You can stick it in a vault where nobody can damage (or enjoy) it. Or you can put it in your living room to impress all your dinner party guests with. (As long as they’re in your bubble or you’ve all gotten vaccinated already.)</p><p>Or you can put it up in a public place where everyone can enjoy it. Something unexpected is about to happen now: the more people get to see it, the more famous it becomes, which makes it even more valuable. Think about Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa; it’s estimated to be worth <a href="https://www.reference.com/world-view/much-mona-lisa-worth-today-ea19afd66638ea57">$1 billion</a>, and the fact that anybody can print up a copy for their living room hasn’t hurt its value one bit. But the distinction of owning the original — now that’s something special, something that people might be willing to drop a billion on.</p><p>Digital art is even easier to copy than the Mona Lisa. So far this has been seen as a threat; music, film, and software companies have fought hard against piracy. That’s because their business models have centred around restricting who can access the things they produce, then charging for access. At the beginning of the internet age, this suddenly became nearly impossible to enforce.</p><p>What if we could do for digital art what art galleries did for physical art? What if we decoupled ownership from possession in a way that safely ensured that creators could make a respectable living? What if digital art became more valuable the more freely it was copied and enjoyed? And while we’re at it, could digital tech be used to eliminate (or reduce) the middlemen and let more of the revenue reach the people who do the work to inspire, challenge, and delight us?</p><p>According to the website <a href="https://cryptomedia.wtf/">cryptomedia.wtf</a>, this is exactly the sort of opportunity that NFTs hold. Reading this manifesto, I do really wonder if they might just upend the revenue strategy of content producers, allowing them to let go of artificial scarcity and profit from abundance. Could this be an example of a bridge from the extractive economics of the past into a cooperative economics that many of us are hoping for?</p> Why blockchain? <p>In order to do NFTs, we need some sort of registry that records the creation of art pieces, along with subsequent ownership transfers, so people can’t try to sell things they didn’t own. It’d be nice if this registry were publicly auditable — oh, and tamper-resistant, which implies that it shouldn’t be controlled by any particular organisation. And since it’s a piece of software, maybe it could automate ownership transfers and payments too. You can probably see now why blockchain technology is such a good match for NFTs.</p> Could we do NFTs on Holochain? <p>Yup!</p> How? <p>We talked to a couple of Holochain’s core devs about this, and while they came up with different designs, they all agreed that it wouldn’t be hard to do. You only need one simple rule, a ‘pass-the-ball’ rule, where you only get to pass the NFT to someone else if someone passed it to you (or you created it in the first place). They described this rule as ‘transitive’ — as long as it’s applied to every ball-passing event, it’s guaranteed to be correct all the way back to the object’s creation event.</p><p>Some people think you have to add some additional consensus to manage scarcity of NFTs, but in Holochain, every element on every user’s chain is already guaranteed to be unique, and you don’t get scarcer than that. You just need to track the history of who the unique thing has been transferred to.</p><p>I find all this easy to understand, because Holochain is modelled on the idea of person-to-person interactions — and we all understand how those work. Holochain adds some extra magic to prevent cheating. I won’t go into much detail, except to say two things:</p>  Every time you pass the ball, you need to ask a few people to witness the act. But you don’t get to choose who witnesses it, which helps keep you honest.  If someone passes the ball to you, you’re probably going to want to make sure they aren’t cheating. So this NFT app should let you check with a few prior witnesses to make sure the ball wasn’t secretly passed to someone else already.   Why Holochain instead of blockchain? <p>Plenty of reasons:</p>  Cost. Because Holochain apps are so resource-efficient, there’s no need to charge a transaction fee.  Ethics. A lot of smart people have already investigated <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6">blockchain’s</a> <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(19)30255-7">ecological</a> <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/">impact</a>, claiming that we can’t really afford to be adopting this kind of technology right now. A Holochain NFT app, by contrast, would be light enough to run on the basic devices its users already own.  Developer efficiency. Blockchain NFTs require a couple different stacks for payment, ownership, storage, and UI. With Holochain, those functions could all be integrated into one stack.  User experience. Not only are crypto wallets really confusing for the average user, but the disconnect between components has caused <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdj79/peoples-expensive-nfts-keep-vanishing-this-is-why">real losses for NFT art collectors</a>. I don’t think I need to explain why this is a serious problem. Better component integration means a safer — and nicer — experience for everyone.  Scalability. Holochain apps don’t use global consensus and they run on user devices. That means they <a href="https://qz.com/1145833/cryptokitties-is-causing-ethereum-network-congestion/">scale with the number of people</a> using them.  Accountability. People have already been selling things they don’t control the rights to. An NFT app on Holochain could leverage some of the <a href="https://hackmd.io/Y4QSGqn6T_amCvHv6T9f6A">identity tools we're building</a>.  <p>Put together, all of these things could mean greater adoption for NFTs — as well as massive new opportunities unlocked by the efficiency, cheapness, and versatility of a future Holochain-based NFT platform.</p>

 How to Build Use Cases with Affinidi — Driving License as a Verifiable Credential <p>This <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/protecting-your-drivers-license-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-25d22aeac05b">article</a> explains the importance of Verifiable Credentials for Driving License while this <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">article</a> gives you an insight of what verifiable credentials are, in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>As a continuation of the above articles, we’re now moving to the next step, which is the actual implementation.</p> STEP 1: <p>As a first step, get a react project template of your choice. Check out <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started">https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started</a> to get the react boilerplate in one command. Create three repos, one each for the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-issuer">issuer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-holder">holder</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-verifier">verifier</a> apps. (You can also use any other tech stack of your interest though in this article, we use&nbsp;react).</p> STEP 2: <p>Moving on, get the API access key and API key hash to access the Affinidi APIs from <a href="https://apikey.affinidi.com/?source=vcms-api-sandbox">https://apikey.affinidi.com/?source=vcms-api-sandbox</a> and add in&nbsp;.env file in your react&nbsp;app.</p> // .env file<br>REACT_APP_API_KEY=<br>REACT_APP_API_KEY_HASH=<br>REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=  STEP 3: <p>Now, the user(Issuer/Holder/Verifier) can do the sign up using <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/SignUp">link</a> and login using <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/Login">link</a>. On the issuer side, both the applicant and the issuer can log in, but they get to see different dashboards after they&nbsp;login.</p><p>The applicant logs in and fills the form and submits it to get VC(Verifiable Credential) for their Driving&nbsp;License.</p><p>When the issuer logs in, the list of all applied forms will be shown, and the issuer now checks the applications and issues a VC for the same. Issuing the VC involves two APIs: <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/BuildUnsigned">creating an unsigned VC</a> and <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/SignCredential">signing the credential</a>.</p> STEP 4: <p>Once the VC is signed, it can be saved to the issuer’s wallet using this <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/StoreCredentials">API</a> and shared using the credential share <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/ShareCredential">API</a> that creates a shareable link with expiry date and QR code(it contains the shareable link URL). This link can be sent to the applicant via email or as a QR code to the applicant.</p> STEP 5: <p>Finally, when the holders/applicants click the link, they are redirected to their respective wallet app and prompted to store or reject the VC. Once the user accepts the request, the VC is stored to their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/StoreCredentials">wallet</a>.</p> STEP 6: <p>The holder is able to see the <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/GetCredentials">list of all VC</a> stored in their&nbsp;wallet</p> STEP 7: <p>Let’s say, the holder wants to rent a car from a Car Rental Company(Verifier). To prove the authenticity of the holder’s VC and to avoid its misuse, the holder shares the VC with the verifier. There are a series of handshakes that happen to safely transfer the VC from the holder to the verifier as&nbsp;follows.</p><p>The car rental company has displayed a <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk/tree/master/sdk/core#initiate-credential-share-request">link</a> with a JWT token generated from the SDK. This JWT token has the list of encoded credentials required for the&nbsp;share.</p> STEP 8: <p>The link in the above image redirects to the wallet application with Token Request in the query parameter. The holder accepts the request to share the VC to the car rental&nbsp;company.</p> STEP 9: <p>One or more VCs are combined to form a Verifiable Presentation. Also, the VCs present inside the Verifiable Presentation are not the actual VCs, and are intended to avoid misusing the VC. At the same time, it also has the necessary information to prove the authenticity of VC as it has a Response Token(JWT token with Verifiable Presentation encoded in it). This is generated by the holder like this <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-holder/blob/master/src/containers/CredentialShareModal.js#L29">code sample</a> and shared to the verifier through the encrypted <a href="https://affinidi-messages.dev.affinity-project.org/api-docs/#/Message/SendMessage">messaging service</a>, similar to this <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-holder/blob/master/src/containers/CredentialShareModal.js#L33">code&nbsp;sample</a>.</p> STEP 10: <p>When the verifier logs into the account, the list of submitted applications can be seen through the <a href="https://affinidi-messages.dev.affinity-project.org/api-docs/#/Message/PullMyMessages">messaging service</a> like the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-verifier/blob/master/src/containers/MessageListener.tsx#L80">code sample</a> and validates the Verifiable Presentation from the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk/tree/master/sdk/core#validate-holder-response-on-share-request">Response Token</a>, similar to the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-verifier/blob/master/src/containers/CredentialShareResponse.tsx#L27">code sample</a>. On verification, the request is approved for a car&nbsp;rental.</p><p>Written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sridharan-jayabal/">Sridharan Jayabal</a></p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">How to implement driving license use case using Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 On-Demand Employment Endorsements — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials <p>For most of us, our first job is always special as it gives us a glimpse of how the next few decades could be. But tracking the responsibilities and roles in your first and subsequent jobs are not easy and more importantly, getting someone to verify them can be a challenge, especially if you’ve worked in an industry with high attrition rates. Platforms like LinkedIn may state your past background with some degree of social vetting but are certainly not fool-proof!</p><p>Fast forward a few years, and you may end up in a situation where the proof of experience from your first job is needed! Verifiable credentials can be your savior&nbsp;here.</p><p>To get an idea of what these are, feel free to read this <a href="https://medium.com/affinidi/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">101 post on&nbsp;VCs</a>.</p> How Can Verifiable Credentials Get an Employment Endorsement? <p>Let’s say, John has applied for a Post-grad program in digital marketing at the ABC university, but it requires work experience in a related field. John had been a salesman ten years ago and wanted to share this experience with University ABC in the form of a verifiable credential without the need for any additional verification.</p><p>So, how can he do&nbsp;that?</p><p>As with any VC, there are three parties involved here&nbsp;too.</p>  Issuer — Employers, job search sites, payroll providers, and startups like <a href="https://www.goodworker.in/">GoodWorker</a> that empower seasonal workers and employers, one verified credential at a time. It matches employers with a large network of trustworthy and verified profiles of skilled workers, at a fraction of the cost, and allows workers to take control of their job search, with direct access to trustworthy employers.  Holder — John  Verifier — University ABC  <p>As a first step, John logs into the issuer’s portal, and submits his personal details like his name and the month and year of employment. After verifying John’s credentials, the issuer looks through his work records, and sends a verifiable credential in the form of a QR code detailing John’s period of employment and his role as a salesman. In turn, John scans this QR code and stores these details in his digital&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Next, he creates a verifiable presentation with the information that University ABC wants, and shares it with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Here is a sample VC that checks the past employment of John as a salesman.</p><p>Finally, the university examines John’s verifiable presentation and learns about his experience as a salesman. This makes him eligible for the post-grad program and coupled with his admission test results, he gets the admit he’d always&nbsp;wanted!</p><p>Sounds simple,&nbsp;right?</p><p>The obvious advantage of VCs is that they are readily available and accessible. Imagine if you have to go to your first company and search through the physical records in a dusty storage room (No, we aren’t talking about Flintstones here!!).</p><p>Since these VCs are immutable and tamper-proof, the verifier could access authentic information that helped its decision-making process. In all, a win-win situation for everyone!</p><p>Overall, VCs are a huge leap forward in the world of ever-changing technology as it is a hassle-free way of sharing personal information securely and quickly with explicit consent of the owner of that information.</p><p>At Affinidi, we’re working to build an ecosystem that would help developers and companies create such interesting VC-based applications.</p><p>To learn more about what we do, drop a line at <a href="mailto:contact@affinidi.com">contact@affinidi.com</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">On-Demand Employment Endorsements — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Monthly Roundup for Holo &amp; Holochain — March&nbsp;Edition March Edition <p>Welcome to our monthly roundup — March edition, as always I’m bringing you the scoop of the month. If you have been reading the regular updates we share in Telegram or Twitter, you probably already know that we’ve now got a working Elemental Chat application and that we are hard at work preparing the Holochain and Holo infrastructure so that we can release it to all hosts. We are almost there! The big news this month was Holo being granted a patent for Holochain Distributed App Framework.</p><p>If you’re wondering what exactly we’ve been working on at Holo and Holochain this past month — the wait is over! Let’s jump right&nbsp;in.</p> Press Release: U.S. Patent granted for Holochain Distributed App Framework <p>In a big step forward for the P2P web, Holo Limited was granted a US patent for the rrDHT networking innovations within Holochain. rrDHT is a peer-to-peer networking design implemented in Holochain that describes a system of nodes communicating according to a relaxed, agent-centric distributed hash&nbsp;table.</p><p>Read the full Press Release: <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-patent/">U.S. Patent granted for Holochain Distributed App Framework</a></p> How rrDHT Works: A Tech Deep&nbsp;Dive <p>Unpacking the technology behind Holochain’s secure P2P networking. This week we got word that a <a href="https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10951697">patent</a> we submitted to the USPTO was approved. That means that Holochain’s special DHT design — rrDHT — is <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-patent/">covered under intellectual property&nbsp;laws</a>.</p><p>Read: <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/">How rrDHT Works: A Tech Deep&nbsp;Dive</a></p> Dev Tools in the&nbsp;Works <p>Mostly we’re working on performance, bugfixes, and features (proxy server, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/659">storage code</a>, sharding, and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/684">validation receipts</a>), but we’re also working on a few developer tools: the hc command (yes, it’s coming back), a mock HDK, and a nearly finalised hApp bundle&nbsp;spec.</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 92 — <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-tools-in-the-works/">Dev Tools in the&nbsp;Works</a></p> Elemental Chat Gets Freshened Up <p>This week we rolled out an update to all HoloPorts. The most visible changes are in the UI of Elemental Chat, our demo app. Users now have ‘identicons’ beside their name; these auto-generated avatars are based on their actual agent ID in the Holochain network and can’t be forged. This is important because usernames are just labels; you can set yours to anything you like, even someone else’s name. If you’re talking to a friend and suddenly their identicon looks slightly different, there’s a good chance someone is trying to impersonate your&nbsp;friend.</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 93— <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/elemental-chat-gets-freshened-up/">Elemental Chat Gets Freshened Up</a></p> Decentralized Next-level Collaboration Apps with&nbsp;Syn <p>My passion for Holochain has always been sourced in upgrading our collective intelligence, which means making it easier and more joyful to collaborate together. In early December, Art and I <a href="https://github.com/holochain/syn/blob/main/DESIGN.md">sketched out</a>, in an afternoon, a generalized pattern on Holochain for real-time collaborative apps like Google docs where you can type in the same document as others simultaneously, and see their cursor moving&nbsp;around.</p><p>Read: <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/decentralized-next-level-collaboration-apps-with-syn/">Decentralized Next-level Collaboration Apps with&nbsp;Syn</a></p> Moving HoloFuel up on the&nbsp;Roadmap <p>Yes, you read that right! We are actually ahead of where we expected to be in some ways. While it is taking a while to complete infrastructure testing because that is one of the most complex aspects of our work, we have been able to move many other activities forward. Because of that we decided to shift the HoloFuel application up in the roadmap. Here is what it looks like with the new changes. <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">Check it out on our website where you will find more&nbsp;details</a>.</p> More Dev Documents are&nbsp;out   To install the new RSM go&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/">here</a>.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>I’ve been in IT long enough to remember when business applications were home-grown and written in COBOL. In the early stages of my career, I even gave computer classes on the standard algorithms for good COBOL programming, such as sorting and grouping.</p>
<p>In the more than three decades since, I’ve seen SAP R/3 being discussed as the revolutionary approach for business applications, moving these from mainframes into client/server models. I’ve seen the emergence of the first SaaS applications, with some such as Salesforce or Ariba still being around. I’ve seen the broader adoption of the cloud for critical business workloads, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud. And, I have also seen GRC (Governance, Risk &amp; Compliance) become mandatory for organizations.</p>
 The hybrid reality of today’s business applications 
<p>For many, if not most organizations, the landscape of business applications has changed over the past year. With the advent of SaaS services, there are typically more vendors for the various business applications than there were a few years ago, and with the shift to the cloud, most organizations have ended up with a hybrid infrastructure. This makes managing such applications and providing GRC solutions for these environments more complex, starting with enforcing consistent identities, access controls, and SoD controls (Segregation of Duties) across these applications.</p>
<p>To further complicate things, other IT services are evolving towards becoming business applications. &nbsp;ITSM (IT Service Management) solutions, for example, are morphing into ESM (Enterprise Service Management) solutions with central platforms for workflows and services that support several lines of business, well beyond IT.</p>
 A challenge of breadth versus depth 
<p>GRC and, within that, access control, are about finding the right balance between breadth and depth. In rather monolithic landscapes of business applications, there is logic in using a highly specialized solution. In hybrid, heterogeneous landscapes, however, there often isn’t a single GRC solution that covers all the business applications and services anymore. Some deliver depth, such as for the traditional SAP ERP solutions, while others provide breadth, starting with standard IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration) solutions. There is no simple answer, and for many organizations, there won’t be a single solution.</p>
<p>This challenge is further complicated by organizational and ownership issues. Traditional SAP Access Control runs on SAP and commonly is owned by the SAP team. But how should the organization look in a world of hybrid and heterogeneous business applications? Is there still room for an SAP silo? Who should own what? CIOs, CISOs, and CROs (the Chief Risk Officers) must rethink the way GRC and access control are implemented for today’s ecosystems of business applications. This starts with revising the organizational structure and responsibilities.</p>

 After a massively successful IDO on Polkastarter, the roadmap is laid out and the team is ready and excited to work towards&nbsp;it. <p>We started Shyft Network with the view that one day our ecosystem would require critical infrastructure to ensure its stability. Now, more than three years later, that day has come; as international regulatory guidance begins to take shape, we begin to introduce infrastructure that aims to solve global challenges faced by ecosystem participants.</p><p>The Shyft Network roadmap spans multiple years, but is not limited to our roadmap alone; rather, the future development of Shyft will also be dependent on where our industry goes, and the challenges that present themselves across institutional adoption and regulatory guidance.</p><p>The goal of introducing Shyft Network into the space is to provide a response framework that we, as an ecosystem, can build on and use to provide more options and create new systems that help us better comply with evolving regulations.</p><blockquote>Shyft Network is meant to act as a layer 1 federated side chain, a smart contract tooling infrastructure, and a general purpose protocol that provides adaptability and optionality into&nbsp;systems.</blockquote><p>Shyft Network also has general-purpose use cases that were built alongside its architecture in order to provide solutions to global problems. These use cases define the intent of why we built the Shyft Network. Although these are mission driven use cases, they do not limit the extent to which this infrastructure can be used to build other systems, and as we now deliver this infrastructure to the global ecosystem, we hope to work alongside the community as we all carry it forward into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>We’ve had so much interest from third-party developers, protocols, companies, enterprises, governments and more looking to implement Shyft Network and its aggregation infrastructure. Once the Node Federation takes control of the network, the network company, Shyft Network Inc., will help to provide resources and support to aid new parties entering the&nbsp;project.</p> Stage 1 — Launch <p>The initial deployment of Shyft Network smart-contracts on Ethereum is where this project begins to enter the open world and goes into the hands of users; with it, we initialize our core KYC contracts, and enable proof-of-concept of our flagship use cases. Shortly after, the node federation takes over and Shyft Network’s mainnet is deployed. Stage 1 is the culmination of more than three years of development, planning and execution. We survived crypto-winter and proved to our supporters and community that our project is stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p> What can the Shyft Network community expect?   The SHFT Token ready for use on digital identity, verification and KYC concepts.  VASPs who we partnered with enter a second round and are now integrating into Veriscope, the global exchange and institution-governed solution to the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.  The deployment of community incentivization structures, i.e., yield wrapping, liquidity bootstrapping and DAO enablement.  The creation of the Node Federation as an essential component of Shyft Network’s push towards decentralization   March 24th, 2021: Ethereum &lt;&gt; Shyft Network version 1.0&nbsp;launch   The deployment of the first of the Shyft Network Core KYC contracts; this enables trust anchoring, compliant liquidity pool development, coalition and identity creation, and cross chain bridged asset and identity routing architecture to be possible.  This deployment will focus infrastructure towards the integration of decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, and existing Ethereum dapps for compliant, opt-in primitives.  The importance of this infrastructure is that it creates a fundamental development apparatus and initial base structure so that the Defi ecosystem can begin to build FATF compliant endpoints into existing ecosystem utilities and platforms.   April 2021 — Shyft Network launches the Federated Mainnet (Layer 1 consensus nodes will now carry the protocol&nbsp;forward)   The Shyft Network mainnet is live and the Node Federation takes over the protocol and carries it forward. This is a major milestone in the decentralization of the Shyft&nbsp;Network.  Once the Node Federation takes over the protocol, the Shyft Network team becomes another member of the community, and will work with partners and new applications to aid in providing developer tools and resources to new entrants. It will also launch educational marketing campaigns to increase awareness of the network and its capabilities.  VASPS that have been leading governance on Shyft Network through Veriscope, as well as national identity systems and other institutional use cases, will be able to use the attestation infrastructure on the Shyft Network Virtual Machine (SVM). The globally distributed federation will now be active, and support for Travel Rule complying entities globally will now be live for utilization and deployment. Identity use cases and entity to entity data sharing requirements will initially take place on the Shyft Network Layer 1 until data portability and synthetic asset transmission into corresponding Shyft Network contracts on other chains is complete.  ChainBridge technology, developed in collaboration with Chainsafe, will be deployed between the Shyft Network and Ethereum to support cross asset transmission and minimal cross-smart-contracts operations. This will not link coalitions or data use cases, attestations will not be routable at this stage, only asset transmission.   Stage 2 — Expansion <p>Additional use cases, e.g., our PerseID Government ID project, will be deployed. The Shyft Network team will also start a community and industry wide education and promotion campaign to bring in new partnerships and developers into the ecosystem.</p> What can the Shyft Network community expect?   Staking on the Shyft Network goes&nbsp;live.  More incentives in the form of community DAOs and&nbsp;grants.  Technological improvements on the Shyft Network protocol.  Ecosystem expansion: external use cases and third-party developer use cases begin to deploy and scale the&nbsp;network.  <p>Disclaimer: The plans, dates and other statements contained in this roadmap are an estimation only, are subject to change based on various factors and circumstances, and there are no assurances that they can be fulfilled</p> Q2 2021   Staking on Shyft Network goes live. Additional community token-based metagames &amp; AMM incentivization is released. The goal is to improve token distribution and prepare the network for scalability and resilience. As an enhancement of Veriscope, the federation initiates discussions and prototypes of opt-in compliance products designed for decentralized finance; compliant DeFi will begin to take shape and aim to enter a new era of mass adoption and user empowerment.  LP Reward Program is released on Ethereum, allowing a whitelisted subset of participants to get SHFT token rewards for applying their liquidity to specific SHFT:asset pairs on Ethereum’s AMMs. We will be expanding this program and notifying the community on the construction of additional purely-compliant LP&nbsp;pools.  Another major milestone for Shyft Network is the launch of “Perseid” Government ID Project; the PerseID team has been working with the Government of Bermuda for years and are very proud to deliver technology that aims at improving the life of their citizens. Once launched, the PerseID and Shyft Network teams will look to deploy public grassroots &amp; government-wide marketing campaigns aimed at expanding this particular use&nbsp;case.  Federation improvements &amp; Shyft Runtime Inflation DAO’s: One of Shyft Network’s core pillars is effective decentralization, and will further promote federation-wide technology improvements to integrate with Shyft Community DAOs. Runtime inflation DAO’s are aimed at creating a solid developer base and the incentive structures that will help it flourish.  First Alpha iteration on the Shyft Byfrost bridging technology, allowing further economic &amp; reputational finality across blockchains.  Iterations on the “Compliant DEFI” project, integrations on VASP-scale to allow “passporting” of identities onto the blockchain DEFI applications.   Stage 3 — Continuity  Q4 2021   Further iterations, LP stability, composability standards implemented &amp; used across multiple platforms simultaneously.  Shyft Node Federation integrates Proof-of-Work checkpointing.   2022   Further instantiation of “Veriscope”, “Perseid”, “Compliant DEFI” products &amp; cross-product integration, oracle support, management of full cross-chain opt-in identity transactions &amp; composability support.  Node Federation transitions to ToR-only communication.   Conclusion <p>The team is ready to push forward and achieve this milestones; this is what we’ve been working towards and are very excited to share it with our community as we enter a new era of decentralization for the project. Join us as we unlock trust, identity, and creditability networks for humanity.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network is a public protocol designed to aggregate and embed trust, validation and discoverability into data stored on public and private ecosystems, and facilitate information transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks.

 <a></a>Introduction: Music and SSI 
<p>Mathieu: Many different people have spoken to me about some of the work that you and the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/">Human Colossus Foundation</a> are doing: both within the foundation and also with different community initiatives over the past little while. I have been quite interested in the work you’re doing, and I’m looking forward to just going a little deeper into this with you today. Thanks for doing this.</p>
<p>When I started looking into your background and how you got into what you’re doing now, it seems that early on in your career, you had a passion with a lot of interest and activity in the music industry. </p>
<p>Paul: Yes, I’ve always had a bit of a dual career in music and the pharmaceutical industry. Like a lot of people in the music industry, sometimes you need a second job to keep your passion going. My crux was the pharmaceutical industry, but yes, the music industry. We’ll take it back a step: my degree at university was in I.T. Right after university, I did an audio engineering degree in London and learned how to work with the big mixing desks in recording studios. From there, I started working for a couple of recording studios, getting to understand the trade as an audio engineer. I fell into private events through my music industry career. I ended up doing showcases at the Gibson showroom for international artists travelling into the U.K. Gibson Guitars had some showrooms in London, so whenever anyone decent was coming through, I’d put on a showcase for the U.K. music industry, which would usually kick off their U.K. tour.</p>
<p>One of the artists that came through was an Indian artist called Raghu Dixit, who was actually the highest selling independent artist in India (outside of Bollywood). I put on one of these showcases for him, and through that, I ended up co-managing him for a while. That kept me busy. I got to fly around the world a little bit with him, but it was that journey that started getting me into the data space at the same time. I created a platform called the International Music Community, where the idea was to introduce up-and-coming artists to music industry professionals, but using data to build those algorithms. For an artist, we’d get all their social media traffic, put that into an algorithm, and then hook them up with industry professionals who had worked with artists of a similar level. It was an interesting space. We ended up white-labelling that platform and a lot of the music industry conferences really liked it. As you can imagine, you’ve got the president of Warner Brothers or something on a panel at a conference, and they don’t want to be bombarded with contacts from baby artists. Through this tiering thing that we’d built within the platform, I was able to protect the identity of the music professionals at the high end. But at the same time, they could look down into the filter to find the up-and-coming artists that they were looking for. So that got me into the data space in music. At the same time, I’d always had this parallel career in the pharmaceutical industry in data management and statistical analysis. That was paying the bills as I was doing all of the music stuff.</p>
<p>I suppose that’s how I became so interested in semantics. That’s how it all started; my journey into SSI was through that algorithm development within the music platform. I wanted a way of authenticating when an industry professional said that they worked with Rod Stewart or something like that. I wanted some way of authenticating that information, and that’s how I got into SSI, decentralized authentication, and key management, etcetera.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s super interesting! As you were explaining your marketplace solution of connecting up-and-coming artists or musicians with labels and so forth, right away, my head went to credentials, and showing proofs, and just doing matchmaking. With the way the platform had been built, but before self-sovereign identity, you could see the next evolution of the platform growing into its own ecosystem solution, potentially using verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Paul: Exactly. The platform was an incredibly federated platform when I built it because I didn’t know that SSI existed. So as soon as I found that ecosystem, I tore up the rulebook and said, “This isn’t going to work; I have to rebuild it.”</p>
 <a></a>SSI and Pharma 
<p>Mathieu: At the same time, you were definitely solving significant problems with the way it was built, and I’m sure it still does. Now that this type of thing is possible, we could explore all these new business opportunities with this. At least, that’s what gets me excited every day, when I get up and look at the self-sovereign identity stuff.</p>
<p>Working in pharma, it seems like big data is just crucial to that field. Big data and identity management are at the core. Is that what got you thinking more about the data structures? In pharma, I need to have very solid data inputs. But, if I want to be able to share results and across multiple parties, especially for clinical testing, that got you thinking about the structure of data a lot more, am I right?</p>
<p>Paul: Yes, absolutely. One of the first jobs I had in the pharmaceutical industry was actually data entry. They had these clinical report forms which were all handwritten, and I’d have to enter that into the system. In those days it was very dodgy: you’d have all sorts of doctor’s notes and comments, and you’re entering all of that, which is obviously full of P.I. information and dangerous data. It wasn’t nearly as strict as it is now, but yes, it did get me thinking about semantics very early. Obviously, for all those free form text fields; bringing in predefined entries and putting some structure around data is necessary, so that it becomes useful for machine-reading and analytics. One of the pain points with clinical data capture is that when you work on two sister trials and you’re trying to aggregate that data together at the end of the process, it was always little things that would break that pooling process. For example, maybe the same attribute had different formatting in each study, or the length of the attribute was different in each study — when you aggregated it, the data would truncate. These are pain points that are still going on today in the pharmaceutical industry. That’s where I started delving hard into semantics, and trying to find new ways of capturing data: different architectures, all that sort of stuff, to try and get some of those pain points ironed out.</p>
<p>Mathieu: A long time ago, I spent some time working in a clinic. We conducted clinical trials and later, staged trials on patients who would come in for the trials. I did all sorts of different stuff in this clinic, but I was more on the input side. I was managing the operation, the intake of the drug that was being administered, and the blood sampling and the testing. Because I was more on the input side of things, it wasn’t on the data and the analysis side of things. It seems that’s how you’re looking at the inputs and semantics: it’s the two sides of this. How do you describe inputs and semantics to someone?</p>
 <a></a>Semantics and Inputs 
<p>Paul: The easiest way to think about it is: inputs are what is being inputted into a digital system or ecosystem. Semantics are what is providing context and meaning to the information that’s being entered into a system. Those are the two main differences. Another way to look at it, would be data entry versus data capture. When you just say ‘pure data entry,’ that’s the keys that you enter on your keyboard into a system. But really, to bring anything in any context or meaning, it relies on data capture; when you enter something and you need to capture it into a schema structure or something like that. That’s where you have all your formatting and your predefined entries, your human-readable labels, the context, the metadata of the schema, and all that sort of stuff. All of that rich information that brings contextual meaning to the data, that’s been inputted. The data inputs are on one side, the input side. You want to know that the data has come from an authenticable source, whereas on the input side, it’s more about making sure that the context and the semantics around the data — those constructs are immutable. So that way, any actor who is interacting with any of those objects knows that the data capture structures are the same for everybody.</p>
<p>Mathieu: You had a nice illustration diagram of semantics and inputs; you started splitting everything up into both of them. Does this go all the way down?</p>
<p>If you’re looking at the different inputs through credentials, does that push all the way through to attributes? Does that push all the way through to deeper objects?</p>
<p>It definitely seems that in the self-sovereign identity space, and entering with that mindset if these things are needed — you must have realized pretty quickly that for this to actually take off, there’s a lot of this infrastructure that needs to be in place.</p>
<p>Paul: Yes. As soon as you’re talking about <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">a decentralized ecosystem</a>, you are looking at a lot of innovation to enable that whole space to work. One suggestion that I would say to people is that you’ve almost got to treat the entire data economy as one company. Within a company, you would have a data analyst group or something similar, plus perhaps other groups that are more geared towards marketing or whatever. These sorts of differences within an organization work quite well, but as soon as you go into a decentralized space, it’s more challenging. Where do you categorize things in a totally decentralized space, so that you have communication throughout the entire data ecosystem? For that model that you’re talking about, I think the official term for it is “the model of identifier states.” At the Human Colossus Foundation, we call it the rugby ball model because of the shape of it.</p>
<p>I built that model because I thought the decentralized identity folks were overlooking semantics. Obviously, with my data management background, I wanted to get a model for them to understand the importance of semantics. When you talk about decentralized key management solutions, you’re really only looking at half of the puzzle. That puzzle is all about making sure that data comes from an authentic source. Regarding all the immutable semantics and stuff, that’s the other half of the model. I call that the semantics domain. That’s been fun; it took a little while to get down to the nitty-gritty of the dualism between every component within each half of that model. For instance, when you talk about an attribute in a schema on the input side, that’s a claim within a credential. Essentially, the input side is about real data, and the semantic side is about the constructs that were used to put context into those data inputs.</p>
<p>Mathieu: You’re involved in many different communities; we’ve seen each other in the different working groups, and you run your own working group in the Trust over I.P. movement. How does this model fit into the Trust over I.P. stack? There are different types of organizations or people that are playing at different levels in the Trust server I.P. stack. For example, you could have people just playing in Layer One: they’re building public identity utilities. You could have other companies, like the company I represent, that are playing more at the top layers: we’re trying to enable ecosystem solutions to be built. However, just as there is a governance layer across the stack, what you’re bringing here, through inputs and semantics, needs to be taken into consideration across the stack. How does that fit into the whole picture? </p>
<p>Paul: It’s just a different vantage point; it’s still a full ecosystem. With the dual-stack at Trust over I.P., you’re looking at governance versus technology across the four layers that you mentioned, from utility at Layer One, right up to the ecosystems at Layer Four. That gives you a fairly big picture of a data economy, but only from a perspective of governance versus technology. The inputs and semantics group is just a different vantage point — thinking more about what is entered into a system. and the meaning of the data that you’re capturing and stuff like that. It’s still a totally full model, but it’s complementary to the dual-stack. I’d suggest that data entry and data capture is valid for all four layers, and at each layer, it’s really about how you’re capturing that data. It’s not so much about what you’re capturing at the time; it’s thinking a little bit beyond that. For example, with all the vaccine stuff; it’s great if your apps can work for contact tracing and all that sort of stuff. But the way that I think about data is, “Okay, in the pandemic, you have the World Health Organization; how can we make this data useful for their processes and the analytics at their end?” That would enable them to get some real-time analytics to see how the pandemic is responding. I think there’s always a broader context than some developers sometimes think.</p>
 <a></a>Human Colossus Foundation &amp; KERI 
<p>Mathieu: You approached this through the Human Colossus Foundation; what were your steps to forming this? What was your journey of starting this organization, and why have you structured it the way you’ve structured it?</p>
<p>Paul: The foundation started because of Overlays Capture Architecture at the time. The foundation was founded by three of us: myself, Robert Mitwicki, and Philippe Page. The idea of it really kicked off when I met Robert. Robert’s a deep stack developer, but he’s an interesting developer — he’s always got a very broad perspective on the things that he’s building. We hit it off immediately when I showed him the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/cjzegoi58xgpfzwxyrqlroy48dihwz">Overlays Capture Architecture</a> (OCA). Initially, we had built an innovation hub at a proprietary company called Dativa, but we soon realized while we were building our OCA and that environment that it had to be open source. By that time, we’d also started developing a model called the “Master Mouse Model,” which is a conceptual model of what a dynamic data economy would look like. That was all spearheaded through the characteristics of Overlays Capture Architecture. Really, the reason we built the foundation was we knew that OCA was going to be an important part. We knew that what they were doing with SSI, and in Hyperledger Aries and Hyperledger Indy, was an important space for authentic provenance chains. It was about taking these different parts, and trying to have a foundation where we could knit some of these components together without having to disrupt too much of what was going on in those communities. We could do it within our own foundation. Everything we build is totally open source. As soon as we’ve done a proof of concept or we’ve knitted some components together for the benefit of the economy, then we can showcase that, and people can simply pick up those components and integrate them into their own solutions.</p>
<p>Mathieu: For the work that’s being produced by the foundation (like the overlays capture architecture, which was the starting point): is it all very use-case-oriented, or is it more generic frameworks that only need to be customized?</p>
<p>Paul: No, they’re totally generic everything; one of the components we’re developing at the moment is a trusted digital assistant. That would be a deeper component into the stack than a traditional digital wallet. You’re probably aware of KERI; have you come across KERI, the <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a>?</p>
<p>Mathieu: In the seminar you threw, you had Sam Smith, who was involved in this. We were personally quite excited. We’re excited about KERI, but we’re also excited about the network of networks concept, so those fit in nicely together.</p>
<p>Paul: KERI is a very interesting architecture, because, with a data ecosystem, you can really go two different ways. You can have your Root of Trust being a node on the network, whether that’s Sovrin, or Ethereum, or Bitcoin, or whatever that provides a Root of Trust. What KERI promises to enable — and I say ‘promises’, because it’s still being developed as we speak — you could change your Root of Trust because it’s a ledger-less solution. Your Root of Trust could be what we call a trusted digital assistant, which is a component on your mobile phone. The importance of doing it that way, is because you avoid all this potential network lock-in. That is, when some people are building on Hyperledger fabric and others on Ethereum and the like, you could potentially get into these interoperability issues with the way DIDs are, currently. With the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifiers</a>, you have this method space that usually gives you the location of where the identifier is housed. So, if it’s a DID:SOV, that suggests it’s on the Sovrin network. There’s something like 87 different methods, so it’s not great for interoperability.</p>
<p>What KERI allows, is if you have the identifier as a component on your mobile phone, then you can suddenly interact with any network: you’re not locked into those networks. That’s a really interesting technology that we’re going to be delving hard into at the Human Colossus Foundation, for sure.</p>
<p>Mathieu: My perspective on the evolution of the self-sovereign identity stack, is that we’re at a point where there needs to be a lot more intelligence built into agents to create more value.</p>
<p>With your digital assistant utilizing KERI, is that a way to say you’re basically enabling a smarter agent, that fits the real-world business processes?</p>
<p>Paul: Yes, exactly. The advantage of it is that we’re not stopping people from building on any blockchain networks, but at the same time, we’re not reliant on that, as well. If I could describe the ‘trusted digital assistant’ in a short sentence, I’d call it an API plug-in gateway, into a dynamic data economy. Today, a browser is really your way into the internet. The way for individual citizens to get into the decentralized dynamic data economy, is through this component on your mobile device. So, you can think of it as a personal browser, if you like.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes. That truly is being open source. Whether I’m the ‘good health pass’ or if I’m some ecosystem solution, I could choose to incorporate this into my stack. That gives you all of the context and all of the other benefits that you need to have. If I need to worry about privacy, or user experience, this could fuel a lot of these benefits that we talk about every day in SSI.</p>
<p>Paul: Absolutely. I think that there are three main domains that you really need to decentralize: one is obviously the decentralized key management, the second is decentralized semantics, and then the last one is decentralized governance. I think the governance piece is maybe where KERI can help, because you’re not necessarily locked into those networks. I believe that can help a lot to decentralize governance. For instance, if I’m at border control in the U.K., or China, or any of those different countries, you can’t expect them to all be using the same network. By introducing KERI, it gets you out of those potential network lock-in issues. When we say ‘decentralized governance’, I think it sits in that sort of space.</p>
 <a></a>Working Groups within Trust over IP 
<p>Mathieu: You’ve chosen the Trust over I.P. as a good home to conduct certain work with the community. Would you mind describing what’s going on right now within the Trust over I.P., inside the inputs and semantics working group?</p>
<p>Paul: You can think of the inputs and semantics working group as the innovation hub of Trust over I.P. You don’t have to be an identity network, that is, an SS-Identity network. If you’re coming into the space and you have an identity solution of whatever kind, we can look at that within the inputs and semantics group. We would try to knit it together into a proof-of-concept or pilot, without disrupting some of the businesses that are already developing strong <a href="https://northernblock.io/services/ssi-implementation/">SSI solutions</a> within the dual-stack, as it stands. I think there’s a little bit more freedom in the inputs and semantics working group for people to work on brand new solutions.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Is it more new solutions, or do you see a mix? There are so many solutions that exist in the market today. I’m sure you could talk about so many things that go on in pharma, for example. You’re working on helping entrepreneurs or helping new ecosystems, but is it a mix of both that come through there?</p>
<p>Paul: It’s absolutely a mix of both. You’ll get people who want to set up new ecosystems, but maybe they’re sometimes working with some legacy solutions. They want to figure out how to deconstruct what they’ve done to make it more decentralized. All of those issues can come into the inputs and semantics group. At the same time, we’re also looking at new solutions such as semantic containers. Some of the transient portability solutions can also fit into inputs and semantics, and we see how we can work them into moving data around in a safe and secure manner.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It’s such a cool space. I was looking into it: as you said, there are task forces on storage and portability; there’s privacy, and risk, and notice, and consent.</p>
<p>There are so many things that need to be thought of from the user experience standpoint, or from the business case standpoint: to figure out what to show, what not to show, and how certain functions should work. You’re able to absorb that, and build it into the models.</p>
<p>Paul: Probably one area that needs strengthening up a little bit, is the user experience side of things. There is a human experience working group that is set up at Trust over I.P. It’s not housed in the inputs and semantics group, but it’s a very new group, so I don’t think they’re totally up and running yet. It’ll be interesting to see what comes out of that task force.</p>
<p>Mathieu: For just a simple example of what you mentioned earlier in the pharma segment: the dates can get screwed up in different formats. Being in Canada, that happens very easily if dates are written in English and in French — you write it in one format if it’s in English, and another format if it’s in French, so there’s a mismatch, to begin with. That’s a simple user experience example where, if you want to internationalize a solution, or if you want to make it applicable, it needs to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>I would love to hear more on how you thought about general user experience overall, but it seems like the structure that you’re building and bringing up enables contextualization to happen inside of the actual wallets, and apps and systems that are being used by end-users.</p>
<p>Paul: The semantics part is very interesting. I think we’ve stumbled across a really nice architecture, in that it doesn’t matter what language you want your credential to resolve in, or your predefined entries; they can all be resolving in your mother tongue. Everything in OCA is a layer, so depending on the country that you’re in, we can easily swap in a layer here and there, rather than rebuilding the entire schema structure. With you being a Canadian, you’ll be interested in this: I’ve been building a COVID-19 vaccination specification for the COVID-19 credentials initiative group. It’s an OCA-formatted spreadsheet, if you like. I showed it to the Canadian guys, and I had both Canadian French and English as some overlays. They asked, “Could you build some overlays for the Indigenous communities in Canada, like the Inuit?” I said, “Yeah, I think so.” Then, I had to google Inuit, because I have no idea — I’ve never seen the language before. It looks almost like hieroglyphics or something, and I thought, “I don’t think this is UTF-8 compliant.” Interestingly, with Overlays Capture Architecture, the character set encoding is a separate layer altogether. So, for an interesting character set such as what the Inuit use, you can just change the character setting encoding overlay, and then rebuild all the human-readable labels, and all the predefined entries, and everything in their language. The idea is that when you resolve that on your mobile phone, it comes through as a form. The whole form can be structured in their language, so it’s great. If you’re travelling and you don’t speak a language, you can enter everything in your own language. If the guy at border control only knows Russian, for example, all you have to do is hit a little scroll-down at the top from English to Russian, and the whole credential form changes into their language. It’s a really cool architecture, and we’re super proud of it.</p>
 <a></a>Managing Privacy 
<p>Mathieu: I won’t lie, it was heavy the first time I started looking into it; there are so many layers. I think the fact that you’ve been able to componentize it like that, makes it very easy to swap-in/ swap-out what you’re trying to do, based on your use case. I don’t know if it would be the masking layer, but if we’re talking about selective disclosure or privacy, there’s another layer in there that addresses that too, right?</p>
<p>Paul: Yes. If you look at data management as a three-step process: from data collection, data capture, data exchange… that second step of data capture is really important, because that’s where you rebuild the semantics for the data exchange. In that way, when it’s gone out the other end, if you like, it’s all beautiful for machine learning, etcetera. Some of the overlays that you use in that second stage, the capture stage, are really things like your human-readable labels, your predefined entries, or your formats. Some of the overlays that you might use on the exchange side might differ, so that’s what we’re looking at at the moment. When you talk about a masking overlay, that requires additional processing on perhaps certain attributes that you flagged in the schema base. Some of that masking might be more suited for the data exchange side, rather than the data capture side as a secondary process. We’re looking into all those nuances at the moment. I think that OCA has enough flexibility to be very granular on which overlays are used at, what stage of the data life cycle.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That makes sense. You touched on this earlier when we were talking about KERI being interesting for governance, because you’re not locked into a specific utility. Thinking about privacy, and governance around whatever needs to go into an ecosystem solution; this is where ecosystem builders would be able to integrate this architecture, and to be able to create the rule-set based on this, right?</p>
<p>Paul:  Yes, absolutely. The privacy folks are almost a totally different community in themselves. When I talk about the ‘Master Mouse Model,’ which is our vision of a dynamic data economy, what we talk about is really the data layer. However, there’s actually an entirely new layer that goes on top of that, which is the jurisdictional layer. For example, is a company compliant with jurisdictional law to be able to operate within that sort of economy?</p>
<p>When you talk about services: are those services authenticated by a jurisdictional authority? Are they allowed to perform those services? Those sorts of legal things are almost like a different ecosystem altogether. When I was talking about the ‘trusted digital assistant’, that’s really where you’d have APIs from that jurisdictional layer, plugging into your trusted digital assistant. That way, you know that when you’re looking for certain services, they’re already legal and they’ve been authorized properly. Obviously, it shouldn’t be up to the human being to decide whether something’s authorized or not; that’s a legal component.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes. So, in a COVID credentials or vaccination credentials use case, based on the jurisdiction you’re in, you don’t want to allow anyone to breach privacy or share PII. It’s all built into the system based on the jurisdiction: if I’m in Canada, or in a specific province in Canada, versus if I’m in a U.S. state, or if I’m in France or wherever, you could have this built right in.</p>
<p>What other use cases do you find interesting in what you see now? You came from the media/music space, you have a lot of experience in pharma, you’ve been spending a lot of time with the COVID projects: what do you find super interesting, or where are you spending most of your time right now?</p>
<p>Paul:  There are a couple of interesting things that we’re looking into. One of the projects that we built at the Human Colossus Foundation was a digital immunization passport. We haven’t pushed it that hard, because it’s actually working on brand new technologies that are not standards yet. I think there’s going to be a second wave of digital immunization passports; the first wave that goes out might come across a few issues with governance and all that sort of stuff. We’re sitting in on discussions about the next generation of immunization passports. One of the interesting things in that solution was trying to cryptographically link verifiable credentials to semantic containers.</p>
<p>Our view of a credential is that it should allow you to do something. When you have a credential on your mobile phone, you can show it to border control. They can see, “Oh, you’ve got a green tick mark; you’re good to go.” All of the sensitive health information data that sits behind that, we’ve been storing that in what we call a semantic container. That’s where the holder of the data can give access to that container using a token, and there is obviously a cryptographic link between the container and the credential. What’s interesting is that the credential’s great for saying,” Yes, this data has come from an authentic source.” Essentially, by cryptographically tying that credential to the container, you can say that anything in that container has been authenticated by me, and that has some interesting properties.</p>
<p>When you’re talking about the music industry, I think that for music publishers it could be really interesting. They’ve always had trouble with people copying MP3s and giving it to their friends; the artist doesn’t make any money. However, if you put an MP3 in a container and you’ve got a verifiable credential saying, “Yes, this container has been authenticated by AC/DC or whoever the band is”, then you can track it very well, using these decentralized technologies. So, if anybody is accessing that MP3; firstly, they need a token from, let’s say, the publisher acting on behalf of the band. That would probably be a good way to do it, because there’s always a provenance chain, back to where it came from. There’s an interesting technology that we’ve been looking at, called Digital Water-marking. Basically, it just changes the composition a tiny bit of the digital asset within the container. So, if somebody leaks that for any reason, without proper authorization to do it, you can track who leaked it. That’s super cool: it’s more of a defensive approach to data sharing. I think with all these things: the more protection you can have, the better. That’s just another method that we’re looking at, for how to stop illegal data sharing.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Is a good analogy that a credential is like a recipe item, but without a semantic container? That’s the meal; you’re able to put everything in together, you could take it from different places, and just have it as its own package.</p>
<p>Paul:  Yes, you can think of it exactly like that. It’s a bundle of information; so it could be a usage policy, plus a huge audio file, plus a couple of attachments — that can all be put into a container. The credential is saying that everything in that container is authentic; you can take a cryptographic hash of the contents of the container, and also a cryptographic hash of the data capture structure that was used to capture that data. If either of those two items changes, the hash basically breaks, and then the credential is automatically nulled.</p>
<p>When you have a UPS package or something like that, the package is the container and the thing that you’ve signed to get the package; that’s your credential. That’s your way of authenticating that it’s yours, all under your control.</p>
 <a></a>Community Activities 
<p>Mathieu: All of this work, and thinking, and pilots, and effort: you’re bringing all this to the Trust over I.P., and you seem to be working with Sovrin. Is it more specifically on the UX or guardianship side of things? Are you also involved with Kantara?</p>
<p>Paul: Yes, I’m involved in all of those communities in varying capacities. I work with the MyData community, all about personal data. I set up the ‘MyData Health’ thematic group over there, so it’s really about making sure that that health data is treated properly throughout the data life cycle; that’s one thing I do. For the COVID-19 credentials initiative, I run the schema task force there. We’re basically creating schema specifications for COVID-19 tests: that includes test reports, test certificates, vaccine reports, vaccine certificates, those sorts of things. At Sovrin, I lead the communications team. So, whenever you see blog posts going out from Sovrin, it’s usually pulled into our group. We’ll vet it, and make sure that it’s accurate and supportive of the community. And then, with Kantara, I work very closely with the ‘notice and consent’ group over there. Notice and consent is totally not my expertise, but I know how important that piece is to the whole ecosystem, so I’m trying my best to learn as much as I can. There are some amazing people in that space, who have as much knowledge in their space as I do in semantics. I’m totally in awe of those guys, as well.</p>
<p>Mathieu: For the different communities advocating for trusted data, or self-sovereign identity, or <a href="https://northernblock.io/">decentralized identity</a>, however you call it; I think everyone has the same ethos of what we’re trying to do, and the community is amazing. Everyone is trying to help each other out; everyone’s trying to give. Honestly, we’re very fortunate to work with these types of people every day. It’s just amazing; it’s very motivating.</p>
<p>Paul: Absolutely. You’re dealing with people who have 25 years of identity experience, and 25 years of consent, and getting these people to the same table to agree on what a dynamic data economy should look like. I’m totally blown away by the level of knowledge.</p>
<p>Mathieu: To close, where could you use help? How could people help you to keep pushing the dynamic data economy forward, and all these things forward?</p>
<p>Paul: It’s very much a cross-community effort, really. The Human Colossus Foundation is pretty much as agnostic as you like; we don’t really have an agenda. We talk to all the communities, and we try hard to make sure that everybody has a place at the dinner table to put their objectives forward, for the good of the economy.</p>
<p>Moving forward, if anybody’s really interested in this space, I would suggest that the inputs and semantics working group within Trust over I.P. is a great place to join. You’ll get a very broad perspective on the economy from a lot of specialists all working together. For a quick fix on a lot of information, that’s a great place to go. At Trust over I.P., looking at the dual stack, there’s also space for governance across the governance stack, and also new technologies in the technology stack. I think Trust over I.P. is a great space to join. When it was first set up, there were a few murmurings that this is just Sovrin, rebranded. In reality, it’s much broader than that. Sovrin is a utility for self-sovereign identity and will probably always be seen as the genesis point of that whole ecosystem, but Trust over I.P. goes much broader than that. It’s self-sovereign identity, but it’s also decentralized consent, semantics, ecosystems — it’s a much broader space. The reason I say that is because for anybody that is uneasy about SSI or has any doubts about it: just go into Trust over I.P., and there will be a space for your expertise, for sure.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Agreed. Paul, thank you very much for doing this with me. It was a great conversation. I’m sure people are going to find this quite interesting and want to go a little deeper into the stack that you guys are bringing forward. I know this is an area that I’m quite interested in going into a lot deeper, so thank you for doing this!</p>
<p>Paul: My pleasure, thanks for having me; I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>It’s a sad reality that Web 2.0&nbsp;and social media&nbsp;have&nbsp;made it easier for&nbsp;<a href="https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/defining-online-harassment-a-glossary-of-terms/">online abuse</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rightsforpeace.org/hate-speech#:~:text=Speech%20that%20is%20simply%20offensive,religion%2C%20ethnicity%20or%20other%20factors.">hate speech</a>&nbsp;to flourish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/07/11/online-harassment-2017/">2017 Pew Research</a>&nbsp;revealed 41 percent of Americans had&nbsp;been harassed online and 66 percent hadwitnessed&nbsp;abuse of others.&nbsp;Updated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">2021</a>&nbsp;data show&nbsp;roughly the same&nbsp;rates of abuse but&nbsp;more severe&nbsp;abusive encounters,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;physical threats, stalking and sexual harassment.&nbsp;Significantly,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">75&nbsp;percent</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;the most recent encounters for those affected happened on social media platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We all know online abuse can be&nbsp;incredibly damaging&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/07/11/online-harassment-2017/">Pew</a>&nbsp;puts it like this: “In its milder forms,&nbsp;[online&nbsp;abuse]&nbsp;creates a layer of negativity that people must sift through as they navigate their daily routines online. At its most severe, it can compromise users’ privacy, force them to choose when and where to participate online, or even pose a threat to their physical safety.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For years solutions to this growing problem have&nbsp;largely&nbsp;centred on&nbsp;ridding the internet of anonymity—forcing people to&nbsp;reveal their real names and identities&nbsp;when they engage online.&nbsp;But as&nbsp;Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>,&nbsp;recently pointed out on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lock and Code&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/podcast/2021/03/defending-online-anonymity-and-speech-with-eva-galperin-lock-and-code-s02e03/">Malware Bytes</a> podcast,&nbsp;removing anonymity&nbsp;unacceptably risks&nbsp;exposing the world’s most vulnerable populations.&nbsp;And that’s where we start to see that anonymity isn’t all evil for its shielding of malicious actors&nbsp;(a common charge); it’s also&nbsp;an essential protection&nbsp;for those who need it most.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms Galperin says: “Being able to speak anonymously is extremely important for people in vulnerable populations, for people with unpopular opinions, for minorities, for women, for anybody whose identity is non-standard.”&nbsp;Included in that, she says, are survivors of domestic and sexual abuse, whistleblowers, and human rights activists working against oppressive governments.&nbsp;For these&nbsp;people, anonymity&nbsp;can be&nbsp;essential because,&nbsp;she&nbsp;says, “the systems are not there to protect vulnerable communities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms Galperin points out anonymous speech and pseudonyms are “an extremely important tool for people who want to speak truth to power.” Journalists can do more dangerous reporting;&nbsp;whistleblowers&nbsp;can lift the lid on corporate malfeasance and so on.&nbsp;For&nbsp;domestic abuse survivors,&nbsp;anonymity allows vital sharing of experiences.&nbsp;“Often speech is the only outlet survivors have because often abuse is difficult to prove … and accusations often come a long time after the abuse. Getting legal action or even action by police on sexual abuse is incredibly difficult.” She says this action often doesn’t result in consequences for the abuser that are proportional to what they’ve done,&nbsp;“so all survivors can do is tell their stories.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we remove anonymity online,&nbsp;we remove that vital outlet.&nbsp;“Not only will they not be able to tell their stories, they also won’t be able to continue hiding from their abusers. One major concern is ‘how am I going to continue my life online without continuing to be harassed by [my] abuser’?&nbsp;Starting new&nbsp;social media, getting a new phone …&nbsp;having a pseudonym, hiding …&nbsp;are&nbsp;all important to these communities,” Ms Galperin says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms Galperin says using real identities online won’t make the internet a safer place&nbsp;for anyone.&nbsp;She argues many people happily post harassing content under their own names all the time so&nbsp;revealing their identitywouldn’t deter their behavior.&nbsp;Further,&nbsp;users&nbsp;need to be able to compartmentalize their&nbsp;personal and professional lives&nbsp;so they can express themselves&nbsp;safely&nbsp;in different forums. Ms Galperin says: “We don’t have one single incorporated identity. We’re often different people to co-workers, school friends, church etc. That’s fine.&nbsp;But jumbling all those identities together&nbsp;[to use a single, real online identity]&nbsp;can result in really negative consequences.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another&nbsp;long mooted solution&nbsp;to online abuse&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;abandon&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230">S. 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a>, which&nbsp;protects companies that publish or republish third party content&nbsp;and,&nbsp;as Ms Galperin points out,&nbsp;“has enabled social media platforms and our current media environment to thrive.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>CDA 230&nbsp;says&nbsp;“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider”&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">47 U.S.C. § 230</a>).&nbsp;This means, any platform that allows users to post content online (e.g.&nbsp;Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok),&nbsp;is&nbsp;not legally responsible for that content.&nbsp;They don’t have to&nbsp;take down&nbsp;defamatory/abusive/inflammatory&nbsp;content (except where content is copyrighted) and they can’t be sued for what others say on their platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People see&nbsp;[CDA 230]&nbsp;as problematic, because they think&nbsp;[removing ]it would rein in Big Tech and&nbsp;social media&nbsp;companies … but it is not a special law just for SM companies.&nbsp;These protections are essential to everyone and to competitors to Facebook, Twitter etc. Getting rid of it is not going to help.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, Ms Galperin points out that “issues&nbsp;with CDA&nbsp;230 are really issues with&nbsp;the First&nbsp;Amendment.”&nbsp;When&nbsp;you&nbsp;engage&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;platform, it’s not your free speech rights that apply, it’s the platform’s. This means the platform owners&nbsp;can say&nbsp;what they want and remove whatever content they want.&nbsp;Abolishing&nbsp;CDA 230 won’t matter because platform owners can still apply their rights under&nbsp;the&nbsp;First&nbsp;Amendment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Most of our speech online now takes place on platforms controlled by someone else. Companies are entirely within their free speech rights to edit, ban, leave out whatever they want. Users’ rights are largely limited.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a nutshell, if we&nbsp;change the laws and&nbsp;make companies, particularly Big Tech,&nbsp;liable for their users’ content,&nbsp;they&nbsp;could&nbsp;become&nbsp;“extremely cautious and hyper moderated”, and again this removes one of the few safe outlets vulnerable people have to express their experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Survivors need to publish their story on someone else’s platform.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;often the only option survivors have for anything even vaguely resembling justice&nbsp;…&nbsp;Then if there’s no CDA&nbsp;230&nbsp;…&nbsp;now the survivor is completely silenced,”&nbsp;Ms Galperin said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As&nbsp;Lock and Code&nbsp;podcaster&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/podcast/2021/03/defending-online-anonymity-and-speech-with-eva-galperin-lock-and-code-s02e03/">David Ruiz</a>&nbsp;asked:&nbsp;So if&nbsp;using real names and changing the law won’t work, what will?&nbsp;What&nbsp;would make the internet a&nbsp;safer space for survivors?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms Galperin says it’s about makers of tools and platforms taking responsibility&nbsp;for their products’ effects on vulnerable users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Primarily the onus for&nbsp;making&nbsp;safe platforms is on the makers of platforms&nbsp;and the onus for safer tools and IoT objects is on their makers … I encourage them to&nbsp;think about how their&nbsp;tool will be used for harassment, how&nbsp;this tool&nbsp;will be used by&nbsp;a&nbsp;domestic abuser,&nbsp;to&nbsp;think about empowering the user to get away from someone they used to trust&nbsp;who also used to use this tool with them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, she points to messaging: “One&nbsp;of the&nbsp;most important&nbsp;things&nbsp;is if you have a way of sending messages through your platform please make it possible for people not to use their real names. Ideally make it possible so they don’t have to hand over their&nbsp;phone number&nbsp;…&nbsp;and to block other users or mute certain keywords. If you give the power to the user, they can decide what is harassment and what is abuse and&nbsp;it really&nbsp;takes&nbsp;the&nbsp;onus off&nbsp;the&nbsp;makers&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;platform to be judge, jury and executioner&nbsp;for every&nbsp;communication that somebody&nbsp;has online.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re already seeing a lot of positive movement in making it better for users&nbsp;online. Ms Galperin points to&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;like EFF&nbsp;and&nbsp;Malware&nbsp;Bytes, and we’d add&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/01/anonyome-labs-sudo-safe-program-supports-at-risk-users/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;to the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Anonyome Labs, our solutions help mitigate tech-facilitated violence and abuse. We empower people to be able to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. We provide survivors and those at risk of harassment, violence and abuse, real and effective tools for protecting their personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2020, we proudly became a partner of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/anonyome-labs-joins-global-fight-against-stalkerware/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>, a global working group uniting advocacy groups, software developers, security firms, victims and survivors, in the fight to protect consumers against stalkerware and to eliminate abusive technology and software.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>OneTrust, provider of data privacy, security, and governance solutions has announced that it will acquire Convercent, an enterprise GRC solution with an ethics and compliance portal. Slotting itself as a strategic acquisition, the two companies will be aligning and merging their products to actualize trust for the enterprise. The deal is intended to be finalized in mid-April.</p>
 Expanding the ways to build trust 
<p>Building trust is a multifaceted task that encompasses the relationships an organization has with all stakeholders. OneTrust works with a trust framework where establishing trust and assessing risk of third-party vendors is at the foundation. There are also compulsory elements of trust like maintaining adequate security and compliance. The relational aspect of trust is powerfully influenced by transparency, ensuring privacy, and taking measurable action on environmental and social issues. The acquisition bolsters OneTrust’s activities in the third-party due diligence and GRC domains, and helps to make progress for new products: OneTrust Ethics and OneTrust ESG.</p>
<p>Third-party risk solutions are becoming ever more urgent, especially those that support supply chain management and accounting for supplier risk. COVID-19 showed the massive impacts on supply chains, which is only the most recent and most visible example of how unforeseen disruptions to a supply chain can wreak havoc. Pressures to manage vendor relationships come both from regional initiatives, such as the German<a href="https://lieferkettengesetz.de/" title="Lieferkettengesetz"> Lieferkettengesetz</a>, and from large enterprises that can put stringent requirements on their suppliers. There is a clear and growing market for such vendor risk management solutions.</p>
<p>To communicate and operationalize the trust reputation of a company, OneTrust Ethics is intended to function like a privacy portal. It will handle the communications, ethics policies, requests, and even gamification of taking ethical action. This could be employee facing as a centralized, standardized, and private way of handling ethics cases, as well as being vendor or customer facing as well.</p>
<p>OneTrust ESG is a groundbreaking product aiming to standardize reporting on environmental, social, and governance initiatives. This product will begin by assisting in reporting specific environmental initiatives, like when an enterprise makes a net zero carbon emission pledge. The product will assist in normalizing data from utility bills, collaborate with remediation providers, and work to provide transparent and standardized reporting the initiative’s progress. This product will eventually expand to cover other environmental and social initiatives like empowering diversity in the workplace. While it is a conservative approach towards measuring corporate ESG initiatives, simply providing support in standardizing reporting is a huge step forward.</p>
<p>Both of these are timely additions because corporations are under regulatory pressure and intense public scrutiny to protect whistleblowers, demonstrate meaningful action in diversity or sexual harassment cases, and show commitment to environmental causes. Contributions to establish metrics and define reasonable expectations of enterprises to create public value come from entities like the <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_IBC_Measuring_Stakeholder_Capitalism_Report_2020.pdf" title="World Economic Forum">World Economic Forum</a> and nonprofits such as <a href="https://yourpublicvalue.org/principles/" title="Your Public Value">Your Public Value</a>. OneTrust joins the effort by striving to provide resources for transparent reporting and internal structures to mitigate risk.</p>
 Focus on growth 
<p>OneTrust has seen rapid growth overall of its original portfolio consisting of privacy, preference, GRC, and third-party risk management solutions. There will be continued development to expand the privacy platform to stay current with the increasing global privacy regulations. Convercent’s ethics and compliance solutions will be a recipient of this growth, with particular focus on R&amp;D and customer support.</p>

  <p>Recent web searches show the massive volume of unemployment insurance fraud occurring across the United States. The increase in unemployment claims due to job losses stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with aging IT systems, have led to an increase in identity theft, fraud, and loss of federal tax dollars. The State of <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/03/05/metro/ri-43-percent-unemployment-claims-were-suspected-or-confirmed-fraud/">Rhode Island</a> estimates 43% of its unemployment claims in the past year may be fraudulent. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-bdb79d54d86c3758650fa4f7163cebb2">California</a> lost over $11 billion dollars to fraud in the past year. Thousands of accounts that use Social Security numbers (SSN) as the primary account identifier have been stolen in <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/investigations/kare-11-investigates-unemployment-scam-targets-minnesotans/89-bdeb0212-01a0-419b-9fe8-02bd2770ab60">Minnesota</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 What’s Behind the Fraud? 

<p>There is no single answer, but the surge in COVID-19 related unemployment claims, stolen personally identifiable information (PII) from massive data breaches, and antiquated state unemployment systems that rely on out-of-date technology have generated the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-sees-spike-in-fraudulent-unemployment-insurance-claims-filed-using-stolen-identities">perfect storm</a> for unemployment fraud.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United States government recognizes that state unemployment insurance systems are in dire need of upgrades or replacement. To address this crisis, the U.S. Department of Labor recently <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20200901">announced</a> it will distribute $100 million dollars in funding to state agencies to help them combat fraud and recover improper payments. This is a good start, but a much more comprehensive plan is needed.&nbsp;</p>

 Legacy Applications&nbsp; 

<p>Some state unemployment insurance applications rely on technology that is at least 20 years old. This older technology does not provide an agile and efficient way for average citizens to quickly, securely, and safely access their unemployment claims. The systems are not user friendly, while many users want to log in to manage their claims using a smart device. Some states may not be in a position to upgrade their applications and systems until the pandemic surge in unemployment claims recedes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Legacy Identity and Access Management (IAM)&nbsp; 

<p>Deploying a modern identity and access management system on the front end of these legacy applications can help reduce fraud. Keeping the applications on premises and deploying an IAM solution in the cloud is the best approach. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-reports/forrester-study-hybrid-cloud-iam">Leading analysts</a> state that hybrid cloud and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/hybrid-iam">hybrid IAM</a> will continue to be the best approach in the coming years to support legacy systems. Legacy applications will continue to prevail until they are migrated to either SaaS applications or applications developed in DevSecOps.</p>

 The ForgeRock Approach 

<p>ForgeRock protects several state unemployment systems with millions of constituents authenticating daily. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway">Identity Gateway</a> allows state governments to continue using their legacy unemployment applications with a more modern approach by providing an authentication framework for legacy applications. By coupling Identity Gateway with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">Identity Management</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">Access Management</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access</a>, state agencies now have a modern, more secure, and agile <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">IAM platform</a> that will meet their needs.&nbsp;</p>

 “Identity and Access Management is a key foundation in modernizing unemployment insurance.”    

 — Mike Wyatt, Cyber Risk Leader focusing on Identity Management and State Government at Deloitte 

 What Can States Do?&nbsp; 

<p>The U.S. Department of Labor has published <a href="https://oui.doleta.gov/dmstree/uipl/uipl2k4/uipl_2404.htm">guidelines</a> that reference the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST).</p>

<p>While these guidelines attempt to address commonly encountered flaws, they can be addressed more effectively by taking advantage of modern security tools such as those provided by ForgeRock. Here are the Labor Department’s recommendations and how ForgeRock can help:</p>

 1) Stop Using Social Security Numbers as a Constituent Login Method&nbsp; 

<p>Social Security numbers (SSN) can be compromised in a variety of ways, including stolen mail and breached databases. The best approach is for constituents to log in using a unique identifier instead of their SSN. Unique identifiers offer additional benefits, including having a user-friendly syntax with data that only the owners would possess. They can also be used in other programs within the state without the fear of disclosure to inappropriate agents.</p>

<p>If an email address is used as the login key, ForgeRock’s user validation and orchestration tools within <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">Identity Management</a> can provide the necessary assurance of the email’s accuracy. In combination with the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/intelligent-access-series-reduce-total-cost-of-fraud">fraud detection</a> analysis available in ForgeRock Intelligent Access, agencies can ensure that the email login key is unique and approved for use.&nbsp;</p>

 2) Implement Robust Password Policies&nbsp; 

<p>ForgeRock suggests having <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/knowledge/kb/article/a25369326">different password policies</a> based on different types of users. Although complex password policies are not considered user-friendly, many backend unemployment systems running on mainframes require passwords for access. ForgeRock’s user interface (UI) ensures that passwords meet your desired security parameters and support rigorous password refresh/reset policies when a user is going through registration, thereby maintaining a high level of confidence throughout the experience.&nbsp;</p>

 3) Implement Geo-Fencing 

<p>If a constituent is logging into the unemployment site from another state, that user should be flagged. Claimants should be in the state they are filing a claim in, ready and available for work. For example, if a login occurs from Montana for a New Jersey unemployment claim, this should be flagged as suspicious.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock Intelligent Access can use geolocation to verify that the user is logging in from a real location. For example, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">ForgeRock Access Management</a> can allow a login event to occur only if it is physically possible. This prevents a person from logging in from two widely separated locations within a timeframe when movement at that speed would be impossible. Intelligent Access user journeys can be designed to transparently <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/intelligent-access-series-reduce-total-cost-of-fraud">detect fraud</a> through behavioral biometrics. If a login attempt does not fit the established use patterns, it can require the person logging in to provide stronger assurance of their identity.&nbsp;</p>

 4) Enable Contextual and Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication 

<p>ForgeRock includes the cost of multi-factor authentication (MFA) with Intelligent Access, while other vendors charge for it. Most users now understand that MFA makes their login experience more secure, so they are generally willing to sign up for it. Depending on the perceived fraud risk and the type of transaction, ForgeRock Intelligent Access can also adjust the MFA method and require more validations if needed. Often, an MFA challenge requires minimal contribution from the user, for example, by using facial recognition through an iOS device along with a PIN.</p>

 5) Incorporate Identity Proofing Solutions 

<p>ForgeRock offers pre-built identity proofing solutions through its <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">Trust Network</a> partners. These vendors extend the digital experience by leveraging fast, accurate, and contextually driven flows. These journeys surpass the user validating experience achieved in face-to-face transactions and provide a global review of a person’s assertions to further decrease any chance of fraud. The dynamic nature of the ForgeRock identity proofing flow enables organizations to fine-tune proof of identity. This ensures the level of assurance always corresponds to the level of access or the type of assets a user may need to reach. The experience encountered is tailored to the type of user and the risk associated with the flow, without the need for manual interventions from state agents.</p>

<p>There’s no question that the applications and IAM systems behind state unemployment agencies desperately need to be modernized. ForgeRock has the technology to make unemployment insurance better, stronger, and faster.</p>

<p>Benjamin Cox (Ben) was a lawyer and a working partner at an up-and-coming law firm in New York City. He was born in the inner city of NYC and had worked his way to this position.</p><p>At the same time, he had been sensing fatigue and a lack of interest in his work over the last few months. Today, in particular, he was not ready for work at all and decided to call in sick. Bored, he simply darted out of his apartment, took his car, and decided to go on a&nbsp;drive.</p><p>12 hours&nbsp;later…..</p><p>Ben was still driving. He was somewhere in Georgia and he booked into a hotel and spent the night contemplating his future. The next day, instead of driving back to NYC, he kept going in the other direction.</p><p>He had finally taken the plunge! Though there were many uncertainties, he knew he could handle it all as he had the emotional strength and more importantly, he had his verifiable credentials that could help him anywhere.</p><p>He got behind the wheels and started driving again. By the end of the day, he reached Houston! That night, the Houston Rockets were taking on the New York Knicks, and for the first time, he cheered for Rockets as he wanted to break away from the shackles of his life in NYC and anything that even remotely connected him to this&nbsp;city.</p><p>The next day dawned and Ben decided to go further south and drove right past the Mexican border between El Paso and Juarez. When he was asked to show his ID, he quickly turned to the <a href="https://medium.com/affinidi/protecting-your-drivers-license-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-25d22aeac05b">driver’s license verifiable credentials</a>. All that he had to do was share the verifiable presentation from his digital wallet to the border authorities, who in turn, checked for its validity and authenticity. Since these verifiable credentials were tamper-proof, the authorities had no qualms about his identity or the authenticity of his VCs, and approved his entry. So, just like that, Ben breezed into&nbsp;Mexico.</p><p>The next morning, the same story, and more driving! A couple of days later, he reached Cancun and decided to stay there for a few&nbsp;days.</p><p>While relaxing on the seaside one afternoon, he started feeling a bit nauseous, so he headed back to the hotel. As he was mulling over the possibilities, he realized he hadn’t been taking his regular meds for high blood pressure. He went to the local clinic to get a prescription for his restricted blood pressure drug. But the authorities there weren’t forthcoming to give the prescription, so Ben shared his <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/accessing-medical-records-anywhere-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-81a248f9b746">medical condition verifiable credentials</a> that proved his medical condition and his use of the drug. These VCs proved to be a life-saver as he was able to get a prescription for the restricted drug even in a different country!&nbsp;.</p><p>A week later, he decided it was time to decide what he really wanted to&nbsp;do.</p><p>He had no clue what, but it was definitely not back to NYC and the firm. With such thoughts, he picked up the local paper, and his eyes fell on an advertisement for an English-speaking guide in the small town of Barra de&nbsp;Potosi.</p><p>With a smile, Ben drove down to Barra and met the hotel manager at the Laguna de Potosi, the only hotel in this town of about 400 residents. Since it was a tourist town where hundreds of Americans landed each year to enjoy the watersports, the hotel was looking for a guide to talk to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Though Ben was over-qualified and his weekly pay was a pittance compared to what he was earning at NYC, he accepted it with all his heart! But there was a problem! To employ him, the hotel had to submit his ID and some proof that made him eligible for this&nbsp;job.</p><p>Verifiable credentials came to Ben’s rescue again as he dug through his digital wallet to find an English teaching <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">employment verifiable credential</a> he had done many years ago when he was a sophomore in college. He shared the verifiable credentials of his first job with the local labor department, and the officer was able to verify it based on the schema. This was deemed to be sufficient for the job and Ben started his new career as an English&nbsp;guide.</p><p>A week later, it was time for his pay and the hotel wanted to pay him through a bank account to avoid tax penalties. So, Ben had to open a bank account. But the bank manager wanted a ton of documents and all that Ben had to do was share his <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/opening-a-bank-account-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-53ea478b5414">verifiable credentials with the bank manager</a>. Ben created a verifiable presentation that contained all the documents that the bank wanted and shared this presentation with the bank manager. In turn, the manager checked the identity of the issuer and the validity of the documents, and opened the bank&nbsp;account.</p><p>Ben settled into a life of peace, solitude, and freedom. His law firm had given up searching for him and had moved on. Ben lived the rest of his life at Barra de Potosi, the magical place where he truly found&nbsp;himself.</p><p>So, what do you think is the reason for Ben’s serendipity? A stroke of luck?&nbsp;Destiny?</p><p>The real reason is verifiable credentials as it came in handy every step of the way. He had complete control over his credentials and could share it with just the entities he wanted to. Also, he had no plan and it would’ve been impossible to move seamlessly across international borders without his&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Think about it for a moment. No physical documents at all, but a simple and secure self-sovereign identity that Ben had complete control over. More importantly, look at the interoperability and flexibility as Ben could use them in different situations and across multiple platforms.</p><p>That’s the true power of&nbsp;VCs!</p><p>Do you think he could have changed his life so drastically without his VCs? What about your life? How can VCs help&nbsp;you?</p><p>Imagine the endless possibilities it can create for people and the society at&nbsp;large.</p><p>This is undoubtedly the future — a world of secure and portable credentials that individuals can control completely.</p><p>Are you ready to be a part of this&nbsp;future?</p><p>We have the building blocks on which you can build any VC-based application that you think will benefit everyone.

<p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are an important part of the <a href="https://tykn.tech/self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) technology stack. The DID is the lowest level on top of which other identity components such as <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (personal information or information about organisations and other entities) can be built. Using the SSI tech stack allows applications to use an interoperable identity that is driven by a well curated set of privacy and security knowledge. Using an SSI architecture brings privacy and security to digital human identity, and significantly removes technical and legal friction for governments, enterprise and SMEs.</p> DID:EOSIO specification

 The GiD Report#154 — Digital identity is cool now (Big Tech is&nbsp;not) <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-153-the-age-of-the-digital-wallet-has-arrived-76e32a1aba69">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  Digital identity is cool&nbsp;now  Athletes as Storytellers (via&nbsp;Greg)  The New Yorker explains Clubhouse  Microsoft wants to buy&nbsp;Discord  No one trusts Big&nbsp;Tech  Facebook’s massive data&nbsp;breach  This week in&nbsp;NFTs  Tweet of the week (digital wallet edition&nbsp;w/CZ)  Stuff happens   1. Digital identity is cool&nbsp;now. <p>Got a text from a friend this morning about the latest craze — a new platform called <a href="https://y.at/control-center">y.at</a> — let me know if you’d like an invite to check it&nbsp;out.</p><p>In a nutshell, Yat wants to turn unique emoji combos into universal identifiers:</p><blockquote>Yat lets you use emojis as your universal username and identity on the internet. Imagine being known as 🔥🐍 or 🤖👻👑 instead of coffeequeen98 or jake.smith2438@gmail.com.</blockquote><blockquote>By owning a Yat — let’s say 🌊🔱🌴 — it’s yours forever. You are the ~only~ one on earth who owns these&nbsp;emojis.</blockquote><blockquote>The possibilities are endless with Yat. You can receive payments, use it on your socials, and eventually much more. Your Yat can be used as a link like this: https://y.at/🌊🔱🌴 (click it to see it!) and automatically redirect visitors to any website you&nbsp;want.</blockquote><p>Now, it’s unclear to me how natural or intuitive it is to associate people with emojis — but it’d be easy to dismiss me as a boomer. (The fact that the platform is selling off emoji combos based on their own internal score for rarity makes it feel like a bit of a short term cash grab. Although my friend did buy his own emoji real estate for $120, apparently.)</p><blockquote>“I don’t know, man. It seems like a low risk/high reward thing. People are hype on it! I’m just trying to be an early adopter. It’s called an investment, my&nbsp;dude.”</blockquote><p>At the very least, there’s a compelling narrative here about digital identity — how it’s becoming more playful/fun/compelling in a way that’s attracting mainstream attention. People are actively thinking about this stuff. They’re willing to engage in new ideas. Most of all, they understand why identity is so important.</p><p>Here’s <a href="http://global.id/m">/m</a>’s&nbsp;take:</p><blockquote>Maybe it’s just me as I don’t use emojis much (except for 10 of them). They are really hard to find. Some of them are also very similar (e.g. skin tones, small changes) so I see a lot of problems with this. I guess this might be much easier for anyone that knows e.g. Chinese and Japanese characters but learning an alphabet with more than 3000 characters won’t be easy. But this might be where the 🌎 is going&nbsp;😉</blockquote> 2. We need an identity. We want a&nbsp;voice. <p>Here’s the New Yorker from <a href="http://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> on <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/05/the-rise-of-the-athlete-podcaster">The Rise of the Athlete Podcaster</a>:</p><blockquote>In the past, if athletes wanted to speak candidly, they would write a tell-all book, do a sit-down interview, maybe phone in to a radio show. If they aspired to work in media, they would try to land a cushy network job, providing expert commentary or analysis. But the Internet, which allows any of us to air the slightest thought, has changed those rules. Players have grown infatuated with sharing their perspectives in real time, in direct, unfiltered ways. Retired greats have realized that they possess endless content — stories, memories, behind-the-scenes morsels — that fans crave. And athletes everywhere are seizing the means of production. Around the time that Jeter launched the Tribune, LeBron James got funding for a new company, Uninterrupted. Its aim was to produce content from players’ points of view, and to show that those players could be “more than an athlete.” People like Jeter and James no longer had to settle for being talking heads. Now they barely had to settle for sports at&nbsp;all.</blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1379061143495381000">Greg’s take</a>:</p><blockquote>“Athletes as Storytellers — one more indication that the world is getting flatter.”</blockquote> 3. This week at the Clubhouse (naturally) <p>Here’s the New Yorker — <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/in-the-clubhouse">Clubhouse Feels Like a&nbsp;Party</a>:</p><blockquote>Here would be the place to speak of the history of mass communication; to produce historical analogues for Clubhouse, such as call-in radio shows, the teen party lines of the nineteen-eighties, and the Agora; to cite Habermas or Gramsci and nod to Marshall McLuhan. I kept thinking of a minor section in Don DeLillo’s “White Noise,” from 1985, in which the narrator completes an A.T.M. transaction and experiences a sparkling moment of integration with the global financial apparatus: “The system was invisible, which made it all the more impressive, all the more disquieting to deal with. But we were in accord, at least for now. The networks, the circuits, the streams, the harmonies.”</blockquote><blockquote>This was basically how it felt to be on Clubhouse. With each new experience — a lullaby room, in which most avatars wore the same cartoon, baby-blue nightcap; a beatboxing and freestyle session between musical-theatre performers; a “dopamine reset” silent meditation, which was actually silent — I felt increasingly as if the app, whose creators have not articulated any particular theory of technology or media, belonged to a great, surging&nbsp;lineage.</blockquote><blockquote>In 1999, John Durham Peters, who is now a professor of English and film and media studies at Yale, published “Speaking Into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication.” “In richer societies, much of our interaction is enabled by interpersonal media such as email and telephone,” he wrote — forums “in which the broadcast and the interactive are hard to tell apart.” In such a society, where the boundary between mass communication and in-person conversation is more porous, everyday talk can assume the tones and tics of media. “In private life, many of us talk like Beckett characters,” Peters wrote, while “in public discourse, celebrities present themselves as if they are our friends.” When we spoke, over the phone, he had not yet used Clubhouse. Still, he considered parallels to the use of CB radio among truckers in the nineteen-seventies, to the Sandinistas’ experimental shows in the eighties, and to French salons. He contemplated feminist scholarship on the synchronization of soap operas and domestic labor, and described the inside-out dynamic of advice columnists — the “structural inversion of the single voice crying out, and the advice columnist crying out to everyone all at&nbsp;once.”</blockquote><blockquote>“In the nineties, you were stigmatized if you were a lurker, but this legitimates the listener,” Peters said, of Clubhouse. “Listening is a democratic thing. It’s not passive. It’s one of the hardest things we do.” The concept also reminded him of shortwave radio. “Very early on, you had amateurs talking back and forth to each other, first in Morse code, then in voice,” he said. “You could presume intimacy because very few people had the receiving equipment. That’s sort of the same idea as Clubhouse. Not everybody has the receiving equipment. They don’t have&nbsp;access.”</blockquote><p>Like I said, it’s the New&nbsp;Yorker.</p><p>And as you all know by now, everyone is Clubhouse — Via MIT Tech&nbsp;Review:</p><blockquote>+ LinkedIn is working on a Clubhouse clone. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/?mc_cid=14aab0a479&amp;mc_eid=cd5d02dae9">TechCrunch</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>+ And so is Spotify.

<p>We talked with our co-founder and CTO <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a> about her unusual career path, amazing achievements and experiences as a woman in tech. Read on to get to know one of our favorite fearless leaders. </p> Q. Can you tell us about your programming journey and your career in computer science/development? <p>A. &nbsp;I have a weird winding path to programming, and kind of "fell into it".</p><p>I started out as a classical music composer (this is relevant for a few reasons, as you'll see). Back in music school, I had the best Photoshop/Illustrator skills in my cohort, so I ended up making a bunch of the concert posters and programmes (back when they were paper). I was also a very interested in the technical aspects of music: What made it tick? What are the underlying structures? How many lines of polyphony can I write while keeping it coherent? Turns out that this is a lot of related theory to CS.</p><p>Many years later, I ended up at a startup doing graphic design. You end up doing a little bit of everything at startups, and they asked me I'd be willing to implement parts of the designs I was making. So I read a book that weekend, and showed up on Monday writing HTML/CSS and a tiny bit of jQuery. It turns out that I was better at that than design, and so I switched to development.</p><p>This was back before it was clear that Node would win the JS-on-the-server space. We were using a JVM-based framework that let you write in a dozen-or-so JVM-based languages, so I had to learn a bunch of languages early on to contribute to this project: Java, JS (Rhino), JRuby, Groovy, Clojure, and a couple more. I got really into Clojure, and thus into functional programming, and started reading the classic CS literature from the 70s and 80s. I quickly became a programming language nerd, which means also picking up a bunch of related CS. The rest, as they say, is history 😉</p><p></p><p></p> Q. Could you share an example of a hurdle or obstacle you experienced during your developer journey and how you overcame it? <p>A. You know, I honestly don't feel like I've have a ton of the classic blockers in my career! I'm very passionate about what I do, and work feels like play. The hardest part has been self-inflicted burnout. Burnout is the flip side of being so enthusiastic about my work: I take on a ton and work myself into the ground. I've burned out several times, and it's deeply unpleasant. </p><p>I'm learning to take better care of myself, but it's an internal struggle of short-term vs long-term. When people talk about mindfulness, you usually think of meditating and clearing your mind to focus on the here and now, but the bigger part of that for me is recognizing when I'm red-lining too much and eustress is turning into distress.</p><p></p><p></p> Q. You are one of the industry's most sought after keynote speakers. How did that come to be and how are you received as woman speaker in a male-dominated industry? <p>A. I think that I ended up keynoting conferences for a couple reasons: I was pretty engaged in tech community organizing, so I was fairly visible. I have a fair bit of public speaking experience, so I generally can generally (but not always :P) put together a coherent presentation. Finally, I like to push the boundaries of my tools, so I've done some OSS work that folks have found interesting (e.g. Witchcraft, Exceptional).</p>Brooklyn Zelenka keynoting at a 2017 event<p></p><p>I've definitely experienced sexism in tech, though as my career has progressed and I've become more visible, there's less of that. There have been comments that the women speaking at conferences are just there to fill a quota. I've had comments on talk feedback forms that were just one word: "girl", or people assuming that I'm Boris' assistant during a workshop about a technical standard that I developed. I've at times overcompensated by trying to "look the part" with programmer joke t-shirts and hoodies. Now, I'm pretty nerdy by nature, and I do like these things, but there's also a level of defense mechanism there.</p><p>That said, on the whole, people have been incredibly nice and supportive! Part of this choice of communities -- I just don't have time for constantly fighting, so I go where the people are friendly!</p><p></p><p></p> Q. What advice would you give young women about a career in tech? <p>A. Honestly: just try it! I've spoken to a bunch of women over the years that just don't see themselves as the unfeeling, uncreative, evil-genius programmers that our culture likes to portray. I had the same bias! It turns out that programming is a very broad field. It's also extremely creative, and provides a ton of flexibility. Yes, bad programming jobs exist, but you have way more agency and power than really any other career I can think of: you can really choose your own adventure. It's not even that hard to get started, though like any skill, learning the basics is the hardest part. Just try it; it's much better than you think!</p><p></p><p></p> Q. What has been your biggest career and/or personal achievement? <p>A. Wow, that's a hard one! I feel really lucky to have done a lot of things that I find meaningful, from activism to building products to seeing the world as a digital nomad. I think my biggest success has been forging my own path: choosing interesting experiences over cash, curating where I spend my energy to support communities that I care about, and learning as much as possible.</p><p></p> <p>Thanks to Brooklyn for taking the time to answer questions about her background and career. Over the next months Fission will be sharing profiles of each of our awesome team members with the community. Fission's team is one of its biggest strengths and we want to give them each a moment to shine. </p><p>Interested in learning more about the Fission community? <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">Visit the Fission events page</a> to sign up to get notified about new events, and join us most Thursdays for new tech talks.</p>

  The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) has selected IDunion for the second phase of the innovation competition “Showcase Secure Digital Identities”.  The three-year implementation phase began on April 1, 2021.&nbsp;  The goals of this new project phase includes the establishment of a European cooperative, the launch of a production network and the implementation of 40+ different pilot applications from several areas.  



<p>Frankfurt am Main, April 6, 2021 – IDunion, an open ecosystem for trusted identities, entered its second project phase funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy on April 1, 2021 as part of the innovation competition “<a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Redaktion/EN/Standardartikel/sdi_programm.html">Showcase Secure Digital Identities</a>”. With these showcase projects, the German Federal Government aims to promote the development of digital solutions for identity management in Germany within the framework of an innovation competition. This competition is based on the framework “<a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/edt_bekanntmachung_foerderrahmen.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3">Development of Digital Technologies</a>“. The aim of this competition is to develop and test outstanding approaches, which are designed for everyday use and are usable in a wide range of possible applications in the field of secure digital identities.</p>



<p>Based on the concept of self-sovereign identities (SSI), IDunion has set itself the goal of establishing an ecosystem for natural and legal persons as well as things. Use cases in a wide range of areas will therefore be piloted in the following areas: education, e-commerce, mobility, e-government, e-health, finance, identity &amp; access management (IAM) and industry/IoT. Some further concrete examples of applications are the following: the derivation of the ID card into available wallets, campus management and educational credentials for students, legal identities for companies or product identities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the network has several other ambitious goals, such as building a comprehensive framework to further develop trust in the underlying technology. In addition to this, the partners are working together on the conception and implementation of security-related aspects. The wallets and other software applications developed within the consortium will also be further enhanced to ensure an optimal user experience and a wider distribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A European cooperative will be established and will serve as a legal entity for the management of the network and the operation of the ecosystem. The cooperative will act in the interest of all members and will be a non-for-profit organisation. A draft of the statutes, which constitutes the set of rules for the members, can be found <a href="https://nextcloud.idunion.org/s/38weYaGtSMSRwJQ">here</a>.</p>



<p>Within this innovation competition, the following partners are funded:&nbsp; </p>



  Bank-Verlag GmbH,  Bundesdruckerei GmbH,&nbsp;  DB Systel GmbH,&nbsp;  Deutsche Telekom AG  esatus AG,&nbsp;  GS1 Germany GmbH,&nbsp;  ING-DiBa AG,&nbsp;  Main Incubator GmbH,&nbsp;  Robert Bosch GmbH,&nbsp;  Siemens AG,&nbsp;  Stadt Köln,&nbsp;  Spherity GmbH,&nbsp;  Technische Universität Berlin,&nbsp;  Institut für Internet-Sicherheit (Westfälische Hochschule) und  YES Payment Services GmbH.  



<p>The following institutions are associated partners:&nbsp;</p>



  51nodes GmbH,&nbsp;  Berlin Partner für Wirtschaft und Technologie GmbH,  Berliner Senatsverwaltung für Wirtschaft, Energie und Betriebe,  Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge,  BWI GmbH,  CodeCamp:N GmbH,  Commerzbank AG,&nbsp;  CompuGroup Medical Software GmbH,  D-Trust GmbH,  Datarella GmbH,&nbsp;  DATEV eG,  Deutsche Bank AG,  Deutsche Post AG,&nbsp;  Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband e.

 Opening a Bank Account — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials <p>Opening a bank account is something that we have all done at some point in our lives. Though over the years, the process has become a lot simpler, still it entails a ton of documents to prove your identity.</p><p>At the bare minimum, you’d&nbsp;need,</p>  A piece of government-issued identification to prove your&nbsp;identity  Your Social Security Number or a Taxpayer Identification Number  <p>Carrying these documents is a hassle because they can get lost or damaged in transit. Plus, it is highly risky in the event of theft because your Personally Identifiable Information can fall into the wrong&nbsp;hands.</p><p>A more secure and easier way to share your information for opening a bank account could be through verifiable credentials.</p> How to Use VCs to Open a Bank&nbsp;Account? <p>Here is a sample workflow on how verifiable credentials can be used to open a bank&nbsp;account.</p><p>There are three entities to these transactions, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Issuer — A startup company that collates all the government-issued documents and stores them in the form of a verifiable credential. A good example would be DigiLocker from the Government of India that provides access to authentic digital documents to citizen’s digital document&nbsp;wallets.  Holder — The individual/company/entity looking to open a bank account. In this sample use case, let’s assume this entity is an 18-year old girl opening a bank account for the first&nbsp;time.  Verifier — The bank where the holder wants to open an&nbsp;account  <p>As a first step, the holder logs into the issuer’s portal and submits a request for verifiable credentials. After checking the holder’s identity and request, the issuer sends a QR code to the holder, and in turn, the holder scans the code and saves the information in her digital&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>The scanned information would look something like&nbsp;this:</p>Sample VC<p>When the verifier requests the documents, the holder creates a verifiable presentation of her SSN/TIN and any other government ID and sends it. Finally, the verifier examines the schema to determine the authenticity and validity of these documents. Specifically, the verifier checks the following.</p>  Is the credential in a format that’s acceptable for the verifier?  Does it contain the data that the verifier needs such as information that identifies the holder, the credibility of the issuer, and&nbsp;more?  Is the data still&nbsp;valid?  Are the credentials issued by a trusted&nbsp;issuer?  Do the credentials or its signature provide the cryptographic proof that the holder is the subject of this verifiable presentation?  <p>If the verifiable presentation sent by the holder meets these criteria, the verifier approves the application for account opening, and the holder can start transacting through&nbsp;it.</p><p>This sample workflow gives you a glimpse into the world of self-sovereign identity, where an entity has complete control over his or her credentials and can choose to share these secure and tamper-proof identities with the appropriate entities.</p><p>Does this enthuse you to create SSI applications that can change the face of our&nbsp;society?</p><p>Check out how <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api">Affinidi’s APIs</a> can help you get&nbsp;started.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/opening-a-bank-account-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-53ea478b5414">Opening a Bank Account — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>NOTE: Beginning this week, we’re trying something new with the Dev Pulse. We’re going to start publishing smaller pieces more regularly. We think this will make them both fresher and more digestible.</p><p>This week we rolled out an update to all HoloPorts. The most visible changes are in the UI of Elemental Chat, our demo app. Users now have ‘identicons’ beside their name; these auto-generated avatars are based on their actual agent ID in the Holochain network and can’t be forged. This is important because usernames are just labels; you can set yours to anything you like, even someone else’s name. If you’re talking to a friend and suddenly their identicon looks slightly different, there’s a good chance someone is trying to impersonate your friend.</p><p>This is an example of how cryptographically-secured data is a good first step to <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/is-holochain-a-safe-haven-for-dangerous-extremists-or-a-beacon-of-hope-for-accountability-fcbb8f5d38c6">ensuring authenticity and accountability</a> without the need for a central authority.</p><p>There are some under-the-hood changes to Elemental Chat as well. The network stats are calculated more accurately (you can see them by clicking that graph icon in the upper-right corner). And the real-time performance of chatting (using <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/concepts/9_signals/">signals</a>) has been tweaked to be more efficient; this should result in a small performance improvement.</p><p>Under the hood, the HoloPort’s operating system is using a new version of Holochain RSM. The reason this matters is that it prepares us for the next infrastructure milestone: hosted hApps! The speedups so far are modest, but we expect that other near-term updates will make Holochain substantially faster, fast enough to support thousands of users per app.</p><p>These future updates will include:</p>  A switch to a new storage engine based on <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>, the world’s <a href="https://sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">most popular</a> database engine. I know, I know, last year we said we were switching to LMDB because it was the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/a-new-holochain-developer-release/#seen-in-dev-team-land-upcoming-initiatives">best</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/announcing-and-unpacking-the-new-holochain/#a-tighter-tech-stack">thing</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holofuel-enters-community-testing-phase/#how-far-have-we-come-so-far">ever</a>. And in comparable tests (hash table lookups) it does outperform SQLite. But we need more than just hash table lookups — we need fast querying with arbitrary filter parameters. This is especially important if we want to do <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/concepts/4_dht/#finding-peers-and-data-in-a-distributed-database">neighbourhood sharding</a> well. And sharding will lift the lid on scaling, allowing hApp networks to grow far beyond what traditional blockchains can reasonably handle.  The proxy server, which helps HoloPorts and Holochain users punch through home firewalls, is in the midst of a large rewrite. So far, benchmarks predict that it’ll be 5× faster for raw throughput, at the very least. Once this is deployed, it will enable us to see places where DHT gossip and validation performance need to be improved.  <p>For developers, all of the above means that Holo hosting is on its way. The <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/web-sdk/">Holo Web SDK</a> is being readied for public use as well, and we’re exploring the possibility of offering automated hApp testing services in a real hosting network on real HoloPorts.</p> Special note for hApp devs <p>The <code>develop</code> branch of Holochain has advanced quite a bit past <code>main</code> in the past month or two, bringing features like the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-tools-in-the-works/"><code>hc</code> dev tool and hApp bundles</a>. For that reason, I’m now recommending that you use <code>https://nightly.holochain.love</code> to install/enter the development shell. Also, take note that we might be changing installation URLs in the future, but we’ll always keep the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install">installation guide</a> up to date for you.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pawel_czerwinski?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Paweł Czerwiński</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/paint?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

Institutions are now coming aboard. The momentum we see today is more justified than that of 2017’s, during the days of the ICOs. Today’s momentum is here to stay, and that’s exciting.

<p>I’d like to take a dive into the deep end and talk about the regulatory shift — no pun intended — that is happening today because Bitcoin has performed exactly as we expected. Institutions are now coming aboard. The momentum we see today is more justified than that of 2017’s, during the days of the ICOs. Today’s momentum is here to stay, and that’s exciting. That’s why there is a regulatory shift happening.</p><p>The ecosystem has started to understand the implications of the ongoing regulatory shift. That fact that crypto doesn’t fit into the regulatory box is the problem. Bitcoin doesn’t operate in the same context as traditional finance. The space must figure out how to merge these two, disparate worlds together and create a&nbsp;bridge.</p><p>There will be an intersection at which blockchain and traditional finance meet, and we’re at that Goldilocks moment now. In the children’s story, she tastes three different porridges and finds that she prefers the porridge which is neither too hot nor too cold, but just the right temperature. The question is, What is “just the right amount” of regulation when it comes to blockchain?</p><p>From 2010–2016, there was an impression given that the crypto ecosystem was untouchable, invincible, censorship resistance, and much more. The whole Honey Badger sentiment, which states that Bitcoin will progress no matter what had a few flaws. For one, Bitcoin doesn’t care what anyone thinks. Bitcoin itself is censorship resistant, but its users are not honey badgers, we are bound and influenced by the policies and regulations that shape the societies we live in, and if we don’t get that right, we as a society lose in our ability to utilize at scale what bitcoin and our industry fixes and&nbsp;enables.</p><p>I had a very deep conviction that the traditional world could make impactful and negative changes to our ecosystem, and influence the future of blockchain. In 2017, there were no early crypto OGs working on the regulatory challenge, ensuring it progresses the right&nbsp;way.</p><p>Over the next several years, the ecosystem continued to grow, causing the regulatory landscape too swiftly become the main battleground for blockchain. We must work with international organizations to educate them and drive the ecosystem into the&nbsp;light.</p><p>While lobbying on behalf of the industry, I began in 2016 to look at the problem from a technical perspective. I saw the demand for a blockchain identity infrastructure which preserves openness, decentralization, and the privacy of individuals, and began work thereupon.</p><p>This work comes with tradeoffs. For instance, full anonymization and privacy of money is a big ask in a world that combats terrorist financing. Whether you like Know Your Customer (KYC) or not, it is a function of how institutions operate, just like they must adhere to securities law, international taxation, and so on. Since KYC is a critical requirement when it comes to open payment systems, you can imagine how the regulations would&nbsp;evolve.</p><p>However, our ecosystem doesn’t work the way to which they are accustomed. Their traditional approach to regulation will transform the ecosystem into something barely recognizable. We can avoid that, however, it’s a battle with lots of complexity. There’s plenty to overcome. The challenge requires collaboration amongst the blockchain industry.</p><p>Tackling the problem isn’t as attractive as DeFi or NFTs, but this battle has the potential to empower the space to move forward. We need open infrastructure and tools that support the ecosystem and the cointegration.</p><p>Written By Joseph Weinberg, Co-Founder, Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p><p>About Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p>Shyft Network is a public protocol designed to aggregate and embed trust, validation and discoverability into data stored on public and private ecosystems, and facilitate information transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks.

  The HYPR Cloud Platform 6.10 helps organizations keep up with internal and external compliance regulations.

<p>The HYPR Spring Release (6.10) brings exciting new features and enhancements for a stable, secure, and simple passwordless experience. From improving the user experience to adding security features that’ll make compliance auditors smile, the HYPR Spring Release creates a clear and safe path to passwordless security.</p>
      
<p>Addressing Security &amp; Compliance</p>
      
<p>HYPR strives to ensure the most secure passwordless experience without disrupting the user experience. HYPR is a favorite of end-users because they’re able to employ their own smartphones to authenticate. This may give administrators pause, however, as admins have little to no control over the devices themselves.</p>
      
<p>To keep up with internal and external compliance regulations that our customers face, with our spring release HYPR has introduced admin-defined mobile version control to establish a minimum OS and HYPR mobile app version requirement that extends to the entire user base.</p>
      
 Enforce minimum OS requirements to maintain the latest security updates. 
      
<p>With these rules in place, users cannot pair devices or authenticate into protected resources without updating their device to the required version. To make the rollout process easy, administrators can define an authentication warning period during which users are still able to authenticate successfully, but are prompted to update their device or mobile application to avoid being blocked in the future.</p>
      
<p>HYPR has always had rules in place to prevent jailbroken devices being used for authentication. Jailbroken devices are prevented from running the HYPR mobile app as well as the HYPR mobile SDK. To further enhance security, our spring release brings additional enhancements to keep the solution up to date and secure. </p>
      
<p>Updated User Login Flows</p>
      
<p>When logging into web resources with HYPR, only devices that the user paired appear as an authentication option, making it easier to know which method to authenticate with. If the user has only one type of device paired, then HYPR automatically sends the request, reducing the required clicks during the flow.</p>
      
<p>In addition to a smoother web login experience, RDP users can now authenticate in a single step. By shifting more of the login control from Microsoft to HYPR, users are not burdened with unnecessary process points and are no longer wasting time in the login operation.</p>
      
<p>Finally, Mac users can rejoice as HYPR enables the use of Touch ID to unlock their Mac workstation. Touch ID is a FIDO-certified authentication method that employs the security of the platform biometrics to validate a user’s identity in lieu of a password. Combining this with HYPR unlock, all users can log into their computers with FIDO authentication with the methods that works best for them.</p>
      
<p>The Takeaway</p>
      
<p>HYPR continues to improve the user experience for end users as well as administrators who rely on ease of deployment and upgrade. Every second counts in performance and it is our goal to deliver lightning-fast experience at every HYPR touch point.</p>
      
<p>To learn more about what 6.10 has to offer, read our latest release notes for <a href="https://docs.hypr.com/installinghypr/docs/workforce-access-6100">Workforce Access 6.10</a> and <a href="https://docs.hypr.com/integratinghypr/docs/customer-authentication-6100">Customer Authentication 6.10</a>.

<p>Munich, 2 April 2021 – The decision of Bundesnetzagentur to allow AI (artificial intelligence) based identification methods for new use cases in Germany is a confirmation of IDnow’s platform strategy and at the same time a turning point in international competition for German technology companies.</p>
<p>With the publication “Video identification with automated procedure” for automated optical identity verification by Bundesnetzagentur in cooperation with the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), AI-based solutions for the verification of customers are now approved for certain use cases in Germany in addition to the proven methods. <a href="https://www.elektronische-vertrauensdienste.de/cln_111/EVD/DE/Fachkreis/ModulBest/ModulBest-start.html">(Order here.)</a></p>
<p>The published order is based on the German Trust Services Act, which implements the eIDAS Regulation in Germany. The catalogue of criteria published by Bundesnetzagentur and BSI prescribes high technology standards for automated identity verification. IDnow is one of the few European providers that has already been officially confirmed with other methods by Bundesnetzagentur within the scope of an accredited conformity assessment and is now also already working on the confirmation for AutoIdent.</p>
<p>IDnow has been using automated identification technology for many years. With its product IDnow AutoIdent, IDnow is one of the leading providers for automated identification in Germany. As early as 2012, IDnow filed a patent application for fully automated identification procedures, which has been granted by the European Patent Office. “We are pleased that the regulatory authorities have now finally opened up to technological development in Germany and we see our efforts and years of research into the development of our own AI technology confirmed,” says Armin Bauer, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of IDnow. In addition to this patent, IDnow holds other patents and patent applications at the European level.</p>
<p>IDnow’s technology uses so-called Deep Learning to perform an identification at the same security level as a personal identification – for example in a branch. For this purpose, the self-developed artificial intelligence, automatically recognises the security features of the ID documents in a video stream and performs a biometric face comparison of a video selfie with the ID document. This is complemented by new security mechanisms such as a “liveness detection” that prevents attacks through recorded videos and photos.</p>
<p>IDnow sees the regulator’s decision as an important step towards a digital society in Germany and as a fundamental turning point for German companies in international market comparison. The established and very successful services such as the electronic ID card, BankIdent or the VideoIdent procedure can now be supplemented with AI-based AutoIdent methods for new use cases. IDnow expects a significant change for German consumers: The new decree will make innovative technologies such as digital identities accessible to the broad population in the future – regardless of the individual citizen’s affinity for technology. This is because the new regulation enables platform companies such as IDnow to offer the appropriate digital methods for identity verification in each case.</p>
<p>“The decision of Bundesnetzagentur is an important milestone for platform companies like IDnow. In the future, IDnow, as one of the leading European platform providers, will be able to offer additional, automated identification methods to numerous other industries in Europe. This is an essential step towards a digital future in Germany and for Europe and shows that the time for secure digital identities has come,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow. “Consumer security is always at the forefront of the development of our procedures. For many years, we have therefore been actively working with various organisations in politics and regulation to jointly shape this secure, European future,” he adds.</p>
<p>IDnow is one of the leading providers of digital identities with a broad portfolio of products and solutions and identifies several million citizens per year with its platform. The portfolio includes identification methods from offline to online, from automated methods to procedures carried out by identity specialists, available flexibly online, offline in branches and even by a courier at the user’s doorstep. IDnow has expanded its role in recent years far beyond simply offering individual ident methods and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year.</p>
<p>Just last month, IDnow announced the acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, one of the leading international providers for on- and offline verification. This is the second acquisition in the last six months for IDnow and represents an important milestone on the way to becoming the leading identity platform in Europe. The acquisition of identity Trust Management AG enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Germany and beyond.</p>

 Accessing Medical Records Anywhere — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials <p>If there’s one thing we’ve learned from this COVID pandemic, it’s the importance of good health and the need to stay on top of our medical records at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>Whether it’s our vaccinations, prescriptions, medical tests, conditions, or even a history of doctor visits, keeping this information readily accessible has become imperative now than ever&nbsp;before.</p><p>At the same time, this is easier said than done as our medical records are all over the place (literally!). You’ll know this pain if you’ve moved from one state/country to another in the last few years because the medical records are stored only in the institution or physician’s office where it is generated. Though these are done partly to preserve privacy, transferring or giving access to these records is a whole different story altogether!</p><p>But all this can change with Verifiable Credentials and Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI).</p><p>For starters, verifiable credentials are a secure and accessible way to share your medical records with whomever you want. You can read more about verifiable credentials and how they work in this&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/affinidi/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">post</a>.</p><p>So, how do VCs work? How can you keep all your records in one place and share them within seconds to just those you&nbsp;want?</p><p>Let’s understand with a possible real-life scenario.</p><p>Lisa is on a business trip to London, and she suddenly feels dizzy and nauseous. The same night, she develops a high fever and decides to visit a nearby clinic. Now, the doctor suspects it to be a case of food poisoning and wants to know her medical history and pre-existing conditions before prescribing a medicine.</p><p>To give this information, Lisa simply logs into her wallet, creates a verifiable presentation of the medical records that the doctor wants, and shares it with the doctor. After looking at the records, the doctor finds that she is allergic to sulfide and prescribes a mild dose of antibiotics.</p><p>Soon, Lisa gets well and is back to&nbsp;work!</p><p>Sounds simple and quick, right? What went on in the background that made it so easy for Lisa to share her medical records within&nbsp;seconds?</p><p>That’s the magic of VCs, and here’s how it&nbsp;works.</p><p>As with all VCs, three parties are involved and they&nbsp;are:</p><p>Issuer — Lisa’s primary care physician’s office</p><p>Holder — Lisa</p><p>Verifier — The doctor’s clinic in&nbsp;London</p><p>As a first step, Lisa logs into her doctor’s clinic and submits a request for VC. The primary care physician’s office checks Lisa’s immunization status and her history of allergies, and accordingly, issues the verifiable credentials in the form of a QR code with the results of those checks. Lisa scans this code and saves it in her&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Next, she receives a Credential Share Request from the doctor’s clinic in London and approves it to share a Verifiable Presentation containing her medical history to the doctor’s office in London. The receptionist at the office logs into the admin account, verifies the credentials, and notifies the doctor of allergies and pre-existing conditions. That’s it,&nbsp;really!</p><p>If you notice, this workflow doesn’t involve any third-party to store your medical data and this also means no worry about medical data storage policies and the laws associated with it. The holder completely owns his or her medical data and stores it exclusively in his or her digital wallet, thereby making it secure and hassle-free.</p><p>Also, these VCs are secure, tamper-proof, and authentic information that can be quickly shared with anyone you want. Such streamlined access is sure to transform the way we create and handle our Personally Identifiable Information. And undoubtedly, it’s our&nbsp;future!</p><p>Are you ready for&nbsp;it?</p><p>We are!</p><p>We’ve built a bunch of APIs you can leverage to create such applications.</p><p>In the meantime, you can also check out our <a href="https://affinidipocathon.devpost.com/">PoCathon</a> to build Proof of Concepts using Affinidi’s resources and get a feel of the endless possibilities that our APIs&nbsp;offer.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/accessing-medical-records-anywhere-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-81a248f9b746">Accessing Medical Records Anywhere — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Example sketch of street transition in Malmö — as part of the Climate KIC Deep Demo&nbsp;project<p>This article proposes key principles which we believe could be the foundation for replicating democratic models of retrofitting. It is part of the <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">‘A Right to Retrofit’</a> series, and you can read all other related blogs by following the links at the bottom of the&nbsp;page.</p><p>The way we retrofit needs to be redesigned to meet the urgent need for climate transition in the built environment. To overcome the systemic constraints on the potential impact of retrofit, a fundamental shift in the system is required. [For more on this, see <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">The System Challenges to Retrofit]</a></p><p>We believe this systemic shift can be achieved by testing strategic interventions in the ‘dark matter’ of the retrofit ecosystem: through piloting and proving out new infrastructures, new standards, new legal patterns, or new institutions. Our ‘dark matter’ experiments and propositions will be oriented around these key principles which we believe will begin to deliver a sustainable, socially-just future.</p> 01 — Collective and democratic <p>The individualisation of responsibility over retrofit continues to frame retrofit solutions with individualised approaches. [For more, see this section of <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3#3883">The System Challenges of Retrofit</a>] Instead, when a whole street is considered as the subject of retrofit, the ambition of retrofit is a scale of magnitude beyond the sum of individual households, by considering not just these private spaces themselves, but in combination with the public spaces in which they coexist. The ambition of collective retrofit could include public realm, green mobility, and community amenities; these are necessary in a climate transition that includes all of the built environment. As a minimum unit of organisation, a street-wide community provides a critical mass to test systemic changes that reshape the retrofit market and the wider ecosystem, such as exploring new models of collective financing that remove cost burdens from the individual. The street as a unit of organisation is also a familiar, natural scale for deliberative decision-making as a community.</p> 02 — Performance-oriented <p>The justification for retrofit is still viewed primarily through its ability to deliver decarbonisation, yet retrofit’s ecosystem is rarely structured around its actual performance in doing so, relying on theoretical and indirect measures. In restructuring incentives around measured performance, the dynamics of the system will not only shift in favour of better performing retrofit, but have wide-ranging systemic impacts — from providing the upstream impetus for improving skills, tools, and services to deliver on this demand for performance, to broadening the definition of what makes a high-performing retrofit project by analysing and accounting for its full range of co-benefits. We think that with this new knowledge infrastructure, built on data from IoT, sensor technology, and automation using smart contracts, the definition of ‘performance’ can evolve from energy use into a more holistic and precise resident-oriented metric such as ‘comfort’ instead, and be built right into the incentives of contracting for retrofit work. [For more on how performance-based incentives can shift the retrofit system, see this section of <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3#e1bb">The System Challenges to Retrofit</a>]</p> 03 — Empower the&nbsp;local <p>Moving from being “done to” their communities, to being “done with” them, a future retrofit ecosystem must empower residents to be in the driving seat of their community’s climate transition. Building their trust, agency and capability is fundamental to have enough community buy-in for its long-term success, and to ensure a democratised transition. This also means challenging the false economies of delocalised, value-extracting approaches. Instead, leveraging local supply chains, local skills, and local networks of knowledge and trust ensure that retrofit is not just about short-term investment in emissions reductions, but also long-term investment in community wealth and resilience. This emphasis on the local also means moving away from assumptions of one-size-fits-all retrofit service models, instead moving to modular, adaptive models that may be built on wider systemic learnings, but tailored to the specificities of the local context. [For more on our research on local retrofit models, see this section of <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3#d64d">The System Challenges to Retrofit</a>]</p> 04 — Built on open knowledge <p>Knowledge and data around retrofit drives better decision-making, yet data gaps exist in the ecosystem for many stakeholders, from residents, to suppliers and municipal governments. Building this open knowledge infrastructure serves as an evidence-base for new infrastructures, new standards, new legal patterns, or new institutions, and each future retrofit project has the potential to become a longitudinal study, offering a wealth of data into the comprehensive impact of deep community retrofit. This knowledge infrastructure must be in place to harness the future utility of these insights. Building this open knowledge infrastructure for the long term ensures that innovation capability in the retrofit ecosystem is not exclusive to proprietary services and governments, but too is democratised. [For more on our research on why this knowledge infrastructure is critical, see this section of <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3#e1bb">The System Challenges to Retrofit</a>]</p> Future retrofit starts now: testing and demonstrating <p>These principles need to be translated from ‘thinking’ into ‘doing’. The work of Dark Matter Labs is currently scoping and investing in strategic experiments to make this future retrofit ecosystem a reality. These ‘system demonstrators’ consist of what we believe to be the minimum viable propositions to prove out a systems change, based on the dynamics of the system we’ve mapped out so far, and in line with the principles we believe are necessary for a democratised climate transition.</p><p>It is important to note that these propositions and demonstrators are part of an ongoing iterative process: as our learning evolves from sketch to prototype, concept to context, so too will the nature of these propositions. Based on our work so far, we believe there are some interesting lines of enquiry that&nbsp;include;</p>  Service journey for community retrofit<br>Can we redesign the citizen experience of retrofit for a community at the scale of a street or block to maximise the potential of its ‘beyond the individual’ approach? By building and ensuring processes to empower the community’s democratic, and deliberative, decision-making capability, can this collective approach form the critical mass needed to reshape the wider ecosystem, such as broadening the range of financing and reinvigorating local supply&nbsp;chains?  Data platform<br>Can we lay the foundations for retrofit’s knowledge infrastructure, and design an open platform that presents relevant insights to stakeholders across the retrofit ecosystem for holistic, data-informed decision-making, at all stages of the service journey? Can this foundation include a protocol to capture the potential insights from future retrofit projects to help grow this knowledge infrastructure?  Smart comfort contracts<br>Can we structure contracts so that their incentives are not based solely on completing agreed retrofit work, or relative energy savings, but instead contract around broader definitions of performance, such as comfort?. Can potential beneficiaries of retrofit outcomes extend beyond the residents? Might these standards be co-created with the communities who will use them, and might they be structured with financing to overcome high upfront costs and tenure barriers?  <p>These interventions aim to target fundamental and interconnected leverage points in the retrofit ecosystem, with propositions that we think could shift the underlying dynamics, rebalance incentives, and empower actors. In the next phase of this work, our ambition will be to build and test these interventions in-situ with the residents of these retrofitted homes, to ensure these interventions create cascading, multiplied impacts and prioritise deep, comprehensive retrofit through systemic changes that are sustainable in the long-term.</p><p>Over the next few months, Dark Matter Labs will be pursuing these and other lines of enquiry, applying future retrofit principles in real places to test propositions with system-shifting potential. We believe that the system not only needs to change to deliver wider adoption of deeper retrofit, but these changes must ensure that the climate transition of the built environment is democratised, equitable, and just. We will begin building this collective, democratic vision of retrofitting, and also rebuilding trust in the systems of how our built environment is made and remade. As our testing progresses, we will be updating blogs in this series with a deeper look into some of the prototypes/propositions that are emerging.</p><p>To outline our work on reimagining retrofit, we have curated our thinking from the last 9 months into a <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">series of blogs</a> which form the basis for ongoing&nbsp;work.</p><p>These blogs&nbsp;examine</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/retrofit-building-back-better-d0ce9921840a">Retrofit &amp; ‘Building Back&nbsp;Better’</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">The System Challenges to&nbsp;Retrofit</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">Scaling the Right to Retrofit</a> (this&nbsp;blog)  <p>You can find the full series&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">here</a>.</p><p>This blog and its visuals has been co-authored by <a href="https://medium.com/u/1c295ef66c9c">Calvin Po</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/u/f7fc325b2eeb">Ariane Porter</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/ee5c7ea1d010">Jack Minchella</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">Scaling the Right to Retrofit</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">A Right to Retrofit</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

It is part of the <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">‘A Right to Retrofit’</a> series, and you can read all other related blogs by following the links at the bottom of the&nbsp;page.</p><p>Over the past nine months Dark Matter Labs has been working with <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/">EIT Climate-KIC</a> and partners in cities across Europe to understand the retrofit ‘ecosystem’, and how it can be reformed to meet the urgent need for climate transition in the built environment.</p><p>In each of the local contexts, alongside our partners <a href="https://www.polimi.it/">Polmi</a> and <a href="http://www.poliedra.polimi.it/en/homepage/">Poliedra</a> in Milan, <a href="http://regea.org/en/">REGEA</a> in Zagreb, <a href="https://jibe.company/">Jibe</a> in Sofia and the <a href="https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/">City of Edinburgh Council</a>, we identified factors across different parts of the retrofit system leading to barriers to retrofitting.</p><p>Through this work we’ve come to understand that retrofit, its uptake and impact, must go deeper than its market dynamics alone, or we risk continuing to overly rely on supply and demand-side levers (such as one-off training schemes and homeowner grants). Retrofit and its market exists in a wider context where factors from across the stack, from institutional infrastructure to community dynamics, have complex interrelationships. To develop a system-oriented understanding of retrofit and its problems, retrofit must be considered as part of an entire ‘ecosystem’.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/The-Multiple-Benefits-of-Deep-Retrofits-A-toolkit-for-cities?language=en_US#:~:text=Deep%20retrofits%20provide%20city%20governments,educational%20attainment%20of%20urban%20residents.)">C40 Cities</a>’ framework and energy<a href="https://municipalpower.org/articles/energy-efficiency-key-findings-from-mpower-exchange/"> municipal learning exchanges</a>, we see emerging consensus in the retrofit field that home retrofit has intrinsic, multiple benefits, beyond just improvements of energy efficiency and emissions reductions. This work recognises that retrofitting has potential positive impacts across health and well-being, fuel poverty and inequality, local economic recovery, job creation, and community resilience, because retrofit exists not in isolation, but sits across strategic intersections of multiple&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The diagram below is a summary of common factors that were found over the course of working across many contexts, where problems that on the surface appear simple (such as lack of cash, lack of awareness, and lack of suppliers) in fact have complex, interlinked causes. These are represented as ‘causal loops’ or vicious cycles, where the identified factors mutually reinforce one another, and all eventually lead to the symptoms of low retrofit uptake rates, lack of deep, comprehensive retrofit approaches, and ultimately, contribute to the exacerbation of the climate crisis. The factors that are connected to many others begin to indicate strategic areas and leverage points for interventions in the system, with potential, multipliable impacts.</p>A system map of retrofit ecosystem — <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C7WjclTqHCP4OBSaDpbFSQQs86kjwv30/view?usp=sharing">original file&nbsp;here</a>. 01 — Individualised Responsibility and&nbsp;Risk <p>Pre-21st century institutions are designed around individual interests and responsibilities, but in the face of an unprecedented collective climate crisis, these institutions are being stretched to their&nbsp;limits.</p><p>Retrofit, in attempting to deliver a collective climate transition of our built environment, still operates within the primarily individualised institution of property. Common across almost all the contexts we worked in, the onus to pay for retrofit work remains by default with the individual property owner, with the risks of high energy costs, maintenance costs, and substandard housing conditions borne by the individual. An owner’s inability to pay the high upfront costs required, and the lack of available financing, becomes a barrier to retrofit with cascading consequences. As a result, credit/cash-poor households, who may benefit most urgently from energy and cost savings, are often excluded, exacerbating a vicious cycle of fuel poverty and inequalities, despite the solid long-term investment case of retrofit.</p><p>Efforts to mitigate this so far still operate within the framework of individual responsibility: governments and local authorities continue to subsidise individual homeowners with one-off grants for individual interventions. This funding is prescriptive and bureaucratic for the homeowner to access, and often require onerous supplier accreditation. The UK’s Green Homes Grants are a perfect example of this: not only were there delays in payments and a distinct lack of suppliers to do the work (<a href="https://www.housingtoday.co.uk/news/government-to-claw-back-unspent-green-homes-grant-funding/5110362.article">leaving 95% of the funding set aside by the Treasury unspent</a>), that which was spent found its way to construction firms currently<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/grenfell-firms-share-in-2bn-green-grants-p6dlc6vr5"> under criminal investigation</a> for the Grenfell tragedy. Grant schemes like these tend to concentrate on the ‘easy wins’ by limiting eligibility to<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-green-homes-grant-scheme#what-the-voucher-can-be-used-for"> certain types of intervention</a>, and lend the weight of government authority to mainly conservative, piecemeal approaches, rather than deep, comprehensive retrofit.</p><p>In the long term, this has been shown to be <a href="http://urbed.coop/sites/default/files/2016%20URBED%20Tyndall%20The%20Retrofit%20factfile%20-%20facts%20and%20publications.pdf">insufficient in reducing</a> energy usage and emissions, and within <a href="https://www.green-alliance.org.uk/resources/reinventing_retrofit.pdf">30 years</a> time, will require further retrofit. The knock-on consequences of this funding barrier is that with retrofit’s limited demand, contractors have little incentive to invest in training or developing dedicated retrofit services, so work is completed with conventional construction methods with little guarantee of performance, and in turn, worsening the perception of retrofit, becoming a cascading risk.</p><p>When retrofit approaches operate under the assumption that responsibility lies with the individual property owner, it ignores the more complex reality that property interests are relational and hierarchical. The only situation where such an individualised approach is even remotely appropriate is the owner-occupied detached home. For anything else, these hierarchies can be the relationship between landlord and tenant, between owners in a block, or between freeholder and leaseholders. Each of these stakeholders may have different incentives and different agencies to act on them, and when these coexist within a single building and are misaligned, the barriers to retrofit are multiplied.</p><p>This may be as obvious as tenants who pay their own energy bills having the incentives to retrofit but being dependent on their landlord to commission retrofit work. In the urban contexts we worked in last year, such as Milan, Zagreb, and Edinburgh, homes were predominantly in blocks of flats. Multiple parties sharing the same building fabric and maintenance costs means commissioning retrofit work comes with an added dimension of complexity. There is a need to enable trust and consensus-building across the community to proceed, subject to property laws and governance of shared buildings that vary by context. More often than not, these governance structures are still built around dividing collective responsibilities (and costs) to individual owners (in the words of a partner in Zagreb, “deciding who can sue whom”). The inability of some residents in a shared building to afford retrofit work may lead to those residents pressured to sell and move out in an<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-2427.12634"> ecological gentrifying phenomenon of ‘renoviction’</a>, or limit the comprehensiveness of retrofit, or even hinder a retrofit project altogether.</p><p>For example, from our work with City of Edinburgh Council, while the council has set ambitious decarbonisation targets with council-funded retrofit used as a means to achieve this, the privatisation of individual council flats has created mixed-tenure blocks with private owners who may not be able or willing to invest in retrofit. The buildings considered viable for the council’s retrofit programme end up being limited to those where the council itself owns all units. The barrier of a resident’s ability to fund upfront, along with limits on how public investment can be used in mixed-tenure buildings, calls for an alternative tenure-independent model with long-term collective financing that can overcome the affordability and accessibility barriers to retrofitting and to high-standard housing.</p><p>This individualisation of responsibility does not just concern money, but also time and knowledge — the complex and inconsistent retrofit landscape of contractors and products, requires the individual homeowner to invest time in research, with little experience or expertise to guide them. While the retrofit ecosystem could benefit from a more established knowledge infrastructure, approaching retrofit collectively rather than individually could allow this burden to be shared. A well designed collective approach could create enough aggregated demand for new models to be viable, such as dedicated, resident-oriented retrofit services providing beginning-to-end guidance throughout the retrofit&nbsp;journey.</p><p>In our work in Milan, where the condominiums, apartment blocks or collection of homes are often managed and maintained by a Building Manager. When redesigning the end-user journey of retrofit around a collective approach, we could leverage the Building Manager’s unique existing community relationship to engage and guide residents through the retrofit process, instead of relying on the efforts of motivated individual owners. By working within governance structures that communities already know, trust and rely upon, the perceived complexity and misaligned incentives that discourage residents from embarking on retrofit projects can be overcome as a community.</p> 02 — Knowledge, performance and&nbsp;trust <p>Retrofitting homes is understandably perceived by residents to be a risky activity. These risks are often not intrinsic to the retrofitting process, but are perceptual. As experienced by one of our municipal partners, these perceptual risks can act as barriers to retrofitting for households who can afford retrofit costs and, at least in theory, should be the “low-hanging fruit” and obvious targets for boosting retrofit uptake. The crucial missing piece is the knowledge infrastructure around retrofit, where the accessibility of accurate information, in particular data on retrofit performance, can mitigate these concerns. For a resident, the perceived risks of retrofit, namely the large investment and the temporary disruption to their home, are balanced out when they can be sure that their retrofit project and its use of new energy technologies is built on a performance track record, and will deliver promised results. This knowledge infrastructure around performance, both as an evidence base and a metric for successful retrofit completion, is critical in transforming the reliance on ‘faith’ in retrofit into genuine&nbsp;trust.</p><p>EU-wide schemes such as Energy Performance Certificates are attempts to implement a knowledge infrastructure around building performance and retrofit, under the economic rationale of “de-risking” and creating a <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A52016SC0408#">“market signal for efficient buildings”</a>. However, the implementation of EPC’s have been <a href="https://epbd-ca.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CA-EPBD-CT3-Certification_Control-system_Quality-2018.pdf">inconsistent across member states</a>, and the fact that EPCs rely on <a href="https://www.cibsejournal.com/technical/completing-the-picture-london-energy-map/">modelled or indirectly measured energy performance</a> and lack open access to its data in some countries limits its utility in progressing the knowledge infrastructure around built environment transition. Worse, when EPCs are used as the only performance metric, they could end up incentivising <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032117301569?casa_token=vqWfKcyCj4AAAAAA:dPIUTP1uyKgsb8XkSHRgVQVTmi8uTWVA06cpRa3xjp9qJSGYNGE8rJApM6uA8fMaqHrQHImyIPC1#s0050">inappropriate or ineffective</a> retrofit interventions due to their pro forma approach. While long-term financing based on achieved performance outcomes are used in energy performance contracting provided by ESCOs (Energy Service Companies), where energy savings are used to finance the retrofit cost, these models are inevitably based on the few available sources of performance data, primarily metered energy use, and leave the other benefits of retrofit unaccounted for, reinforcing only the energy and emissions-related understandings of retrofitting performance instead of incentivising a comprehensive, deep approach with multiple benefits.</p><p>Knowledge infrastructure is also crucial for the planning of retrofit works: for a local authority or retrofit service provider, data on the neighbourhood can scope out potential retrofit sites that can deliver maximum impact, and support a targeted resident engagement strategy or leverage a local skilled labour force. This data picture not only can survey the condition of neighbourhoods’ built environment and its energy performance, but can be broadened to include its demography, its social, economic and environmental conditions, and embed in the planning process a fuller range of impacts in assessing a retrofit project’s cost-benefit balance, and identify stakeholders and potential beneficiaries beyond the residents themselves.</p><p>From our work in Zagreb, state funding allocated after the March 2020 earthquake primarily for reconstructing homes to a safe standard also provided a unique opportunity to initiate a neighbourhood-scale climate transition, by simultaneously retrofitting those homes and minimising overall disruption. As part of developing the knowledge infrastructure around retrofit, we conducted a data study using a combination of earthquake damage data, census and open datasets in a prototype of a mapping tool that could identify building typology, indicators of fuel poverty, potential for nature-based solutions and public realm interventions, and even public attitudes based on social media&nbsp;data.</p><p>When holistic knowledge of the city is built into the retrofit process, such as in a open mapping platform, neighbourhoods can be targeted for engagement that fit a comprehensive balance of factors, and begin building a portfolio of retrofit sites where returns are not just considered in terms of energy savings per capital expenditure, but maximising impacts across a broad range of environmental, socioeconomic factors</p> 03 — Supply-side cycles <p>One of the key causal loops is that the low demand for retrofit, caused by a myriad barriers including those above, leads to a relatively <a href="https://www.theiet.org/media/5276/retrofit.pdf">underdeveloped supply side of the retrofit market</a>, with <a href="https://www.theiet.org/media/5276/retrofit.pdf">few dedicated retrofit service providers</a>, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/8/12/174">relying on traditional contractors or installers of individual products</a>. This lack of competition to deliver on performance (which impacts quality of construction, timeliness of completion, the appropriate specification of products, in addition to actual achieved energy use and emissions) in turn reinforces lower uptake. As a result of these supply-side barriers, many existing retrofitting services, such as <a href="https://energiesprong.org/">Energiesprong</a>, have adopted centralised industrial supply models based on standardised design, procurement and funding, to target neighbourhoods as ‘critical masses’ for viable community retrofit.</p><p>Standardised approaches are often justified by an assumption of the economies of scale, that they afford greater speed in reaching the scale of renovation and energy efficiency measures needed. This model is used by many local authorities or housing associations to retrofit their own stock, for example Edward Wood Estate, Fulham and New Barracks Estate, Salford. However, these large-scale initiatives mean that the resulting innovation, knowledge and economic growth is centralised and delocalised, reducing the opportunity for alternative services to develop and compete. These centralised models can deliver fast results; companies like Energiesprong have developed off site manufacturing methods that allow for quick turn over by designing and completing prefabricated panels that are brought to site and constructed within 14 days; this speed makes centralised approaches an attractive route with looming legal decarbonisation targets.</p><p>However, the concern is that the speed of a centralised industrial supply model comes at the cost of agency of the local community over the deliberation and consensus-building processes of retrofit, with residents encouraged to accept proposals adapted from their standard approaches. Emerging alternatives, such as <a href="https://carbon.coop/">Carbon Co-op</a>, are developing models that rely on networks of practice which bias existing networks of knowledge, skill and delivery within a neighbourhood to develop local and collective responses to the challenge of retrofit. In the case of Carbon Co-op, a local team is employed to coordinate households requiring renovation, and understand the needs of the demand through detailed sessions with residents. The same team manages various specialist contractors, organising actors to collaborate and build a ‘critical mass’ both supply and demand-side for local retrofit. For a climate transition that is just and democratised, as much agency as possible should be devolved to the level of the community. This is not simply just a desirable principle, but it also builds a solid foundation for ambitious retrofit with a broad and deep scope through a process of co-design and trust-building.</p><p>One of the effects of the centralising tendencies of some service models is that by leveraging centralised, large suppliers, it removes the impetus to retrain and up-skill the local workforce. The benefits of retrofit are economic as much as environmental, with spending on retrofit projects having the potential to create demand for <a href="https://neweconomics.org/uploads/files/Green-stimulus-for-housing_NEF.pdf">515,157 new jobs between 2020–2024</a> just within the UK. In contexts such as our work in Zagreb, there have been mostly publicly-funded training and accreditation schemes to up-skill trades with construction skills for low-energy buildings and energy efficiency renovation, such as <a href="https://croskills.hr/en/">CroSkills</a> and <a href="http://www.fit-to-nzeb.com/croatia.html">other programmes</a>. However, these training schemes tend to only be funded on a one-off basis, and the accreditation is not widely adopted by the industry and the wider market, without mandatory licensing or public recognition of their value. These training programmes are therefore often not sustained as they operate in isolation without creating the demand for these improved skills. When training is implemented alongside a service model that draws on local suppliers, and contractual incentives for retrofit are based on delivered performance, these system reforms can sustain up-skilling in the long-term as a critical part of climate transition.</p><p>To outline our work on reimagining retrofit, we have curated our thinking from the last 9 months into a <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">series of blogs</a> which form the basis for ongoing&nbsp;work.</p><p>These blogs&nbsp;examine</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/retrofit-building-back-better-d0ce9921840a">Retrofit &amp; ‘Building Back&nbsp;Better’</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">The System Challenges to Retrofit</a> (this&nbsp;blog)  <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">Scaling the Right to&nbsp;Retrofit</a>  <p>You can find the full series&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">here</a>.</p><p>This blog and its visuals has been co-authored by <a href="https://medium.com/u/1c295ef66c9c">Calvin Po</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/u/f7fc325b2eeb">Ariane Porter</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/ee5c7ea1d010">Jack Minchella</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">The System Challenges to Retrofit</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">A Right to Retrofit</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

If ‘getting back to normal’ is an illusion, and any ‘new normal’ is ladened with the same vested interests and structural injustices as before, then the promise of ‘building back better’ should also be finding ways of rebuilding the trust that such a just and sustainable future is possible.</p><p>One area of convergence that holds promise is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cf668430-fee8-45d4-982c-4b2996186879">retrofitting</a>.</p><p>Taken at face value, retrofitting is the process of upgrading our homes to be more energy efficient, but viewed through a much wider lens, retrofitting is the conscious adaptation our streets and neighbourhoods to become a more <a href="https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/interactive-digital-projects/gnd-glasgow/sectional-view">sustainable and equitable platform</a> for our everyday lives. It is this broadened idea of retrofitting that can serve as a transition strategy for society to recover and&nbsp;rebuild.</p><p>Over the course of the last nine months Dark Matter Labs have been working with partners across Europe to understand how this wider remit of retrofitting, and the systems that support it, can form a vehicle for a post-COVID recovery, and act as a transition model to a 21st century&nbsp;economy.</p> Retrofitting. Where to&nbsp;begin? <p>Building on the work of other organisations, we now understand retrofit’s <a href="https://theiet.org/media/5276/retrofit.pdf">need</a> and <a href="https://www.passivhaustrust.org.uk/competitions_and_campaigns/passivhaus-retrofit/">scale</a>, why we should <a href="https://neweconomics.org/uploads/files/Green-stimulus-for-housing_NEF.pdf">fund it</a>, and some great ideas about <a href="https://cc-site-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/07/3.-PeoplePoweredRetrofit-Report.pdf">localising how it can be done</a>. All of them agree on one thing…retrofitting is difficult. This is partly because it’s riddled with complexity (needing to draw on many expertise, skills, and networks) and partly because it’s unpredictable and costly (no two homes are the same). But beyond these technical and logistical hurdles, retrofitting seeks to address a much more complex crisis — the crisis of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Like so many of the crises that define our current economy, a big part of this crisis of trust has its roots in our broken housing system. This is a sector defined by and designed for a carbon age: <a href="https://www.velux.com/indoorgeneration/indoor-generation-facts-and-figures">cramped, expensive, unhealthy homes</a>; <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/futurelondon/air-we-breathe-tackling-hidden-dangers-pollution-inside-home-b925797.html">chronic air pollution</a>; streets dominated by cars and roads; <a href="https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-9278009/Big-energy-suppliers-hike-prices-96-year-line-price-cap-rise.html">expensive and unaccountable energy costs</a>; disappearing local services and spaces; <a href="https://www.retailresearch.org/retail-crisis.html">failing high streets</a>; <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30482-X/fulltext">rising isolation, anxiety</a>, and <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1872">domestic abuse</a>. These are challenges that have been exacerbated by the economy into which they were born, and unequally amplified during the pandemic. It is no wonder that proposals to tinker with our homes is met with mistrust when faced with the scale of these challenges.</p><p>Lockdown policies have exacerbated inequality<br>For many, lockdown policies have forced our homes to host our entire lives. Four walls now define not only our domestic space, but also the office, the school, the playground, and everything in between. That means more heating, more energy, more internet, more cooking, cleaning, and stress. All which sits against a backdrop of anxiety over our health and wellbeing, job security and rising fuel costs. These added burdens remain largely unaccounted and invisible, and inevitably end up falling on the individual.</p><p>The home is the fundamental unit of our housing system, and the pandemic has made it increasingly clear that the home is also the determining factor in our access to <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/209373/connected-nations-2020.pdf">education</a>, to support networks, and to <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/newsroom/blog/analysing-greenspace-access-during-pandemic">public space</a>, fundamentally shaping our health and wellbeing. When all of this is filtered through an unequal housing system, it shows in plain sight the illusion of equal access to these basic standards of living, especially for those at the intersections of <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-10-29-poverty-and-inequality-surge-across-europe-wake-covid-19">socioeconomic class</a>, <a href="https://www.nhsconfed.org/news/2020/12/structural-inequalities-lie-behind-pandemic-impact-on-bme-communities">race</a>, <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/blogs/inequalities-and-deaths-involving-covid-19">gender</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbydisabilitystatusenglandandwales/2marchto14july2020">ability</a>.</p><p>Any political remedy that proposes a regenerative recovery strategy with housing at its focus needs to recognise these cascading impacts of the home. It must move away from the idea of retrofit as a superficial investment in fixing technical problems in individual buildings, to one which addresses the underlying systems that are tied to our domestic spaces. Retrofit should not only see the home as a strategic site for decarbonisation, but also a site for addressing the inequalities in wider, interlinked systems, of which housing sits at the&nbsp;centre.</p><p>A crisis of trust needs a democratic transition<br>To address the challenge of climate breakdown, retrofitting will mean large-scale, long-term plans that propose to take our homes and streets apart and build them back with us still inside. For this to be possible, the way we approach retrofitting needs to empathise with just how precarious many people’s lives have become, not only during the last 12 months, but as a result of the systemic injustices in how our built environment gets made and remade, and the suspicion that it has caused. A legitimate climate transition cannot address the technical challenges alone, but must tackle the social ones as well. For retrofitting to be a part of this kind of transition, it must be done with the consent of all those who hold a stake in it. This transition must be democratic, not just about voting, but in the widest sense: the agency to shape the future, with the right support to exercise this agency&nbsp;capably.</p> A green recovery at the scale of the&nbsp;street <p>Conventional approaches to retrofitting have attempted to reduce domestic carbon emissions on a piecemeal basis, relying on the ‘easy wins’ for individual homes such as one-off grants for wall or loft insulation, replacing boilers, or adding heat pumps. Although useful in the short term, these measures will only make a small dent in our 2050&nbsp;goals.</p><p>From Home to Neighbourhood<br>Government recovery plans tend to centre on individual households as the site for both decarbonising the built environment, and also the site for attempting to address systemic inequalities. But approaching retrofitting this way, through the lens of an atomised single home, made up of atomised individuals, won’t work. A recovery strategy built on retrofitting should try to multiply the value of green investment and economic stimulus by recognising that the home is inextricable from the spatial, social, and economic relationships of its neighbourhood. Retrofitting is critically situated in a knot of wider networks of local services, spaces, skills, ownership, regulation, ambition, and&nbsp;trust.</p>Fig. 1 — Understanding retrofit as a whole system of&nbsp;recovery<p>In practical terms, this means designing a retrofit strategy that sees the home in the context of its block, its street, and its neighbourhood. It is only at these scales can retrofit happen across a continuum of private to public spaces, and work with economic and social networks together as a complete unit of&nbsp;change.</p><p>The challenge we face now is how we can deconstruct and redesign the ‘dark matter’ around retrofit to deliver on this vision of a democratised climate transition.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">This publication series</a> aims to do just that, outlining the <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">challenges we see in the current retrofit ecosystem</a>, and how we think this approach to <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">retrofitting could be scaled democratically</a>.</p><p>These writings are a curated version of our thinking from the last 9 months. Over the next few months, Dark Matter Labs will be pursuing these and other lines of enquiry, applying future retrofit principles in real places to test propositions with system-shifting potential. We hope to begin rebuilding the ecosystem on a collective, democratic vision of a retrofitting that delivers deep and broad impacts, and also rebuilding trust in the systems of how our built environment is made and remade in our shared climate transition. As our testing progresses, we will be updating this series with a deeper look into some of the prototypes and propositions that are emerging.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>This blog and its visuals has been co-authored by <a href="https://medium.com/u/1c295ef66c9c">Calvin Po</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/u/f7fc325b2eeb">Ariane Porter</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/ee5c7ea1d010">Jack Minchella</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit/retrofit-building-back-better-d0ce9921840a">Retrofit &amp; ‘Building back better’</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">A Right to Retrofit</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 How redesigning the dark matter of city systems can unlock sustainable, democratic urban environments Madrid is one of 10 European cities DML are working with on EIT-Climate KIC’s Healthy Clean Cities Deep Demonstration [Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alexrvasey?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Alex Vasey</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>] Looking back and forward on our work in&nbsp;cities <p>After a year like no other, and faced by what may well be permanent disruptions to their natural rhythms and rituals, cities around the world are grappling with how to navigate their uncertain, post-covid, climate-defined futures. Such transitions have, of course, been long overdue. The entrenched inequality and unsustainable metabolism that have come to define our cities is what drives many to look for ways to transition them towards the sustainable and democratic urban environments we need them to be. On current trends, temperature changes of 3 degrees celsius are <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-why-low-end-climate-sensitivity-can-now-be-ruled-out">more likely than 1.5 or even 2 degrees</a>, exacerbating a series of calamitous, cascading risks in our cities, whether as tangible places or as urban systems. The urgency and the depth of the transitions required to enable more hopeful scenarios means we have to act across a range of systemic levers in order to achieve a democratic, equitable pathway to a liveable&nbsp;future.</p><p>Our journey into&nbsp;cities</p><p>Over the past 5 years, Dark Matter Labs has found itself involved in several collaborations with such focus — where efforts to transition society in response to technological revolution and climate breakdown look to the city as a critical problem-space and tangible unit of change. From our early work to develop <a href="http://www.northcamdenzone.org/blog/launching-learning">impact movements in Camden</a>, to our experiences with <a href="https://civicsquare.cc">Civic Square</a> and <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Alternative-Camden-A-civic-innovation-district">Alternative.Camden</a>, then the development in 2019 of our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10n--zTnTtmsMgjZVHVbYd9FrAESGaT7-/view">Micro-Massive urban transition thesis</a> with UNDP and EIT Climate-KIC and our involvement in the latter’s <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DD_Healthy_Clean_Cities.pdf">Healthy Clean Cities Deep Demonstration</a>, we’ve cultivated a deeper understanding of the critical role ‘<a href="https://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2012/08/dark-matter.html">dark matter</a>’ — the invisible structures and infrastructures that shape our systems, from regulation and procurement to contracting and financing mechanisms — must play in driving transitions in&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Cities as systems of systems: regulation, tech, participation, and&nbsp;finance</p><p>Cities, of course, are anything but one-dimensional. Even a first glance at their impact on climate change reveals that their footprint is much larger than the emissions taking place ‘within the gates.’ Scope 3 emissions in particular are driven by complex global supply chains in which urban politics is nested and entangled. But working with cities is still worthwhile — as long as we recognise that cities form a ‘system of systems’, where several levers of change come together, and can be acted upon — whether at the scale of a city-regional portfolio of interventions, or district-focussed ‘living&nbsp;labs’.</p><p>How cities update and in some cases revolutionise their regulatory landscape will determine the speed and depth at which urban environments can transition. Since co-founding <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/The-Network-of-Regulatory-Experimentation-A-peer-to-peer-community-of">the Network of Regulatory Experimentation</a> in partnership with <a href="https://bloxhub.org/">BLOXHUB</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/corporate/about-health-canada/legislation-guidelines/community-federal-regulators.html">Community of Federal Regulators</a>, <a href="https://doteveryone.org.uk/">Dot Everyone</a>, <a href="https://www.marsdd.com/systems-change/mars-solutions-lab/mars-solutions-lab-approach/">MaRS Solutions Lab</a>, <a href="https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/">The McConnell Foundation</a> and <a href="https://waag.org/">Waag Society</a>, Dark Matter Labs has continued to explore the promise of a new generation of regulatory sandboxes based in cities, with <a href="https://www.mis.quebec/projets-dinnovation-sociale-realises/2020/10/26/licer-laboratoire-innovation-civique-experimentation-reglementaire/">Montreal</a> and Madrid playing early&nbsp;hosts.</p><p>How cities leverage the promise of technology — digital tools &amp; platforms, open data systems and artificial collective intelligence — will in many cases be pivotal in both accelerating change, but also in either by-passing or actively ensuring deeper legitimacy and ownership of transitions amongst those most affected. Seeing deeper civic participation as inherent in regulatory or technological innovation is integral to the future of cities: the promise of new technology and agile regulation moving us to a more sustainable future rings false unless people and communities can truly be part of collaboratively understanding why it is necessary, what opportunities it could hold for them, and how different design principles can drive towards very different outcomes. In this context, <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.lucidminds.ai/">Lucidminds</a>, with support from <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/">Nesta</a>, have been developing three use cases for near future ideas where <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/civic-ai-1890d93eb8ce">Civic AI</a> can help equip communities with the tools to collectively respond to the climate crisis and achieve the goal of a carbon-neutral society. While such technology scenarios may feel distant, <a href="https://regulation.network/legitimacities1Q">controversies such as around the Sidewalks Toronto proposition</a> shows the urgency of building civic legitimacy around tech-enabled sustainability pathways. In response, we are working with city governments like Amsterdam to explore how to bring collaborative dynamic regulation and tech-enabled renewable energy communities closer to reality, as well as with the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement, tech-enterprises and local citizens in Daegu, South Korea, to develop new frameworks and strategies for combining technology and civic innovation.</p>Visual from our Daegu Creative City project with Daegu Technopark<p>How cities finance their transitions will be crucial in ensuring capital best serves the future, both in terms of what they invest in and how they invest. Dark Matter Labs has been <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-infrastructuring-tomorrow-d19971b1f351">working with partners across North America and Europe</a> to explore how the transition capital embedded in the coming Green Deals can be best deployed. As cities will be significant recipients of transition capital over the coming decade, they must develop new financial instruments that enable long term investment; new mechanisms to capture and share the multiple spillover effects and value flows of a climate investment strategy, like better health and jobs; and new public governance models capable of limiting rent-seeking incentives traditionally structured into investment propositions. In short, we need to re-code capital so it privileges the shared public value of transition investment. Cities are starting to see the significance of the challenge, and our work with the cities of Madrid and Vienna to explore such ‘re-coding’ mechanisms will <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-2021-roadmap-bde60861dacb">accelerate in&nbsp;2021</a>.</p><p>What we’ve learned along the&nbsp;way</p><p>Needless to say, we’ve learned a few lessons from these encounters with cities and their dark matter. We have a growing appreciation of the need to combine discovery work and creative imagining with the hard graft of enabling change to happen on the ground. We have a deeper sense of the undeniable role cultural competence alongside local leadership and partnerships must play to drive and sustain urban transformation in what are always unique places with powerful and complex identities. In response, our team is even more geographically distributed than it was a year ago; aspiring to be more deeply embedded in the local contexts in which we work. We are explicitly working on what it means in practice to deal with urban systems by both reaching down into neighbourhoods and up into sprawling economic and ecological geographies and supply chains. We recognise the need to mobilise national and regional authorities as much as municipal governments if we are to truly rewrite the DNA of cities and their dynamic flows beyond the traditional city boundaries. Each of these points probably warrants a post in themselves, and over the next months we’ll be sharing in more detail some of our insights from the work in different places.</p> Why cities — revisited <p>These experiences and reflections have pushed us to refocus on the why, what and how of city transitions. Of all the problem and opportunity spaces our world has to offer, why do we choose to ‘lean into’&nbsp;cities?</p><p>Aggregate and compound&nbsp;value</p><p>Cities are where many of the most complex challenges we face combine into webs of cascading risks and legacy lock-ins. It’s widely acknowledged that cities are a net-contributor to climate breakdown, covering less than two percent of the earth’s surface, but consuming 78% of the world’s energy, producing more than 60% of all carbon emissions and reinforcing the habits, lifestyles and extractive economies most associated with the causes of the climate crisis. And the past year has been a particularly stark reminder that this takes place in the context of chronic and deepening ‘multiple horizon’ emergencies, of growing disparities in wealth and power, and the double edged sword of runaway technological capabilities.</p><p>While the scale and entanglement of the problems are enormous, so is the possibility for impact. If we succeed in transitioning cities to a more sustainable and democratic future, the aggregated value of improving the lives of the vast urban populations cities serve is clear. But cities are also particularly powerful hubs of knowledge and collaborative innovation capacity, driven by their innate diversity, their assertive plurality of institutional and non-institutional actors, and their capacity to attract capital. This, together with the soon to be made available ‘once-in-a-generation’ investments, if leveraged well, can shift them from engines of unsustainable growth to catalysts of healthy, green, caring transitions.</p><p>The pathways for deploying this capital need to be explored in the full acknowledgement of complexity, uncertainty and entanglement. This also means that we cannot just engage deeply with neighbourhoods and communities, but also have to think widely across (bio)regional and even national economies and ecologies. They provide fertile ground for strategic innovation and new lead markets (e.g. bio-based zero embodied carbon building, nature-based solutions financing, industrial hydrogen) that represent significant compound value and multiplier effects beyond the city’s municipal limits. This, in turn, is critical to overcome the growing political divides and spectre of culture wars between cities and hinterlands where it comes to the winners and losers of transition.</p><p>An opportunity to build institutional capacity for deep transitions</p><p>More fundamentally, we’re seeing more and more clearly the urgent need to enable the deep institutional shift from incrementalism to transformative change. Cities are expressing that they see the need to accelerate this shift — but it is evident they currently struggle to provide the conditions for this to happen. They want systemic change — but can they change their systems? Siloed organisations; analogue-era regulatory approaches; resistance to policy-making that actively shapes markets; limited capabilities in blended finance and multiple outcome accounting; underdeveloped local innovation ecosystems; and rudimentary infrastructures for collaborating with citizens are just some of the critical institutional capacity gaps present in cities. At the same time, the Deep Demonstration in Healthy Clean Cities has seen emergent progress in many of these fields: from Vienna’s success in bringing together a remarkably large number of departments around its decarbonisation agenda employing ‘ <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/why-we-need-more-t-shaped-graduates-1.2584765">T-shaped’ </a>team members to connect opportunities, to Amsterdam’s dynamic outcome-based regulation aspirations for last-mile logistics, cities are starting to embrace pathways to action that can match the ever-more ambitious target-setting. If we succeed in redesigning the dark matter of city systems, and unlock such fertile institutional ground for creating sustainable, democratic urban environments, we go a long way to accelerating transitions towards rapid decarbonisation and a healthier, more sustainable human thriving.</p> What’s at&nbsp;stake? <p>Of course, institutional capacity is just one side of the equation. The other is where it takes us. Directionality matters. Intentionality matters. Values matter. So what are we trying to achieve with our work in&nbsp;cities?</p><p>At Dark Matter Labs, the aspirations of city transitions is to create a thriving urban everyday life with radically improved standards of civic agency and the opportunity for human flourishing afforded to all, within planetary boundaries, and alongside a regenerated natural realm. We see this manifesting across a range of domains and lived experiences in cities and peri-urban areas.</p>Visual from our Malmö Example Streets experiment proposition<p>In the near and now, we aspire for ‘cities-as-commons’ — places where participatory governance of civic assets shape our communities, public spaces and local economy. New institutional tools, such as <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/climate-city-contracting-for-humane-thriving-39153a2ba5ab">multiple-level climate contracts</a> and <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/network-city-endowments/">civic endowments</a> for shared infrastructure and innovation investment, are building blocks for this. We see cities as carbon positive urban environments — not just because of decarbonised homes and transport, but also with <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-aa141acdf227">vast urban nature</a> capable of turning concrete jungles into their very own carbon sinks. We aspire for ‘<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/building-mental-wealth-34441f638e3b">caring cities</a>’ — places that privilege and properly invest in wellbeing and empathy, but also shared learning and active participation in deep democracy. We see cities as circular and collaborative, where food and (re)construction are part of digitally integrated local value chains capable of building community wealth and local resilience, underpinned by next generation logistics systems and agile regulation that include real-time environmental performance as key&nbsp;metric.</p><p>Urban futures like these would mean people having more power over their places, a deeper relationship with nature despite their urban setting, a sharpened consciousness of the materiality of their city, greater security and capacity to focus on the pursuit of equitable human flourishing, and the ability to benefit from the value generated by collective endeavours, all the while preserving and nourishing our shared ecosystems. It is a vision in which cities finally deliver on their promise to each and every one of&nbsp;us.</p> How might we get&nbsp;there? <p>As we’re often reminded, it’s not enough to have a clear case for change and a compelling vision for how things can be different. This is particularly true in the uncertain, complex and emergent times in which we live. So if there is no clear linear pathway to unlock such a city transition, how do we&nbsp;proceed?</p><p>Our thesis at Dark Matter Labs is that there are a set of key ingredients we must start&nbsp;with.</p><p>Strategic risk and future liability</p><p>Even though 2020 showed in brutal tangibility what ‘<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/governing-the-asian-century-28b7ce1aaf2e">interconnected and cascading risk</a>’ can mean for cities, urban governments and the national equivalents that support them systematically fail to properly account for risk and liability. In too many cities we see ambitious urban strategies for decarbonisation sat in juxtaposition with stable consumption of high embodied carbon materials such as concrete. In too many cities we see aspirations for eliminating poverty alongside extractive development models reliant on housing and land asset bubbles. In too many cities we see ambitions for once-in-a-lifetime deep energy retrofitting investments that are unconnected to other needs and opportunities in neighbourhoods, like reimaging streets, creating digitally enabled local supply chains or building community wealth. In too many cities we see a growing awareness of mental health risk being undercut by an ongoing inability to make long investments into social infrastructure that overcome loneliness and strengthen individual and collective resilience.</p><p>To address these disconnects, we’re focussing on building capabilities and mechanisms for understanding and acting on strategic risk. That means assessing risk and liabilities not at a project level, but rather at a whole-place transition level: identifying the extent to which a proposed course of action or set of interventions impacts on the ability of a city to deliver on its vision and mission. In our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-way-forward-77ad17a031cc">age of the long emergencies</a>, cities must take steps to address multiple levers of change, connect several domains of vulnerability and opportunity, and unlock new lead&nbsp;markets.</p><p>This new relationship with foundational risk and liability at the urban level can have a ripple effect on some crucial practices that define the trajectory of cities, perhaps most profoundly in how we move towards strategic investment portfolios inextricably linked to the transitions we pursue. We are exploring a range of instruments and financial models such as smart and tradable perpetual bonds that can amplify the capacity of public sector and other public interest actors to raise capital for long term multiple outcome interventions; urban-scale carbon sequestration certificates as a pathway to broader ecosystem services investment certification; and a Settlement Risk-Innovation Facility to enable systemic innovations to resolve key liabilities (e.g. urban air pollution) with solutions that can only be proven over time. Alongside similar efforts such as those of the <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/programmes/transformation-capital/">Transformation Capital Initiative</a>, we are bringing together problem owners, solution providers and financiers in new relationships that again are geared towards aligning interests for the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>Portfolios of interconnected interventions</p><p>As cities make this shift towards more co-beneficiary investment strategies, the necessity of a portfolio of interconnected interventions becomes clear. EIT Climate-KIC’s 2019 strategy document <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Transformation-in-time.pdf">Transition, in Time</a> lays out how, in the context of uncertainty, a portfolio approach is essential to discover options and pathways. What we have seen over the last year and a half working with EIT Climate-KIC and <a href="https://tomorrowscities.partners/">a range of other partners</a> in fifteen cities across Europe is how the portfolio of interventions need to focus both on domain-based and on transversal approaches. The two intertwine to recognise the complex and adaptive nature of systems, but also to generate systems learning and mark out possible transition pathways, rather than seeking to simply validate whether a single point intervention has impact or&nbsp;not.</p>Overview of one strategic experiment in Madrid’s Health Clean Cities portfolio of interventions<p>To start with the transversal: the next generation transition finance capabilities we mention above are just one of the cross-cutting innovation capacities that cities need. Regulatory innovation capacity will be equally essential: updating cities’ regulatory frameworks can not be limited to a one-off fix to include e.g. embodied carbon emissions into their planning systems and public realm specification sheets. Rather, it needs to be a permanent capacity for change that can work with civic and private stakeholders as well as with other public authorities in an on-going, agile and transparent manner to integrate new progress metrics and strategic learnings stemming from accelerated decarbonisation and pollution targets into policy frameworks. As our <a href="https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/report/legitimacities/">Legitimacities</a> publication set out, this requires us to build a new set of collaboration settings (‘sandboxes’) and capabilities so that urban regulatory experiments can be created with and co-governed by people from across sectors, rebuilding trust and revealing transition pathways.</p><p>And regulatory innovation is just one aspect of a broader transition governance capacity, which is multifaceted and needs active investment at a time where large amounts of recovery capital and transition needs will at local level often meet deeply ingrained scepticism and mistrust of ‘change’ and its winners and losers. It is extremely unlikely that a truly just transition can be forged through the decision-making patterns of the past. Hence we are working to develop a new range of ‘transition’ governance tools and mechanisms, ranging from new contracting architecture for collective action with Leuven2030, to new collaborative governance arrangements with the Orleans Metropole. Our collaboration with <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/climate-city-contracting-for-humane-thriving-39153a2ba5ab">Viable Cities and nine Swedish cities to establish Climate City Contracts</a> — an emergent and agile contracting architecture for complex and entangled challenges like the climate emergency — is another example of an alliance of partners working together to reimagine governance.</p><p>In a city portfolio, such ‘horizontal’ innovation capabilities meet with a range of ‘vertical’ missions or integrated interventions such as fostering circular economies, at-scale nature-based solutions, and whole-district climate retrofitting (or actually, we’d prefer to call it future-fitting — as it also needs to take stock of shifting working patterns after Covid-19, counter the loneliness epidemic, and build resilience in adapting to a 3+ Celsius scenario of climate extremes). In each of these domains there are interconnected financial, regulatory and broader transition governance questions, alongside technology and data questions. Responding to these entanglements through a portfolio approach can enable cities to become early movers in lead markets that can build new inclusive value and supply chains, attract investment and drive sustainable recovery. While confronting to the managerial orthodoxies of city administrations, this more dynamic approach inevitably gives rise to new and valuable institutional and sector-specific tools such as comfort contracts that can bind together households, energy solutions providers and financiers in a district retrofit; or material registries that can enable the construction and real estate finance sector to embrace circularity, and make decisions based on long-term considerations.</p> Towards more hopeful urban&nbsp;futures <p>As we continue down the multiple transition pathways we have embarked on with cities, we are making some strategic bets where we will invest our time and energy over the coming years. We’re working with cities and a range of partners on developing strategic transition portfolios, on place-based proofs of possibility exploring how the full stack of institutional innovations can be brought together, and on particular tools and instruments for next generation governance and finance. Across these three types of work, we increasingly pay attention to how we learn from strategic experiments and build capabilities in the process. We believe that by better structuring the demand for such change, building new functions of governance, and showing tangible demonstrations of new and legitimate transition pathways, we can reorientate our cities’ current trajectories towards more hopeful&nbsp;futures.</p><p>This is our emerging thesis on redesigning the dark matter of city systems. It has been built through the support from, and conversations with many of our partners, and we are encouraged by (and immensely grateful for) their trust in together navigating the opportunities for positive change in an uncertain world. Equally, we are keenly aware that our approaches and practices are inevitably incomplete — and we’d like to invite feedback and discussion in order to spot gaps, next opportunities, and blind spots as well as complementary perspectives. It’s not quite true that this shared endeavour is ‘just getting started’ — but given the terrain ahead, that’s often what it feels like. We look forward to exploring the way forward with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Written by <a href="https://twitter.com/joostbeunderman?lang=en">Joost Beunderman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/t_bez12">Tom Beresford</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RonnquistLinnea">Linnea Rönnquist</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DanWainwright15">Dan Wainwright,</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/lesinterstices">Jonathan Lapalme</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/eunjikangsin">Eunji Kang</a> in deep acknowledgement of contributions to our work with cities by other DM colleagues, our kin (the <a href="https://www.project00.cc">00 ecosystem</a>) and our partners — particularly <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org">EIT-Climate KIC</a>, <a href="https://tomorrowscities.partners/Partners">Bankers Without Boundaries, Democratic Society and Material Economics</a>.</p>Funded by EIT Climate-KIC <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/accelerating-city-transitions-3baadbfdcd68">Accelerating City Transitions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>Luxembourg, April 2021 – Tokeny Solutions has announced a white-label secondary market solution for securities issuers and digital asset marketplaces to improve private market access for investors. The Billboard module of the T-REX Platform allows an issuer’s investors to connect with one another, express trading intentions and ultimately execute peer-to-peer security token transfers on a decentralized infrastructure. Asset issuers can utilise the solution today, and improve the experience for their investors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The private market industry is one that has grown impressively over the past decade, offering lucrative returns for investors. Yet, due to this industry operating on a plethora of centralized, manual and inefficient networks, there is barely any transferability in the secondary market. Investors are resigned to long lock-up periods and ultimately face costly liquidity problems. Today, this is a barrier to entry for many as liquidity is often needed, especially in times of economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Billboard leverages decentralized technologies to digitally identify stakeholders and their assets to facilitate transactions. Thanks to onchain identities, the ownership and the eligibility claims of the counterparties are automatically verified. Once verified, the transaction is rapidly executed peer-to-peer by investors. This easy-to-use type of transfer reduces many fees seen in traditional private markets such as those to do with settlement and custody.</p>

		 
	 
    Since 2017, security tokens have promised to bring liquidity to an industry that has long been starved of it. So far, this hasn’t happened due to the lack of a complete, end-to-end solution, from the identification of investors down to the on-chain transfer. With T-REX Billboard, we are delighted to be the first company to finally deliver on this promise and open a broad spectrum of opportunities to a wider group of investors, and improve the liquidity as a result.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions       As the leading pan-European market infrastructure, we invested in Tokeny with the shared vision that blockchain technologies and the use of security tokens could further support the development of private markets. Billboard, the new module of the T-REX security token platform, is a significant step in this journey and completes Tokeny’s offerings: financial institutions now have all the technological pieces to efficiently interact with security tokens, and thus grasp the benefits of blockchain technology in the world of private markets.  Pierre DavoustHead of CSDs in Euronext and Non-Executive Director at Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>Blockchain technology is now recognized as an infrastructure to issue and transfer securities across capital markets. These securities, or security tokens, fall under the same rules and regulations as traditional financial securities in many European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the UK. Asset owners utilising Billboard also benefit from the built-in compliance of the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX security token standard</a>, which has been used to tokenize over €8.5 billion of assets to date.</p>

<p>Dresden, Germany and Sparks, Nevada, April 1, 2021 – Blockchains, Inc., a Nevada-based blockchain technology company committed to protecting and empowering individuals, today announced its acquisition of evan GmbH. Headquartered in Dresden, Germany, evan focuses on building for the new economy through its blockchain-based decentralized identifier solutions.</p>
<p>“Developing a trust infrastructure based on digital identity is key for cooperation on the blockchain. Enabling parties to transfer trust from the real world to the digital world is what led us to Blockchains,” said Thomas Müller, evan’s co-founder and CEO. “Digital identity is in Blockchains’ DNA. We are very excited to be joining the Blockchains’ family and working with like-minded innovators and visionary developers to empower individuals and businesses.”</p>
<p>In 2018, the founders of evan GmbH set out to jump-start the movement to Web 3.0 by developing decentralized identifiers for businesses to interact directly with each other without an intermediary, by leveraging automation and a trust and trace-based methodology. Evan’s core technologies have significant implications for Blockchains’ suite of solutions currently in development. The companies plan to integrate evan’s solution stack with Blockchains’ digital platform to empower individuals by allowing them to control their personal information and assets.</p>
<p>Recognized as one of Gartner’s Cool Vendors in Blockchain Business in 2020, evan is a contributor of the W3C, an international consortium where member organizations and the public work together to develop Web standards. Additionally, the company is a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation and partners with Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation network organizations.</p>
<p>Evan’s expertise extends to employing identity through IoT devices for use-cases in a variety of industries, including energy, government services, transportation, and healthcare. “How IoT connects to decentralized identifiers provides significant privacy benefits when these devices are communicating directly with the outside world, and when the devices operate with multiple parties in different contexts, such as when part of a supply chain or when integrated into smart city infrastructure,” said Thomas Herbst, co-founder and CTO, evan GmbH.</p>
<p>“The value that evan brings to Blockchains is not only in the tremendously talented people who built a technology portfolio based on a much-needed trust infrastructure but also a deep understanding for developing decentralized solutions with global interoperability standards in mind,” said Lee Weiss, executive vice president, Blockchains. “Whether for companies to be able to work together and with us in our blockchain-based smart city in Nevada, or for us to be able to partner with a wide scale of enablers for our digital ecosystem, interoperability is key.”</p>
<p>Together, evan and Blockchains are writing a new chapter in the evolution of the web by breaking dependencies on central platform providers and giving individuals back their autonomy in the digital space.</p>The post <a href="https://evan.network/news/blockchains-acquisition-evan/">Blockchains Strengthens Decentralized Identity Capabilities with Acquisition of evan GmbH</a> first appeared on <a href="https://evan.network"></a>.

<p>Our April 1st platform update brings increased performance, noticeably faster speed, and groundbreaking security enhancements.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>The highly anticipated No-Factor Authentication (NFA) feature is the pinnacle of cybersecurity innovation. It removes the hassle of logging into workstations and applications by eliminating the need to log in…altogether. </p>
      
<p>That’s right — we’ve gotten rid of the login screen completely, so there is no barrier to entry.*&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
 Instant Access for Anyone, Anywhere 
      
<p>No-factor login means you don’t need to prove who you are. By eliminating the authentication flow, your teams will enjoy an unrivaled sense of freedom when logging in. Just sit down at your computer, and begin using it. Nothing else is required —&nbsp;no password, token, biometric, nothing. </p>
      
<p>Arguably, this approach is more secure than a password.</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
 Easy Logout 
      
<p>Logging out has never been easier. You don’t need to log out, because you were never really logged in. Feel free to get up from the computer, walk away from it (leaving it in any state), and when returning it is simply open and available to you.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>A seamless logout experience is only possible with No-factor authentication.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 How It Works: Bleeding-Edge Technology 
      
<p>From machine learning to Zero Trust architecture to immutable blockchain-based identity stores, NFA combines the latest buzzwords to achieve bleeding-edge innovation. </p>
      

      
<p>All the user needs to do is show up. HYPR’s NFA architecture handles the rest. Our R&amp;D team has been working tirelessly on eliminating login and what you see today is the culmination of decades of hard work.</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
 Super Low Pricing 
      
<p>Looking for great ROI when sourcing a security product? How about one that requires no investment?  </p>
      
<p>If you’ve come this far, then by now you’ve probably realized that this feature doesn’t exist, so you’ll never have to pay for it. Happy April Fool’s Day 2021.</p>
      
<p>* Electricity and internet connection are still required.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data has driven incredible improvements in the way people have experienced financial services over the last decade. Services that once could only be done at bank branches can now be easily accessed online. And people now have powerful financial information, products, and management tools at their fingertips via their mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The expansion of open banking is creating a new turning point in the money experience. Open banking allows consumers to share their financial data with third-party developers and fintechs in exchange for new services—unlocking the potential of financial data to catalyze another generation of innovation across the industry. Services such as providing financial data to build credit and gain immediate access to capital, initiating a direct payment to a business or individual, and managing household expenses and budgets fundamentally change the boundaries of banking relationships.</p>
<p>Responsible data practices are required for participants to best take advantage of this technology. The key differentiator that sets the world of open banking apart from previous innovation environments is the requirement for consumer consent in data sharing and adherence to core data principles: control, access, transparency, traceability, and security (CATTS).</p>
<p>In order to enable open banking and empower customers, data access agreements (DAA) must be in place to ensure access to financial data that financial service providers need to innovate and provide new services and benefits in a digital world. These agreements define common rules for how two parties—usually an open banking platform or financial data aggregator and a financial institution—will communicate and exchange financial data. More secure data access agreements mean more connections that financial service providers can use to empower consumers with greater control over their financial health.&nbsp;</p>
 Finicity’s Market Leadership in Financial Data 
<p>Finicity’s connections cover 95% of direct deposit accounts in North America. And thanks to 20 signed direct access agreements with some of the nation’s largest financial institutions, we support 60% of our traffic with direct API access. We expect that direct-API traffic share to grow to over 80% by the end of 2021, greatly reducing the use of user credentials and screen scraping in the financial services market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2017, we have led in signing data access agreements with the top FIs including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, Fidelity and many others.&nbsp; And, in just the past year, Finicity has worked to strengthen the open banking ecosystem by creating stronger, more secure data access agreements and partnerships with key financial institutions and fintechs, including Charles Schwab, TD Bank, Citi, Brex, Chime, US Bank, and BMO Harris.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And where Finicity has been leading, the market is following. Along with an increasing number of financial institutions and other financial service providers, more payroll providers are recognizing that consumers can benefit from the data they hold. As a result, these providers are adopting API connections to open banking platforms that expand the use of financial data in lending, tenant screening, background checks, government verification and personal financial management.&nbsp; Finicity announced a Direct Access Agreement with the leading payroll provider in September 2020, representing 16% of the payroll provider market.</p>
<p>DAAs provide the broader fintech and financial services community with access, through Finicity, to consumer-permissioned financial data that enables a variety of apps and services across financial management, payments, lending, and beyond. And a key result for all parties is enhanced data stability, accuracy and improved security through reduction of user credentials.</p>
<p>A direct access agreement with Finicity ensures the most reliable data security for financial institutions while still enabling fintechs and financial service providers to deliver solutions that empower consumers and foster financial inclusion.

<p>Cisco has released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-privacy-benchmark-study-2021.pdf">Data Privacy Benchmark Study 2021</a>&nbsp;and it’s got some revealing insights for enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly,&nbsp;this&nbsp;year’s study is framed&nbsp;around&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;and&nbsp;reveals the pandemic has&nbsp;significantly&nbsp;elevated the importance of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;as a business priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cisco&nbsp;says: “The reaffirmation of privacy’s value even during the pandemic positions it as a priority for years to come. Privacy is no longer an afterthought; it is core to how we work and interact with each other. The Age of Privacy has arrived.”&nbsp;We wholeheartedly&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">agree with these sentiments</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cisco’s Data Privacy Benchmark 2021 is a significant study. It’s an annual survey which, for this&nbsp;2021&nbsp;installment,&nbsp;anonymously&nbsp;surveyed more than 4,700 security professionals from&nbsp;25 geographies&nbsp;in mid-2020.&nbsp;Respondents&nbsp;represented&nbsp;all major industries and organization size. It also&nbsp;drew&nbsp;on&nbsp;data&nbsp;from Cisco’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-consumer-privacy-infographic-2020.pdf">2020 Consumer Privacy Survey</a>, which was completed in&nbsp;mid-2020 by 2,600 adults in 12 countries.*&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;four key&nbsp;messages that flow from&nbsp;Cisco’s Data Privacy Benchmark 2021&nbsp;are&nbsp;important&nbsp;for enterprise:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Privacy&nbsp;is helping&nbsp;organizations to overcome the challenges of the pandemic.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Cisco reports 93 percent of organizations&nbsp;used&nbsp;their privacy team to help&nbsp;navigate and manage&nbsp;their pandemic response&nbsp;in 2020, particularly the rapid shift to remote work and&nbsp;balancing&nbsp;individual rights&nbsp;and&nbsp;public safety. Private and secure remote work access and systems and policies for&nbsp;when and how to share employees’ personal information and to limit access to and use of that data&nbsp;are&nbsp;urgent priorities&nbsp;in the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Investment in privacy&nbsp;has increased&nbsp;and&nbsp;ROI is positive.&nbsp; 



 &nbsp; 



<p>As you’d expect in a pandemic, the study shows&nbsp;privacy budgets&nbsp;across all organization sizes&nbsp;roughly&nbsp;doubled in 2020.&nbsp;The&nbsp;average&nbsp;privacy spend is now USD&nbsp;2.4 million.&nbsp;While&nbsp;ROI&nbsp;on this spend&nbsp;was slightly down compared&nbsp;with2019,&nbsp;it&nbsp;tracked similarly to 2020 and remained&nbsp;solid.&nbsp;Thirty-five percent&nbsp;of respondents&nbsp;reported&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;at least two times&nbsp;their investments&nbsp;in areas such as mitigating losses from data breaches,&nbsp;spurring&nbsp;innovation, achieving operational efficiency, and building trust with customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Tighter privacy laws&nbsp;are welcomed and positively regarded.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>We recently told you about the new&nbsp;“privacy actives”, a term Cisco coined&nbsp;following&nbsp;its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/en_uk/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">2019&nbsp;Consumer Privacy Survey</a>.&nbsp;‘Privacy actives’ are highly motivated privacy-aware individuals&nbsp;who&nbsp;care about privacy,&nbsp;are willing to act to protect theirs, and&nbsp;are proactive&nbsp;about it.&nbsp;The latest Cisco data shows organizations are recognizing and responding to this new influential demographic and accept that consumers won’t buy their products and services if they perceive a risk to their personal information&nbsp;from the company’s data practices and policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such,&nbsp;the steady tightening of privacy laws globally,&nbsp;which&nbsp;promote&nbsp;greater transparency, fairness and accountability,&nbsp;are being welcomed and positively regarded by&nbsp;both&nbsp;enterprise and consumers. Cisco&nbsp;reports&nbsp;that 79 percent&nbsp;of organizations indicated&nbsp;privacy regulations&nbsp;are having a positive impact (and only a&nbsp;5&nbsp;percent&nbsp;negative impact).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about&nbsp;how&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">privacy regulations&nbsp;are&nbsp;picking up pace</a>&nbsp;at the state level in the US and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Privacy is&nbsp;becoming&nbsp;even more&nbsp;critical to the bottom line.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Cisco has several key findings in this area:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  90&nbsp;percent of respondents agreed&nbsp;that external privacy certifications, such as&nbsp;ISO 27701, APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules, and EU Binding Corporate Rules,&nbsp;are an important buying factor when choosing a product or vendor.&nbsp;  Organizations with more mature privacy practices are&nbsp;enjoying greater&nbsp;business benefits than average and are&nbsp;in a stronger position&nbsp;to handle new and evolving privacy regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;  More security professionals&nbsp;say&nbsp;data&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;is now a core requirement of their role, and&nbsp;93&nbsp;percent of organizations&nbsp;are reporting&nbsp;privacy metrics&nbsp;such as&nbsp;privacy program audit findings, privacy impact assessments, and data breaches to their&nbsp;board.&nbsp;  



<p>All these findings&nbsp;point to the fact the pandemic has strengthened&nbsp;the commitment to privacy&nbsp;globally.&nbsp;As the report summarizes: “Privacy budgets have increased over the last year, organizations have more resources focused on privacy, and privacy investments going above and beyond the law are translating into real business value. Privacy legislation and external certifications are providing assurance in a business environment where it’s hard to know whom to trust. Consumers are exercising their privacy rights and demanding enforcement of existing privacy protections.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed,&nbsp;Cisco could not be plainer in its assessment of privacy’s importance to business&nbsp;as we move further into 2021:&nbsp;“Organizations that get privacy right improve trust with their customers, operational efficiency, and both top-line and bottom-line results.”&nbsp;</p>

 Already integrated by SAP and rfxcel, the Spherity Credentialing Service is now ready to be shipped to the&nbsp;market <p>Spherity announces the launch of its new product: The Spherity Credentialing Service, which sets the benchmark for compliance solutions in the field of trading partner verification and is available from today. The product establishes trust in digital interactions between trading partners in pharmaceutical supply chains and ensures compliance with the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act&nbsp;(DSCSA).</p>Spherity Credentialing Service — Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@aronvisuals?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Aron&nbsp;Visuals</a><p>We are proud that Novartis, as an innovation leader, is looking to adopt the Spherity Credentialing Service. David Mason, Regional Serialization Lead at Novartis says that “Using credentialing is the first proven digital solution for our industry that addresses the ATP compliance gap of knowing if the counterparty is an Authorized Trading Partner. This is a foundation to meet DSCSA requirements by&nbsp;2023.”</p><p><a href="https://news.sap.com/2021/03/pharmaceutical-supply-chain-industry-pilot/">SAP</a> and <a href="https://rfxcel.com/rfxcel-adopts-open-credentialing-initiative-oci-meet-dscsa-authorized-trading-partner-atp-requirements/">rfxcel</a> have integrated the Spherity Credentialing Service within their verification routing service solutions to be able to share and verify the Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) status in product verifications. Herb Wong, Vice President of Marketing &amp; Strategic Initiatives at rfxcel says “The Credentialing Service is the most comprehensive effort to address the upcoming Authorized Trading Partner requirement for DSCSA. rfxcel was impressed to see how seamlessly it integrated with our solution.” Dr. Oliver Nuernberg, Chief Product Owner at SAP says “For SAP, one of the key requirements was to ensure that the existing returns verification process is not impacted by adding credentialing. By making the credentialing optional, we further ensure that our customers can add this capability over time without disrupting existing processes.”</p><p>The <a href="https://spherity.com/credentialing-service/">Spherity Credentialing Service</a> enables supply chain actors to verify in real time that they are only exchanging information with Authorized Trading Partners (ATP), as per DSCSA requirements, even when they do not have a direct business relationship yet. The Spherity Credentialing Service integrated Legisym as credential issuer and is based on the ATP architecture that was tested by an industry wide pilot. Beyond DSCSA compliance, Spherity leverages process efficiencies of exchanging data with indirect business partners by avoiding manual and time consuming due diligence processes. Saving significant time and money for all participants in the ecosystem.</p><p>To drive the utilization of decentralized digital identity technologies across the industry, Spherity participates in the newly founded Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI). As an industry consortium, this initiative incubates the ATP architecture and governs further standardization efforts.</p><p>“Using ATP credentials for product verification interactions is just the tip of the iceberg. The established enterprise identities and associated verifiable credentials will leverage efficiency to exchange data in regulated environments”, says Georg Jürgens, Manager Industry Solutions at Spherity.</p> About Spherity <p><a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a> is building decentralized digital identity management solutions to power the fourth industrial revolution, bringing secure identities to enterprises, machines, products, data and even algorithms. We provide the enabling technology to digitize and automate compliance processes primarily in highly-regulated technical sectors like pharmaceuticals, automotive and logistics.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/fisher">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>I have been covering cybersecurity issues, first as a journalist then as an analyst, since 2006. In that 15 years I have heard the mantra that security is a boardroom issue hundreds of times. The subject has filled countless conference talks and media articles.</p>
<p>It appears that the message is still not getting through if a <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/ncsc-ceo-first-speech" title="speech by the new CEO of the UK National Cyber Security Centre">speech by the new CEO of the UK National Cyber Security Centre</a> (NCSC) anything is to go by. In her first public speaking engagement in March this year, Lindy Cameron, said, you guessed it folks, security must be given more attention in&nbsp;the boardroom.</p>
<p>“Cybersecurity is still not taken as seriously as it should be, and simply is not embedded in UK boardrooms. The pace of change is no excuse — in boardrooms, digital literacy is as non-negotiable as financial or legal literacy,” she said.</p>
<p>“Our CEOs should be as close to their CISO as their finance director and general counsel, and we want to help them to develop this knowledge, as we’re all too aware that cyber-skills are not yet fundamental to our education — even though these are life skills like wiring a plug or changing a tyre as well as skills for the future digital economy.”</p>
<p>Fine words and reported diligently by a few security media outlets in between the latest sensational cyber-attacks. But why has it not changed – and more importantly, does it even matter?</p>
 Have a cigar? 
<p>I take issue that cybersecurity is “not taken seriously” by CEOs etc. I believe they are more than aware of the risk of cyber-attacks. But there is a crucial difference between taking an issue seriously and making it a regular “embedded” boardroom issue - one discussed and approved by directors at all time. This is what many aspire to and to get there, security people are told they must speak the “language of business” for budget approval and to get things done.</p>
<p>I am not sure those who want a seat at the table will ever find one. Perhaps security is not a regular boardroom issue because the board simply expects the CISO and everyone in the hierarchy beneath them to get on with the job. It also betrays a lack of awareness by the “cyber is a boardroom issue” lobby as to <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/04/leading-from-the-boardroom" title="what board meetings consist of">what board meetings consist of</a>.</p>
 Mind your language 
<p>Very often this debate is framed around language – the Board does not care because CISOs only talk in technical terms they do not understand. If security people can frame security needs and projects with “normal” business language, then more budget may be forthcoming or new policies could be approved. I’m not so sure this makes a difference.</p>
<p>Other than reducing people-based incidents such as phishing through awareness training (not usually successful in the long term), reducing cyber risk is almost 100% based on the successful management of policies, IT and software. Therefore, it is not unreasonable for a CEO and the board to consider it primarily an IT issue.</p>
<p>There are articles, books even, which explain how to get boardroom buy-in – yet the amount of activity and social interaction that these entails would preclude the CISO from doing much else. Other organizations are simply too small to have an expensive and dedicated CISO function – so they rely on managed security services. The board then simply expects that company to do what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>Unlike finance, HR, marketing, R&amp;D and other LOBs, IT security is a function of risk and event management and not one of creative development - it is a negative asset- one that organizations would gladly pay less for if they could. Security does not lead to innovation, create new markets, design new products and services or consider the impact of M&amp;A, ROI, or P&amp;L. It is however a cost entry in the auditor’s report.</p>
 Focus on technology not theory 
<p>For her first speech, Linda Cameron would have done to better to focus on how advanced technology, automation and better deigned security tools are doing more keep organizations safe than trotting out a tired line about security’s battle to be taken seriously by the board.</p>
<p>Outside of this diversion the best CISOs, CIOs and IT managers are putting in place security technologies that focus on the end user by working with vendors and analysts to find the right solution. They are making employees lives easier by deploying solutions that provide privileged access, single sign on, secure remote access etc without security controls getting in the way. This is surely making security a business issue -without needing boardroom approval.</p>
<p>Given the workload of most CISOs right now, not having to worry about speaking to the board would probably come as a relief. Of course, the one time a CISO may be summoned to the board is when there is a serious breach, but no-one ever said life was fair.</p>

   Getting these elements right can be the dividing line between IoT chaos or control 

<p>Too many vendor-based IoT blogs and articles go like this:</p>

  AMAZING STATISTIC on the exponential growth of IoT! (Hint: It’s huge!) 
	 SCARY STATISTIC on how out of control the situation is. (Note: It’s very, very out of control!) 
	 (ANOTHER) SCARY STATISTIC on how a single compromised device can imperil your entire organization. 
	 CONCLUSION: Buy our stuff. 
 <p>These basic tenets are obvious and generally well understood by anybody in the orbit of IT. Missing here, however, is what are the essential elements that are needed to get your Internet of Things (IoT) project off the ground. What should you be looking for or careful not to miss? Based on my conversations with many customers in all industries and in all phases of their IoT projects, I’ve put together six must-haves that need to be in any IoT plan.&nbsp;</p>

 Must-Have #1: Support for Smart Devices 

<p>IoT devices come in several different flavors. A common one is the “smart device.” Smart devices are small computers: they are IP addressable, have a microprocessor, communicate using a protocol (Wi-Fi, Z-wave, or other), and have memory storage for an X.509 certificate, which is a public key cryptographic document used to secure the device. A smart IoT device can perform some complex tasks, and some even have a user interface (UI) that can be accessed. Your IoT plan needs to make provisions for how to manage these smart devices, including how to update software, if allowed. Your plan should also take into account how to install and refresh a security certificate. And, it should address how to manage these devices like any other computer on your network. But aren’t all IoT devices “smart” you may ask? Read on to find out.</p>

 Must-Have #2: Support for Constrained Devices 

<p>Not all IoT devices are “smart”. In fact, quite a few are just inexpensive, single-purpose devices that sit at the edge of the network and communicate through a gateway. These are known as “constrained” devices because they are limited – or constrained – in how much you can interface with the device or customize it for your environment. An example is a simple temperature sensor. But that doesn’t mean you can ignore them. The truth is you’ll have both smart and constrained devices on your network, and you need a solution that can manage both.</p>

 Must-Have #3: Support for Offline Capabilities 

<p>Think of where IoT devices are installed. While most are operating within the comfortable confines of the network WiFi, many others are mobile or far afield in places like factories, oil platforms, utility buildings, cars, and the like. Communications may be intermittent. A critical, often overlooked element in IoT plans is how do you support the offline nature of IoT devices? In particular, how do you authenticate devices to ensure they can continue to do their jobs while momentarily unable to connect to the network? A well-executed IoT plan should account for how offline devices can be secured and authenticated while off the network. Also needing to be accounted for is what happens when they rejoin the network in terms of synchronization with policy changes and event logs.</p>

 Must-Have #4: Manage IoT and Humans With a Common Platform 

<p>Who wants one more platform to manage? My guess is nobody. In that case, you need to manage your IoT devices like you do your users – with the same<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform"> identity platform</a>. This can be done because the users and devices share similar management and lifecycle needs. Just as you have users join your organization, gain various levels of access, and eventually leave, you also need to verify your IoT devices, authenticate them, give them various levels of access, and then eventually terminate their access and retire them. After all, the principles of least privileges and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/what-entitlement-creep">entitlement creep</a> apply to non-human identities as well. Doing this on a common platform will allow you to manage both human and IoT assets through a common interface.</p>

 Must-Have #5: Integration with Leading IoT Platforms 

<p>The leading cloud platform providers – Google, Amazon, and Microsoft – all have their IoT management features. Best of all, their basic capabilities are often low-cost or even free to use. This is great, but it’s just a starting point. While those vendors offer deep analytics capabilities, they stop where real <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity management</a> capabilities are needed. The cloud providers hand these capabilities off to the IoT application that can manage and secure the IoT devices. That’s why selecting a vendor that has tight integration into your chosen cloud vendor’s platform is essential.&nbsp;</p>

 Must-Have #6: Automatic Authentication, Authorization, and Registration 

<p>Just as it is increasingly difficult – or almost impossible to manually manage the sprawl of identities in your environment – it is nearly impossible to manage all the IoT devices connecting to your network on a daily basis. Once devices are known on the network, a good IoT platform can automatically register devices when they turn on and automatically authenticate them. Automation is the only way to handle IoT projects. Make sure you include vendors who have an automated approach.</p>

 Protecting Your Driver’s License — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials <p>A driver’s license may seem like a simple card that you carry around with you every day, but it can have serious consequences if it falls into the wrong&nbsp;hands.</p><p>Well, let’s imagine for a moment that your wallet containing a few credit cards, your driver’s license, and some cash, is stolen. You would immediately call the credit card companies and let them know about the theft. But what about the driver’s&nbsp;license?</p><p>It can be a time-consuming process to report the theft by which time the thief would have impersonated you with your Personally Identifiable Information!</p><p>What’s a better way to avoid this situation?</p><p>Go for self-sovereign identities (SSI) and <a href="https://medium.com/affinidi/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> because they are private, immutable, secure, and available only in your digital wallet, so you can access it at any time and share it with anyone without ever worrying about losing&nbsp;it.</p> Driver’s License and&nbsp;SSI <p>Let’s take a peek into how you can apply, share, and safeguard your driver’s license through&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>In this example, let’s assume that the applicant wants to use the driver’s license to rent a car from a car rental&nbsp;company.</p><p>There are three parties involved, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Issuer — A startup company that issues standard and interoperable driver license Verifiable Credential (VC) after validating the government-issued driver’s&nbsp;license  Holder — An individual applying for the interoperable driver license&nbsp;VC  Verifier — The car rental&nbsp;company  Creating and Managing a Driver’s License&nbsp;VC<p>Here’s the step-by-step process.</p>  The holder goes to the issuer’s portal to submit the details to get the verifiable credential for the driver’s license. He/she fills up the form and submits&nbsp;it.  The issuer checks the application and issues the verifiable credential to the&nbsp;holder.  The issuer sends the verifiable credential in the form of a QR code, by mail, to the&nbsp;holder.  The holder gets the QR code, scans it using the Wallet application, and saves it to his/her&nbsp;wallet.  The holder goes to the verifier’s website or office and scans the QR&nbsp;code.  The holder checks the Credential Share Request and approves it to share his/her Verifiable Presentation to the verifier, and waits for the confirmation.  The verifier logs into the admin account, checks the list of applications, and verifies the credentials. On confirmation, the verifier rents a car to the&nbsp;holder.  <p>As you can see, the biggest advantage of such an SSI-based driver’s license is that there’s absolutely no possibility of loss. Furthermore, there is no question of your PII on the license to fall into the wrong hands because the holder has complete control over how it is used and with whom it is shared. So, no more worries about losing your driver’s license and facing its repercussions.</p><p>At the same time, it’s simple to implement, foolproof, and saves time and effort for everyone.</p><p>So, are you ready to leverage this power of SSI?

<p>Mathieu: Jimmy, thank you for&nbsp;doing this with me.</p>
<p>Jimmy: Thank you for having me on; I’m looking&nbsp;forward to it.</p>
<p>Mathieu: We’re doing some&nbsp;cool stuff in the self-sovereign identity space,&nbsp;and we’ll get to that&nbsp;in a few minutes. I was curious — I know&nbsp;you come from the crypto space. It seems that a lot of people in the&nbsp;self-sovereign identity community come from crypto backgrounds. Conversely, there are a lot&nbsp;of people in the self-sovereign&nbsp;identity community who try to&nbsp;distance themselves from crypto, but&nbsp;there is some tie there.&nbsp;Did you come from the crypto space?</p>
<p>Jimmy: I’d say,&nbsp;technically, yes. Although, at this moment,&nbsp;all of that is very nuanced. It’s logical&nbsp;that a lot of people come from a crypto background, because the whole&nbsp;idea of decentralization and everything&nbsp;associated with it, is the same&nbsp;mentality that’s carried over. I think it’s good that&nbsp;crypto and SSI have been parting ways a bit.</p>
<p>I entered the crypto space in 2015-2016 through Bitcoin&nbsp;and then Ethereum; mostly being super-interested in the technology, and just geeking out, diving into it. At some point, I met my&nbsp;co-founders from <a href="https://tykn.tech/">Tykn</a>, and they came from the same space.&nbsp;We saw this big identity problem,&nbsp;and I thought, “Okay, can we marry&nbsp;this idea&nbsp;of decentralization with the problem of identity and&nbsp;privacy and everything?” That was at a&nbsp;very naive stage in early 2017, when everything to do with self-sovereign identity and decentralized identity began to emerge. All those&nbsp;ideas&nbsp;are still very rudimentary; you just hash a certain identifier, and&nbsp;you put that on the chain. No one had said, “Maybe that’s a privacy concern&nbsp;and a correlation concern.”</p>
<p>Everyone was very excited about the potential of these&nbsp;ideas. We built some early proofs-of-concept on Ethereum; at a time when&nbsp;you didn’t have ERC 725, it was&nbsp;just ESC 20s. We saw that this is a lot&nbsp;more complicated than it should be when you’re talking about&nbsp;people needing to have tokens in their&nbsp;wallets to interact with this. The UX was truly a nightmare, even conceptually.</p>
<p>At the time, people also had this idea of verifying credentials when paying for things like gas, which didn’t seem like a very good idea. At a certain point, we saw a group of like-minded&nbsp;people within Sovrin, which had&nbsp;only a couple of other stewards at the&nbsp;time&nbsp;(I think we were the ninth when we onboarded in June or July 2017).&nbsp;They’d been working on&nbsp;this concept of self-sovereign identity for a while. We hooked in on that; we saw,&nbsp;“Okay, these&nbsp;guys have done a lot of work&nbsp;that we thought we still had to do.” So, we dove&nbsp;into that and started flying the&nbsp;sovereign/SSI flag. Shortly after that, we started&nbsp;working with The Netherlands’ Red Cross through the&nbsp;510 data team. For us, that was a very valuable experience in needing&nbsp;to make these things work for people&nbsp;on the ground floor and for high-stakes situations. That was&nbsp;very valuable from the perspective of privacy and the implications. We didn’t want to have any perverse incentives,&nbsp;which you also see in certain models. For example, this is one that’s still&nbsp;around: it’s the idea of data marketplaces. In the humanitarian&nbsp;sector, at least, people were pitching&nbsp;this idea of data marketplaces, where refugees and people who’d been&nbsp;struck by disaster&nbsp;could sell their data. They&nbsp;would get money for it, and then they&nbsp;could use that to sustain themselves.&nbsp;That sounds&nbsp;good, in the sense that, “Oh, you’re&nbsp;empowering people with the&nbsp;power of data; we are giving all&nbsp;this data away anyway, and now — power to&nbsp;the people who can use this to get financial&nbsp;freedom.” But, when you’re&nbsp;talking about people who have been put into such a&nbsp;situation, they will, of course, always sell their&nbsp;data. That’s a perverse incentive, because, at that point, they don’t really have a&nbsp;choice — which&nbsp;doesn’t scale very well. Coming&nbsp;face to face with those realizations&nbsp;was very good for us early on.</p>
<p>Mathieu: We came from the&nbsp;crypto space as well; it was similar to Tykn, in that&nbsp;we had done some early POCs on Ethereum and on some other chains. It was the same problem back in the early days: “Yeah, let’s just throw everything on&nbsp;here, let’s disregard anything else. Yay for immutability,&nbsp;yay for not being able to rewrite&nbsp;data and history, let’s go!”</p>
<p>Then, you realize&nbsp;quite quickly that this doesn’t work. It doesn’t even work for&nbsp;a use case of buying gas, or going to buy a bottle of alcohol. It is interesting; people who come from that space,&nbsp;they get decentralized identity, or they&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblock.io/">get self-sovereign identity</a>. It’s&nbsp;more the concept, and not necessarily&nbsp;the implementation, the technology, or the&nbsp;governance, or everything that you could go&nbsp;into. Conceptually, it makes&nbsp;sense. I believe that many people who are advocates for crypto get that right. You gave a presentation earlier this year at the <a href="https://www.btcmiami.com/">North&nbsp;American Bitcoin Conference</a>.&nbsp; I attended&nbsp;that conference in December 2017, which was when the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp">Initial Coin Offerings</a> (ICO) were peaking, and it was crazy.</p>
<p>Jimmy: We were there at the same time, then. It&nbsp;was probably January 2018, the one in Miami.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It was&nbsp;crazy! There were close to 100 presenters at that conference,&nbsp;and half of them were ICO pitches. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Jimmy: That was nuts. We were actually one&nbsp;of the companies presenting, but we&nbsp;weren’t presenting an ICO,&nbsp;and so we stood out in that&nbsp;way. We actually had a booth&nbsp;there as well, and that was the conference&nbsp;where we unveiled&nbsp;our collaboration with the 510 global initiative of the Red Cross, which was done the month before. There were so many ICOs. I was there with Khalid, and I remember the guys next to us. They didn’t really feel&nbsp;right to me; there was something about how&nbsp;they interacted with people that was very&nbsp;defensive. Two months later, they were&nbsp;indicted for&nbsp;securities fraud for 40 million&nbsp;or something.</p>
<p>Mathieu: You can still see&nbsp;some of those classic memes today in crypto: there’s a guy at a party with a Bitcoin&nbsp;Christmas sweater and a guy with an&nbsp;Ethereum&nbsp;sweater, that comes from around that timeframe. It was just pure craziness.</p>
<p>Jimmy:  That was peak madness, because&nbsp;that’s when the market had topped the week before. It was just all-round “Lambo&nbsp;Moon” hype madness.</p>
<p>At the same time, barring those projects, a lot of good things have come out of&nbsp;this as well. What was&nbsp;exciting about that time to me, is&nbsp;that I looked around and saw, “Okay, most of these projects; it’s&nbsp;ridiculous, and they shouldn’t exist.” At the same&nbsp;time, I saw that the underlying technology was still&nbsp;so early, and in a way, it was&nbsp;really shitty; there wasn’t much you could do&nbsp;with it. But to me, this was something that’s super early&nbsp;that’s still going to evolve a lot. You could start to ideate what things might look like in five to ten years.&nbsp;So, in that sense, I’ve tried to remain&nbsp;optimistic but also neutral. I can tell you that a lot of the information is pure hype, and in the short term, that’s going&nbsp;to go very wrong.&nbsp;But then, in the long term, there’s&nbsp;an element of this that’s going to&nbsp;survive, and that element is going to be super&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>It’s the same with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211">Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NFTs) — a huge hype. A lot of it doesn’t make sense, in that it’s&nbsp;non-persistent. Much of this art is&nbsp;hosted on&nbsp;centralized domains, and the tokens&nbsp;themselves just contain pointers to the&nbsp;centralized domain.&nbsp;If that domain goes down, or if some of these marketplace startups&nbsp;shut down&nbsp;in five to ten years, then your art is gone,&nbsp;and your token’s worthless. That doesn’t&nbsp;make any sense to me.&nbsp;There’s an underlying idea that some of this art that’s created is generative and some not, but it’s actually stored on chain, which is a lot more persistent. I find it interesting that some art will be fully persistent. If we think about how much we are interacting on Zoom and other platforms nowadays, it’s not weird to think that in five years, we’ll get into this “metaverse” idea.</p>
<p>Jamie Burke from Outlier Ventures&nbsp;wrote about the “Open Metaverse”&nbsp;and being involved in these virtual&nbsp;worlds. Of course, having scarcity there is a&nbsp;good idea, just like in the real world.&nbsp;Then that idea becomes appealing, but at the same&nbsp;time,&nbsp;a lot of it is now is hype and it&nbsp;shouldn’t really&nbsp;exist. To clarify, I don’t mean it shouldn’t&nbsp;exist at all; of course, it should, but it doesn’t have persistent, lasting value, and will go through the same cycle.</p>
<p>Mathieu: If you’re thinking about the NFTs&nbsp;today, it’s the same thing as the ICOs were,&nbsp;three years ago. The&nbsp;properties behind it are amazing; the&nbsp;ability to be able to tokenize&nbsp;and create liquidity around pretty much&nbsp;any type of unique asset is quite interesting. Forget “just art”: imagine being able to&nbsp;borrow against it, and to lend against it.&nbsp;There are so many cool things you could do&nbsp;with that.&nbsp; When you went back to&nbsp;the virtual conference this year, you pitched self-sovereign&nbsp;identity&nbsp;to the crypto crowd: How did you&nbsp;approach that?</p>
<p>Jimmy: I try to approach it from a&nbsp;neutral point of view. Oftentimes at these&nbsp;conferences, people pitch their own&nbsp;project or at least shill it, and there’s&nbsp;some financial motivation behind it. The organizers have said, “Don’t do that; try to keep it&nbsp;informational and educational.” That’s what I tried to&nbsp;do. In a couple of slides, I talked about some of the&nbsp;stuff Tykn’s been doing, just from a use case perspective. Really trying to keep it straightforward, as&nbsp;an explanation of&nbsp;how this really works from a high&nbsp;level: how credentials flow, and data flows, and what hits the underlying ledger, and what&nbsp;doesn’t. But then, you already saw in the comments, people asking, “Oh, what’s this project? What’s the&nbsp;token?” No token, no ICO.&nbsp;Just a tech company, building tech&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>Mathieu: But, by the way, it could&nbsp;bridge a significant gap between the&nbsp;institutions and crypto, so you want to pay attention.</p>
<p>Jimmy: I wonder when that’s really going to&nbsp;happen. I thought maybe&nbsp;that in this cycle, there would&nbsp;be more of this linkage between&nbsp;the crypto space and SSI space because&nbsp;they’ve separated. I thought maybe some of these <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity-use-cases-in-fintech/">SSI use cases</a> would start to drip into the crypto space, even just for KYC (Know Your Customer).&nbsp;But now, because of more decentralization&nbsp;in the crypto space, with decentralized&nbsp;exchanges and such, you see that, in fact, demand&nbsp;for KYC is becoming less and less — they’re&nbsp;actually moving away from it. For instance, ShapeShift moved to working with decentralized exchanges. Is there really a demand for&nbsp;that now in the crypto space?</p>
<p>I don’t know. Maybe by the time&nbsp;where you have to&nbsp;essentially dox all your wallets, then&nbsp;it might become more interesting. Maybe once it’s necessary to prove that you own certain wallets that becomes interesting, but so far I haven’t really seen that — which is&nbsp;slightly surprising to me. On the other hand, throughout the bear market, blockchain&nbsp;crypto had a&nbsp;bad rep; so, perhaps it’s good that SSI moved itself away from that. In my opinion, that was rational and a good move, because blockchain and that idea of SSI were so strongly connected. There were many misconceptions. There were journalists writing about us,&nbsp;who vaguely understood&nbsp;blockchain and they vaguely understood&nbsp;the premise of SSI. They made assumptions that you could take someone’s identity and put it on a blockchain,&nbsp;and then it can’t be lost anymore, and it’s there forever.</p>
<p>Of course, that isn’t how it works, and that’s not a good message to&nbsp;perpetuate. We got flack&nbsp;from people, saying, “Ah, Tykn’s&nbsp;putting personal information on channels.” No. This is the opposite of what we do. I would be calling&nbsp;these journalists asking, “Oh, could you&nbsp;please amend this in the article?&nbsp;Thank you for writing about us, but could&nbsp;you please correct this?”</p>
<p>Mathieu: But, people get stuck here. I see this often: as soon as the word blockchain enters&nbsp;someone’s mind, they really get stuck on blockchain. It’s&nbsp;not unimportant, but it’s not what you should be focusing on when&nbsp;we’re talking about decentralized&nbsp;identity or self-sovereign identity.</p>
 Digital Identity for At-Risk Populations 
<p>Mathieu: Let’s go back in time to the founding of Tykn: You, Khalid, and there was a third&nbsp;person, I believe.&nbsp;A lot of companies come&nbsp;out of a real -problem. It seemed like this one was a perfect example of a real-world&nbsp;problem; an early&nbsp;contributor to the project,&nbsp;who&nbsp;lost his identity. Would you mind talking through that, and how&nbsp;Tykn came about?</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yes, that was one of the motivations.&nbsp;He struggled through this problem&nbsp;himself; being a refugee and coming&nbsp;to The Netherlands, without having a birth&nbsp;certificate or anything to prove his history. As a refugee in The Netherlands, there are certain processes with many steps that are required. You go through ten, eleven&nbsp;different&nbsp;kinds of interviews, with different&nbsp;institutions. You have this whole&nbsp;sheet of interviews that you go&nbsp;through to establish things such as your&nbsp;age and everything else.&nbsp;He&nbsp;did have a passport, so he could still have something to show, but for most of the requirements, he didn’t. That&nbsp;lack of track record did impede his ability to integrate&nbsp;better, and to&nbsp;get access to certain&nbsp;opportunities along the way. Of course, while he was within these&nbsp;refugee camps, he saw that there were many people&nbsp;who were worse off, who just had&nbsp;nothing to prove about themselves. Perhaps from a place of&nbsp;good-natured naiveté on our side, we thought — okay, we can solve this.</p>
<p>I feel that a lot&nbsp;of companies are born out of the idea of underestimating how big the problem&nbsp;is: “Oh,&nbsp;we can do this!” Of course, the problem is way bigger than one&nbsp;company could&nbsp;strive to solve, but it did put us&nbsp;on that right track. What’s important for me,&nbsp;and what’s always been important, is to&nbsp;at least make some sort of impact on the status&nbsp;quo to make it better than it is. Maybe we can’t retroactively give billions of&nbsp;people an identifying document — you can’t retroactively give&nbsp;someone a birth certificate. But, you can try to help those&nbsp;people to have a higher degree of access&nbsp;to the current systems without&nbsp;needing that document. To me, that has become an important part of the motivation&nbsp;within Tykn. Of course, there are big regulatory, legal, policy&nbsp;implications. When you’re talking about legal&nbsp;documentation, it’s very hard to change. It will happen eventually; at least, I think that it will happen&nbsp;over time, but&nbsp;that’s not something you can change&nbsp;within the timeframe of five years.&nbsp;Over the past four years, we’ve spoken frequently with policy-makers&nbsp;within different governments. We have worked with different&nbsp;governments through giving&nbsp;awareness sessions,&nbsp;and with large institutions within&nbsp;the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) and IFRC (International Federation of Red Cross), with the United Nations, the&nbsp;Dutch government, the Turkish government. We’ve tried to at least&nbsp;create that awareness and create a&nbsp;discussion. On that front&nbsp;already, it’s done quite a bit of good.</p>
<p>What we were talking about,&nbsp;at the time,&nbsp;was really the far end of the scale for&nbsp;them: the idea of&nbsp;self-sovereignty&nbsp;and coming from a very puristic point&nbsp;of privacy&nbsp;and data control. Some of the&nbsp;things that stuck practically, were the&nbsp;ideas of things such as data minimization. There is a looming idea of what they&nbsp;call ‘surveillance humanitarianism.’ It’s growing to be a more important term and&nbsp;idea, as the opposite of&nbsp;‘surveillance capitalism.’ It’s&nbsp;the idea that by digitizing a lot of these&nbsp;humanitarian aid processes, you are also gathering&nbsp;a lot of data about different people who are at risk of being exposed. You can get a lot of insights into these populations, which can be dangerous. You’ve&nbsp;seen it with the Rohingya people; through&nbsp;the best humanitarian efforts, they&nbsp;became&nbsp;a lot easier to identify. I don’t&nbsp;think that was even a tech problem, but just because of the humanitarian&nbsp;intervention, suddenly, these people&nbsp;became very centralized&nbsp;in certain areas, and they had identification cards. Suddenly, they were an easy target&nbsp;for genocide.&nbsp;That’s of course on the worst end of&nbsp;the spectrum, but it’s also&nbsp;not strange to think that&nbsp;a lot of this tech is being tested in&nbsp;the field. I feel that we’re putting privacy concerns on the back&nbsp;burner, coming from an idea of, “Oh, these people&nbsp;don’t have much anyway”; they are&nbsp;almost entirely digitally excluded. So it&nbsp;doesn’t really matter that much&nbsp;if we don’t safeguard their privacy&nbsp;optimally, or if we&nbsp;store all their information in a central&nbsp;database, or collect their biometric&nbsp;information.&nbsp;That scales very poorly,&nbsp;especially when you’re talking about&nbsp;Sub-Saharan Africa which is digitizing&nbsp;at lightning speed. Over the course of twenty years, it becomes quite dangerous. For us, that’s why that sense of control, data minimization, privacy has to be there as a first building block. Seeing that the conversation has started flowing over the past&nbsp;couple of years, that makes me feel&nbsp;good at least, because it’s a&nbsp;conversation that we didn’t see four&nbsp;years ago. We are definitely not the only ones that have been pushing this.</p>
<p>There are a lot of&nbsp;activists in that space that have&nbsp;been&nbsp;contributing to making this impact. I have personally seen that ‘click’ once we’ve&nbsp;explained it, but at least those core&nbsp;principles got stuck somewhere and are identified as something we have to take&nbsp;seriously. So at least the idea of&nbsp;self-sovereign identity can already produce quite a bit of&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>Mathieu:&nbsp; I guess that&nbsp;naive optimism when jumping into anything is probably not a bad thing, because if&nbsp;you knew the complexity&nbsp;underneath, you might have stayed&nbsp;away from it, right?</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yes, I think about that a lot. If I had known&nbsp;what was coming and what was ahead in&nbsp;2017,&nbsp;I’d probably have said, “I’m going to do something else, and just sit on my crypto.” Honestly, I would have been&nbsp;better off if I did that.&nbsp;But I have no regrets at all.&nbsp;We actually talked about that this&nbsp;morning during our stand-up. Of course, in the beginning we had to bootstrap a&nbsp;lot before we started raising&nbsp;funds, and even then, we barely paid ourselves out in terms of salary or anything. I was compensating for that&nbsp;within crypto,&nbsp;and even through the bear market, I sold a lot.&nbsp;I’m thinking now that I could have probably just retired at 25, which I don’t think is a good thing, necessarily.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think you guys are clearly trying to&nbsp;make a social impact here, and it’s&nbsp;quite important. Anything that falls outside of that, it’s nice to think about; maybe, it hurts&nbsp;sometimes to think about&nbsp;the missed opportunities.</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yes. I don’t think about it&nbsp;too much. What we’ve been doing with&nbsp;Tykn&nbsp;is much more fulfilling to me,&nbsp;and I wouldn’t trade it&nbsp;for a second. So, no regrets.</p>
<p>Mathieu: When I think about privacy, I like to break it down into just two pieces:&nbsp;one being&nbsp;control, or having the ability to control what happens. The second piece is all about&nbsp;transparency or traceability. That could happen with centralized&nbsp;systems but it could also happen&nbsp;with decentralized systems, as well.</p>
<p>Going back to the early days of&nbsp;Tykn; you’re looking to empower&nbsp;people&nbsp;to have control, and transparency&nbsp;and to own their identity. Is that the&nbsp;project that you guys did with the Turkish&nbsp;government?&nbsp;Was that along the&nbsp;same lines?</p>
<p>Jimmy: Exactly. We put that press&nbsp;release out a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp;This is a project that we started in 2019,&nbsp;at least in the research and conceptual phase.&nbsp;We&nbsp;took part in this UN/Turkish government-led accelerator for&nbsp;identity companies&nbsp;to tackle some of the aspects of the&nbsp;refugee crisis&nbsp;in Turkey. Turkey has taken in a lot of&nbsp;Syrian refugees,&nbsp;and they want them to integrate into&nbsp;society. Of course, there are several different facets to different&nbsp;problems within that whole sphere. We went to Turkey multiple times; we&nbsp;went from&nbsp;Istanbul to Gaziantep, which is very&nbsp;close to&nbsp;the border. In Gaziantep, out of the 2.5 million people that live&nbsp;there, 500,000 are refugees. Surprisingly few&nbsp;are still in refugee camps; they’ve put in a lot of effort to&nbsp;be able to integrate them into society.</p>
<p>We went there with a bunch of&nbsp;assumptions, and again, with a certain degree of naiveté. They have this temporary protection&nbsp;card. We know it’s hard for them to move across different geographical areas and to do certain&nbsp;things because they need to get this&nbsp;card updated, and sometimes, they don’t have the&nbsp;mobility.&nbsp;We knew that smartphone&nbsp;penetration&nbsp;was very high amongst the refugee&nbsp;population; a lot higher than people&nbsp;assume. It’s about 94-95 percent, and a lot of&nbsp;families have multiple devices: iPhone,&nbsp;iPad, they love Apple products.&nbsp;We thought, “Okay, we’ll just digitize&nbsp;this temporary protection card and&nbsp;that’s a job done. They can receive the&nbsp;money on their phone, and&nbsp;they can update it remotely, etc. etc.”</p>
<p>However, we got to&nbsp;talk to the refugees on the ground floor, and the people around that; with people from government to local&nbsp;NGOs to&nbsp;United Nations (we try to&nbsp;talk with everyone).&nbsp;Then, we saw that this didn’t&nbsp;even come close to being&nbsp;the actual most pressing issue. They thought the card&nbsp;was annoying, because it’s a piece of&nbsp;plastic that’s just a bit too big to put&nbsp;in your pocket.&nbsp;Further, they said, “that’s annoying, but I don’t really care&nbsp;about that; I have bigger things to&nbsp;worry about. I can’t get a job on paper; my eight-year-old&nbsp;daughter&nbsp;is working full-time in a textile&nbsp;factory&nbsp;for 30 euros a month,” and so on. Those were very&nbsp;heavy and shocking conversations, as they always are. I had a conversation with a&nbsp;colleague about this: the difference between knowing, and&nbsp;understanding. You can know a&nbsp;lot of these facts, and read them from reports and articles, and see them on&nbsp;the news. Understanding: we probably never&nbsp;will, because&nbsp;we’ve never had to go through those experiences. At the least, we can approximate understanding once you have those&nbsp;conversations face-to-face, and when&nbsp;you sit at the table&nbsp;with people and they tell you their&nbsp;eight-year-old daughter is working almost full-time in a textile&nbsp;factory.</p>
<p>We started to look at, and think&nbsp;about this. We saw that one&nbsp;of the pain points was that&nbsp;there’s a work permit application&nbsp;process that employers need to go&nbsp;through in order to employ a refugee.&nbsp;This process is a&nbsp;bit cumbersome; quite long, usually. What often happens,&nbsp;is that the employer passes this&nbsp;process onto an accountant. You have to pay an initial fee for this&nbsp;work permit,&nbsp;and then you have to pay a recurring fee,&nbsp;and then&nbsp;the accountant also charges markup. The way that the accountant does this&nbsp;application process, is that the employer basically gives their&nbsp;information from their&nbsp;portal. Essentially, they give government identity portal&nbsp;login information to the&nbsp;accountant, who also has a lot of other data. The accountant charges a surplus&nbsp;on top of it.</p>
<p>This is not very legal, but what&nbsp;we saw happening&nbsp;often, is that the costs of this work permit were being&nbsp;passed on to the refugee. We started working it&nbsp;out, and we’ve found that&nbsp;for a refugee, oftentimes they end up&nbsp;with less money&nbsp;if they actually work on paper.&nbsp;Of course, that’s a huge&nbsp;disincentive to work, when you can still get your emergency social credit every month,&nbsp;and work under the table and&nbsp;get paid more,&nbsp;because you need to sustain your family. So, we thought maybe&nbsp;we shouldn’t work with the refugees directly, but maybe we should focus on this part&nbsp;with the employers.&nbsp;If we make this work permit application process easier for them to&nbsp;do,&nbsp;then it would give more incentive to&nbsp;hire refugees, and they&nbsp;would be the primary social benefactor.&nbsp;The UN really liked that idea, and the Turkish government really&nbsp;liked that idea.</p>
<p>We started working that out with our product Ana,&nbsp;and we ran a pilot on that in Istanbul, with the Istanbul chamber&nbsp;of commerce, INGEV (a local NGO),&nbsp;and the Ministry of Labour. Essentially, we made&nbsp;it super easy for an employer to receive a certificate of business ownership, and&nbsp;then use that&nbsp;with a statement from an accountant, to&nbsp;be able to apply&nbsp;for a work permit within the application. The pilot was received very&nbsp;well, and it’s now escalated to&nbsp;the top of the presidency office, where we’re now talking about how we can&nbsp;move this forward within their digital&nbsp;transformation&nbsp;framework.</p>
<p>Turkey is very advanced in terms of&nbsp;its digital infrastructure. For some reason, that is not on a lot of&nbsp;people’s radar. For example, Tubitak, which is the research arm of the Turkish government:&nbsp;they’ve been working on indie&nbsp;wallets&nbsp;and sovereign desk networks since 2018.</p>
<p>Many other governments are not thinking about it even now, and they were already looking at that three years ago. So, in that sense, they are very advanced. That’s why it’s been such a pleasure to work with them, because they already know everything. I remember meeting their chief researcher at a UN function somewhere in Ankara, and I was talking to someone else. I was talking <a href="https://northernblock.io/resources/glossary/">about self-sovereign identity</a>, and trying to obscure the terminology a bit to make it easier to understand, like “explain it like I’m five.” This guy came over and said, “Hey, are you talking about self-sovereign identity? Are you talking about Sovrin? Because then we need to talk.” I said, “Yes, absolutely,” which was a really nice moment.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It’s nice when&nbsp;you can skip that education&nbsp;part; when people are already&nbsp;sold on the concepts. Now, we could focus on what the economics are, and what&nbsp;the business case is.</p>
<p>It seems that going on the ground there really helped&nbsp;you guys understand the dynamics&nbsp;within that ecosystem; to figure out&nbsp;how the economics work. That’s&nbsp;the crucial piece to figure out, if&nbsp;you’re going to make anything work. There’s another key piece too. I know you guys put a lot of focus&nbsp;on UX and design&nbsp;as a company. There are many&nbsp;conversations happening&nbsp;around design in the SSI space. Even just around wallets:&nbsp;more specifically, how do you&nbsp;internationalize wallets?&nbsp;It’s more than just having a switch&nbsp;that you flip the language;&nbsp;people use things differently in&nbsp;different countries. I’m sure that was noticeable as well in Turkey, or with Syrian refugees, around how they use technology. Even looking at intricacies within the apps; how can you make it a better experience, get more&nbsp;engagement, and get more usage?</p>
<p>Would you mind&nbsp;speaking about the&nbsp;importance that you guys place on that,&nbsp;and then&nbsp;how it’s resulted in Ana? I know&nbsp;we’ve talked before, about cloud&nbsp;products and browser products. How&nbsp;does that all tie together for&nbsp;you guys?</p>
<p>Jimmy: It’s a shame Khalid isn’t here, because&nbsp;he’s the chief UX-er. There are some huge things&nbsp;that we’ve seen there, which&nbsp;were very valuable in terms of&nbsp;learning. Like a lot of other <a href="https://northernblock.io/about/">SSI companies</a>, we went being a bunch of geeks working on the whiteboard, to actually having to&nbsp;speak with people and understand, “If we built this, could you use it?” Oftentimes, in the&nbsp;beginning, the answer was “no.” Then, you find out that across population&nbsp;groups, there are a lot of user experience assumptions that we make&nbsp;nowadays. Many things are very intuitive and natural for us now, because&nbsp;the digital products that we’ve been&nbsp;using for the past&nbsp;ten years have certain&nbsp;interactions that&nbsp;are just completely logical to us: filling out a form, scrolling, having it go back using a button. All those things seem very&nbsp;natural to us, but&nbsp;it isn’t inherently&nbsp;natural for a lot of other population&nbsp;groups. When you actually go to test&nbsp;those designs, you see people get stuck.&nbsp;One thing we saw within the Syrian refugee population was that they are a lot more tech-savvy. As I said, a lot of them have iPads; they have iPhones. Syria was&nbsp;generally a technologically advanced&nbsp;society, so they understand those interactions a lot&nbsp;more and there isn’t as much of a gap.</p>
<p>However, with&nbsp;some of the design work with the Red Cross, we did see people for whom it&nbsp;wasn’t ‘intuitive’ when having to scroll&nbsp;and fill out certain forms. You have to think hard about,&nbsp;“Okay, how can I make this as intuitive as&nbsp;possible,”&nbsp;and that also inspired some of the&nbsp;designs for Ana. This probably won’t&nbsp;come as a big surprise,&nbsp;but a service or product that is used almost ubiquitously across&nbsp;population groups&nbsp;is WhatsApp and Facebook. Even people who didn’t understand any&nbsp;other apps; they understood WhatsApp, they&nbsp;understood&nbsp;texting people, and they understood&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;and Facebook groups. Many other areas are sometimes quite abstract,&nbsp;and didn’t quite ring globally. Some of the interface within Ana, we try to make it seem like it’s a WhatsApp flow: when you go&nbsp;through certain parts of the onboarding, for instance. It was the same with one-to-one, which the&nbsp;Red Cross project ultimately ended up&nbsp;being called: one-to-one,&nbsp;or cash-based aid.</p>
<p>From an SSI perspective, we took a lot of&nbsp;learnings from that, because we came face-to-face with some of the&nbsp;realities of&nbsp;having to go into the field and making it useful for people. We saw pretty early that the puristic view of SSI, in terms of having everything&nbsp;stored on edge wallets — when you go to somewhere in Sub-Saharan&nbsp;Africa, that’s going to be pretty&nbsp;difficult, when there’s maybe one phone in a&nbsp;village&nbsp;and it’s not&nbsp;even necessarily a smartphone.&nbsp;It’s very easy to say,&nbsp;“Oh yeah, but within SSI, everything has to&nbsp;be stored on the edge wallet.” What we saw was&nbsp;that if you make that this hard&nbsp;requirement, and keep working from that, then&nbsp;all these population groups are just&nbsp;going to be left behind&nbsp;more and more.</p>
 SSI for Privacy and Security Concerns 
<p>For those cases, perhaps it makes more sense to&nbsp;take some of those qualities of SSI in&nbsp;terms of having a higher degree of&nbsp;control and being able to guard that,&nbsp;and&nbsp;have these guardianship models where the information isn’t per se stored locally. For instance, that would allow them to use a feature phone, which is what we’ve been working on: being able to accept credentials and verify credentials using a feature phone, which inherently needs some sort of <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">SSI cloud infrastructure</a>. Obviously, the credential isn’t stored on the feature phone, on the edge in that case. That does open up a lot of these interactions and use cases to these population groups. It’s also better than the status quo, which is something we feel strongly about. Perhaps it’s not in the puristic sense of ‘pure SSI,’ but it is much better than the status quo.</p>
<p>As long as you take certain aspects into account, such as: not having that degree of correlation, still having that degree of&nbsp;privacy, operating from a starting point of user control, and&nbsp;data minimization — they still have the portability. From that point of view, it&nbsp;is a lot better than the status&nbsp;quo, and it’s important to be able to&nbsp;see that nuance across different&nbsp;sectors and within SSI. We’ve&nbsp;also seen it from the other side, within enterprises where they didn’t&nbsp;especially want to have something&nbsp;pure SSI, because they wanted to get&nbsp;certain insights. That’s not a popular idea within SSI for good reason, I think, because&nbsp;that’s something we ultimately want to&nbsp;move away from.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That doesn’t apply for business reasons or&nbsp;for regulatory reasons; there’s no reason&nbsp;why data could not be received&nbsp;and stored and used. Going back to what you’re saying, about removing certain correlations, minimizing&nbsp;the data,&nbsp;and ensuring the user control and&nbsp;transparency, and the different privacy&nbsp;properties, and&nbsp;all the other principles we live by. As&nbsp;long as that’s built into the&nbsp;architecture of what you’re doing; if you want to do&nbsp;business with a bank or with an employer&nbsp;and they need&nbsp;certain information — it’s up to you,&nbsp;to&nbsp;opt into it.</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yes. Opt-in, and be able&nbsp;to opt-out, as well. That’s&nbsp;important to me, within SSI as well as complying with GDPR. It’s good that&nbsp;we can request our data back, and request it to be forgotten.&nbsp;I don’t know about you, but I don’t&nbsp;have a list anywhere&nbsp;of companies who have my data, or that I’ve&nbsp;interacted with. So, even being able to have that, and&nbsp;having a ‘nuke’ button&nbsp;that says, “Okay, opt out of all&nbsp;of these,” that would already be pretty&nbsp;great.</p>
<p>At a minimum, becau se of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylWKrg3FjBE">principles of SSI</a>, I think that things like that will become a lot easier within the next five years or so. Ultimately, perhaps it’ll even become a requirement.</p>
<p>Mathieu: On the consumer side, I like what you said about taking&nbsp;messaging into consideration, inside of the user experience. Messaging is the killer application of mobile&nbsp;technology; there’s nothing more used&nbsp;than that. So, I love&nbsp;that this makes sense to&nbsp;literally everyone in the world. If you could try to incorporate a bit of these digital credentials within a messaging experience,&nbsp;it’s very intuitive. It makes sense, and&nbsp;doesn’t force someone to learn&nbsp;something new or get used to using&nbsp;something new, it’s just&nbsp;easy.</p>
<p>Jimmy: That’s something we need to&nbsp;build on. We’ve all become&nbsp;very excited about SSI because of its potentially&nbsp;disruptive properties.&nbsp;You start&nbsp;ideating about what society would&nbsp;look like, in a perfect utopia where this is the norm. You have the people who go a step further, and they’re suggesting, “Oh, maybe we don’t even need&nbsp;governments anymore, because we could&nbsp;just attest to our own existence.” But, at the end of the day, if you build something that’s so&nbsp;completely different, the regular person will just&nbsp;not understand how to even use it, or&nbsp;why I would want that.</p>
<p>A lot of&nbsp;people say, “Oh, but I trust my&nbsp;government,” or “Oh, but I trust my bank, why would I want&nbsp;to step away?” We still see it&nbsp;in crypto: it’s “Oh, I don’t feel comfortable with that. I like having everything in my bank,” and that’s super&nbsp;logical. However, I think that working within SSI, it becomes very easy&nbsp;to have your nose to the whiteboard, and forget&nbsp;that there are other people out there&nbsp;who aren’t as intimately familiar with&nbsp;the technology,&nbsp;its propositions, and the ideology around it. Most&nbsp;people simply want things to work more smoothly, and perhaps as a secondary goal, they want to&nbsp;be less at risk.</p>
<p>This is something that we’ve also seen.&nbsp;In a lot of SSI companies, including us in the beginning, much of what&nbsp;we were saying&nbsp;was based around privacy and security.&nbsp;To many people, that&nbsp;isn’t an appealing value&nbsp;proposition.&nbsp;That assumption is baked-in to a lot of products when you use your bank. They assume with all these&nbsp;regulations it’s all good; it’s a bank, it’s&nbsp;secure and private&nbsp;until proven otherwise. For a lot of&nbsp;people, it’s never proven otherwise.&nbsp;Many people don’t get their identity&nbsp;stolen, so they’re sure it will all be fine. That’s the&nbsp;paradox in The Netherlands; they did some&nbsp;research on it, and found that there’s this privacy paradox of people. Everyone’s&nbsp;concerned about their privacy,&nbsp;but no one necessarily takes the proper&nbsp;actions to ensure that degree of privacy&nbsp;and online security, and even things like password management. I still meet people&nbsp;who&nbsp;have no idea that they shouldn’t reuse&nbsp;passwords. These are people my age,&nbsp;and they just have no idea why&nbsp;that would be risky.</p>
<p>That’s something we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;consider as well. When&nbsp;you put this out there,&nbsp;a lot of people simply want things to&nbsp;go more smoothly,&nbsp;and they don’t necessarily have a strong&nbsp;opinion on how that happens. Many&nbsp;people don’t understand why biometrics may be bad, especially if we consider what’s happening in China. It has taken quite a lot of education&nbsp;of the tail risks of implementing&nbsp;something like that;&nbsp;of having all your biometrics&nbsp;in a central database that can be&nbsp;accessed by governments and who knows else. They only see, “Oh, but wouldn’t it be&nbsp;great to walk through the&nbsp;airport, and they scan your face, and you&nbsp;get on the plane.” From a user experience&nbsp;point of view that could be pretty great,&nbsp;but then from a point of view of&nbsp;privacy and security,&nbsp;maybe not.</p>
<p>Mathieu: At our company,&nbsp;we laugh every time we ask a company&nbsp;we’re talking to about their&nbsp;security. “I don’t know, we hash our data,&nbsp;and we do this and&nbsp;it’s quite funny, To&nbsp;your point here, it comes down to the lowest&nbsp;friction and the most utility. I saw numbers the&nbsp;other day: today there are 2.8 billion&nbsp;people who use Facebook products,&nbsp;and they’re awesome to a lot of&nbsp;people. Why would they not want to&nbsp;use them, when there’s so much utility to it?</p>
<p>Jimmy: That’s also a point. It’s really hard to get away&nbsp;from that&nbsp;grip now. Even if I think&nbsp;about it myself; I still have a Facebook&nbsp;profile,&nbsp;just because my grandparents have a Facebook profile. Especially now, because my&nbsp;grandfather’s&nbsp;pretty sick and it’s magic; it’s the only way for him to see me,&nbsp;and my sister in the UK,&nbsp;and my parents in Spain. We can all&nbsp;see him at the same time&nbsp;while he’s in bed. To him, it’s magical.&nbsp;For me, that’s huge, so it does bring a lot of good&nbsp;things to people’s lives. But then, most people don’t&nbsp;understand the potential risks of having that&nbsp;power within Facebook. We spoke&nbsp;briefly about things like the Open Metaverse in the future.&nbsp;Facebook is already making a big bet on that with Oculus and all these other devices that you’ll need a&nbsp;Facebook account to use. They’re already extending that&nbsp;control&nbsp;which in the long term is very scary. A lot of people don’t&nbsp;inherently care about that, because they&nbsp;just want to receive that&nbsp;utility, which is logical.</p>
<p>Mathieu:&nbsp;For sure. We’re having these utopian&nbsp;conversations about&nbsp;self-sovereign identity and how&nbsp;everything’s going to be on the edge; everyone’s going to own their keys,&nbsp;everyone’s going to own their&nbsp;credentials.&nbsp;There are similar conversations if we jump back on&nbsp;the crypto side; we want to&nbsp;have the right principles baked in.</p>
<p>Over the past&nbsp;decade, the rise of cloud, mobility, and connectivity have&nbsp;created&nbsp;so much usability and so much utility. It’s lowered friction for so many&nbsp;things that you have to use these products. Again,&nbsp;to your point earlier about still interacting with banks: banks are custodians of your money,&nbsp;your fiat money.&nbsp;There are several issues with banks, but they do provide very valuable&nbsp;services. The same thing should be true&nbsp;when we talk about identity and&nbsp;credentials. It’s crazy to think that people are&nbsp;going to store their credentials&nbsp;on an edge wallet, similar to the way the&nbsp;maximalists&nbsp;store their crypto on an edge wallet. That’s such a small&nbsp;percentage of the population, and&nbsp;it doesn’t work well. So,&nbsp;how do you bake the correct principles that we’re&nbsp;advocating, into existing models and augment them? We’re not jumping from 20 percent to 100 percent, but we’re jumping from 20 to&nbsp;25; we have some goals to get to 30,&nbsp;and to keep improving that. I love what you guys are doing and&nbsp;how you guys are thinking about that, with your product suite and&nbsp;your vision for the future.</p>
<p>Jimmy: We’re totally aligned on that. I think ultimately, as you said, it’s a very puristic view that’s&nbsp;come from the crypto space, where it’s&nbsp;natural. You have&nbsp;to manage your own keys, unless you want to keep it on&nbsp;a centralized exchange— which historically&nbsp;hasn’t gone very well. Then, you have&nbsp;these hardware wallets and&nbsp;where you store it, which is essentially on the&nbsp;edge, or at least your keys. If that’s for a regular&nbsp;user, that’s not going to fly, it’s not going to&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>I have many friends and&nbsp;family who&nbsp;are now diving head-first in crypto — of course, because things are at&nbsp;all-time high. I even have to persuade them to&nbsp;spend 80 euros on&nbsp;a hardware wallet, so that it’s not on&nbsp;an exchange and&nbsp;they’re not at risk of huge loss. When you have something like that,&nbsp;but storing it in something like MetaMask, they already find that&nbsp;more comfortable. Ideally, you would&nbsp;use MetaMask with&nbsp;a hardware wallet. That way, you could have it&nbsp;in your browser, but you can still sign&nbsp;it with your hardware wallet, that is, your&nbsp;physical wallet.</p>
<p>I think for identity, something will&nbsp;need to happen where I can at least sign it with my phone,&nbsp;perhaps. Most of the applications&nbsp;are just browser-based, even&nbsp;for different use cases. We talked about this last time, in&nbsp;terms of different stakes and levels of&nbsp;assurance needed. For certain use cases you wouldn’t even&nbsp;need to sign it off. I would love it if&nbsp;a “one-password solution” were able to&nbsp;integrate verifiable credentials. I would simply use my&nbsp;one password, and be able to&nbsp;access all these services. In a way, you could say that approach defeats the point of decentralization, but&nbsp;for a lot of use cases that makes a lot&nbsp;more sense.&nbsp;There’s so&nbsp;much nuance in this, because it’s such&nbsp;a new space.</p>
<p>I think we’ve&nbsp;only seen the tip of the iceberg of the change that this technology&nbsp;will provoke. Take the example of your diploma: we use our diploma&nbsp;to get access to certain job opportunities. You use the presentation of your diploma to provide that you’ve put in the work. But, what we mostly use it for, is signalling; we put that information on our&nbsp;LinkedIn profile. It’s the same with our job history. I might use an employment&nbsp;statement to&nbsp;get a mortgage or something, but&nbsp;mostly, it’s on my LinkedIn profile for&nbsp;signalling.&nbsp;That is data that I want to be&nbsp;public information, and what most of us&nbsp;want to be public information.&nbsp;So, we should have an&nbsp;option to make certain credentials public. I should&nbsp;have the power for myself, to turn that&nbsp;off and make it private again. I should have the option to&nbsp;not disclose that to anyone at all, but&nbsp;then I also should have the option to&nbsp;make that public.&nbsp;A lot of those things, it’s&nbsp;still relatively new&nbsp;and we’re only just thinking about this.</p>
<p>It’s the&nbsp;same with peer-to-peer credentials. I started&nbsp;thinking about that, when my girlfriend was from Canada. She said that in Canada (and you probably know&nbsp;more about this than I do) if you want to&nbsp;get a new passport,&nbsp;you need to get a bunch of people from&nbsp;your circles to attest that you exist.&nbsp;You need to get five people to say, “Oh yes, I know&nbsp;Mathieu. He’s my brother, or he’s my&nbsp;colleague, or he’s my friend, or he’s my&nbsp;neighbour.”&nbsp;Of course, for some applications, p2p credentials would be quite interesting. There are&nbsp;so many other uses that we haven’t even&nbsp;thought of yet. So, yes, I think within that&nbsp;nuance, we’re going to see a lot of billion-dollar companies&nbsp;spinning up within these little corners. This is what excites me about SSI, because it’s still so new. It’s so young and so early, relative to what it&nbsp;will look like ten years from now.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes, I totally agree with you. I would&nbsp;love to have a further conversation&nbsp;with you; there’s a bunch of other stuff we could&nbsp;talk about. I think&nbsp;the whole concept of <a href="https://northernblock.io/verifiable-credentials-for-fintech/">using verifiable&nbsp;credentials</a> for signalling is quite a funny one, if you look&nbsp;ahead. I love that idea. Thinking about&nbsp;the peer-to-peer credential: you start&nbsp;talking about the value of relationships,&nbsp;and how that could start building&nbsp;up. I think we could go on for a long&nbsp;time on these subjects, but Jimmy, I want to thank you so much for doing&nbsp;this with me today.</p>
<p>Jimmy: It was&nbsp;a pleasure, it was really nice.&nbsp;Maybe we do need to have a part two, someday. Let’s plan for that.</p>

You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-152-how-economists-corrupted-the-internet-d4ea0861475f">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI: <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-is-hipaa-compliant-1e8cdf915ab6">GlobaliD is HIPAA compliant</a></p><p>This week:</p>  Digital wallets will gut traditional banks  The U.S. isn’t behind in digital payments&nbsp;anymore  Visa lets you settle in&nbsp;crypto  This week in tech&nbsp;policy  The rise of the Sovereign Writer  Thinky longreads on Likes and&nbsp;music  Stuff happens  What’s in your digital wallet? Photo: NeONBRAND 1. Digital wallets will ‘gut’ traditional banks <p>(According to Cathie Wood, who manages the largest actively managed ETF in the world. H/T <a href="https://gritcapital.substack.com/p/fintech-is-eating-the-world">Grit&nbsp;Capital</a>)</p><p>Here’s a crazy stat <a href="http://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> pointed out last&nbsp;night:</p><blockquote>Market cap of top 4 U.S. banks =&gt; $1.1&nbsp;trillion</blockquote><blockquote>Market cap of top 4 cryptocurrencies =&gt; $1.2&nbsp;trillion</blockquote><p>Pretty wild.</p><p>Remember when Marc Andreessen claimed that software would eat the world? Well, apparently fintech is eating the world now (<a href="https://gritcapital.substack.com/p/fintech-is-eating-the-world">according to Genevieve Roch-Decter in her latest newsletter</a> — also via <a href="http://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>).</p><p>Some key&nbsp;charts:</p><p>Because the future won’t be about&nbsp;banks.</p><p>It’ll be about digital&nbsp;wallets:</p><blockquote>A DIGITAL WALLET is a service that allows you to pay for things, usually through a mobile phone app connected to a credit card, debit card or even a bank account. It stores a number of other items, such as a driver’s license, gift/loyalty cards, tickets for entertainment events, and transportation passes. It can also contain private keys for cryptocurrencies and some even let you hold&nbsp;stocks.</blockquote><p>Would be cool to keep my COVID creds and NFTs there,&nbsp;too.</p><p>Welcome to GlobaliD (powered by&nbsp;Uphold).</p> 2. Remember when the U.S. used to be way behind in digital payments? <p>That’s no longer the case, <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/25/america-used-to-be-behind-on-digital-payments-not-any-more">according to The Economist</a>:</p><blockquote>It has been a while coming. In 2018 Ant Financial, China’s payments giant, raised private funds at a valuation of $150bn. It was common then to hear Chinese executives say that America, land of the posted cheque and the hand-signed credit-card receipt, was years behind, held back by a cosy club of banks and credit-card firms.</blockquote><blockquote>Now investors have decided the moment has come. Take PayPal, a digital-payments firm set up in 1999 to allow users of Palm Pilots, a forebear of smartphones, to “beam” each other money. It was later bought by eBay, an online marketplace, which spun it out in 2015 for $45bn. Today it is worth $275bn, more than Citigroup or Wells Fargo. It is also more valuable than Ant, which has fallen out of favour with regulators in China and has been forced to cancel its initial public offering.</blockquote><blockquote>Enthusiasm for digital-payments companies has been whetted by the pandemic. The share price of PayPal has jumped 186% in the past 12 months while shares in Square, an American rival, have more than quintupled and those of Adyen, based in Amsterdam, have nearly tripled. The digital boom is luring credit-card colossi and tech titans, such as Visa and Google, to online payments.</blockquote> 3. Speaking of Visa, they let you settle in crypto&nbsp;now <p>“This is huge.” — <a href="http://global.id/pstav">/pstav</a></p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/visa-uses-anchorage-to-settle-usdc-transaction-on-ethereum-in-further-crypto-push">The news</a>:</p><blockquote>Visa has processed a cryptocurrency payment directly on the Ethereum blockchain as part of a new service the payment giant plans to introduce to its partners later this&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>The move, the latest sign of increased adoption of digital currencies by the old-guard financial industry, bumped the price of bitcoin (BTC, +2.57%) and ether (ETH, +6.05%) roughly 5%&nbsp;each.</blockquote><blockquote>Per a press release shared with CoinDesk, Crypto.com sent a USDC (-0.06%) stablecoin transaction on Ethereum to an account at Anchorage custody under Visa’s name. Crypto.com issues “crypto-backed” Visa cards that allow its users to spend the coins in their Crypto.com wallet.</blockquote><blockquote>United States dollar coin, or USDC, is a stablecoin pegged 1-to-1 with the dollar. It is the second-largest stablecoin with an $11 billion capitalization.</blockquote><p>“Yep.” — <a href="http://global.id/shadi">/shadi</a></p><p>All the other fintech&nbsp;stuff:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/germany-central-bank-tests-blockchain-solution-counter-cbdc">Germany’s Central Bank Tests Blockchain Solution to Counter CBDCs — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/covid-fraud-costs-americans-382-million-dollars.html">Covid-related fraud has cost Americans $382&nbsp;million</a>  <a href="https://hackernoon.com/fintech-how-covid-affected-payments-and-the-underbanked-7q2233xm">Fintech: How COVID Affected Payments and the Underbanked | Hacker&nbsp;Noon</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/federal-reserve-s-digital-dollar-momentum-worries-wall-street?sref=daDAhXzz">Federal Reserve’s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall&nbsp;Street</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/25/america-used-to-be-behind-on-digital-payments-not-any-more">America used to be behind on digital payments. Not any&nbsp;more</a>   4. This week in tech&nbsp;policy: <p>On <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-00b41ffa-8aac-4433-ac3f-efc4ea32ecc6.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">new tech&nbsp;laws</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: Democrats, empowered in Congress and enraged by misinformation over vaccines and the election, agree it’s time to legislate on tech policy, including updating the key law that shields them from liability from user-generated content. The path to passing a bill is a little clearer, and there have been signs that the largest tech platforms are ready to embrace some&nbsp;changes.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: Pallone said he wants to take aim at online platforms’ financial incentives to amplify misinformation and extreme&nbsp;content.</blockquote><blockquote>“The more outrageous and extremist the content is, the more engagement and clicks they get, and therefore the more advertising dollars they get,” Pallone told Axios. “If nothing else, I’d like to create a disincentive for these companies to amplify this content that leads to violence.”</blockquote><blockquote>In an op-ed ahead of the hearing, Facebook disputed the notion the company has a financial interest “in turning a blind eye to misinformation,” saying, “We have every motivation to keep misinformation off of our apps and we’ve taken many steps to do so at the expense of user growth and engagement.”</blockquote><p>On <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-950953c7-ec6d-4280-86a7-8b5206cde00f.html">last week’s&nbsp;hearing</a>:</p><blockquote>Lawmakers at Thursday’s hearing on misinformation were less interested in getting answers from the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google than in warning the social media giants that a legislative hammer is about to land on them, Kim, Ashley and Margaret&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: In a gruelingly long session conducted entirely by video conference, members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee told the CEOs their businesses prioritize ad revenue and engagement over rooting out misinformation and content that harms users, especially children.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: The relatively consistent lines of questioning, sometimes crossing party lines, displayed a new unity among members of Congress in their concern about the companies — and a stronger likelihood that they might pass punitive&nbsp;laws.</blockquote> 5. The rise of the Sovereign Writer <p>Here’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/">a cool Stratechery piece</a>, highlighted by <a href="http://global.id/anej">/anej</a>, who&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>Ben Thompson made a good piece on so-called sovereign writers that thrive off of Substack and he makes a good point with “the problem with the social networks is that they want to own the reader, but the entire point of the sovereign writer is that they own their audience. “</blockquote><blockquote>With the feed and publishing capabilities and addition of wallet we can easily compete in that space as well. Email per se is still just a&nbsp;channel.</blockquote><p>And <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/">here’s Ben on The Sovereign Writer</a>:</p><blockquote>I am by no means an impartial observer here; obviously I believe in the viability of the sovereign writer. I would also like to believe that Stratechery is an example of how this model can make for a better world: I went the independent publishing route because I had no other choice (believe me, I&nbsp;tried).</blockquote><blockquote>At the same time, I suspect we have only begun to appreciate how destructive this new reality will be for many media organizations. Sovereign writers, particularly those focused on analysis and opinion, depend on journalists actually reporting the news. This second unbundling, though, will divert more and more revenue to the former at the expense of the latter. Maybe one day Substack, if it succeeds, might be the steward of a Substack Journalism program that offers a way for opinion writers and analysts to support those that undergird their&nbsp;work.</blockquote><blockquote>What is important to understand, though, is that Substack is not in control of this process. The sovereign writer is another product of the Internet, and Substack will succeed to the extent it serves their interests, and be discarded if it does&nbsp;not.</blockquote> 6. And If you want more thinky&nbsp;stuff: <p>Here’s <a href="https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/the-logic-of-the-like/">a longread about&nbsp;Likes</a>:</p><blockquote>And yet, as new communication technologies expand and come to structure more and more of our interactions, it is hard to avoid feeling there is something lost in living by the Logic of the Like. We reach for terms like “homogeneous,” “simple” or “flat” in order to express some truth about life in a world reduced to vectors of attraction and revulsion. Homogeneous, because of the tendency to steer ourselves toward others who already view the world as we do. Simple, in that complex emotional life is compressed into a single scale with only two sides: like and not like. Flat, because it seems to reduce the depth and texture of&nbsp;life.</blockquote><blockquote>But these terms fail to capture what is perhaps the most potent feature of the Logic of the Like, which is its seeming inescapability. It is similar to Thomas Hobbes’s theory of religion. We create a God whose needs and desires in turn come to control us. And the Logic of the Like is a jealous God. It admits nothing outside of itself, even its own negation. For example, suppose you decided to reject homogeny and seek out difference, contingency and surprise. A noble pursuit, perhaps, but easily assimilable: “I think we should expose ourselves to difference” is exactly what someone like you would say. It is a self-organizing system but also a self-enclosing one.</blockquote><p>And another one <a href="https://prospect.org/power/islands-in-the-stream-spotify-youtube-music-monopoly/">about the plight of musicians</a> (in a world full of monopolies).</p> 7.

  <p>Gimly is excited to start the EOSIO identity working group WG (Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=eosio_id">#eosio_id</a>)! This open working group (WG) will create and foster identity solutions using <a href="https://eos.io">EOSIO</a> technology, by creating open W3C compliant self-sovereign identity standards, interoperability, and ecosystem development for eosio based identities.</p>
<p>Gimly has been working in the SSI ecosystem for over two years, closely with the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=eosio_id">Decentralised Identity Foundation</a> and <a href="https://sphereon.com">Sphereon</a>, and has been the core development partner of <a href="https://www.gimly.io/europechain">Europechain</a> for the creation and implementation of the <a href="https://www.gimly.io/blog/gimly-europechain-myd-ssi">MyD</a> sovereign identity portal. We are working with the <a href="https://www.gimly.io/blog/gimly-in-essif-ssi-and-nfc-smartcards">European self-sovereign identity Framework lab</a> and <a href="https://ontochain.ngi.eu">Ontochain</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.ngi.eu">European Next Generation Internet</a> initiative, and building an <a href="https://www.gimly.io/blog/gimly-wins-momentum">SSI pilot with KLM/DHL</a> to improve cargo supply chain. </p>
<p>From our experience with Europechain and knowledge of the EOSIO ecosystem, we are excited to bring our experiences and allow EOSIO identity systems to participate in the larger SSI ecosystem. We see this as a pivotal technology to allow enterprises and governments to safely and ethically manage identities and data exchange, and an enabling tool for blockchain and non-blockchain applications.</p>

<p>È la visione del Gruppo Tinexta illustrata da Danilo Cattaneo, Amministratore Delegato di InfoCert, durante l’evento del Centro Economia Digitale sulla Sovranità Tecnologica</p>



<p>Roma, 30 marzo 2021 – Tinexta Group, tra gli operatori leader in Italia nelle aree di business Digital Trust, Credit Information &amp; Management e Innovation &amp; Marketing Services, sta partecipando all’evento organizzato dal Centro Economia Digitale per la presentazione di un nuovo position paper sulla Sovranità Tecnologica, alla cui realizzazione ha contribuito con le competenze della propria controllata InfoCert, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione a livello europeo</p>



<p>Di fronte a un <a href="https://www.centroeconomiadigitale.com/sovranitatecnologica/">parterre</a> istituzionale ed imprenditoriale d’altissimo profilo, ad esporre la visione di Tinexta su un tema così strategico è Danilo Cattaneo, Amministratore Delegato di InfoCert: “L’emergenza pandemica ha accelerato il processo di digitalizzazione per cittadini ed aziende e il loro ricorso a soluzioni di Identità digitale, firma elettronica, PEC, conservazione dei documenti. D’altronde, il Digital Trust, cioè la fiducia digitale, sta diventando uno dei fondamenti del funzionamento di tutte le società moderne. Per l’Europa sarà strategico, oserei dire vitale, assicurarsi e mantenere una solida sovranità tecnologica in un ambito così determinante per l’intero sistema economico, politico e sociale. È indispensabile tenere presente che il Digital Trust implica il controllo delle identità digitali e delle firme digitali e, quindi, la gestione di dati sensibili. Per di più, abilita processi molto critici: sottoscrizione di contratti, apertura di conti correnti, accesso a posizioni previdenziali, prescrizioni mediche e molto di più. Di conseguenza, il mantenimento della sovranità tecnologica è irrinunciabile per garantire la protezione dei dati dei cittadini da possibili intrusioni o manipolazioni e assicurare la continuità di servizi fondamentali.”.</p>



<p>Miliardi di transazioni digitali al giorno determinano la trasmissione via web o sul cloud di dati personali e commerciali: la perdita totale o significativa di sovranità si tradurrebbe in minacce per aree delicatissime quali la Difesa, la segretezza industriale, la privacy e la sicurezza dei cittadini. Si pensi, ad esempio, che l’Europa rappresenta solo il 4% delle piattaforme business digitali nel mondo, con il resto dei dati che transita su infrastrutture nelle mani di operatori extra UE.</p>



<p>“È importante mantenere il controllo sulla gestione e la residency dei dati digitali. Così come prevenire i rischi che scelte commerciali di aziende straniere – o addirittura decisioni politiche di Stati esteri – provochino impatti devastanti sulle attività e sulla stabilità di un Paese, ad esempio sospendendo l’erogazione di servizi quali i processi di firma digitale ai propri utenti europei. In questo senso, sarebbe opportuno avere strumenti di governance per quelle aziende ad alta rilevanza strategica per dati trattati o ruolo nella catena del valore. E, non ultimo, è indispensabile che le soluzioni di Digital Trust siano caratterizzate by design da livelli di sicurezza informatica adeguata” ha sottolineato Cattaneo.</p>



<p>Già da anni Tinexta effettua investimenti mirati in Ricerca e Innovazione che le hanno consentito di acquisire lo status di Digital Champion europeo, offrendo al mercato la possibilità di affidarsi a un player continentale allineato alle normative UE in tema di data privacy e digital trust. In questo solco, ha scelto di puntare anche sulla cybersecurity, acquisendo recentemente tre società qualificate del settore con circa 700 persone in organico: l’obiettivo è integrarne esperienze e competenze nel Gruppo e così rafforzare ulteriormente la propria offerta di Digital Trust, peraltro già pienamente conforme ai rigorosi parametri normativi del regolamento europeo eIDAS.</p>



<p>“La volontà di integrare gli aspetti di certificazione fiduciaria e di&nbsp; e sicurezza dei dati &nbsp;rappresentano un &nbsp;passo decisivo in un rapido percorso verso un posizionamento esclusivo e di leadership nella creazione di infrastrutture digitali sicure e con piena validità legale” ha commentato Danilo Cattaneo a margine del suo intervento.</p>



<p>InfoCert SpA</p>



<p>InfoCert, Tinexta Group, è la più grande Certification Authority europea, attiva in oltre venti Paesi. La società eroga servizi di digitalizzazione, eDelivery, Firma Digitale e conservazione digitale dei documenti ed è gestore accreditato AgID dell’identità digitale nell’ambito di SPID (Sistema Pubblico per la gestione dell’Identità Digitale). InfoCert investe in modo significativo nella ricerca e sviluppo e nella qualità: detiene un significativo numero di brevetti mentre le certificazioni di qualità ISO 9001, 27001 e 20000 testimoniano l’impegno ai massimi livelli nell’erogazione dei servizi e nella gestione della sicurezza. Il Sistema di Gestione della Sicurezza delle Informazioni InfoCert è certificato ISO/IEC 27001:2013 per le attività EA:33-35. InfoCert è leader europeo nell’offerta di servizi di Digital Trust pienamente conformi ai requisiti del Regolamento eIDAS (regolamento UE 910/2014) e agli standard ETSI EN 319 401, e punta a crescere sempre di più a livello internazionale anche mediante acquisizioni: detiene il 51% di Camerfirma, una delle principali autorità di certificazione spagnole e il 16,7% di Authada, Identity Provider tedesco all’avanguardia. InfoCert, infine, è proprietaria dell’80% delle azioni di Sixtema SpA, il partner tecnologico del mondo CNA, che fornisce soluzioni tecnologiche e servizi di consulenza a PMI, associazioni di categoria, intermediari finanziari, studi professionali ed enti.</p>

 Providing further clarity on circulating supply during the first month, and supply schedules.  From the Shyft Network&nbsp;Team: <p>Hi everyone, as we begin to distribute and hand over the core protocol to the ecosystem and community, we wanted to quickly put out a high-level breakdown to provide more context, as well as a better high-level view of how we see economic circulation and productive supply across the Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p><p>We also want to notify anyone inspecting the contract’s values moving here and there, that we will be shortly moving assets to Cold&nbsp;Storage.</p><p>The way to look at Shyft Network’s economics is through streams of productivity and how those tranches are formulated, what they are intended to achieve, and what role they play across the macroeconomics as well as micro operational needs of any ecosystem or use&nbsp;case.</p><p>Circulating supply and total supply are often black and white, and the numbers are meant to be a macro snapshot of the entire universe. Within this universe, are a variety of asset tranches that are not meant to be a part of the active circulating supply, but are regulating pools of liquidity that were designed for certain use cases and network-effect-specific outcomes.</p><p>Below is a high-level breakdown that should help our community understand the distinction between Active Circulating Supply, Inactive Supply, and Total Supply, and how self-regulating asset pools play into&nbsp;this.</p> The sum of all liquidity in the&nbsp;universe <p>Let’s start by describing what self-regulating asset pools are. These pools are, primarily, use-case-controlled circulating reserves that become a part of the percentage of circulating supply, but are pre-programmed into smart contracts that have specific use cases and are autonomous applications (pre-built in-system use&nbsp;cases).</p><p>These tranches are designed to regulate and accelerate economic activity as cross-protocol total supply balancers. They are not meant for operational disbursement and are not allocated to participants of the ecosystem, but are liquidity pools that act to autonomously expand, decrease, accelerate or slow down the total usage and supply of the overall ecosystem. These asset pools were designed as mechanisms to help regulate and keep the ecosystem functional, plus incentivizing stability and longevity. Here are some examples of these self-regulating pools (for more information on these tranches, please see our <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-token-distribution-and-economics-d2d9a146504e">Token Economics blog&nbsp;post</a>):</p><p>1. Synthetic Asset Wrap Rewards<br>2. LP Pool &amp; Liquidity Rewards<br>3. Economic Metagame<br>4. Next-Gen&nbsp;DEFI</p><p>What goes into the Active Circulating Supply? The following buckets and tranches are considered active or can be active when deployed (some will remain inactive for a long period of time), and can be counted towards the Active Circulating Supply when deployed on the&nbsp;network.</p> Operational Liquidity. <p>Over the next 7 years, these tranches and allocations are defined and allocated across the distribution schedules for the network’s operational activities. These are asset pools that can become active when they enter circulation. They are meant to provide liquidity to new projects, like <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/is-compliance-the-next-wave-for-defi-a4baf6c0e70c">compliant DeFi</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/shyft-network-to-build-opt-in-compliance-primitives-on-the-oasis-network-393388c51f71">strategic partnerships</a>, marketing activities, and community DAOs that incentivize the growth of our developer community. Here are some specific tranches that work within this&nbsp;bucket:</p><p>Ecosystem Development (Support): To be used on operations, liquidity, partnerships, federation bootstrapping, marketing, foundation &amp; DAO creation.<br>1. Public Distribution<br>2. Shyft Network Treasury<br>3. VASP Initializer</p> Purchaser, Team &amp;&nbsp;Advisors <p>These are the incredible people who have made this global ecosystem possible by supporting it, advising, or directly working on it for the last 4 years, and who are committed to continue working alongside all of you as an open community over the coming&nbsp;years.</p><p>1.

					 One woman’s open-source journey to decentralized identity—with the help of Indicio.tech 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Noha Abuaesh, a Bahrain-based computer scientist, has been exploring decentralized identity for the last year, often with assistance from Indicio.tech’s open-source tools and free communications channels. She took a moment to answer some questions about her work and her journey in the decentralized identity space.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>(The conversation has been edited for length and clarity)</p>
<p>What’s your background and how did you come to be interested in decentralized identity?</p>
<p>I graduated computer engineering in 2007. My graduation project was in robotics. I worked as a technical writer for a while before I completed a master’s in computer science in 2014. My thesis was on embedded systems. Then, I became a dedicated homemaker until late 2018, when I decided to explore my career possibilities.</p>
<p>I felt like one of the seven sleepers, (who slept for about 300 years to avoid persecution; they appear in both the Quran and Christian tradition —ed.) if you know their story. Because in the insane world of computer science, if you snooze for four years—or even less—it can feel like you have been sleeping for centuries! I really didn’t know where to start. Long story short, I took a couple of professional courses, then a nanodegree on blockchain development. I built some projects on Ethereum and Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it wasn’t until last year when I came through a LinkedIn post on self-sovereign identity. I was intrigued. So, I started reading about it, took an edX course on self-sovereign identity and Hyperledger technologies. I was blown away with the potential of this field. I knew I wanted to continue there. I thought, if I am to plan for the next five years of my career, I want to be in this area.</p>
<p>What kind of decentralized identity work are you doing now?</p>
<p>I am now building my first SSI wallet using Hyperledger Indy, experimenting with what can be done with it and exploring its possible use cases. It is command line-based, just a proof-of-concept kind of a thing. I can work on the interface later (or maybe never). There are many cool general-purpose SSI wallets out there with pretty cool user interfaces.</p>
<p>What are your goals in exploring decentralized identity?</p>
<p>Anyone who learns about decentralized technology knows the enormous potential it has in many different applications. Decentralized identity will touch the lives of billions of people in the future. It promises to be the magic wand to a lot of the problems many people are living with now. Who doesn’t want to be part of that? I am looking to be a field expert in this area, inshallah. I am really hoping I can do something with it for the good of humanity.</p>
<p>What Indicio resources have you used in your explorations?</p>
<p>I used Indicio’s TestNet. They have a strong support system. They also have documentation with very clear steps for what to do and what to expect when you run your software development kit. I couldn’t find that anywhere else. I made use of that and other articles as well. At some point, I left a note on their website, not really expecting anything. I was surprised to find their response in my mailbox a couple of days later. They offered a FREE 30-minute session to answer my questions!</p>
<p>What have been your challenges or obstacles to overcome?</p>
<p>Installing the Indy SDK on Windows was challenging for me. Either because it is the very first thing I faced when I decided to work on this, or because it really is a cumbersome process. Nevertheless, I got that working at the end, thank God.</p>
<p>The community is relatively small. At first, my questions didn’t seem to get any attention when I posted them in the public help group. When you compare that with other developer communities that, sometimes, answer your questions within an hour or two, well — it was disappointing. It is really tough when you are new to something and you don’t know where to go for assistance. However, Indicio’s engineering team, I have to say, are doing a great job serving the community in this area.</p>
<p>Another challenge I faced was outdated documentation. It took me some time to get some of the information together. Also, some features are not very well-documented. At times, I had to refer to Jira threads to know what is going on. I am so glad they are keeping these public!</p>
<p>What’s next for you as the field continues to accelerate?</p>
<p>Well, to be honest, I really am not sure what my next step will be. But I am certain that the future holds good things both for me, and for decentralized identity.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *</p>
<p>Ready to begin your decentralized identity journey? Look no further than the Indicio<a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/"> TestNet</a>, which provides an independent and reliable decentralized network for the exchange of verifiable credentials. Beyond the technology, Indicio also can provide concierge-level support and<a href="https://indicio.tech/training-packages/"> training</a> to make your journey a successful one.</p>

<p>Martedì 30 marzo, Danilo Cattaneo – InfoCert CEO – interverrà all’evento virtuale dal titolo “La sfida della Sovranità Tecnologica: una strategia per l’Italia e l’Europa”, organizzato dal Centro Economia Digitale. A partire dalle ore 11:00 si susseguiranno interventi di alto profilo con importanti ospiti istituzionali, operatori leader in Italia nelle aree di business Digital Trust, Credit Information &amp; Management e Innovation &amp; Marketing Services e rappresentanti delle maggiori realtà imprenditoriali italiane. Danilo Cattaneo parlerà dell’importanza della sovranità tecnologica e della sicurezza associata al Digital Trust.</p>



 “La sovranità tecnologica e la sicurezza del Digital Trust sono fattori sempre più strategici per l’Europa” 



<p>Di fronte a un parterre istituzionale ed imprenditoriale d’altissimo profilo, Danilo Cattaneo, Amministratore Delegato di InfoCert (Tinexta Group) esporrà la visione di Tinexta su un tema così strategico quale la Sovranità Tecnologica, sarà un intervento che parlerà delle evoluzioni che cittadini e imprese hanno dovuto affrontare in maniera ancora più repentina a causa della situazione pandemica, dell’importanza del ruolo delle istituzioni nel creare un ambiente di scambio normato e sicuro e delle prospettive future..</p>



<p>Miliardi di transazioni digitali al giorno determinano la trasmissione via web o sul cloud di dati personali e commerciali. La perdita totale o significativa di sovranità si tradurrebbe in minacce per aree delicatissime quali la Difesa, la segretezza industriale, la privacy e la sicurezza dei cittadini. Si pensi, ad esempio, che l’Europa rappresenta solo il 4% delle piattaforme business digitali nel mondo.</p>



 Martedì 30 marzo 2021, dalle ore 11:0 0 – <a href="https://www.centroeconomiadigitale.com/sovranitatecnologica/">evento su libera iscrizione</a> 



<p>Durante l’evento di presentazione del Position Paper su “La sfida della Sovranità Tecnologica: elementi per una strategia italiana ed europea”, con istituzioni, mondo economico e accademico, verrà posto l’accento sulla definizione, gli obiettivi, le tecnologie critiche e le linee di policy per le nuove competizioni globali.</p>



<p>Intervengono:</p>



  Giancarlo Giorgetti, Ministro dello Sviluppo Economico  Vittorio Colao, Ministro per l’Innovazione Tecnologica e la Transizione Digitale  Enzo Amendola, Sottosegretario agli Affari Europei  Antonio Parenti, Capo Rappresentanza in Italia della Commissione Europe  



<p>E i protagonisti dell’Italia che innova:</p>

 Introduction <p>With their recent <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1376143875312607235">appearance on SNL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> have definitively crashed into the mainstream. This is great news for helping creators get paid! And for driving blockchain adoption.</p><p>However the label “NFT” holds a frustrating but solvable problem. Let’s start with nerd favorite #43 — UFOs.</p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/22/us-government-ufo-report-sightings">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/22/us-government-ufo-report-sightings</a><p>Just as there are ‘difficult to explain’ UFO sightings, NFTs also have ‘difficult to explain’ fungibility sitings. For example, is RAC’s tape token “NFT”? Unisocks? What about limited editions “NFT”, which appear to be interchangeable? Is ERC1155 “NFT”, given that it supports fungibility?</p><p>This essay explores these questions. It then proposes a modest answer, hoping to alleviate frustration among nerds (myself included) and open the door to less-explored opportunities.</p> The “fungible” in “non-fungible” <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAC_(musician)">RAC</a> is a Grammy-winning musician operating in the realm of NFTs. In early 2020, he released <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/64760/ethereum-tokenized-cassette-dj-rac-zora-grammy">$TAPE</a>&nbsp;. There are 100 TAPE tokens. You can redeem 1.0 of them for exactly one physical cassette tape of RAC’s “BOY” album. 1 TAPE is currently trading at <a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape">$4200</a>, easily the most expensive cassette tape&nbsp;ever.</p><p>“NFT”, right? Well, you can substitute 1 TAPE for any other TAPE token; they are mutually interchangeable. This is the very <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fungible">definition</a> of fungible (not non-fungible). Hmm. Furthermore, TAPE are implemented in ERC20 — the standard for fungible tokens (not non-fungible). And you can even interchange a fraction of TAPE too. “NFT”?&nbsp;🤔</p><a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape">1.0 TAPE for 1 “BOY” cassette tape by RAC [Image from&nbsp;zora.co]</a><p>Let’s consider <a href="https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1126506339075641344">Unisocks</a>, ticker $SOCKS. There are 500 SOCKS tokens. You can redeem 1.0 of them for exactly 1 pair of physical socks. 1 SOCKS is currently trading at <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/unisocks">$86K</a>, having peaked at $164K. You could trade a pair of socks <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais/status/1360446856392810497">for a Tesla</a>! <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais">Mike Demarais</a> is a self-proclaimed <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais/status/1220875073252401153">SOCKS shill</a>&nbsp;🧦.</p><p>Here’s how I like to think about Unisocks. In 19th and early 20th century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faberg%C3%A9_egg">Fabergé egg</a> sculptures were the precious art pieces sought after by Russian royalty, with only 69 made. Given crypto’s bias to hilarity and memeability, Unisocks emerged as 21st-century precious art pieces sought after by the crypto community. Unisocks are the Fabergé eggs of&nbsp;crypto.</p>Unisocks are the Fabergé egg of&nbsp;crypto.<p>“NFT”, right? Well, SOCKS are implemented in ERC20, the standard for fungible tokens (not non-fungible). 🤔</p><p>Let’s contemplate “NFT limited editions”. Consider the <a href="https://nbatopshot.com/listings/p2p/c561f66b-5bd8-451c-8686-156073c3fb69+f2a3c763-f7ff-4342-a209-44a34cdf1d02">“Damian Lillard Dunk” NBA Top Shot NFT</a>. There are 6 editions. There may be unique serial numbers but those numbers matter so little that they’re not even reported on the GUI. You can swap one of these NFTs for another; they are mutually interchangeable. Oops, that means fungible.</p><p>Consider ERC1155 token standard. If you mint one token, it’s non-fungible, since there’s just one. But mint a second token, and now you have fungibility, oops.</p> Towards a&nbsp;Solution <p>So are TAPE and SOCKS “NFT” or not? [0] And what do we do with “NFT limited editions” or ERC1155? It appears to be a contradiction.</p><p>There’s a way, inspired by the history of the label “blockchain”. In 2014–2015 as “blockchain” started to get traction, many argued whether some particular system was a “blockchain”. The Bitcoin maximalists would say “only Bitcoin is a blockchain”. Others had more permissive definitions like “it’s a chain of blocks” (where block N stores the hash of block N-1) or “it’s a replicated database with no leader” (using a consensus protocol like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04098.pdf">BFT, PoW, or PoS</a>)&nbsp;[1].</p><p>These arguments were never resolved per se. Rather, they simply faded as “blockchain” got treated more <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/blockchain-as-a-field-47c9f4589418">like a field</a>. The definition went meta! There was no huge push, it just happened.</p><p>So now, we have two meanings for “blockchain”:</p>  The technical definition for the database-like artifact that includes a chain of blocks, replicated, etc.  The field or movement that’s applying the technology.  <p>Understanding that (2) exists softens the debate, and in fact is highly empowering because it opens the door for new ideas around&nbsp;(1).</p><p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a>” is similar. There used to be huge battles among the tech nerds — myself included — about whether something was “AI”. But the AI field got strong, and now pragmatically “AI” means two things [2]: the technical definition (with much debate!) and the&nbsp;field.</p> A Modest&nbsp;Solution <p>“Blockchain” and “AI” both emerged with technical definition(s), and a field definition. We can do the same thing for “NFT”! We can have the technical definition, and the field. The latter is a subfield of blockchain. Upon examination, we actually find two subfields: one covering the creative part, and one covering non-fungible items. Let’s put it all together:</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1369750239649882118">@trentmc0</a></p></blockquote><p>Let’s review each in more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>NFT Definition 1: Technical standard for unique-snowflake</p><p>A unique-snowflake token standard is a standard simply for tokens that can’t be swapped interchangeably with each other. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/">ERC721</a> <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">is</a> the most famous example. It’s not restricted to Ethereum; standards on Bitcoin or any other blockchain fit as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Note that I purposely do not use the phrase “non-fungible” here, because that’s what’s causing confusion!</p><p>It also includes <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155">ERC1155</a>, at least for tokens that are unique snowflakes.</p><p>NFT Definition 2: Blockchain subfield for creative&nbsp;work</p><p>This includes all the work in blockchain on digital art, physical art, photographs, music, etc — generally speaking, anything involving creative work that outputs intellectual property&nbsp;(IP).</p><p>This means it may use “unique snowflake” standards, but critically, it doesn’t need to. It can also use ERC20, or whatever it&nbsp;wants.</p><p>This resolves our core problems:</p>  $TAPE (music) fits within this definition of&nbsp;“NFT”.  $SOCKS (physical art)&nbsp;fits.  “Limited edition NFTs”&nbsp;fit.  And ERC1155 for &gt;1 minted token fits&nbsp;too.  <p>NFT Definition 3: Blockchain subfield using unique-snowflake standards</p><p>This third definition covers blockchain applications that use ERC721 etc. that aren’t in the “creative” realm, such as real estate or financial supply chains (e.g. Centrifuge). It also covers applications that use ERC721 etc that are creative, which means partial overlap with (2), and that’s&nbsp;ok!</p><p>The following image illustrates.</p>“NFT” means 3 things. Here’s how the definitions relate to each other in terms of token standards (top), and fields (bottom). Conclusion <p>This essay started with a frustrating problem: the ‘difficult to explain’ fungibility sightings in NFTs, in everything from SOCKS to “limited-edition” NFTs. It then proposed a modest solution: simply acknowledging that “NFT” is not only a technical standard, but also a field. (And in fact two fields.) The framing melts the frustration away, at least for&nbsp;me;)</p><p>Finally, stay tuned for more NFT&nbsp;fun…</p> Notes <p>[0] FWIW I think RAC is awesome and SOCKS are hilarious.</p><p>[1] See “Ways to Frame Blockchain” in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nature-2-0-27bdf8238071">“Nature 2.0” post</a> for many pragmatic definitions</p><p>[2] See “Ways to Frame AI” in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nature-2-0-27bdf8238071">“Nature 2.0” post</a> for many pragmatic definitions</p><p>Thanks to Wilkins Chung for pointing out the need for NFT meaning (3), to complement the other two meanings.

 T-REX Factory Enhancements 
<p>T-REX Factory is a process management tool, which we rolled out last year, and is specifically designed to support multi-issuers (or agents supporting them) to issue T-REX Tokens in a very automated way and, possibly, a very repetitive way.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in March 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>As you might already know, T-REX Factory is a process management tool, which we rolled out last year, and is specifically designed to support multi-issuers (or agents supporting them) to issue <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX Tokens</a> in a very automated way and, possibly, a very repetitive way. It allows issuers (or their agent), literally in a few clicks, to provide basic information related to a token, upload a list of investors that have been white-listed by the issuer for that token, as well as the tokens positions to be allocated to them.</p>
<p>T-REX Factory then automatically deploys the whole suite of related smart contracts on the blockchain, creates a digital identity (“ONCHAINID”) for the investors who don’t have one, and finally allocates the tokens they are entitled to receive. It can be used at the end of the subscription period into a newly issued digital security or to replicate (“mirror”) on the blockchain the register of an already existing financial instrument.</p>
<p>We have recently enhanced T-REX Factory with a few additional features:</p>

		 
	 
         Set compliance rules for the security token  <p>While the T-REX Protocol takes care of enforcing basic compliance rules of a security token, the compliance smart contract allows more complex or more general compliance rules to be added. The compliance smart contract of the token can now be configured online very simply by the issuer whenever they define the general parameters of the token. At this stage the issuer can define the eligible countries for the token as well as periodic limits in terms of tokens transfers. Other or more complex compliance rules will still need the Tokeny team to design an ad-hoc compliance smart contract as before, but additional compliance rules will be added to the T-REX Factory interface in the coming week in order to minimize those interventions;</p>
                 Email Notification  <p>At each stage of the T-REX Factory issuance process (token deployment, investors whitelisting and tokens allocation), the issuer will be notified by email and receive all details of the step executed;</p>
                 Automatic transfer the ownership of the smart contract  <p>At the end of the T-REX smart contract deployment process, the T-REX Factory now automatically transfers the ownership of the token smart contract to the issuer’s wallet (this was a manual process so far).</p>
        
	 
		 
			<p>With these various improvements, T-REX Factory further facilitates the life of multi-issuers and makes it even easier to industrialize the issuance process of security tokens on the blockchain.</p>

<p>Thursday, 25 March, 2021<br>Gibraltar<br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>In a big step forward for the P2P web, Holo Limited was granted a US patent for the rrDHT networking innovations within Holochain. rrDHT is a peer-to-peer networking design implemented in Holochain that describes a system of nodes communicating according to a relaxed, agent-centric distributed hash&nbsp;table.</p><p>Holo is owned in full by the Holochain Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in Gibraltar, and formal transfer of this patent to the foundation will be completed this&nbsp;month.</p><p>You can read more about the patent (number 10,951,697) in the original documentation: <a href="https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10951697">United States Patent and Trademark Office&nbsp;website.</a></p> So why file a&nbsp;patent? <p>Holochain in an open-source project — so why would we spend the time and money to file for a patent? The reality is that projects can be stopped in their tracks while using their own innovations if others are granted patents for the technology. In other words, this is a defensive patent. It is our intention to use this innovation and share it openly within the context of the Holochain open-source framework.</p><p>This patent is a critical component of the open source license used for Holochain. The Cryptographic Autonomy Licence (CAL) was approved by the OSS in 2019 and it makes Holochain widely available to not only developers, but it also protects end-user data rights. Licenses are only powerful as they relate to the intellectual property laws they are based on. The CAL’s protections for Holochain and users of distributed apps built with Holochain are fully enforceable and this patent enables that enforcement both through copyright and also through patent&nbsp;law.</p><p>Van Lindberg, the IP attorney involved in writing the CAL and the patent application shares&nbsp;this:</p><blockquote>“Patents protect how innovations can be used. In our case this patent is intended to protect the Holochain open-source project from trolls who could file patents on our technical innovation and then use them to prevent us from implementing it. The patent is also a critical component of the Cryptographic Autonomy License. Licenses are only powerful as they relate to the IP laws they are based on. Having this patent ensures the CAL is fully enforceable — which means it will protect the rights of end users to have sovereignty over their&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.taylorenglish.com/people-van-lindberg-intellectual-property-copyright-open-source-and-government-policy-and-practice-attorney.html">- Van Lindberg, Taylor&nbsp;English</a></p> What is the technology innovation of the patent, for a layperson? <p>In simple terms this patent represents an easy way to represent complex distributed data models, and manage them with high resilience. While it is possible to design computing systems that don’t use state, many problems — particularly those that are designed to reflect human interactions and the physical world — are easier to model when the computing system has state. The patent focuses on the methods for saving, storing and retrieving data in a multi-node computing system where no single node has a comprehensive index of nodes or content managed by those&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>As you can see in the diagram below, rrDHT gets efficient sharding and storage redundancy by many nodes with overlapping ranges of data they’re responsible for. We get fast lookups by being able to jump to known peer addresses across the circle. And we have a simple way of representing who is responsible for holding data. This model turns out to be very efficient for managing a self-healing DHT.</p> The team behind Holochain and the people behind this&nbsp;patent <p>Our team and community is deeply appreciative of the work that Arthur Brock, David Braden and Jamison Day have put into this achievement. They are the authors of the innovation upon which this patent is based. Arthur is the co-founder of Holochain. David Braden is a leader on the Holochain core development team who is instrumental at implementing peer-to-peer networking innovations in the framework. Jamison Day is an architect and team lead who worked deeply with the Holochain team for several years to iterate and improve the&nbsp;designs.</p> About Holo <p>Holo is a distributed cloud hosting network and marketplace that enables peer-to-peer Holochain applications to be used by regular web users. Holo does to app hosting what Airbnb did to hotels; anyone can use a spare computer to become an app host and get paid in HoloFuel for hosting distributed applications. Each host on the Holo network sets their own prices and preferences for the apps they want to host, and each app publisher sets the hosting specifications required for their Holochain application.</p> About Holochain <p>Holochain is an open-source framework and network protocol for developing peer-to-peer scalable and efficient applications. It is fast, secure, and versatile, which makes it perfect for a wide range of everyday apps. Its long list of uses include social apps, team collaboration, Internet of Things, currencies, and much more. Holochain is a peer-to-peer innovation beyond blockchain that can actually deliver on blockchain promises.</p> Licensing and&nbsp;legal <p>Holochain is the only implementation of the rrDHT P2P networking innovation that we are aware of.

<p>This is the fifth in a series of blogs which provide edited extracts of key points made by Mydex CIC in its response to the UK Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">consultation around a new National Data Strategy</a>.</p><p>This blog focuses on the main ingredients needed to unleash the full potential of personal data — in addition to personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Previous blogs focused on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">how to unleash the full potential of personal data</a>, why <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/transforming-the-system-a-roadmap-for-practical-implementation-411e8821ed19">how to achieve these changes at scale</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/misconceptions-that-kill-progress-in-personal-data-4736b1d883c6">common misconceptions that derail progress</a>.</p><p>To catch up on progress on our Macmillan My Data Store Pilot <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>If you’ve read the other blogs in this series you might think everything we’re saying boils down to a single recommendation “provide every citizen with their own personal data&nbsp;store”.</p><p>That’s definitely pivotal. But it’s not the whole story. Empowering citizens with their own personal data stores only works in the context of a broader ecosystem, where other parties contribute other functions.</p> Adding genuine personalised value <p>The most obvious of these is bona fide service providers, who use data to provide valued services. A personal data store is a generic enabler; a piece of infrastructure. Every bona fide service provider is a domain expert in their particular field. That is why they exist. To provide their services they need to access and use the right data, and they need their own systems to do this. Personal data stores do not eliminate or replace existing organisation-centric systems. They add another complementary layer. We explore some of the implications of this&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-data-sharing-really-works-239fd187c8a8">here</a>.</p><p>A second obvious fact is that value isn’t generated by personal data in isolation. Usually, it’s generated the right connections between and combinations of personal and non-personal data. A simple example: information about the weather is utterly impersonal. But a weather service that provides a forecast for where I am right now, and where I intend to travel tomorrow may use personal data to add value: my location and my future&nbsp;plans.</p><p>Many of our problems today are created by providers of such services using the need to connect personal with non-personal data as an excuse to grab personal data that they can monetise for other purposes. Manipulation of the content and presentation of privacy policies and terms and conditions for these ends has to stop. But the personal data-driven connections and combinations are essential to ongoing value creation.</p><p>This is generating the need for two important bit of enabling infrastructure:</p>  ‘smart directories’ that create connections between the individual’s personal data (my particular circumstances, interests, plans etc) and external data about the world out there, so that all possible extraneous noise is filtered out and only the right information is presented. This is the essence of data logistics: exactly the right information flowing to and from the right people at the right&nbsp;times.  ‘smart search’. Currently, search services are driven primarily by search term plus (perhaps) a tiny bit of filtering that a search engine conducts using information it has gathered about you. Usually, this filtering isn’t done to help you find what you want, but to herd you in the direction that is most profitable for the search engine. Smart search is a genuine service to the individual, using information about the individual that the individual is happy to volunteer (and only that information, almost certainly behind a shield of anonymity) to help filter search results so that the individual finds exactly what they are looking for as quickly as possible. Smart search is a big ask that would turn the existing industry on its head. But it is desperately needed, and only made possible by the prior existence of a personal data store infrastructure.   Additional enabling infrastructure <p>For such services to work efficiently and effectively, further enabling infrastructure needs to be developed.</p> Data directories <p>In <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">a ‘MUMU’ world</a>, where there are many users of data using data from many different sources, service providers need to know what data exists and where to find it. For this, we need data directories.</p><p>Personal data directories create their own special design requirements: they need to protect rather than abuse individuals’ data and invade their privacy. They should not hold the data itself, but provide the routing to that data along with information relating to the nature and type of data that is available.</p><p>In the context of public services, in the long term this directory should list all of the personal data held by the Government and where this data is held. It should also specify what level of assurance relates to that data (for example, was it generated for the purposes of an email newsletter or to verify a person’s identity?)</p><p>The directory should be seen as a service to both service providers and citizens, being used to to signpost citizens to where they can obtain the attributes they need to complete applications and other processes where they need to provide or point to&nbsp;data.</p><p>Many technicalities need to be addressed. For example, a data directory might not point the searcher to the original source of the data, but to another place where the data is easier to access. The directory will need to make clear how, and on what basis, the attribute in question remains up to date and valid (e.g. is updating automatic, periodic or occasional?). A Personal Data Store itself could publish its own directory entries, the same approach could apply for any data&nbsp;source.</p> Metadata standards <p>For data’s full potential to be unleashed, it must be reliable and trustworthy. This creates the need for large amounts of ‘metadata’ — data about the data that is being presented and used. For example, a data user may want or need to know how the data was collected, created, protected and verified. At all times, users need to have confidence that the data they are using is correct and verified and not modified since generated, in storage or transit. They also need to know how to link it with other data and if necessary synchronise the times lines of&nbsp;data.</p><p>To avoid the huge costs and complexities created by the need to check these things — or to regenerate data where it is not possible to check these things — we need metadata standards: mechanisms by which ‘data about this data’ flows with the data to establish its trustworthiness and reliability.</p><p>As with data directories, many technicalities need to be addressed. Data points need to be defined unambiguously and precisely targeted to the context of the transactions they are used in. The metadata should be machine readable and avoid concatenation of data rather dealing with specific attributes and composite attribute structures. (For example, machine readable date of birth as opposed to a composite of date of birth, postcode and full address.) There needs to be clear, standardised processes and procedures for accessing attributes. And so&nbsp;on.</p><p>If you are interested, the strategy report Mydex CIC wrote for Scottish Government on its proposed Smart Entitlement’s programme <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Smart-Entitlements-Research-Recommendations-and-Report-for-the-Scottish-Government-FINAL.pdf">examines these technicalities in detail</a>. There is even work being undertaken on this as part of the Identity and Attributes Trust Framework Alpha in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/attributes-in-the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework/understanding-attributes">policy paper understanding attributes</a> which must surely be influenced by and influence the national data strategy.</p> Real as opposed to ‘faux’ strategies <p>Successful strategies do many things. They have a clear idea of what ‘good’ looks like and of how to get there including who needs to do what and how these different parties’ contributions are going to be realised and coordinated. They need a sense of order — identifying those things that need to be put in place first, thereby enabling other things to happen later. They need to be crystal clear about what is not in scope or allowable as well as what&nbsp;is.</p><p>Yet all too often, we are presented with faux ‘strategies’ that are nothing more than pious wish lists of things that would be nice along with some vague descriptions of resulting things that would need to happen. Often they are worded in deliberately vague ways so as to please as many parties and create as much wriggle room as possible. If you want a good example, take a look at the UK Artificial Intelligence Council’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/949539/AI_Council_AI_Roadmap.pdf">‘AI Roadmap’</a>.</p><p>The UK’s citizens need and deserve a genuine personal data strategy, formulated and implemented to achieve genuine, lasting benefits. This blog has outlined some of the ingredients of such a strategy.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/not-just-personal-data-stores-f2070eada6be">Not Just Personal Data Stores</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

A Zero Trust model offers an alternative that secures data while ensuring it is accessible to employees, regardless of where they are working.

ION does not rely on centralized entities, trusted validators, or special protocol tokens – ION answers to no one but you, the community. Because ION is an open, permissionless system, anyone can run an ION node, in fact the more nodes in operation, the stronger the network becomes. Development of ION, and the Sidetree standard ION is based on, takes place in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF).

<p>Bridge Champは、ジェルリダおよびブリッジのプレーヤーでもあるBarak Lieberman氏を中心に、現代的なオンラインでのプレー選択肢、およびオンライン市場が不足しているというブリッジの課題を解決するために発案された。さらにジェルリダ曰く、ブリッジは社交的なゲームであるため、新型コロナウイルスの流行でオンラインでの娯楽享受が一般的になった現在、対面でプレーできる環境の欠如により、そのコミュニティの発展が停滞しているという。</p>

<p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@artnok?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Nicolas Picard</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/web?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p><p>This week we got word that a <a href="https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10951697">patent</a> we submitted to the USPTO was approved. That means that Holochain’s special DHT design — rrDHT — is <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-patent/">covered under intellectual property laws</a>.</p><p>To be honest, when I heard we were filing for a patent, I was surprised and not entirely comfortable with the idea. So let’s get my (and probably your) ethical concerns out of the way first.</p> Why did we file for a software patent? <p>The most pressing reason is troll protection. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll">Patent trolls</a> are organisations that sit on large collections of patents simply so they can collect licensing fees from people who actually build things — and sue the ones who don’t buy a license. This is an unfortunate reality that we must face — because we plan to build a revenue-generating business on Holochain tech, we may become an attractive target for trolls. This patent helps protect us — and every business that builds on Holochain.</p><p>It also helps make the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/cryptographic-autonomy-license/blob/master/README.md">Cryptographic Autonomy License</a> more enforceable. I don’t pretend to understand the legal artistry that went into all this, but I gather that it gives extra legal teeth to anyone attempting to use the CAL to defend end-users’ data sovereignty and access to the Holochain codebase.</p> But isn’t Holochain open source? Isn’t this kinda… closed? <p>The patent isn’t an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patentleft">open patent</a> right now; we still want to figure out appropriate licensing schemes that make sure that it gets used in ways that <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/understanding-the-cryptographic-autonomy-license-172ac920966d">align with our values</a>. But any application developer who has a license to Holochain (which is anyone) gets to enjoy the use of that patent in their software. And it’s being transferred from Holo (the company) to the Holochain foundation this month.</p><p>I’ve got more thoughts about patents, ethics, and living in the current world while trying to create a new world. But I’ll save them for the end of this article. And you can read more about the ‘why’ and the ‘how’, including how to use the patent in your own non-Holochain-based software, in <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-patent/">Holo’s press release</a>.</p><p>Now, on to the ‘what’!</p> rrDHT, a relaxed, agent-centric distributed hash table  Background: what is a DHT? <p>The patent language starts out with some legalese, then breaks into some pretty accessible language before returning to legalese. At the beginning, we learn that...</p><blockquote>While it is possible to design computing systems that don't use state, many problems — particularly those that are designed to reflect human interactions and the physical world — are easier to model when the computing system has state.</blockquote><p>In computing terms, ‘state’ means ‘remembering things’. It’s what turns computers from simple machines to magical ‘do-everything’ machines.</p><p>Consider a weaving loom. It takes in thread and produces cloth. Pretty cool, but pretty simple.</p><p>Now let’s add ‘state’, or ‘memory of where I’ve been and where I’m going’ to the loom. Now it can know that it’s done twelve lines of blue and needs to change to yellow, but only once it gets a third of the way through the thirteenth line. Suddenly, it can create something really special.</p><p>So far, so simple. We know that computers remember stuff. But it gets complicated when you involve more than one computer, because who’s in charge of remembering the state?</p><p>Even though we operate in a networked era, most online tools you use operate in a centralised way — client/server — where a central authority takes care of remembering everything.</p><p>That’s nice and easy, and it works great — until the database shuts down, the company gets bought out or goes out of business, or the system gets co-opted by someone with evil plans.</p><p>This prompts us to set out to find a better way of holding shared memory — one that isn’t vulnerable to disruptions or bad actors. If you got rid of the central database and distributed the data to all the participants, it would certainly help. But now you’ve got a new problem: without any authority to talk to, how do you find the data you’re looking for?</p><p>The distributed hash table (DHT) was created to help solve this problem. A hash table is just a simple index of keys (things you know) that point to values (things you want). It’s a bit like a dictionary: when you want to know the definition of the word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/floccinaucinihilipilification">‘floccinaucinihilipilification’</a>, you take its name (the key) and search through the book until you find it. On the same line you’ll see the definition (the value associated with the key).</p><p>A distributed hash table just spreads responsibility for the keys and values across a lot of machines — each one stores just a portion of them. This means that, if one machine disappears, only a little bit of data is lost.</p><p>Of course, now if you want to retrieve a piece of data, you have to figure out who’s got it. You don’t want a central index (remember, that’s risky), so instead you need a way of figuring it out on your own. Here’s how it works.</p><p>We’ve already seen that every piece of data in a hash table has a key. In a distributed hash table, every machine has a key too.</p><p>In order to find the machine that has the data you want, you compare the data’s key against the keys of all the machines you know about, using a “nearness” algorithm, and then ask the closest match for the data at that key. If they don’t have it, it’s likely that they know another nearby machine that does.</p><p>Storing data works the same way: you calculate the key for the data you want to store, compare it against the machine keys, and ask the computers whose addresses are nearest the key of the data to store it for you.</p><p>Different DHTs use different ways of calculating nearness, and might implement different ways of recovering from failures such as a machine going offline.</p> How rrDHT makes things fast and robust <p>rrDHT starts out with a pretty simple nearness algorithm — keys are just 32-bit numbers, and the machine whose number is closest to the data’s number is the best match. This makes lookups very fast to calculate.</p><p>We also want to make a Holochain app’s DHT as resilient as possible. Machines come and go, especially when they’re just users’ laptops and phones, and that means that your ‘best match’ for a data key might disappear for weeks at a time. So we want the participants in a DHT to collaborate to make sure each piece of data is stored by more than one responsible party.</p><p>So each peer — which in Holochain is both an end-user and a storage machine — has a range of the key space that it considers its ‘neighbourhood’. (You can think of the keys as addresses.)</p><p>From your place in the DHT, your neighbourhood stretches out to your left and right. Here, you know everybody by name and have a good idea what’s happening in their lives. You take responsibility for storing a copy of all data whose keys fall within it, to the best of your ability. You also know the transport addresses of all peers whose keys fall within it. (A transport address is the address in the underlying networking layer — an IP address, for example. It lets you do the actual communication.) You gossip over the fence regularly, sharing data with each other. If you go offline, your neighbours have your back, because their neighbourhoods overlap with yours and they can ‘heal’ the gap you left behind.</p><p>The size of your neighbourhood depends on your capacity and the resilience of your neighbourhood. If you find your device storage is filling up too quickly, rrDHT might choose to shrink your neighbourhood and drop responsibility for some data. And if you notice the coverage just outside your neighbourhood seems a bit weak, rrDHT might enlarge your neighbourhood and help improve resilience there.</p><p>Outside of this neighbourhood, you might have a couple connections with reliable peers spread across other regions of the DHT. (The patent suggests between five and ten.)</p> Neighbourhood lookups in action <p>Here’s how data storage and retrieval works in rrDHT. Instead of using numbers, I’ll make things easier and use the letters of the alphabet.</p><p>Maria and her friends are members of a dictionary DHT that stores words and their definitions. In the picture below, you can see the DHT from her perspective, with her neighbourhood spreading out from her place in the DHT:</p><p>Maria wants to know the meaning of the word ‘nanotechnology’. She calculates its address, which is N. That’s inside her neighbourhood, so she probably already has it in her own storage slice. But if she doesn’t yet, she asks Paulina, whose neighbourhood also covers that address. Paulina returns the definition to her.</p><p>Now she wants to store a definition for the word ‘galangal’. She calculates its address, G. If her neighbourhood were just a bit larger, she’d take responsibility for storing a copy herself and gossiping it to her neighbours. She sees that Henry, however, is really close to it. She sends it to him and, because his neighbourhood covers G, he stores it.</p><p>Finally, she wants to know the meaning of ‘caterwaul’. Its address, C, is also outside of her neighbourhood, and she doesn’t know anybody in her neighbourhood who’s close to it. The closest peer she knows about is Aoki. Aoki will have a better view of that part of the DHT than she does, so she asks him for the data. His neighbourhood doesn’t stretch far enough, though, so he doesn’t have it. But within his neighbourhood is Carol, whose neighbourhood does cover it. He sends Carol’s transport address to Maria, who asks Carol for the data.</p><p>We expect that, with most application DHTs, it’ll only take a few hops to get the data you’re looking for. Even in the worst-case scenario of a DHT with full saturation of the address space (roughly four billion peers who each have a tiny neighbourhood of two addresses in either direction), it’ll only take 22 hops.</p><p>(Note: there’s a second, broader neighbourhood that I didn’t mention. Maria doesn’t store data whose addresses fall in this neighbourhood, but she does keep tabs on who lives there. This helps improve resilience and lookup times.)</p> Why did we build something from scratch? <p>There are a lot of good DHT designs out there, and the nice thing about them is that they already have implementations we could’ve used. In fact, the first iteration of Holochain used <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht">IPFS’ implementation of the Kademlia DHT</a>. And it worked okay for finding data — it was fast and well-supported — but the challenge is that we want Holochain to have self-healing storage where data gets moved to peers with nearby addresses. And it wass very hard to describe that kind of neighbourhoods with Kademlia's nearness algorithm. And Holohchain wasn’t just using neighbourhoods for data storage and retrieval – it was using them for security too.</p><p>To understand that, we need to back up a bit and look at another problem that pops up when you take the authority out of the middle.</p><p>As I mentioned before, if an application wants to work right, it needs an assurance that it’s got a predictable view of the stored data, or state. If you expect X to equal 3 but it actually equals 7, your application might start throwing errors. But when nobody’s in charge of keeping that state consistent, the individual copies can get out of sync and make a mess of things. So you need to figure out who gets to modify that shared memory, and when. That is, how do you prevent two people from modifying the same thing at the same time on their separate machines? (Remember, there’s no central authority anymore — and there’s a new group of bad guys who would love to get involved too.) This problem was identified back in 1983 as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault">Byzantine Generals’ Problem</a>.</p><p>A common strategy is to select a ‘leader’ — the entity who’s allowed to make writes — and make sure that nobody else can write to the data.</p><p>Bitcoin, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">not</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)#Byzantine_Paxos">first</a> to tackle this problem, is certainly a pioneer when it comes to a strategy for leader selection among an unknown number of untrustworthy members. It simplifies the problem by recording everyone’s data writes in a single journal, of which everyone has a copy. Then a lottery is held every 10 minutes to select the next leader. This lottery helps keep everyone honest. But by design it’s expensive to play, in real time and money. This means that those with more money tend to dominate the game. That doesn’t feel very peer-to-peer anymore.</p><p>This is necessary because of Bitcoin’s design choice — that single, shared ledger is pretty attractive to bad actors, so it needs to be well protected. But we don’t think a shared ledger is actually necessary for ensuring data integrity.</p><p>Holochain makes things even simpler by saying, “why don’t we just put everyone in charge of their own write journal?” That’s where a peer-to-peer application runs anyway — on the devices of its users. This solves the leader selection problem; everyone is their own leader!</p><p>That’s fine when you’re just writing data for yourself. But when you start interacting with others, and everyone's in charge of their own data, how do you police bad data? Particularly problematic is the ability to manipulate your own history; you could do all sorts of fun stuff with that. Make negative balances disappear, change your mind about the politician you just voted for, modify things you said in the past without any accountability trail, etc.</p><p>Holochain’s answer is to make everyone accountable to everyone else. And here’s where that neighbourhood model comes in: when a neighbourhood is called on to store a piece of someone else’s public data, they first validate it according to Holochain’s #1 rule (you can’t manipulate your journal) and an application’s particular rules. If they find any suspicious activity, they sound the alarm. This alarm acts like an antibody — it spreads through the network of peers, triggering an immune response in each of them until everyone recognises the bad actor and has taken steps to protect themselves. (This usually looks like putting the bad actor in a block list.)</p><p>The address of each piece of data you produce is based on a cryptographic hash. That makes it effectively random, which means you don’t get to choose which neighbourhoods witness and validate your data. This prevents you from colluding with your evil friends and hiding your crime. You can try, but the person you’re trying to deceive has their own view of the DHT. They’re going to talk to the peers they trust. And when they find out nobody’s seen the data you said you published, your fraud is exposed.</p><p>Not only that, but you cryptographically sign every piece of data you produce. This means that your identity is all over the evidence.</p><p>This randomised peer witnessing, validation, and policing is what distinguishes Holochain’s rrDHT from other DHTs — it’s built for data integrity from the ground up. And that’s what makes Holochain able to perform at the speed of DHTs while offering the safety of blockchain.</p> Op-ed: bridging the old and the new <p>As I mentioned before, I’ve had a bit of a personal struggle accepting the idea of a patent on Holochain technology. I’m a bit of a starry-eyed idealist — I love free software (free-as-in-speech, although free-as-in-beer is also nice), and I love openness and sharing. Software patents feel like they’re part of the old world of enclosure, extraction, and competition.</p><p>But in the past few years of working with Holochain and Holo, I’ve come to appreciate the value of building bridges between the current world and the next. But when I reflect on it, I think that’s what we’ve been trying to do all along — working within the structures of the current world in order to birth the new. It’s unsexy, tedious, and sometimes dirty, but maybe it’s where we need to start.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this. First, if we don’t understand the rules of the game we’re stuck in, we won’t survive long enough to see the new game to maturity (this is why the troll protection). And reality is hard, messy, and inconsistent — we’re all at various stages of growth, various levels of ability to participate in new games according to our means. The current system isn’t going to just roll over and give us free room and board while we build tools for open collaboration and economics.</p><p>We also need to find ways to start unlocking and using the massive power and wealth that the current system is currently holding. We can see them as an asset, rather than a hurdle, and start ‘composting’ them into regenerative systems.</p><p>In the case of the CAL, that means we’re using the weapons of today (intellectual property law) to protect this little embryo of an idea we love so dearly. Besides being a standard open-source license, it imposes an extra restriction on those who create software with Holochain: they’re not allowed to hold your data hostage. It doesn’t mean you get to choose how it’s used (that’s an application-level concern), but it does mean you’ll never be barred from accessing it.</p><p>That feels powerful to me. It goes beyond the scope of open-source licenses to ensure freedom beyond just being able to audit and modify code. We’re embedding an ethical stance about data sovereignty into Holochain’s terms-of-use. This puts the CAL into the (sometimes <a href="https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/ethical-source-hippocratic-license">controversial</a>) territory of ‘<a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/definition/">Ethical Source</a>’. Personally, I’m okay with that. We’ve always been explicit about our intention to support the commons, and sometimes that means asking people to consent to <a href="https://osf.io/hnerp/?view_only=44b5c10772d5470892b701dfe4b2c833">restrictions</a> if they want to play this new game with us. After all, as Dr Elinor Ostrom famously demonstrated, <a href="http://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons">that's what makes the commons work</a>.</p>

Oraichain will publish and monetize data from Oraichain’s AI services such as AI APIs and AI-generated data via the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>.  Oraichain and Ocean will explore further integrations of future products and services within their ecosystems.  <p>Here’s what Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol founder, said about the partnership:</p><blockquote>Ocean Protocol’s engagement with Oraichain promises to be a dynamic addition to our data and AI ecosystems. The presence of Oraichain data on Ocean Market diversifies our offerings while Oraichain can benefit from leveraging our Compute-to-Data feature in their Request Hub. We’re excited to further explore the potential synergies.</blockquote><p>Commenting on the partnership, Dr. Chung Dao, Oraichain CEO,&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>I am confident in the strong impact that the partnership between Oraichain and Ocean Protocol will have in terms of innovation in the AI and Blockchain space. Artificial Intelligence is the core of both companies, and the combined efforts, synergies, and future integration will create plenty of new opportunities.</blockquote><p>Oraichain is developing an AI Marketplace for AI services, featuring an AI Request Hub that will be the platform where companies (AI services &amp; data buyers) will be able to request customized AI solutions, and AI providers (AI services &amp; data sellers) will offer and monetize their solutions.</p><p>The collaboration will fast-track Oraichain’s AI Request Hub to be a solution-driven product providing direct access to Oraichain’s AI services, including AI Oracles — that contain AI APIs — and data for training and testing for those AI models. After the launch of <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/get-ready-for-smart-contracts-20-oraichain-launches-new-ai-powered-blockchain-network-2021-02-24">Oraichain Mainnet</a> (Oraichain’s blockchain network) in February, this new partnership will accelerate the rate of adoption of both organizations’ platforms.</p><p>The Request Hub is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2021 and will utilize Oraichain’s AI Data Hub and Ocean Protocol’s Compute-to-Data technology in order to attract customers and AI solution providers. Oraichain’s Request Hub will run several AI and Machine Learning competitions to call for an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners, which is similar to Kaggle — a subsidiary of Google. Oraichain also intends to fund innovative AI projects via the Request&nbsp;Hub.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This week, The Grocer’s conference on ‘How to build a sustainable brand’ brought together challenger brands, multinationals, NGOs and others to discuss the key issues in FMCG today. Read on for our roundup of the event’s key takeaways.</p>
 1. Brands must avoid ‘tunnel vision’ on sustainability issues 
<p>It’s vital that FMCG brands approach sustainability holistically and avoid championing certain environmental or social issues at the expense of others.</p>
<p>In a discussion on net zero targets, Dan Crossley of the Food Ethics Council reminded attendees that the current momentum around carbon mustn’t slow progress in other areas: “Brands must avoid having tunnel vision on climate alone and make sure that they are thinking about all those other environmental impacts: biodiversity loss, social impact, etc.”</p>
<p>Victoria Sjardin, VP of Marketing at Kraft Heinz, echoed this sentiment in a panel on sustainability communications. “It’s important to land simple messages with consumers but also to be responsible, and understand the framework of how we think about sustainability holistically.” She cautioned against making decisions to reduce impact in one area which might have detrimental effects in other areas, not least because “Gen Z has never been faster or more able to understand the full business intent.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s important to land simple messages with consumers but also to be responsible, and understand the framework of how we think about sustainability holistically.” – Victoria Sjardin, VP of Marketing at Kraft Heinz</p></blockquote>
 2. Customer-friendly frameworks will be key to driving behaviour change 
<p>“There are customers who would do something different if they knew what that was,” argued Susan Thomas, Senior Director of Sustainable Commercial Activities at Asda, in a panel exploring evolving shopper priorities.</p>
<p>Thomas highlighted the industry’s progress on communicating complex nutritional information to customers with <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/check-the-label#:~:text=The%20traffic%20light%20labelling%20system,kilojoules%20in%20that%20particular%20product.">traffic light</a> health labelling. She believes the FMCG industry needs to deliver comparable education on sustainability issues: “From that data information understanding perspective, we’re a long way behind on the planet side of this conversation. Some products have put a carbon footprint on their packaging, but in isolation I don’t really know what to do with that number as a consumer. And of course, carbon footprint is not the only consideration – how are we going to collectively and consistently communicate these complex interlinked issues, so that customers can make important choices? I think that’s going to be a body of work for us as an industry for the next couple of years.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Some products have put a carbon footprint on their packaging, but in isolation I don’t really know what to do with that number as a consumer.” – Susan Thomas, Senior Director of Sustainable Commercial Activities at Asda</p></blockquote>
 3. Don’t underestimate the proof required by regulators 
<p>Katie Vickery, Partner &amp; Head of the International Food Law Team at Osborne Clarke argued that proof was key to minimising risk for sustainability marketers, particularly in light of regulators’ increased focus on FMCG sustainability claims. She described how she’d seen a number of brands “put forward what would seem to be very credible substantiation [to the ASA], and actually that’s been knocked back.” Her advice for brands was not to underestimate the extent of substantiation required: “If you look at the trends that we’re seeing in terms of regulators, you get a sense of actually how far now marketing teams need to go when they’re coming up with their brand names or marketing slogans.”</p>
<p>But Vickery also offered marketers hope, in the shape of new guidance from the CMA, due to be published in summer 2021: “We’re going to get some really specific points around the different types of environmental claims that people can make.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Victoria Sjardin, VP of Marketing at Kraft Heinz, urged a holistic approach to sustainability</p>
 4. ‘No one can fix this alone’ 
<p>Cross-sector collaboration was a key theme throughout the day, and it prompted a fascinating debate on where responsibility lies for encouraging shoppers to make better purchase decisions. Rob Metcalfe, Richmond &amp; Towers, argued that retailers must take the lead: “The majority of brands don’t have sustainability as their raison d’etre. I don’t think brands can do it on their own.” Others stressed the need for a system-wide approach. ASDA’s Susan Thomas suggested that&nbsp; “a partnership between brands and retailers” was key to making sustainable shopping easier for customers. Jenny Costa, Rubies in the Rubble, agreed that brands have a big role to play, alongside retailers and government: “I would say that brands do have a really strong role to play in this. Purpose-driven brands can transform a category.”</p>
<p>In a keynote on net zero targets, Tesco CEO Ken Murphy also raised the importance of collaborating with suppliers, explaining that Tesco’s progress on carbon was only possible thanks to buy-in from its own-label suppliers: “By working to get our own house in order, we’ve learned lessons we can apply to the broader supply chain and we’re sharing our journey with suppliers. No one of us can fix this alone.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Retailers want to list products that have a sustainable message and reflect their values well. It’s really exciting to see that change.” – Jenny Costa, Rubies in the Rubble</p></blockquote>
 5. Sooner or later, sustainable brands will reap the rewards 
<p>According to Jenny Costa, Rubies in the Rubble, both retailers and consumers have doubled down on sustainability issues in the last year: “Retailers want to list products that have a sustainable message and reflect their values well. It’s really exciting to see that change.” As for customers, she spoke of a huge rise in demand from zero waste stores, and explained that customer engagement in influencing business decisions is higher than it’s ever been.</p>
<p>But whilst investment in sustainability will pay off for brands, Ben Greensmith, Tony’s Chocolonely, suggested that this may still take time: “At the moment the companies that do good are at a commercial disadvantage, but I think in a few years time, those that don’t will be at a disadvantage.”</p>

  <p>A customer once asked me: “Hey – Can Okta integrate with Kong?” Spoiler alert: You totally can integrate Kong with Okta using its <a href="https://github.com/nokia/kong-oidc">OpenID Connect</a> plugin.</p>

<p>Still stuck wondering what an API gateway even is? Here’s a metaphor that works for me: You know that sci-fi movie trope in which you have a centralized hub that “jumps” you to other places in the galaxy? In that kind of system all the screening and security happens at the hub. It’s the same with Kong (and other API gateways).</p>

<p>In the case of the OIDC plugin, only Kong speaks directly to Okta using the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1">Authorization Code flow</a>. It then passes the contents of the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeIDToken">ID Token</a> to an internal service using an HTTP header called <code>x-userinfo</code>. Your app just needs to know what to do with this HTTP header. It doesn’t have to do anything with OIDC itself.</p>

<p>This is easier to understand with some diagrams. Here’s what an architecture might look like without an API Gateway:</p>

<p></p>

<p>While you may have a load balancer sitting in front of everything acting as a “traffic cop”, each of your services has to know how to “speak” OIDC.</p>

<p>Here’s another diagram with an API Gateway in the mix:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this case, only the Kong API gateway is interacting with Okta. Kong then passes the <code>x-userinfo</code> header along after the user authenticates. This enables your services to be a lot leaner – no OIDC stack needed.</p>

<p>I created a screencast based on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-kong-origin-example">this working example</a>.</p>

 
  
 

<p>In this demo, I use <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> to create a container for Kong and another for a <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a> app that understands the <code>x-userinfo</code> HTTP header.</p>

<p>The slides used in the screencast <a href="https://github.com/dogeared/centralize-auth-with-kong-and-okta">can be found on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>James Little presented on <a href="https://stork-search.net/">Stork Search</a>. He created it to solve the problem of locally owned, fast, relevant search for mostly static sites.</p><blockquote>Stork is two things. First, it's an indexer: it indexes your loosely-structured content and creates a file that you can upload to your web server. Second, it's a Javascript + WebAssembly frontend for that index file: Stork will hook into an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> on your web page, download the index you've specified, and display the best search results immediately to your user, as they type. The precomputed index and WebAssembly frontend module make the entire Stork engine very good, and very fast.</blockquote><p>It was really inspiring to hear James' story, starting with solving problems for his college newspaper website.</p><p>WebAssembly, ubiquitous CDN-like functionality for static sites, and that full-text search isn't black magic were the three things that happened roughly at the same time. Can a search index be treated like an image (which we know how to cache and deliver quickly), and use WebAssembly to make the experience very fast?</p><p>The answer of course is yes, with Stork!</p>"I can generate a search index out of band, then load it onto a webpage like an image, then use WebAssembly to run the search"<p>And, how the approach to images on the web can be applied to large search indexes:</p><p>Watch the video below for the full presentation.</p> Video <p><a href="https://files.jameslittle.me/talks/stork-slides.pdf">Download a PDF of the slides</a> or <a href="https://jameslittle.me/talks/stork/">visit James' talk page »</a></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jameslittle230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jameslittle230</a> considers Stork super early still. Use it as the obvious choice if you're building a static site.

   The traditional paradigm of investing in protection of known threats alone has been declining over recent years, as attackers become more adaptable and capable. Combine this with increased threats and attacker ingenuity it is small wonder that a CISO’s role has become more complex. This leads to the inevitability of a security incident where the complex environments and inventive attacks collide.

  <p>The traditional paradigm of investing in protection of known threats alone has been declining over recent years, as attackers become more adaptable and capable. Combine this with increased threats and attacker ingenuity it is small wonder that a CISO’s role has become more complex. This leads to the inevitability of a security incident where the complex environments and inventive attacks collide. <br></p>
<p>This presentation looks at three fundamentals:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Why traditional protective approaches are no longer effective enough.</p>
 
 
<p>How complexity has made the CISO’s ability to respond more difficult.</p>
 
 
<p>The importance of automation in the response process to address this paradigm shift CISOs now face</p>

<p>It’s no secret we need a better web. The original vision of an open and decentralized network that’s universally accessible continues to be a north star for those working to design the future of digital infrastructure for everyday people. Despite the progress that has been made in democratising access to massive amounts of information, the dire state of cybersecurity and privacy on the internet today present significant barriers to access for too many of our most vulnerable populations. We started MATTR because we believe that standards, transparency, and openness are not only better for users; they make for stronger systems and more resilient networks. We recognize that a decentralized web of digital trust, based on transparency, consent, and verifiable data, can help us address critical challenges on a global scale. It represents a significant opportunity to give people real agency and control over their digital&nbsp;lives.</p> Our story <p>At its inception, we chose “MATTR” as a moniker because we strongly believed that the movement towards more decentralized systems will fundamentally change the nature of data and privacy on the internet. Matter, in its varying states, forms the building blocks of the universe, symbolically representing the capacity for change and transformation that allows us all to grow and adapt. In another sense, people matter, and the impact of decisions we make as builders of technology extend beyond ourselves. It’s a responsibility we take seriously, as Tim Berners Lee puts it, “to preserve new frontiers for the common good.” We proudly bear the name MATTR and the potential it represents as we’ve built out our little universe of products.</p><p>In September 2020, we <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">introduced</a> our decentralized identity platform. Our goal was to deliver standards-based digital trust to developers in a scalable manner. We designed our platform with a modular security architecture to enable our tools to work across many different contexts. By investing deeply in open standards and open source communities as well as developing insights through collaboration and research, we realized that developers want to use something that’s convenient without compromising on flexibility, choice, or security. That’s why we launched our platform with standards-based cryptography and configurable building blocks to suit a broad array of use cases and user experiences in a way that can evolve as technology matures.</p><p>At the same time, we’ve continued to work in open source and open standards communities with greater commitment than ever to make sure we’re helping to build a digital ecosystem that can support global scale. We launched <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/">MATTR Learn</a> and <a href="https://mattr.global/resources/">MATTR Resources</a> as hubs for those interested in these new technologies, developing educational content to explore concepts around decentralized identity, offering guided developer tutorials and videos, and providing documentation and API references. We also unveiled a <a href="https://mattr.global/">new website</a>, introduced a novel approach to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">selective disclosure of verifiable credentials</a>, built and defined a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">new secure messaging standard</a>, developed a prototype for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXvWxFjHvdY">paper-based credentials</a> to cater for low-tech environments, and made a bridge to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">extend OpenID Connect with verifiable credentials</a>. We’ve consistently released tools and added features to make our products more secure, extensible, and easy to use. In parallel, we also <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2020/10/09/news-release-dhs-st-svip-makes-new-phase-1-awards-five-blockchain-companies">joined the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s SVIP program</a> in October to help advance the goals of decentralized identity and demonstrate provable interoperability with other vendors in a transparent and globally-visible manner. Zooming out a bit, our journey at MATTR is part of a much larger picture of passionate people working in collaborative networks across the world to make this&nbsp;happen.</p> The bigger&nbsp;picture <p>It has been an incredible year for decentralized and self-sovereign identity as a whole. In light of the global-scale disruption of COVID-19, the demand for more secure digital systems became even more critical to our everyday lives. Start-ups, corporations, governments, and standards organizations alike have been heavily investing in building technology and infrastructure to support an increasingly digital world. We’re seeing this innovation happen across the globe, from the work being done by the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">DHS Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/news/development-of-digital-identity-trust-framework-confirmed/">New Zealand Digital Identity Trust Framework</a>. Many global leaders are stepping up to support and invest in more privacy-preserving digital security, and for good reason. Recent legislation like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> have made the role of big tech companies and user data rights increasingly important, providing a clear mandate for a wave of change that promises to strengthen the internet for the public good. This provides an incredible catalyst for all the work happening in areas such as cryptography, decentralized computing and digital governance. Just in the last year, we’ve seen the following advancements:</p>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage WG</a> created at <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> to realize an interoperable technology for encrypted and confidential data&nbsp;storage  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> v1.0 specification reached “Candidate Recommendation” stage at the W3C, establishing stability in anticipation of standardization later this&nbsp;year  <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree protocol</a> v1.0 released at DIF, providing a layer-2 blockchain solution for scalable Decentralized Identifiers built on top of ledgers such as Bitcoin and&nbsp;Ethereum  <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging v2.0</a> specification launched at DIF, a new protocol for secure messaging based on Decentralized Identifiers and built on JOSE encryption standards  <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP) became an official working group item at the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, advancing the conversation around the role of identity providers on the&nbsp;web  Google’s <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID">WebID project</a> started developing features to allow the browser to mediate interactions between end-users and identity providers in a privacy-preserving way  <p>For more information on how all of these technologies are interconnected, read our latest paper, <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/the-state-of-identity-on-the-web-cffc392bc7ea">The State of Identity on the&nbsp;Web</a>.</p><p>In addition, as part of our involvement with the DHS SVIP program, in March of this year we participated in the DHS SVIP Interoperability Plugfest. This event saw 8 different companies, representing both human-centric identity credentials as well as asset-centric supply chain traceability credentials, come together to showcase standards-compliance and genuine cross-vendor and cross-platform interoperability via testing and live demonstrations. The full presentation, including demos and videos from the public showcase day, can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MeeP7vDXb9CpSBfjTybYbo8qJfrrbrXCSJa0DklNe2k/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>These are just a handful of the significant accomplishments achieved over the last year. It’s been incredibly inspiring to see so many people working towards a common set of goals for the betterment of the web. As we’ve built our products and developed alongside the broader market, we’ve learned quite a bit about how to solve some of the core business and technical challenges associated with this new digital infrastructure. We’ve also gained a lot of insight from working directly with governments and companies across the globe to demonstrate interoperability and build bridges across different technology ecosystems.</p> Launching MATTR&nbsp;VII <p>We’ve been hard at work making our decentralized identity platform better than ever, and we’re proud to announce that as of today, we’re ready to support solutions that solve real-world problems for your users, in production — and it’s open to everybody.</p><p>That’s why we’re rebranding our platform to MATTR VII. Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter">seven states of matter</a>, our platform gives builders and developers all the tools they need at their fingertips to create a whole new universe of decentralized products and applications. We provide all the raw technical building blocks to allow you to create exactly what you have in mind. MATTR VII is composable and configurable to fit your needs, whether you’re a well-established business with legacy systems or a start-up looking to build the next best thing in digital privacy. Best of all, MATTR VII is use-case-agnostic, meaning we’ve baked minimal dependencies into our products so you can use them the way that makes the most sense for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Starting today, we’re opening our platform for general availability. Specifically, that means if you’re ready to build a solution to solve a real-world problem for your users, we’re ready to support you. Simply <a href="https://mattr.global/contact/">contact us</a> to get the ball rolling and to have your production environment set up. Of course, if you’re not quite ready for that, you can still test drive the platform by signing up for a <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">free trial</a> of MATTR VII to get started right away. It’s an exciting time in the MATTR universe, and we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>We’re continuing to build-out features to operationalize and support production use cases. To this end, in the near future we will be enhancing the sign-up and onboarding experience as well as providing tools to monitor your usage of the platform. Please <a href="https://mattr.global/contact/">reach out</a> to give us feedback on how we can improve our products to support the solutions you’re building.</p><p>We’re excited to be in this new phase of our journey with MATTR VII.

   ION – We Have Liftoff! 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four years ago, we started a journey to help develop and advance decentralized identity, an emerging form of identity technology that empowers individuals and creates new business capabilities. Our goal is to put individuals, organizations, and other entities at the center of the apps, services, and digital exchanges that increasingly play a pivotal role in our lives. Among all the technical development required to deliver decentralized identity, none is more important than <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DIDs are identifiers that can be used to secure access to resources, sign and verify credentials, and facilitate application data exchange. Unlike traditional usernames and email addresses, DIDs are owned and controlled by the entity itself (be it a person, device, or company), and exist independently of any external organization or trusted intermediary. Without DIDs, you can’t have a vibrant, interoperable decentralized identity and application ecosystem. Early on we recognized the existence of a secure, scalable DID implementation was a prerequisite for the kinds of applications and services we wanted to offer, so in 2019 <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/toward-scalable-decentralized-identifier-systems/ba-p/560168">we set out to build one</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are excited to share that v1 of <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a> is complete and has been launched on Bitcoin mainnet. We have deployed an ION node to our production infrastructure and are working together with other companies and organizations to do so as well. ION does not rely on centralized entities, trusted validators, or special protocol tokens – ION answers to no one but you, the community. Because ION is an open, permissionless system, anyone can run an ION node, in fact the more nodes in operation, the stronger the network becomes. Development of ION, and the Sidetree standard ION is based on, takes place in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF). Read on to learn how you can integrate ION, DIDs, and Verifiable Credentials in your applications and services.<br><br>Learn more about ION here: <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">https://identity.foundation/ion/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Use ION DIDs 
<p>Creating an open, public, permissionless DID implementation that runs at massive scale, to the tune of thousands of operations per second, while maintaining decentralization and security was a long road – now it’s time to drive adoption. To help get DIDs into the hands of users and enable developers to easily integrate ION DIDs in wallets, decentralized apps, and credential-related services, we have contributed an open source library for generating DIDs and have opened up our ION node to provide a no-hassle option for anchoring ION DIDs:<br><br></p>
<p>Generate ION DIDs and keys – the high-level ION.js helper library is the easiest way to start generating ION DIDs as fast as possible: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-tools#ionjs">github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-tools (ION.js library).</a><br><br></p>
<p>An example of generating an ION DID with the ION.js library:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the lower-level SDK –&nbsp;access a larger set of ION-related APIs that provide more granular functionality: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-sdk">github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-sdk (TypeScript/Node)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anchor DIDs you generate – easily anchor your DIDs via our ION node, without having to interact with a cryptocurrency wallet or run an ION node locally: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-tools">github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-tools</a><br><br></p>
<p>[ NOTE: ownership of your DIDs is based on keys you generate locally, and all ION operations are signed with those keys, so even if you use our node for anchoring DID operations (or any other node), you are always in sole control. ]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Run an ION node 
<p>Running an ION node provides the fastest lookup of ION DIDs, the highest level of security when interacting with ION DIDs, and ensures you can always resolve ION DIDs without depending on intermediaries. There are two options for running an ION node:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Run the Dockerized version of ION: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion/tree/master/docker">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion/tree/master/docker</a> (provides an option to connect to an existing Bitcoin node) 
 Install a node natively on your machine: <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/">https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/</a> 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Lookup ION DIDs 
<p>You can resolve ION DIDs to view their keys and routing endpoints using the ION Explorer interface: <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/</a>. This dashboard (which you’ll soon be able to run against your own local ION node) is being built-out with more views and tools as we speak, and will eventually contain interfaces to help operators monitor their local ION nodes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Leverage ION DIDs today 
<p>Here are a few ways you can use ION DIDs right now:<br><br></p>
 
 If you are a business or organization, sign up for the public preview of the Azure AD Verifiable Credential service: <a href="http://aka.ms/vcpreview">http://aka.ms/vcpreview</a> 
 Explore integrating OpenID Connect Self-Issued for DIDs to authenticate with sites, apps, and services that implement the draft specification: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/master/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.md">https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/master/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.md</a> 
 Create a DID for yourself or your company and cryptographically link it to Web domains you control, using the DIF Well-Known DID Configuration specification: <a href="https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/">https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/</a>. 
 Use a DID to issue <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, which are digital proofs that can be used to represent just about any verifiable assertion or asset, such as diplomas, membership cards, event tickets, etc.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 ION’s core protocol has been standardized 
<p>Along with ION reaching v1, so too has the protocol at its core: <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a>. Sidetree is a specification developed alongside many others at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) that enables scalable DID networks (i.e. <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, <a href="https://www.transmute.industries/element/">Element</a>, <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">Orb</a>) to be built atop any decentralized event record system (e.g. blockchains). We would like to thank the following collaborators who have worked on specs, contributed code, or provided feedback during this process:</p>

<p>This work would not have been possible without the contributions of folks like Orie Steele of Transmute and Troy Ronda of SecureKey, who played key roles in shaping the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree">Sidetree specification</a>, our colleagues in Microsoft Research, as well as Dietrich Ayala and the Protocol Labs team, who helped integrate <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> as the P2P file replication protocol used in ION.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open source development and codification of standards is essential to the creation of a vibrant decentralized identity ecosystem. If you are a developer or organization interested in contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree">Sidetree specification</a>, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION’s open source code</a>, or any other work underway in this area, we encourage you to join the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) and its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">Sidetree Development &amp; Operating Group</a>. This group is the primary place where contributors meet to discuss various technical and operational aspects of ION and the general Sidetree protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Beyond v1 
<p>With ION v1 out the door, we will be turning our attention toward optimizing the ION node implementation and adding other important features, such as:<br><br></p>
 
 Deliver a light node configuration, making node operation easier for low-resource devices. 
 Add tooling and support for Ed25519 and BLS12-381 keys 
 Enable optimistic operation ingestion for transactions still in the mempool (reduces time to resolution) 
 Codify an initial set of DID type tags (used in tagging DIDs as IoT devices, software packages, etc.) 
 Enable querying of ION’s decentralized DID directory based on DID type – for example: once organizations and businesses establish DIDs, you will be able to fetch all DIDs typed as&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/Organization">Organization</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness">LocalBusiness</a>, etc., to build a decentralized directory. You will also be able find all DIDs of types like&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/SoftwareSourceCode">SoftwareSourceCode</a>, to create decentralized code package and app registries. (NPM? How about DPM) 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While launching v1 of ION is a significant milestone, we’re still in the early phases of this journey. We have a lot left to do before we can fully realize a better, more trustworthy, more decentralized Web that empowers every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.</p>

<p>A conversation with KILT Protocol’s Founder and CEO Ingo&nbsp;Rübe</p><p>KILT is a blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous, verifiable credentials and decentralised identifiers. Part of the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems.</p><p>But what exactly does that mean? Who better to ask than the creator of KILT himself! Ingo Rübe breaks it down for us in his own&nbsp;words.</p><p>Let’s start with the things that are most associated with KILT. What are decentralised identifiers and credentials?</p><p>Ingo: KILT Protocol is a system for maintaining identities. And here comes the first interesting part: an identity is something different from an identifier.</p><p>If we have an identifier it’s just a name or a number — it doesn’t say anything about an identity. So for example, my name is Ingo. If my identifier is Ingo, that doesn’t say that I’m from Berlin, it doesn’t say that I am working on the KILT Protocol, whether I have a driving licence or not; it doesn’t say anything about me. It doesn’t really contain any information, it’s just an identifier.</p><p>And if there is only one Ingo here and you direct a question to Ingo, I know it’s me you’re talking to. But if there are two Ingos in the room we never know, so it would be good to have those identifiers a little bit&nbsp;unique.</p><p>This is the first part: Identity starts with an identifier, which is what all the other things are linked to. And many of these things in our world are linked to the identifier with credentials. So think of real life; I have a passport from Europe and it basically says “Ingo”. And it also has a picture of me, and other things, but it can be directly linked to me because I am Ingo and the word Ingo is there on the passport. But the passport gives more information about me because, for example, it says I’m European. And this passport is what we call a credential.</p><p>So identity is built by adding more and more credentials to an identifier.</p><p>If you want to build a digital identity you need both an identifier — for people or things — and then you need different types of credentials which are linked to the identifier. Then step by step you produce a digital identity.</p><p>If you want to register with a social media platform, for example, you choose a username and password. And they check to make sure that the username isn’t already taken and that your password has enough numbers or letters or whatever, and if everything is okay this is now your username and your password and you’ve got an identifier.</p><p>And then you go on the platform and you like certain things and maybe write a comment or two. And depending on the platform, you can add photos, or university status, and a passport or whatever, and the identity is growing. And you can link other things to it. These are your credentials. This is your behaviour, and this aggregates there — with the platform, not with&nbsp;you.</p><p>But this can also be done for machines. The identifier of the device could be a very long number for example. This device can be identified by this number because this number is unique to it. And then, step by step you add more and more credentials to it, like an IOT device that is compatible with a certain standard, for example. Then the device gets an identity. And if the identifier is registered on the blockchain it becomes decentralised, because the blockchain doesn’t store information in any one location; it’s spread across a network of computers.</p><p>What are verifiable credentials and why is it important that they are verifiable?</p><p>Ingo: There are several parts to&nbsp;this.</p><p>First, credentials are built on trust. Trust is not generated by the blockchain, trust is something that happens in the real world — that’s how our society has been working for thousands of&nbsp;years.</p><p>KILT takes the old process of top-down trust in the real world and puts it into the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>Anyone can build a credential. You could make your own. You could print your name on a piece of paper and stick your photo on it and write on it that you can drive, but people might not believe it just because you say it and made your own credential!</p><p>It would be better to use one that is already there, that is already trusted, like a driving licence from the government department that deals with them. That would probably have your photo, your name, it would include a vehicle class. You can go to most places in the world and they will look at it and look at your photo and say, ok, I trust it. It looks like a driving licence and he looks like the person in the&nbsp;photo.</p><p>But digitally, when you give your credentials to someone there’s no photo. I can wave a physical credential at you; a digital one I can’t — it’s just&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>So now we need a trusted entity to confirm that those numbers really mean what they say they mean. In KILT we call this the attester. We’ll go into more details on how the attester works another time, and how we know we can trust them, but basically, they confirm, or attest, that the information is true. They do this by digitally signing the digital credential and then sending it to the claimer. They also create a hash of the credential — a number representing the information — and store it on the blockchain. It’s not personal data or the document itself, it’s just a&nbsp;hash.</p><p>The important fact is: the credential is issued by the trusted entity to the user. And the user owns the credential. They can decide when to show it, to whom and for what purpose. The trusted entity is not involved anymore. So, if I receive your credential because you want to hire a car from me, you show me your digital driving licence. I check with the blockchain to see if this hash which comes out of your credential is actually present on the blockchain. If it’s present on the blockchain, it’s fine. You can hire the car and drive away. The driving license department will never find out about you hiring a&nbsp;car.</p><p>That’s why we call it a verifiable credential; it’s a credential that can be verified. Simple!</p><p>But what happens if you drive crazily and the driving department says “Give the licence back, we don’t want you to drive again for the next ten years”? In the real world they would ask you to send your licence back and you don’t have it any more. But in the digital world it’s just numbers. Even if you send it to them and say “Hey, here’s my licence back” you still have a digital copy. So there needs to be a way that the attester can check that everything is still okay and, if it’s not, be able to revoke the credential.</p><p>So that’s why digital credentials need to be revocable?</p><p>Ingo: Exactly! And that’s what we use the blockchain for. The KILT blockchain makes credentials revocable; so if the attester wants to revoke your digital licence they can just put another hash of the credential representing your driving licence on the blockchain to show that it has been&nbsp;revoked.</p><p>Then if you go to hire the car and present your credential, your digital licence, it looks OK at first. But when I check the hash I can see, yes, there was a credential once but this one was revoked. So I don’t let you hire the&nbsp;car.</p><p>And that’s why it’s so important to have an entity that stores the VALIDITY of a credential. But that’s the kind of thing you don’t want a big corporation to have. They might think “Hey, we could just revoke everyone’s credentials until they pay us a lot of money” or whatever. It could be the most dangerous company in the world. This is why the validity of credentials does not belong in the hands of a company. It has to be on neutral ground, revocable for attesters but immutable to anyone else. And that’s the reason we use a permissionless blockchain to record&nbsp;it.</p><p>Interesting! Back to the description of KILT we started with, what do you mean by “self-sovereign”?</p><p>Ingo: Self-sovereign means something very useful. It means that you hold your credentials. In the real world you hold your credentials in your wallet, or in your home. So you have sovereignty over them, basically. But in the digital world you don’t. In our example of signing up to a social media platform with a username and password, you don’t have your credentials — the platform&nbsp;does.</p><p>But with KILT you own your digital credentials. You keep them in your wallet and if someone asks for your credential — your driving licence or whatever — you can send it to them. And this also affects anonymity because when you have sovereignty over your credentials then you can choose what you show to people and how much of it you want to reveal. And a blockchain-based system allows you to do&nbsp;that.</p><p>So the data is anonymous?</p><p>Ingo: what we do is give you control over your data. We don’t store it on the blockchain, it’s stored in your wallet. Only the hash that shows that the credential is valid — or not — is on the blockchain.</p><p>But anonymity is more than that; it’s something that has to be provided in different ways. So, going back to the driving licence example. If you want to go into a bar you might have to prove that you are over 18. In the real world you can choose any of the credentials you have in your wallet to prove that — your driving licence, or identity card, your student card, whatever. And you can show this to the person on the door. They just need to see your picture and your date of birth to prove that you are over 18, but they don’t need to know your name, or anything else about you — you can choose to put your finger over it and you will still be let in. This is what we call selective disclosure and this is also a part of anonymity.</p><p>That sounds like a great development in digital identity! One last question for you today. What exactly is blockchain?</p><p>Ingo: In simple terms, blockchain is a digital, decentralised database, or record of transactions. So when you think about blockchains you have to start with databases basically, and these are something that are even older than credentials.</p><p>Databases are around 4,000 years old. They started with our ancient ancestors — they put symbols into clay and started to record things like how much tax someone owed, and that sort of thing. And this was the first central database. You had this piece of clay with all this information on it and this piece of clay told the truth, in a way. And if you wanted to know how much tax you owed, you could look at this piece of clay. This principle of a central database is the fundament of basically almost everything we have. Our governments wouldn’t work without that, society wouldn’t work without that, banking wouldn’t work without that; this is really a huge success in history, these databases.</p><p>But they have some disadvantages. The first is that if you drop the piece of clay on the floor, then it breaks and it’s gone. Well, modern databases aren’t made out of clay, but they are still very easy to break. You could make a copy, but then there can be errors in copying it. You could have two different types of information and not really know which is the real one. The second thing which is terrible about those databases is that they are controlled by a single person normally, and that single person can be bribed. So they can be connected with corruption. So you have a lot of disadvantages.</p><p>But you have also advantages, because you have a central piece of information, very easy to handle, very easy to administer, the governance of it is totally easy — the king, or civil servant or whoever says you write this down and only you write this down on this piece of clay and everybody can read it and we’re good to go, right? As long as the person isn’t corrupt and doesn’t die. So that’s basically how central databases work.</p><p>And modern central databases are extremely fast, extremely cheap, extremely easy to administer and this is why they are somewhat successful. But like the ancient ones, they have these two little problems — they are very easy to break and very easy to&nbsp;corrupt.</p><p>If you want to build a system to get away from that, a nice and easy solution is blockchain, because this is a system where you don’t have only one copy of the thing. You say basically everyone can be a bookkeeper and everybody has the same book. If something is added to the book then everybody has to add it, which is extremely hard to administer, extremely slow and extremely expensive. But it is completely safe; if one of the books falls down or one of the machines explodes, because you have 999 copies of it, it’s not a problem. And if one or two of the bookkeepers goes corrupt, it’s also not a problem because you have 998 others who are not corrupt. And with every new entry they have to agree that the book they all have is the same version of the book again. And this is the basic idea of blockchain.</p><p>So what can you do with something like that? You use this if you don’t want to trust a single entity or person, because with a database you always have to trust the person running it. I can read it but I have to trust what they actually wrote into it is true. And there might even be an intermediary, and I have to trust what they wrote in there&nbsp;too.</p><p>If you want to get rid of the intermediary you can use the blockchain and have the actual truth in the system, which is defined by a democratic majority of the bookkeepers and mathematical algorithms. And if you say everyone can actually become part of the system and be a bookkeeper as well, then you have the wisdom of the crowd and can say it’s probably actually the mathematical truth. So we change from trust in a person or entity to the mathematical truth. And most people believe the mathematical truth.</p><p>And if there are thousands of computers that have agreed on something like the balance of my account, then I can believe it much easier than believing a single person or institution. Because they might have made a mistake, or been corrupted.</p><p>This is what you use the blockchain for. It doesn’t work for everything — in the past people tried to build many crazy things with it, like closed logistics chains, and that doesn’t make sense. If you only have three partners interacting and they run a blockchain together they actually have to trust each other because they’re running the system together and it’s not open — it would be much easier and cheaper for them to run a database and all have a key to the database. Blockchain only makes sense if you need to work together without constantly making use of a trusted entity. The blockchain replaces the trust in an entity with the mathematical truth.</p><p>There are so many uses for blockchain; I think it’s going to change the internet completely over the next ten&nbsp;years.</p><p>Thanks for the insights&nbsp;Ingo!</p><p>Discover more about KILT Protocol on our <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">website</a> or follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a>.</p>

   New Report: IAM for the Hybrid Enterprise 

<p>Today we published a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-reports/forrester-study-hybrid-cloud-iam">study</a>* conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of ForgeRock and our friends at Google Cloud on the state of identity and access management (IAM) in the cloud. It’s a terrific read, and I encourage you to check it out.</p>

<p>We introduce an emerging concept called “Hybrid IAM,” which we think is the next phase of digital identity. Simply put, Hybrid IAM enables enterprises to run, unify, and secure all digital identities with a single platform in a hybrid IT environment. We recognize that, while many customers prefer cloud-only approaches if feasible, the reality is a comprehensive strategy involves IAM across <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">cloud</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/multi-cloud-devops">on-premises</a>, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/hybrid-iam">hybrid IT</a> environments. This is a big opportunity for organizations to tackle, and as the only IAM platform on the market that can do this, ForgeRock is very well positioned to help.</p>

 
 


 IAM for the Hybrid Enterprise 

<p>The focus of the study is a global survey of more than 300 IT leaders who are involved in IAM decisions and hybrid cloud migration efforts. Here are the key findings:</p>

  More than 80% will have adopted or plan to adopt/expand their cloud-based IAM initiatives over the next two years 
	 Nearly 90% of respondents are held back from embracing IAM in the cloud because of technical challenges: their current solutions lack the required scale, stability, and capabilities 
	 More than 80% believe a hybrid IAM approach would provide great customer and employee experiences 
  The ForgeRock Difference 

<p>We believe helping organizations create secure and frictionless, intuitive digital experiences is the name of the game, and the market continues to move in this direction. Working with Google Cloud, we continue to see enterprises requiring a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/hybrid-iam">hybrid IAM approach</a> to realize success. Again, check out the study, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/contact">let us know how we can help you</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>*<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-reports/forrester-study-hybrid-cloud-iam">Identity and Access Management (IAM) for the Hybrid Enterprise</a> is a commissioned research study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of ForgeRock.</p>

This is a set of specifications that allow credentials to be verified and shared on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Moving on, let’s take a look at how VCs&nbsp;work.</p> A Basic Working&nbsp;Model <p>There are three entities in a verifiable credential ecosystem and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Issuer  Holder  Verifier  <p>The issuer is the entity that is issuing the credential, the holder is the entity about whom the credential is issued, and the verifier is an entity that verifies if the credential meets the established criteria of a&nbsp;VC.</p><p>Let’s talk a bit more about these entities.</p> Issuer <p>An issuer is an entity that is authorized to issue a credential. These issuers are typically government organizations, healthcare centers, banks and financial institutions, schools and universities, and possibly even organizations that provide proof of employment.</p><p>These entities use a combination of methods such as digital signatures and custom schemas to prove that they are competent to issue a credential.</p> Holder <p>A holder is someone who is the owner of the credential and has complete control over how it can be managed, with whom these credentials can be shared, or revoked. Holders are typically individuals or organizations.</p><p>Since the holder is the owner of the credential, the onus is on this entity to create a verifiable presentation, which is the compilation of data sent by one or more issuers in a machine-verifiable format that adheres to the existing standards.</p> Verifier <p>A verifier is an entity that verifies a credential and ensures that it comes from a competent issuer, is tamper-proof, and is still relevant (not expired or revoked). A verifier takes the verifiable presentation from the holder to determine its authenticity.</p> Example <p>Let’s look at an example to better understand these entities and their relationship.</p><p>Say, a healthcare center certifies that a particular individual has taken the COVID-19 vaccination and this information is verified by a machine for its authenticity.</p><p>Here, the issuer is the healthcare provider, the holder is the individual who has vaccinated, and a verifier is a machine that checks the verifiable presentation for its authenticity. Once verified, the holder is free to share it with anyone he/she&nbsp;wishes.</p> Workflow <p>Now that we know the role of the three entities, let’s briefly talk about the workflow.</p>The Trust&nbsp;Triangle<p>The issuer digitally signs a document and sends it to the holder. Next, the holder creates a verifiable presentation in a certain format that conforms to the W3C specifications and sends it to the verifier for verifications.</p><p>Finally, the verifier checks the presentation against the specifications to verify the three aspects — competent authority, validity, and tamper-proof characteristic of the credential. If all three conditions are met, the credentials are deemed verified, and the verifiable presentation is sent back to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>In another possible workflow, the holder can initiate the proceedings. Let’s say, the holder is an individual who wants to travel, but the airline stipulates only individuals who are vaccinated against COVID-19. In this case, the holder requests information from the issuer and sends it to the verifier for verification. Once verified, the holder can send the credentials to the airline&nbsp;company.</p><p>Likewise, the verifier can also initiate a request to get some data from the holder, and in turn, the holder reaches out to the issuer to send&nbsp;it.</p><p>As you can see, trust is the central aspect of VCs, and handling this aspect well is key to the success of any VC-based&nbsp;system.</p><p>Another key aspect is that many entities work towards the common goal of using the existing data collectively. They use commonly-agreed tools and data standards to handle the data on hand, thereby laying the foundation for a common data registry.</p> Use Cases <p>Now that you have an idea of VCs, let’s take a look at some of the areas where they can be implemented.</p>  Visa validity of travelers  Healthcare certificates, especially COVID-19&nbsp;tests  Airline tickets  Secure transfer of government-issued documents like passports and driver’s&nbsp;licenses  Checking credit scores for loan applications  Credentials for opening a bank account or setting up&nbsp;payments  Sharing residency status for appropriate government schemes, and&nbsp;more  <p>This is nowhere an exhaustive list, rather it gives you an idea of what you can do with this young and exciting technology. If you can think of any area where you can implement these verifiable credentials, join <a href="https://affinidipocathon.devpost.com/">Affinidi PoCathon 2021</a> that offers exciting prizes for new ideas and implementations.</p><p>Also, watch this space for more articles related to the triangle of trust in VCs, W3C specifications, use of complex criteria for verifying the identity of the issuer, possible threats to watch out for, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Written by <a href="https://medium.com/u/47e407d1242a">Lavanya&nbsp;Rathnam</a></p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">What are Verifiable Credentials?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>The Molecule Protocol demonstrates a powerful 2021 rendition of the utility and benefits offered in multi-signature technology in the cryptocurrency space. In multi-signature cryptocurrency wallets, the hashed signatures of multiple addresses are required to reach a majority vote in co-signing a transaction or ‘decision’. The Molecule Protocol innovates on that development through new levels of ‘value’ across these aforementioned signing parties, rather, instead via the form of multi-connected tokens. Built upon the infrastructure of 0x’s Bloom Platform, within the Molecule Protocol, different ‘molecules’ (Customized ERC-protocol tokens) facilitate digitized identity verification and capability on the blockchain. The Molecule Protocol is one of the more recent examples of the harnessed power of 0x’s Bloom Platform for progressive self-sovereign identity development.</p><p>Centralized exchanges are custodial and compliant, relying on KYC (Know Your Customer), AML, CFT, etc. while controlling customer funds and incurring high fees despite its multiple restrictions. Contrastingly, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are unrestricted, have no KUYC, AML, etc - you have full control of your funds, and there are significantly smaller fees. The cost of this decentralized nature has been the lack of knowing who you are exchanging with. While the anonymity and speed of certain DEXs are what make them so favorable, it is also unpredictable and difficult to gauge which users are valid and which are risky, creating insecurity and apprehension from global regulators to further evolve the sector. The result has been a rift between the legacy financial sector and the new age of financial technology. Molecule Protocol aims to solve this via a user-friendly infrastructure that handles the transfer of ERC20 and/or ERC721 tokens only if certain constraints are met for both the sender and recipient. In this way, the Molecule Protocol bridges the aforementioned gap between the two exchanges since it retains the autonomy and self-sovereignty that decentralized exchanges present, however adding constraints that centralized exchanges enlist as a means of security. The protocol is considered non-custodial yet compliant.</p><p>For those not familiar with chemistry or blockchain, the system is still user-friendly and little to no knowledge of chemistry or blockchain is required to use it, making it a perfect stepping stone for those who want to learn more about blockchain, crypto, and self-sovereign identity. Each token (ERC721 or ERC20) represents an ‘atom’. A combination of tokens, such as 2 ERC721 tokens and 1 ERC20 token (like a hydrogen atom: H2O), can authorize functions on an entity. Only if an entity contains a KYC token can the transfer be executed. The concept is reminiscent of chemical reactions since the reactants are individual entities until the ‘reaction’, or in this case, ‘authorization’, occurs. Other molecules and subsequent structures can be configured, however the smaller the protocol, the more it can fit into the Molecule format rendering it more useful compared to larger structures. Tokens can be transferred to a sender and recipient on a DEX or marketplace without any restrictions. Molecule protocol applies the same concept except with an infrangible validation process, &nbsp;creating the security of validity the current digital financial environment lacks.</p><p>Users must first create a Protis account that provides an Ethereum wallet address. Then the user must go through ID verification to obtain a KYC token. In the Molecule Protocol, KYC represents the ERC721 token. Without any way to prove to banks, and even landlords, that you are trustworthy, there’s many times retail users struggle to get an apartment lease, mortgage, tuition, or car loan, creating seemingly unfair exclusivity. To mend this exclusivity the Molecule Protocol utilizes BloomID as verification and Bloom’s credit score system to include those who may not have traditional data. If approved, the KYC 721 token is issued from ‘OnRamp’, Bloom’s smart contract ‘bridge’.</p><p>Bloom creates a digital identity called a BloomID for those who cannot acquire verification via traditional data. With their BloomID, they can securely apply for credit as soon as their identity is verified. There is no need for a SSN which is beneficial to those who may not have a credit history. Rather than submit a credit score, users upload a personal form of ID - which can be in the form of a license, email, phone number, utility bills, or any other financials available or that are considered unconventional. All this data is then used to assess the user’s ‘credit score’, as well as how trustworthy the user is in relation to risk. Both the sender and receiver are able to track the sender’s credit score, utilization, age of credit, or payment history. After deploying, exchanges/marketplaces can validate addresses using Molecule Protocol.</p><p>The process of using Molecule Protocol is simple enough so those without any technical blockchain knowledge can employ it. The first step is to define all ‘molecule’ structures, which Molecule Protocol provides a schema for. Once done, the molecule tokens are minted.</p><p>The security Bloom has created, despite not acquiring SSNs or tax records from their users, is revolutionary to the space, and to self-sovereign identity. Through Bloom, users receive digital identities, and through the Molecule Protocol as a whole, users, globally, receive sovereignty.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce our newest feature, which allows users to deploy existing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts on the Dock network.</p><p>The team has integrated the Dock mainnet with <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier">Parity’s Frontier project</a>, making it possible to deploy smart contracts written in Solidity on Dock and interact with them using existing Ethereum libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js">web3</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js">ethers-js</a>.</p><p>We expect this feature to serve a wide variety of use cases. Its most immediate application will be the integration of our mainnet with <a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</a>’s price feed, which is planned for completion in the coming weeks. This integration will allow us to price the network services in USD, and enable us to add other fiat currencies as needed in the future, making it simpler for organizations to issue verifiable credentials on Dock’s infrastructure.</p><p>To illustrate the steps for deploying and using EVM smart contracts on the Dock mainnet, our team has created a <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/eth/tutorials/src/tutorial_evm.md#dao">tutorial</a> for deploying a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The tutorial contains step-by-step instructions for handling EVM accounts and setting up and executing an example DAO on Dock.</p><p>We will continue to add new features to our offerings and contribute to the Polkadot ecosystem. The team’s plan for the rest of 2021 is reflected in our <a href="https://www.dock.io/roadmap/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=deploy-your-evm-smart-contracts-on-dock">roadmap</a>, which was explained in detail in an <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-2021-roadmap/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=deploy-your-evm-smart-contracts-on-dock">earlier blog post</a>.</p><p>About Dock</p><p><a href="http://dock.io?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=deploy-your-evm-smart-contracts-on-dock">Dock</a> is a platform designed to provide a simple solution for businesses and developers to build, manage and present digital credentials that are instantly verifiable using blockchain technology. Dock has leveraged <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> to create a standalone blockchain, integrated payment and incentivisation token, a trusted network of validators, and seamless adoption and interoperability.

  The TiddlyWiki Community Chat on March 24th showcased the TiddlyWiki on Fission app, the new static publishing on the web feature, and the launch of the Open Collective.

<p>On March 24th, we hosted a community chat for TiddlyWiki on Fission. We've been working with Jeremy Ruston, TiddlyWiki creator, to integrate Fission's webnative accounts and file system. Jeremy gave an overview and demo of the work to date, and we talked about what's next.</p> Video &amp; Slides <p><a href="https://presentations.fission.app/2021-03-24-tiddlywiki-community-chat.pdf">Slides »</a></p> Why does Fission want to support TiddlyWiki? <p>We started by giving a brief overview of Fission, including getting into why Fission wants to support TiddlyWiki. Here are a few of the points we covered:</p><p>The TiddlyWiki community is filled with people who aren’t necessarily software developers, but program and customize all the time: Fission wants to make it easier for anyone to create, personalize, and customize apps. The TiddlyWiki community does this all the time, because of the built in nature of TiddlyWiki itself. That's the kind of energy we want to promote and support.</p><p>Showcase apps on Fission that encourage people to dig deeper, do their own integration: there is a wave of note taking apps, second brains, digital gardens, and more. If we can show more people that these features are possible today in open source apps, and that they can be synced and work everywhere on the web with Fission, this can encourage more people to check us out. And, along the way, see more usage of TiddlyWiki, too!</p><p>We've even heard a rumour that the founder of Roam Research originally prototyped Roam on TiddlyWiki!</p> TiddlyWiki on Fission <p>Jeremy went on to demo what he has built so far. The TiddlyWiki on Fission App is live today at <a href="https://tiddlywiki.fission.app">tiddlywiki.fission.app</a>.</p>Logged in view showing a demo account's private and public file system.<p>You'll need to click on the Authorise with Fission button, create a Fission account if you haven't already, and then you're ready to create a new TiddlyWiki. </p><p>You choose from any of the Editions that are available, give it a name, and it will launch in a new window. As you work on this TiddlyWiki</p><p>What is rather unique is that the TiddlyWiki itself is just a regular TiddlyWiki flat file. Through an iframe, it talks to the TiddlyWiki on Fission editing app, that saves any edits you make to your Webnative File System attached to your Fission account.</p><p>This also means that you can upload any existing TiddlyWiki file that you have, and enable web-based viewing and saving from any browser. The <a href="https://drive.fission.codes">Fission Drive app</a> lets you browse your file system and upload files.</p> Static Publishing <p>As seen in the screenshot above where you pick an Edition to launch, Jeremy has been working on a new web-based static publishing feature. This lets you publish static files directly from the web version of TiddlyWiki. Before, this required the NodeJS developer tools for TiddlyWiki.</p><p>For Fission accounts, this means being able to publish a flat file version of selected portions of your TiddlyWiki as regular static HTML. If you keep your source TiddlyWiki in the private part of your file system, you can then selectively make pieces of content public. </p> Editions <p>Editions are what different distributions of TiddlyWiki – with content, plugins, and other resources bundled in – are called.</p><p>We're going to ask the TiddlyWiki community if they want to include Editions in the base app, so that any user can then select to launch a new TiddlyWiki. This is designed to be non-developer friendly – just give us the URL of where your edition is available online, and we'll add it to the "bill of materials" in the TiddlyWiki on Fission app. </p><p>For example, we've got a <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/tiddlywiki-second-brain-roam-clones/1594/">list in the forum about the different "Roam Clones"</a> that have been built with TiddlyWiki.</p><p>We've also got a thread in the forum going about <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/building-a-tiddlywiki-edition/1727">what is needed to build an edition</a>, and we'll make a basic Fission edition to use as an example.</p> TiddlyWiki on Open Collective <p>We have created a <a href="https://opencollective.com/tiddlywiki-on-fission">collective on Open Collective for TiddlyWiki on Fission</a>. Open Collective is a platform for gathering financial support and transparent finances.</p><p>Our goal is to gather funds from backers who want to see this work be further developed. We'll look to work with the community to find projects and features to fund, and hire from within the community to get those things built.</p><p>Thank you very much to <a href="https://opencollective.com/walt-ludwick">Walt</a> &amp; <a href="https://opencollective.com/karlicoss">Karlicoss</a> for being our first two backers! </p> Spaceship Cat <p>This was also the first introduction of Spaceship Cat, joining Flag Cat. We'll turn these TiddlyWiki + Fission illustrations into stickers and other fun items around the TiddlyWiki community. Anyone is welcome to use the image under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>, let us know if you need a higher resolution copy.</p> Next Steps <p>Try out the TiddlyWiki app: <a href="https://tiddlywiki.fission.app">tiddlywiki.fission.app</a></p><p>Have feedback? <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57">Join the forum</a>, enter the <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">Discord chat</a>, or for developers, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Jermolene/tiddlywiki-on-fission">code on Github</a>.</p> <p>Join us for regular weekly Tech Talk Thursdays and other special events like this community chat. <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">View the upcoming agenda &amp; sign up for future events »</a></p>

<p>Short answer: It’s bad and getting worse.</p>



<p>Long answer:&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">Research</a>&nbsp;continues to confirm organizations are falling behind in efforts to protect the privacy of users’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;(PII) online. Data&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy&nbsp;</a>is an exploding issue because the amount of digital data users generate is increasing exponentially, organizations are moving more data and services to the cloud, and privacy regulations are still a way off being a comprehensive fix. At the same time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/3-serious-data-privacy-risks-from-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;pandemic is forcing more remote work, which exposes organizations to greater risks, and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2019/09/the-top-consumer-security-concerns-this-year/">cyberattacks</a>&nbsp;are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. The&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">data economy</a>&nbsp;is flourishing, on and off the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">dark web</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data privacy is a global issue.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3889055">Gartner</a>&nbsp;predicts the worldwide information security market will reach $170.4 billion in 2022 as companies globally respond to increasing threats. Some countries are more affected than others though, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/a-country-in-crisis-data-privacy/#:~:text=Data%20privacy%20in%20the%20US%20is%20a%20growing%20problem%20caused,increasing%20at%20an%20unprecedented%20rate.">United States</a>&nbsp;is among the worst hit. Internet-connected computers are attacked every&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/87787-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds">39 seconds</a>&nbsp;in the US and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rsa.com/content/dam/en/misc/rsa-data-privacy-and-security-survey-2019.pdf">45 per cent of Americans</a>&nbsp;have had their personal information compromised by a <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>&nbsp;in the last five years. In 2019, the US had the highest average cost per data breach in the world, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/digital-assets/cost-data-breach-report/#/">$8.64 million</a>, and healthcare&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;alone affected&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/the-privacy-risks-of-telehealth-and-what-you-can-do-to-protect-your-privacy/">40 million people</a>—a number that’s growing with the ongoing&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/businesses-face-rising-cybersecurity-risks-from-covid-19/">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. The US still does not have a national consumer privacy law, despite&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dwt.com/blogs/privacy--security-law-blog/2020/10/national-consumer-privacy-law-round-up#:~:text=The%20bill%20seeks%20to%20provide,and%20fair%20exercise%20of%20their">ongoing efforts</a>&nbsp;to enact one, particularly in light of trailblazing regulatory advances in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/california-prop-24-puts-more-brakes-on-big-tech/">California</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The picture is similar in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dwt.com/blogs/privacy--security-law-blog/2020/10/national-consumer-privacy-law-round-up#:~:text=The%20bill%20seeks%20to%20provide,and%20fair%20exercise%20of%20their">United Kingdom</a>&nbsp;where the cost per data breach is slightly lower than the global average but&nbsp;<a>88 percent of companies</a>&nbsp;have been caught up in a breach, mostly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2117843/what-is-phishing-how-this-cyber-attack-works-and-how-to-prevent-it.html">phishing</a>&nbsp;attacks. High levels of data breach are also reported in nearby Germany (<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3440069/uk-cybersecurity-statistics-you-need-to-know.html">92 percent</a>),&nbsp;France (<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3440069/uk-cybersecurity-statistics-you-need-to-know.html">94 percent</a>), and Italy (<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3440069/uk-cybersecurity-statistics-you-need-to-know.html">90 percent</a>). Small UK businesses suffer an attempted hacking attack every&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hiscoxgroup.com/news/press-releases/2018/18-10-18">19 seconds</a>, and nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3440069/uk-cybersecurity-statistics-you-need-to-know.html">40 percent</a> of UK companies reported a data breach in the 12 months to May 2020.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3153707/top-cybersecurity-facts-figures-and-statistics.html">Australia</a>,&nbsp;seven in 10 respondents to the Australian Community Attitudes to Privacy Survey 2020&nbsp;by the Office of the Australian Information Commission (<a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/">OAIC</a>), nominated privacy as a major concern for them, while 87 per cent wanted more control and choice over the collection and use of their personal information. These consumer sentiments are reflected in those of users worldwide, which we recently reported&nbsp;were that:&nbsp;</p>



  High profile, significant, and regular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/information-technology/worst-data-breaches-infographic/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;have spooked consumers.&nbsp;  Consumers generally get that they have to trade certain&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;for services, but are now warier of sharing their personal data.&nbsp;  Consumers want to control their own data and will act to do so if they can.  Levels of consumer trust for brands is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">generally low</a>.&nbsp;  Consumers will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/14/half-of-americans-have-decided-not-to-use-a-product-or-service-because-of-privacy-concerns/">abandon</a>&nbsp;brands or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">delay&nbsp;purchases</a>&nbsp;where they perceive a risk to their personal data.  The regulatory screws are tightening to protect consumers.  



<p>Privacy laws are trying to stem the data privacy crisis and put the brakes on&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>, but there’s still a way to go. California has the&nbsp;California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and its successor, the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/california-prop-24-puts-more-brakes-on-big-tech/">California Privacy Rights Act 2020</a>, which reins in the powers of Big Tech, preventing them from sharing consumers’ personal information and closing a loophole that meant companies could keep targeting ads with user data even when those users opted out.</p>



<p>Beyond the US, there is also solid progress being made in consumer privacy legislation, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-the-regulation-means-for-everyday-internet-user/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>&nbsp;and Brazil’s new&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/brazils-general-data-protection-law-english-translation/">General Data Protection Law</a>, for example. And we hope, in the coming decade, we will see a simplification of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adlawaccess.com/2020/01/articles/the-u-s-approach-to-privacy-what-is-it-and-where-is-it-headed/">current patchwork</a>&nbsp;of privacy regulations in the US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Anonyome Labs, we believe privacy will be a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">defining issue of the coming decade</a>, starting with some hot topics&nbsp;in 2021, as we ramp up the fight against abuse and misuse of data globally. Watch this space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building off of our recent <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-receives-soc-2-type-ii-certification-b2b6ea7a6d75">SOC 2 Type II certification announcement</a>, we’re thrilled to share that GlobaliD is now HIPAA compliant.</p><p>What’s HIPAA?</p><p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html">U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services</a>:</p><blockquote>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) required the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop regulations protecting the privacy and security of certain health information.1 To fulfill this requirement, HHS published what are commonly known as the HIPAA <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/privacyrule/index.html">Privacy Rule</a> and the HIPAA <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/securityrule/index.html">Security&nbsp;Rule</a>.</blockquote><p>In short, HIPAA compliance is about keeping your healthcare data (Protected Health Information or PHI) private and secure. (You can learn more about the Privacy and Security Rules in the HHS links&nbsp;above.)</p><p>More than keeping that data safe, it’s also about safeguarding who has access to it — while preserving certain individual rights such as the ability to obtain records or request corrections. That’s the kind of stuff that GlobaliD is perfectly suited for.

 Dear Shyft Network Community, <p>In alignment with the @polkastarter team, we have come to the decision to postpone the IDO until Friday, March 26th, 2021 @ 3PM&nbsp;UTC.</p><p>Shyft Network is, to our knowledge, one of the largest smart contract infrastructures in the ecosystem, with use cases that require this infrastructure to perform critical operations directly after launch. The size and complexity of the network’s smart contracts makes deployment ordering critical; a core contract that is used to route KYC primitives across multiple networks was missing a feature that would allow for accelerated deployments over the next 3 months of the protocol deployment’s roadmap.</p><p>Given the simplicity of the upgrade required, and the importance of the component for all iterations being deployed following this initial contract release, moving to Friday was a simple decision that will allow for long term ease of future development and cross chain security.</p><p>We understand the frustration that postponing the IDO may cause, and are grateful to the community for their incredible support and enthusiasm.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>The Shyft Network&nbsp;Team</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Data friction is arguably the biggest obstacle for every organization on its journey to achieve optimal business productivity. Even if you have not heard the term before, you’ve definitely faced its consequences in one form or another (most probably, even in multiple different forms). You need your product’s sales data for EMEA, but it’s not a top priority for your IT team? Your marketing team would love to derive better insights from your customer data, but your ERP system is not supported by their fancy cloud service? Your developers must wait several days to get an approved, anonymized copy of production data for testing?</p>
<p>Or maybe your bosses are urging you to migrate to the cloud, but you are too scared of GDPR? Every time your business urgently needs access to some data, but technical debt, other technological limitations or just compliance challenges prevent it from happening as expected, you are facing data friction again.</p>
<p>Data friction is the total of all delays and complications in delivering business data to its consumers within an enterprise. In the age of Digital Transformation when, for many companies, data is their lifeblood, too much friction is not just a productivity killer but the difference between success and failure as a business. Unfortunately, security and compliance are also often considered major sources of data friction, and ones that are too easy to fix: just relax your security policies a bit. Until a major data breach happens, that is.</p>
<p>There are, of course, multiple approaches towards reducing data friction. <a href="https://dataops.io/">DataOps</a> is an entirely new methodology for aligning your people, business processes, and IT to enable rapid, automated management of data. There are also numerous tools and technologies designed specifically to address certain aspects of data friction. For example, data virtualization solutions replace traditional ETL processes with real-time automated access to remote data sources, creating a layer of abstraction above multiple data siloes and enabling transparent data transformations to conform to security and compliance requirements.</p>
<p>However, whenever you add another layer of abstraction to an IT architecture, especially if its only purpose is to address the shortcomings of existing components, you’re not actually solving the underlying problem – to the contrary, the overall complexity is increasing, and the possibility of friction (or failure) is only increasing. Even if each component is the “best of breed” solution for a specific need, the whole is never “greater than the sum of its parts” – you’re lucky if it’s still just good enough. This idea applies to just about every field in IT, but it is especially relevant for the database market where highly specialized products optimized for a specific subset of data are still the norm.</p>
<p>This specialization leads to increasing data fragmentation between siloes, teams, and units within an enterprise. Needless to say, applying business analytics to this data is a challenge – you either have to be content with limited capabilities built into, say, a time-series database or have additional tools and processes to copy the data into a separate location for using “proper” BI solutions, which introduces additional friction and lots of room for error. But does it really have to be this way?</p>
<p>Well, an obvious alternative approach would be to try to keep all your data in a single universal database that’s capable of combining the traditional relational model with modern alternatives like graph or document models. This way, you’ll only need to manage a single technology stack with a single set of access and security policies. That is exactly what Oracle is offering with its “converged database”, and if you opt for their autonomous database service, you don’t even need to worry about managing that stack.</p>
<p>However, just placing all data into a single silo would be rather counterproductive if the only thing you can do with it is to store it securely. And again, Oracle’s long-term strategy is to build a multitude of data processing and analytics capabilities directly into its database. We have already covered <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80405/oracle-apex-secure-low-code-application-development-platform/">Oracle APEX</a> – a low-code application development platform that helps even business users with limited programming skills to create applications that can effortlessly grow up to be enterprise scale while keeping their data secured directly in the Oracle Database. But the company doesn’t stop there.</p>
<p>Last week, Oracle announced major new self-service capabilities in its Autonomous Data Warehouse, which bring the same level of data democratization to business analytics as well. Now business users can import their existing semi-structured data like Excel spreadsheets or XML and JSON files or bring in data from internal or external sources into a data warehouse themselves using a simple wizard-driven UI, without any knowledge about data structures or transformations or support from IT. The data is then immediately available for management and visualization using the APEX platform.</p>
<p>The product now offers rich analytics capabilities that also come with self-service tools for creating business models, data lineage and impact analysis, and automated insight discovery. Again, without any technical knowledge, a business user can quickly identify hidden patterns or anomalies in their data or connect their favorite analytics tool to dig deeper. On top of that, the Autonomous Data Warehouse now comes with built-in machine learning capabilities and includes AutoML – the technology that hides most of the complexity associated with ML from users, supporting them with automatic selection of algorithms and features.</p>
<p>Needless to say, all these capabilities do not require any additional data transformation or export to a different data store, avoiding IT-related time delays. Meanwhile, sensitive business data remains in a single location, secured against a broad range of external and internal threats and highly available. To me, this looks like a Zero Friction situation!</p>

It is predicated on open standards foundations that enable easy movement of data and&nbsp;vendors.</p> Interoperability with DHS SVIP Companies <p>Our team was proud to participate in the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">US Department of Homeland Security Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> Interoperability Plug-fest this month. DHS SVIP has been leading the charge on interoperability for years now, putting their funding and networks on the table to lead the&nbsp;charge.</p><p>This was Transmute’s second time participating as an awarded company of the SVIP program, and we were joined by 7 other companies from around the globe, addressing topics from supply chain traceability to digital assets for&nbsp;humans.</p><p>While each company is focused on slightly different industries — and therefore nuanced solutions for those customers — we are all committed (and contractually obligated by the US Government) to implement open standards infrastructure in a way that ensures verifiable information can be issued, consumed, and verified across systems using different technical “stacks”.</p><p>Technical foundations for interoperability include the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-imp-guide/">W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/on-json-ld-and-the-semantics-of-identity-42d051d3ce14">JSON Linked Data</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api">Verifiable Credentials HTTP API</a>, and the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a>. Companies also worked from shared vocabularies based on use case, such as the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab">Traceability Vocabulary</a> that aggregates global supply chain ontologies for use in linked data credentials.</p><p>The following two videos show examples of interoperability in action using both Transmute and other cohort company systems. Note that the use cases have been simplified to allow for ease of demonstration to diverse audiences.</p><p>Transmute and other companies also publicly shared the results of our interoperability testing — Transmute’s results are&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-http-api/test-suite/transmute/">here</a>.</p> Interoperability in steel supply&nbsp;chain <p>Transmute is working directly with US Customs and Border Protection to trace the origins of steel materials using verifiable credentials. This video shows an example of multiple steel supply chain actors exchanging verifiable trade information culminating in a seamless review process from&nbsp;CBP.</p> Interoperability across industries <p>We also worked with other cohort companies to demonstrate how important credentials like a vaccination certificate can be used to help supply chain professionals get back to work safely. This demo includes the use of selective disclosure technology as well as off-line verification of a paper credential.</p> Charting the&nbsp;Course <p>Interoperability across systems moves the internet towards a more open-network approach for trustworthy exchange of information. Choice is increasingly becoming the network feature that governments and enterprises will not do without. <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-business-case-for-interoperability-a1a2b884297d">It is pre-competitive table stakes for doing business.</a> The path is clear for those of us developing technology in this space: interoperate, or get out. Fortunately, the competitive “pie” is big enough for all of&nbsp;us.</p><blockquote>By creating interoperable systems that can seamlessly exchange trusted information we are creating a global network of information that grows in value as more players enter&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>Transmute is proud to build with talented teams from around the globe, including our cohort friends: Mattr, Mavennet, Mesur, Digital Bazaar, Secure Key, Danube Tech, and Spherity.</p><p>Thank you also to the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">DHS SVIP</a> team for funding this interoperability work, and to our partners at <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/">US CBP</a> for your support moving from technology to tactical solutions.</p><p>To learn more about Transmute’s platform and solutions <a href="https://transmute.typeform.com/to/RshfIw">contact us&nbsp;today</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/interoperability-is-not-a-choice-387d57c6dc32">Interoperability is Not a Choice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is the fourth in a series of blogs which provide edited extracts of key points made by Mydex CIC in its response to the UK Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">consultation around a new National Data Strategy</a>.</p><p>This blog focuses on common misconceptions that need to be addressed if we are to progress. Previous blogs focused on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">how to unleash the full potential of personal data</a>, on why <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/transforming-the-system-a-roadmap-for-practical-implementation-411e8821ed19">how to achieve these changes at scale</a>, and the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-transformational-potential-of-personal-data-da47f666713e">sheer size of the social and economic opportunity</a>.</p><p>To catch up on progress on our Macmillan My Data Store Pilot <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>It wasn’t so long ago that sober, intelligent, responsible adults believed the sun orbited the earth, that if you were ill the best cure was to have a leech suck your blood, and that it was the right thing to do to hunt and burn witches at the stake. They also gave patronage to alchemists and astrologists who claimed they could turn lead into gold and foretell futures. These conventional wisdoms were deeply and dangerously wrong, but the majority of the great and good went along with them without a second thought. If everybody believes it, it must be true.&nbsp;Right?</p><p>Something similar is happening with debates about personal data today. Mydex CIC’s submission on the UK Government’s proposed National Data Strategy highlighted three areas where this is the case: a naive belief in the magic cure-all powers of ‘Big Data’ and artificial intelligence; confusion about what citizens ‘controlling’ their data really means; and whether citizens are actually capable of doing so. This blog summarises what we said on these&nbsp;issues.</p> Beware AI&nbsp;hype <p>Many narratives about a national strategy for data follow a familiar refrain. Artificial intelligence can gain much better insights from data and make much better decisions than human beings can. The opportunities are endless. To enable the analytics that will drive these insights we need to gather together as much data as possible.</p><p>There is so much wrong with this trope that we will need to devote future blogs to it. But basically, it contains three core&nbsp;errors.</p>  Claims for what AI can actually do are being wildly inflated. AI is good at solving certain types of problems (which require lots of computation and where judgements based on context or values are not required). But most of the important problems our society faces do not fit this specification.  By the nature of the processes needed to deliver AI, policies designed to promote it automatically favour existing data monopolies, thereby exacerbating the extreme imbalances of power and reward that already&nbsp;exist.  AI operates by crunching huge amounts of data. But when it comes to actually applying any insights or decisions generated to specific individuals, we hit a transition point. At this point we are <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/completing-the-4th-industrial-revolution-426af23aa475">no longer dealing with ‘big’ statistical data or (misnamed) artificial ‘intelligence’, we are dealing with specific bits of data about specific people</a>: we are dealing with personal&nbsp;data.  <p>This last point needs some elaboration.</p><p>Economically speaking, by far the most important and valuable uses of personal data do not derive from ‘insights’ derived from ‘analytics’. Businesses like Google and Facebook may loom very large in peoples’ consciousness, but their business models are organised around advertising, which accounts for less than 2% of all economic activity.</p><p>The really big uses of personal data lie elsewhere: in public administration, health, financial services, education, transport, retailing and so on. The key point about uses of personal data in these arenas is that they are operational. Service providers use data to plan, organise and implement activities and to undertake associated administration. Such activities include ensuring they are dealing with the right people, making decisions relating to eligibility and access to services, configuring service provision to the needs and circumstances of particular individuals, planning and organising the delivery of such services, keeping associated records, undertaking billing, dealing with queries,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>A key characteristic of these activities is that completing each one successfully does not require the aggregation of large amounts of data. Instead, they each require the ability to access and use exactly the right data at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>The infrastructure and capabilities that make the construction of such data-driven services is not the aggregation of the biggest possible databases but the availability of safe, efficient data logistics: the ability to get exactly the right data to and from the right people and places in the right formats at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>Establishing such personal data logistics infrastructure has almost nothing to do with ‘big data’ or ‘artificial intelligence’ and is entirely overlooked by AI enthusiasts. Personal data stores provide this infrastructure — infrastructure that is really needed to turbocharge the accelerated improvement of the big part of the data picture, operational uses of personal data for the purposes of improved service provision.</p> Do individuals really want to control their&nbsp;data? <p>Most debate about the issue of citizen ‘control’ of their personal data is fundamentally confused. There are two very different types of ‘control’:</p>  Individuals trying to control data that is collected about them and used by organisations  Individuals trying to use their data to manage their lives better, which means they have to be able to exercise control over&nbsp;it  <p>Virtually all current debate about ‘control’ focuses on the first, narrow, meaning. Virtually all of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-practical-vision-for-personal-data-empowerment-1d366ed792f">the value of exercising control</a> derives from the second meaning, which is nearly universally ignored. Personal data stores empower individuals with the second type of positive control: the ability to use their own data for their own purposes; to add value in their&nbsp;lives.</p><p>A second set of misplaced assumptions follows. When individuals seek to control data that organisations collect about them, the process is usually adversarial. The individual is trying to stop the organisation doing things with data that the individual doesn’t like. But when individuals seek to use their own data for their own purposes, on most occasions they positively want to share data with bona fide service providers because these service providers can help them add&nbsp;value.</p><p>If a National Data Strategy frames debate and policy making about citizens controlling their data in the first narrow, adversarial way it will never unleash the full potential of personal&nbsp;data.</p> Are individuals capable of controlling their&nbsp;data? <p>A related, common misconception is that individuals do not want to or are unable to exercise control over their data, because doing so is too difficult and&nbsp;complex.</p><p>The opposite is true. Processes currently used by organisations to collect and use data manufacture complexity, thereby imposing significant burdens on individuals.</p><p>Current burdens lie in four main&nbsp;areas:</p>  Individuals are required to fill in multiple forms when seeking to access and use services, often having to provide the same information many times over, on occasion even to the same organisation.  Individuals are required to prove claims that they make about themselves (e.g. about their age or address) often involving the physical presentation of physical documents  Overly complex and cumbersome consent processes, including privacy policies and terms and conditions that are evasively worded and difficult to read and understand. These are often deliberately made excessively complex by organisations seeking to induce individuals to consent to data sharing for reasons and purposes that go beyond accessing the data that’s needed to provide the service the individual is&nbsp;seeking.  The organisation-centric nature of today’s data ecosystem means that individuals have to manage each relationship with each organisation separately — so that the above burdens of information provision, proofs of claims and consent are multiplied many times over as individuals deal with multiple organisations. Most individuals have 100 or more such data relationships, so to effectively ‘control’ all their data, they need to undertake these processes 100 times over. The transaction costs are so high that hardly anyone&nbsp;bothers.  <p>Personal data stores greatly reduce and often eliminate these manufactured burdens. They do so&nbsp;by:</p>  Standardising data sharing agreements around ‘safe by default’: only sharing data necessary for the purposes of service provision.  Automating data sharing processes so that they work for and on behalf of individuals ‘while they sleep’. For a parallel, think of standard orders and direct debits which provide individuals with full and complete control over their money, but work in standardised, automated ways that mean the individual no longer has to think about their operation.  Creating single, centralised tools for the citizen for managing relationships with suppliers (equivalent to setting up, changing or ending direct debits). For example, consent management dashboards enable individuals to see and simply manage all their data sharing agreements with suppliers in one place (rather than having to log in to dozens of different separate accounts)   Summary <p>It is not possible to make good policy decisions about priorities for investments, grants, innovation and research projects or rules and regulations if the grounds for these decisions are faulty. Currently, effective policy making is hampered by widespread misunderstandings about where the biggest economic opportunities lie, the nature of issues such as control, and the role of citizens in the workings of the data economy. This is resulting in misallocation of available resources and overlooked opportunities. For a National Data Strategy to succeed, a fresh assessment of the assumptions that lie behind current debates about personal data is essential.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/misconceptions-that-kill-progress-in-personal-data-4736b1d883c6">Misconceptions that Kill Progress in Personal Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Shyft Network — Token Distribution and Economics <p>Barbados, March 24, 2021 — The Shyft Network core team is proud to announce the details of its SHFT token economics and distribution schedules within the Shyft Network protocol.</p><p>The Shyft Network is a blockchain-based solution for centralized and decentralized technologies, like decentralized finance (DeFi). It’s a technology layer that aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on private and public ecosystems, enabling an opt-in compliance layer across all&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Shyft Network was designed as an interoperable standard for use cases that require multiparty trust and validation. We took a fundamentally different approach to data and identity and thanks to its founders’ long history with Bitcoin, dating back to 2010. The vision of Shyft Network was one that had a long-term view on the future of where our ecosystem was headed and what would be needed to protect decentralization and privacy while enabling new markets and&nbsp;users.</p><p>The Shyft Network enables identity verification, validation, and the sending of credentials and other data across multiple different blockchains and networks. It is a solution and compliance primitive to the entire decentralized ecosystem, with a focus on solving some of the largest global challenges around regulations, compliance, data privacy, and trust and coordination.</p> Balance and Decentralization <p>When designing the token economics and distribution schedules, we were careful to structure the various buckets/outflows to maximize our impact and collaborative structures across the ecosystem.</p><p>When designing this system, we took to heart the lessons that our ecosystem painfully learned over the last decade; one key goal is to provide distribution and allocation across use cases and community infrastructure enabling perpetual support and longevity to all functions that make networks successful across phases of their development. Resilience, adaptability and decentralization are guiding values of our&nbsp;work.</p><p>This economic structure was built and refined over the last 4 years and included the guidance and direction of our closest partners and advisors, whose capabilities complement the Shyft Network Core’s team, helping us make headway into our product focuses like compliance and identity. We are confident that this strategy will get us to product &amp; community readiness, and puts the hard work into a system that allows the community to take over and continue to advance the ecosystem forward!</p><p>The Network distribution is largely programmatic through distribution contracts which are closely coupled with the inflation rate that is used to pay for federation network security, Byfrost Bridge node security, and Community DAO (Shyft Community Runtime Inflation). The distribution below spans over 10 years with distributions focused on ecosystem pillars and critical infrastructure to support long-term growth of network usage, and meet demand balances to ensure a verifiable and scalable liquidity base.</p> SHFT Overview <blockquote>Name: Shyft Network<br>Symbol: SHFT<br>Type: Native Layer 1, ERC-20 token compatible<br>Decimals: 18<br>Initial Circulating supply on launch: 3,800,000<br>Circulating supply 12 months after launch: 507,432,184<br>Circulating supply 7.5 years after launch: 1,910,000,000<br>Node Inflation rate: set at 6% of the initial universe, released on a per-block basis, perpetually</blockquote> The SHFT&nbsp;Token <p>SHFT fuels the Shyft Network; think of it as gas that powers the engine. SHFT is a means of payment, a mechanism for bonding value, and an instrument for governance value capture. SHFT, depending on the use case, can be utilized in a multitude of ways which includes a payment and authorization system for long-term validation.</p><p>SHFT is a layer 1 currency for identity and data transmission, as well as a governance mechanism for coordination across ecosystems that enables entity-to-entity governance, compliant asset creation, and a system for compliant Defi and other applications. Enabling a new side of the existing ecosystem could greatly expand the size of market participants and increase the size of asset participation across all decentralized projects, protocols, and marketplaces.</p><p>The Shyft token, when used across use cases created on Shyft Network, enables assets and metadata to be added into this compliant layer-2 smart contract system, acting as a wrapper for these asset types and a directory for all Dapps that support the ecosystem. The SHFT token on other chains acts as a layer two gas and currency to pay for the compatibility, composability, and routing channel architecture that is required to create, utilize, and transit compliant (rule based) assets across all 3rd party applications (ie. Dexs, lending pools, etc.). Shyft Network’s native token becomes useful as a bridged currency in liquidity pools through multiple infrastructure and cross-chain Defi deployments. You can read more on the SHFT token&nbsp;<a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shft-token-15743ba0e2d8">here</a>.</p> Token Distribution <p>The SHFT tokens are distributed into a number of tranches, designated for specific activities to benefit the network. These values and distributions are built into the core distribution contracts for automated deployment. You can view this as a form of pre-defined inflation across the network, spanning beyond 10&nbsp;years.</p> Economic Metagame — 20% <p>As users participate in the Wrap Rewards context, there will be a deflationary reduction in the total universe corresponding to the proportion of total assets (E.g. USDT erc20 token) within the Wrap Rewards contract. 20% of the total initial universe is available to be burned over the first 2 years (if lower, will move to further&nbsp;years).</p> Ecosystem Development — 23.81% <p>Less than 30% of the Ecosystem Development allocation will be unlocked at launch, and additional tokens will only be released outside of the intended schedule by Shyft Network in the event of major partnerships that require usage and bonding of tokens (such as enterprise partnerships, VASP partnerships, government partnerships, etc.). Sub-allocations within the Ecosystem Development include:</p>  Next-Gen DEFI (Project Adaptability) — 6.06%<br>To allow for the Shyft Network project to encompass and adapt to updates in the ecosystem as a whole, an allocation has been provided to allow for the engineering/production of services and utilities for this purpose, beginning on month 39 in daily distributions over a 12-month&nbsp;period.  Synthetic Asset Wrap Reward (Ecosystem) — 4.65%<br>Gives individuals a reward for holding other erc20-based assets on Ethereum within the Shyft Network smart contracts (e.g. Shyft-wrapped USDT), distributed in equal instalments over 10 years. Incentivizes participation in the total Shyft Network smart-contract stack e.g. allows for easy use of Trust Channels when regulations require/incentivize participation.  VASP Ecosystem Initializer — 0.03%<br>For the purposes of establishing our VASP/travel rule-related products that interact/support the Shyft Network compliance-related software stack, a small allocation has been provided on months 2–4 to incentivize the business-related relationships that will bootstrap this&nbsp;process.  Shyft Treasury — 2.76%<br>The Shyft Network will maintain a treasury composed of unallocated SHFT assets from advisors, partnerships, purchasers, et al. A portion of these assets may be distributed by way of decentralized consensus through community DAO-structures.<br>Our intention is to maintain these assets in the treasury until they can be allocated for their proper purposes, based on multi-year deployment schedules.   Public Distribution — 0.91% <p>For the whitelisted <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-ido-on-polkastarter-3dc553741e31">distribution through the Polkastarter platform</a>.</p> Advisors — 5.68% <p>Our global network of advisors has been invaluable to the development of the Shyft Network ecosystem. Advisor tokens will be delivered for one month, beginning on month 13, and then following a 6-month pause, resuming distributions on month 20 in daily distributions over a 17-month&nbsp;period.</p> Ongoing Technical Partnerships — 5.47% <p>Shyft Network partners are core to the technical development of the infrastructure, and many have been working with the Shyft Network core team for the past 2 years. Partnership tokens will be delivered for one month, beginning on month 6, and then following a 6-month pause, resuming distributions on month 13 over a 23-month&nbsp;period.</p> Purchasers — 22.26% <p>Shyft Network’s purchases from network participants, industry leaders, and other users. The principal distribution will begin in month 12 over a 16-month period, with partial amounts starting in month 6 as described below.</p><p>Starting in month 6, purchasers may have a mandatory bonding requirement to initiate Shyft Network’s interoperability bridge layer. Bridge rewards may be provided from month 6 to the end of month 11, depending on technical milestones achieved.</p> Strategic Partnerships — 4.01% <p>This allocation includes recent participants, with a focus on expanding Shyft Network’s use cases relating to compliance &amp; identity in the blockchain ecosystem. These partnerships comprise core development teams and entities who have and continue to build critical infrastructure to support native and cross-ecosystem infrastructure. Tokens will be released in daily distributions starting in month 4, over a 14-month&nbsp;period.</p> Core Team — 17.86% <p>The core Shyft Network team has demonstrated their commitment to the project by working relentlessly over the past almost 4 years. Team tokens will be delivered beginning on month 24 in daily distributions over a 12-month&nbsp;period.</p>Total Circulating Supply Over Time (Stacked) — 30&nbsp;months Inflation &amp; Runtime: Federated nodes, Runtime Inflation DAO’s &amp;&nbsp;Byfrost  Shyft Runtime Inflation DAO’s — 2%: Perpetual Community Funding and Ongoing Ecosystem Wide Resource Maintenance <p>Runtime Inflation was designed to address the issues of ecosystem resources that have been prevalent across the digital currency ecosystem. Methods of being able to consistently incentivize the community’s work, research, overall productivity and advancement have been hindered by the lack of structural design at the protocol level to account for these critical components of ecosystem growth and development.</p><p>Shyft Runtime was designed to allow for node block production inflation to be redistributed back to the developers, builders and users that openly contribute and progress the Shyft Network&nbsp;forward.</p><p>This 2% perpetual inflation rate is automatically directed to the Runtime Inflation DAO’s that will categorically allow the community and users to determine the most important initiatives to provide resources towards.</p><p>A separate article will be released that goes in-depth into Shyft Runtime Inflation and we call on the community to help as this exciting new model is deployed shortly after the protocol’s release.</p> Strong Federation — 2%: Inflation per block is generated to pay for the cost of security; all network transactions fees are eliminated through&nbsp;EIP1559 <p>Federation: The Shyft Network Layer 1 operates as a strong federation whose job is to act as proof of authority consensus network. This group of up to 21 participants is geographically distributed and all act as core parties who have aligned incentives to ensure the network is maintained and chainstate security is forward&nbsp;moving.</p><p>The network utilizes EIP1559 to eliminate fees that are transacted across the federation, creating a deflationary component of the network unless the network faces high usage and full blocks. As use cases utilize the network for its core purposes, fees are eliminated from the network reducing network fees over&nbsp;time.</p> Byfrost — 2%: Inflation routed to openly pay for the cost of public bridge nodes for asset-weighted Proof of&nbsp;Stake <p>Byfrost, which will be deployed halfway through the year, will be a weighted staking bridged infrastructure. The role of Byfrost is to secure asset transmission and data availability across blockchains. Byfrost is critical to allowing all of the Shyft Network smart contracts to communicate user identity data, compliant assets, and trust anchor coordination regardless of the layer 1 network they are operating on. Byfrost enables data availability to allow VASPs and use cases to be fully interoperable and connects the compliance and data layer to build an aggregate trust layer for public protocols and private&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Byfrost bridging infrastructure has 2% of the inflation perpetually being directed to pay for the proof of stake security provided by any users across the ecosystem. Nodes will be open and accessible by anyone across different networks who interact with Shyft Network on its native layer 1, or other bridged layer-1’s.</p> In conclusion <p>We are very excited to enter the next phase of our project, as we continue to see our communities growing and supporting the mission that guides us. We’ve stayed true to our path and our core values: decentralization, community-focused, impactful technology that is aimed at improving the way crypto is&nbsp;adopted.</p><p>We will be releasing further details on the inflationary component of the strong federation, and how the inflation mechanics of the network support perpetual enablement of cross-chain security and community DAO’s.</p><p>These token economics are the result of the careful analysis done over the past three years and reflect the decentralization-led ethos of the Shyft Network, its community and strategic participants. Our network is designed to be resilient and structured over time in a manner that best meets the needs of all global participants.</p><p>We are excited to begin to Shyft the world together.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote>

					 Indicio contributes novel UI messaging design for digital wallet to open source community 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Indicio open sources a text messaging UI for digital wallets.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Technology provider Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation advancing decentralized identity software and solutions, today announced the public availability of the Indicio Wallet UI Design, a user interface for holding and presenting verifiable digital credentials. A <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2020/11/02/news-release-finalists-announced-digital-wallets-prize-challenge">finalist </a>in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology ( S&amp;T) Trusted User Interface (UI) Digital Wallets Challenge, the UI digital wallet design is now available in the <a href="https://github.com/Indicio-tech/indicio-mobile-ux">Indicio public Github repository</a>.</p>
<p>To date, most wallets that handle Aries-based credentials have focused on having the user navigate lists of items and an array of popups and notifications. The Indicio UI design concept is rooted in the understanding that the exchange of verifiable credentials isn’t simply about moving data, it’s also about creating and maintaining relationships. As a consequence, Indicio’s design placed all of the interactions into a single, threaded record whereby each party can communicate in plain language.</p>
<p>“Our wallet design is 180 degrees from the list-based or card-based approach to presenting the user with information,” said Scott Harris, Vice President of Business Operations, Indicio. “Instead, we focus on the relationship between a user and issuers and verifiers and we designed the interactions to use an interface that people are familiar with: the text message. A natural and comfortable interface allows issuers and verifiers to clearly communicate requests, offers, clarifications, and policies. It allows users to query their contacts and receive either a personal reply, or a ‘smart reply’ from AI or chatbot systems.”</p>
<p>As Indicio is committed to open source as a proven way to deliver complex, sustainable innovation and adoption across industry sectors, anyone in the open source community beginning work on their own digital wallet can now make use of the Indicio UI design and its associated elements and assets.</p>
<p>“Decentralized identity can give people unprecedented control over their identities and data online,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “But it will only happen if people feel in control of the technology. That’s where good design meets great engineering. Good design is not just about creating beautiful things, it’s about giving people control over their lives, keeping them safe, solving their problems, and helping them achieve their goals.”</p>
<p>Indicio.tech is committed to being a resource hub for decentralized identity, providing enterprise-grade open source tools to get our clients, and the community, building solutions today. Providing the companies and organizations from diverse industries around the world rely on the work of Indicio.tech for expertise in building and scaling their decentralized identity solutions.</p>
<p>###</p>

 The GiD Report#152 — How economists corrupted the&nbsp;internet <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-151-understanding-globalids-vision-soc-2-type-ii-certification-62ebc3d93b36">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  How economists corrupted the&nbsp;internet  GK on the Justice Department investigation of&nbsp;Visa  Glenn Greenwald on Big&nbsp;Tech  What the future of NFTs is really about:&nbsp;music  Tweetstorm of the week — Clubhouse edition  Stuff happens   1. Matt Stoller: How economists corrupted the&nbsp;internet <p>Stoller’s latest blog post is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/16/google-files-ftc-antitrust-investigation-475573">based on this Politico piece</a> that uncovers 312 pages of FTC&nbsp;memos:</p><blockquote>Few moments in the power struggle between Washington and Silicon Valley have inspired more anger and bafflement than one in January 2013, when antitrust regulators appointed by former President Barack Obama declined to sue&nbsp;Google.</blockquote><blockquote>The decision still rankles the company’s rivals, who have watched the search giant continue to amass power over smartphones, data-hoovering devices and wide swaths of the internet, unimpeded by laws meant to deter monopolies. It has fueled some lawmakers’ calls to overhaul the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that spent 19 months investigating Google’s efforts to overpower the competition — and critics say,&nbsp;blinked.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Nearly a decade ago, the documents show, the FTC’s investigators uncovered evidence of how far Google was willing to go to ensure the primacy of the search engine that is the key to its fortunes, including tactics that European regulators and the U.S. Justice Department would later label antitrust violations. But the FTC’s economists successfully argued against suing the company, and the agency’s staff experts made a series of predictions that would fail to match where the online world was&nbsp;headed:</blockquote><p>Now, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/how-biden-can-clean-up-obamas-big">here’s&nbsp;Matt</a>:</p><blockquote>The FTC’s lawyers made two observations about Google. First, Google intentionally harmed and killed vertical search rivals by putting its own product first, which is known as ‘self-preferencing.’ “Google,” said the complaint, “routinely, and prominently, displays its own vertical properties, while simultaneously demoting properties that are identical to its own, but for the fact that the latter are competing vertical websites.” Google also would scape from its rivals and present their user-generated content as its own. Second, Google used exclusivity agreements and its own market power to deprive its rivals of user traffic, advertising revenue, data, and advertisers.</blockquote><blockquote>In doing so, Google drained the vitality out of the web, so much so that venture capitalists began using the term ‘kill zone’ to describe the un-investable spaces adjacent to&nbsp;Google.</blockquote><p>So why didn’t they take action? Reason&nbsp;1:</p>President Obama with Mark Zuckerberg and Eric Schmidt, Photo: Obama White&nbsp;House<blockquote>There were three main reasons for the reluctance to bring a case. The first is simple: corruption. Google was extremely close with the Obama administration, with its lobbyists averaging a meeting a week at the White House. Today, four out of the five FTC Commissioners who voted on the case, as well as staffers involved like Howard Shelanski, receives money directly or indirectly from one of the five big tech giants. (The only former FTC Commissioner who voted on the case and does not receive big tech money is deceased.)</blockquote><blockquote>Even more tellingly, the resolution of the case happened a little over a month after the reelection of President Obama, a campaign in which then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt was on election night, as The Wall Street Journal reported, “personally overseeing a voter-turnout software system for Mr. Obama.” Today this sounds bad, but at the time, the attitude in the White House was that Google, Facebook, and Amazon were making the world a better place. Republicans loved them because the GOP loves business, and Democrats loved them because they were culturally progressive and good for consumers. (For example, in 2013, well-known Democratic pundit Matt Yglesias wrote about Amazon, “Amazon, as far as I can tell, is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers.”)</blockquote><p>That second paragraph is almost weird to read now. It’s crazy the aboutface the public has taken on Big&nbsp;Tech.</p><p>Reason 2:</p><blockquote>The second main reason was ideological. Even the FTC lawyers were under the spell of the ‘consumer welfare’ standard, and felt that Google had the right to monopolize as long as consumers weren’t harmed. The reason, for instance, that the lawyers didn’t want to bring a charge for Google’s self-preferencing to kill vertical search engines wasn’t that they didn’t know the goal. They realized it was a scheme to monopolize. But they felt that Google had presented enough evidence showing that consumers might like it if Google’s search engine prioritized Google’s own properties. This ideology made the lawyers meeker, though they still wanted to bring&nbsp;suit.</blockquote><p>This goes along with the first reason — the way we think about monopolies and Big Tech and the parameters by how we might assess those situations has radically shifted in the last couple years (further cemented by the appointments of Lina Khan and Tim Wu as part of the Biden administration).</p><p>Reason 3:</p><blockquote>The third and most significant reason is that the commission’s antitrust economists made a very strong, and entirely wrong, argument against the case, which in retrospect rested on a set of laughably inaccurate predictions. While the FTC lawyers at the Bureau of Competition wanted to bring some charges, the economists at the Bureau of Economics said there was no case. They believed the online ad and search markets were competitive, consumers were benefitting, and there was little evidence of misbehavior.</blockquote><p>So where are we&nbsp;today?</p><blockquote>Mostly I’m pretty happy with my predictions, in which I said Biden would spend a lot of money and be more populist than Obama. But Biden has out-performed my expectations. He hired antitrust expert Tim Wu for the White House, and is reportedly appointing antitrust expert Lina Khan to the FTC. And Biden himself when he was in the Senate had little patience for economists. Meanwhile, Republicans, who were just as in thrall to Google, have changed as well. Trump brought a Google antitrust suit, the conversation on Capitol Hill has undergone a stark change on the right, and the awesome Texas case against Google is heavy on evidence of monopoly power and very light on theoretical economics.</blockquote><blockquote>So both parties have broken from the antitrust status quo. That said, the question now is whether political leaders writ large can ditch their affection for economists. These debates are more than theoretical. When someone uses Google to find help for their addiction, that person is not accessing a search engine, but a manipulation machine designed to serve the interests of whoever pays Google the most. It didn’t have to be this way. And if we downgrade economics, it doesn’t have to be this way&nbsp;anymore.</blockquote><p>In a very different place, apparently.</p><p>And it’s not just Google. It’s Facebook. It’s Apple. It’s Amazon. These companies have spent years consolidating their market power and they’ve all leveraged their position for their own gains — at the expense of their competitors and at the expense of end&nbsp;users.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/99a3f7c1-54d9-47fe-9bcb-fd72fcd94076">Apple warns Chinese apps not to dodge its new privacy&nbsp;rules</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-singapores-sea-used-facebook-to-become-an-e-commerce-giant">How Singapore’s Sea Used Facebook to Become an E-Commerce Giant</a>   2. But hey, at least we’ve woken up. Better late than&nbsp;never. <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-visa-over-debit-card-practices-11616164525?mod=e2tw">The WSJ on the Justice Department’s investigation of&nbsp;Visa</a>:</p><blockquote>The Justice Department is investigating whether Visa Inc. is engaging in anticompetitive practices in the debit-card market, a probe that casts a cloud over a core part of its business.</blockquote><blockquote>The department’s antitrust division has been gathering information and asking whether Visa, the largest U.S. card network, has limited merchants’ ability to route debit-card transactions over card networks that are often less expensive, according to people familiar with the&nbsp;matter.</blockquote><blockquote>Many of the department’s questions have focused on online debit-card transactions, but investigators have asked about in-store issues as well, the people&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>The probe highlights the important role of the so-called network fees that are invisible to consumers, lucrative for card companies, but a weight on merchants, who often pass on the fees in the form of higher prices to customers.</blockquote><p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1373038167092264960">here’s Greg&nbsp;Kidd</a>:</p><blockquote>No surprise here — Visa costs for running debit cards kept going down but prices kept going up. Hmmm. Glad the policymakers are finally waking&nbsp;up.</blockquote> 3. Glenn Greenwald’s opening statement on Big&nbsp;Tech: <blockquote>Over the last several years, my journalistic interest in and concern about the dangers of Silicon Valley’s monopoly power has greatly intensified — particularly as wielded by Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. The dangers posed by their growing power manifest in multiple ways. But I am principally alarmed by the repressive effect on free discourse, a free press, and a free internet, all culminating in increasingly intrusive effects on the flow of information and ideas and an increasingly intolerable strain on a healthy democracy.</blockquote><p><a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU05/20210312/111315/HHRG-117-JU05-Wstate-GreenwaldG-20210312.pdf">Check out the entire statement here.</a></p> 4. What the future of NFTs is really about:&nbsp;music <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-187d649e-11c3-4584-85b4-495befd03358.html">Here’s Felix&nbsp;Salmon</a>:</p><blockquote>How it works: The overwhelming majority of music revenues now come from streaming, with less than 6% coming from digital downloads, per the RIAA. Artists and genres appealing to a younger audience see almost no downloads at&nbsp;all.</blockquote>  Fandom, however, remains, and there is almost no limit to how much fans are willing to pay to express their allegiance to their favorite artists — especially if that allegiance has potential speculative value.  <blockquote>The state of play: Currently, artists release their singles and albums digitally in unlimited editions, normally at a price of 99 cents per song or $10 per&nbsp;album.</blockquote>  If those downloads were replaced with limited editions of say 10,000 NFTs per single, the price could be orders of magnitude higher — and could attract buyers who currently have no interest in downloads.  The NFTs would become collectible objects, with a resale value that might even go up over&nbsp;time.  <p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opensea-raise-andreessen-horowitz">NFT Marketplace OpenSea Raises $23M, Led by Andreessen Horowitz — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/wisekey-price-rally-nft">This (Small-ish) Swiss Cybersecurity Stock Jumped 80% After NFT-Related Press Release — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tony-hawk-nft-540-ollie">Tony Hawk Skates His Last Ollie 540, Puts the NFT of It Up for Auction — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/jack-dorsey-first-tweet-sells">Jack Dorsey’s First Tweet Sells for $2.9M — CoinDesk</a>   5.

I came up with a <a href="https://www.notion.so/Machine-DAO-your-advice-needed-5a63f9dbb4594b7fbc76ed5a8827f585">draft</a> and for further thinking/building I need to verify with you a couple of assumptions.</p> TL;DR <p>If you agree/disagree with the assumptions in bold chose an action item in the&nbsp;end.</p> Assumption: The way a project is made matters a lot in&nbsp;web3  Assumption: Intrinsically motivated team is better than highly payed&nbsp;stars <p>There is a choice: go fast from day one with money and strong devs VS go slower and build motivated AND strong team along the way. I believe the second option is better. Though certainly harder, in the long run it would be&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Or is there an even better&nbsp;way?</p><p>The plan is to start paying devs with tokens (1 token = $1). Mint them on the go. No real value until launch. After launch convert them into ownership. Hope to catch intrinsically motivated people this&nbsp;way.</p> Assumption: Multiple investors is a&nbsp;must <p>I think having investors in a decentralized project is good. Business professionals with large participation will help to make better decisions. But we need a number of them. Not just in rounds, but simultaneously.</p><p>Is it okay to have multiple investors from the&nbsp;start?</p><p>That would mean splitting the investment. You probably have a minimum threshold sum. Would it be a&nbsp;problem?</p> Assumption: Investor is a part of the community <p>Open discussion with investors brings a lot of value. It shows how the project is made, adds trust.

 Overview <p>Do you know about “short&nbsp;clips”?</p><p>Short clips are short videos that improve the overall quality of video content, by inserting short scenes. Short clips are used in various videos such as YouTube, advertisements, and news. Content businesses like YouTube, where over 500 hours of videos are uploaded each minute, use a variety of diverse short&nbsp;clips.</p><p>Below is a 30 seconds campaign video that was produced using the short clips we provided. Could you figure out how many short clips were used in this&nbsp;video?</p><blockquote><a href="https://youtu.be/kdnKoMOPmQY">How many short clips are&nbsp;there?</a></blockquote><p>Video content editors acquire short clips from taking videos by themselves or purchasing from other sources. They spend a lot of time struggling to resolve copyright issues when purchasing from various sources. Videos posted on YouTube are frequently taken down for copyright infringements and/or violations. For YouTube, it is difficult to detect copyright infringements in the vast content&nbsp;library.</p><p>CRISPY WHALES has created Banana Clips, to address these&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Banana Clips is an online marketplace where video content creators can sell or purchase short clips using web and mobile applications. Anyone with a smartphone can easily upload videos and anyone can easily search and purchase them via the&nbsp;web.</p> Features <p>Banana Clips provides 3-big features:</p>  Uploading and searching short&nbsp;clips,  Preserving copyrights of short clips and protecting contracts between buyers and&nbsp;seller  Tokenizing short clips and&nbsp;rights.  <p>Banana Clip users can easily upload their own videos and receive rewards through sales. Searchable metadata and simple recognizable keywords are extracted from the uploaded short clips via our AI system. In addition, emotional keywords like ‘warm’, ‘afraid’, ‘sad’, etc. are extracted through our patented AI algorithm which provides a search function that allows downloaders to easily search for the right short clips without professional knowledge.</p><p>The uploaded short clips are analyzed by our AI system, and then unique steganography is implanted in each short clip through our copyright management system to be used for identifying and verifying later. The watermarked short clips are stored and protected over the AERGO platform. We believe that the fast transaction speed and the strong security of AERGO is the best solution to provide the appropriate environment to protect and verify the copyright of short clips. Additionally, the short clips are used in a variety of ways when purchased and 3rd party protection lends credibility. Banana Clips provides a contract management system using fingerprint technology on the AERGO platform and protects rights for buyers and&nbsp;sellers.</p><p>Uploaders can sell their ownership of short clips at any time in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) with their unique value in Banana Clips. However, a contract to purchase rights of usage for a short clip would be a common case in our service. The unique value of it is determined by the value derived from the short clip and the contract. In order to enable trading, we are proposing to develop a new token protocol; a re-fungible token (RFT) which is a separate token value from non-fungible token&nbsp;(NFT).</p><p>Video content production and/or editing professionals using Banana Clips can purchase short clips and may use them free from copyright infringement through professional and advanced search methods. The unique token for each short clip issued can be traded to other users, so the sustainable value will further boost the market. In addition, NFTs or RFTs issued in this process will be valued and traded in the market, providing transparent compensation to uploaders.</p> Goal <p>CRISPY WHALES aims to provide a transparent marketplace through Banana Clip to ensure various short clips are securely provided and that each user can be fairly compensated. Furthermore, our company’s goal is to create a transparent and ethical culture by establishing a video copyright verification system that can be shared worldwide.</p><p>Within Banana Clips, content creator’s efforts will be paid at a fair price, the diverse values of the world will be brought together, and users will have a great collaborative experience.</p><p>CRISPY WHALES will work with AERGO to provide tools that will make it easy for content creators to exchange their creativity and have their work protected. We will collaborate together to create a world where the creator’s contents are respected.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-community-to-vote-on-awarding-second-incubation-investment-to-crispy-whales-be08520c8ea4">AERGO community to vote on awarding second incubation investment to CRISPY WHALES</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Meeco has been enabling organisations and people to collect, protect and exchange personal data since the <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Meeco manifesto </a>came to life in 2012. Since then, Meeco has been steadily growing in size and recognition.




 




2020 was an interesting year! Despite worldwide shutdowns and uncertainty, Meeco doubled in size in the last year, adding to our development team in Melbourne. Meeco also secured new partnerships in Europe along with the <a href="https://blog.meeco.me/fintech-australia-announces-meeco-as-a-finnies-2020-finalist/">Finnie 2020 award</a> in “Excellence in Industry Collaborations &amp; Partnerships” to prove it.




 




Now as we enter 2021, we’re keeping the momentum and thrilled to announce the expansion of our UX, Design and Testing team in Adelaide, Australia.




 




The new meeps will significantly bolster Meeco’s design chops, bringing more <a href="https://womeninidentity.org/">diversity</a> to the team and addressing the need for more women working on digital identity and personal data solutions. This new team is  Meeco’s Design/Digital hub, cementing Meeco’s commitment to delivering beautiful design and digital work made in-house.




 




The first task of the Meeco Design Team will be breathing some new life into its website and digital communication. The new meeps are excited to bring in their understanding of data collection, user interactions and how they can bring them together to create thoughtful design solutions. They add to Meeco’s belief that an holistic approach to designing processes is key to delivering unique and powerful memories for people.




 Our new office 





 




The team has taken residence in <a href="https://www.stoneandchalk.com.au/">Stone&amp;Chalk </a>Adelaide, keeping up with the tradition in Melbourne and Sydney. Stone&amp;Chalk  is located on Adelaide’s remarkable <a href="https://lotfourteen.com.au/">Lot Fourteen</a>.




 





<blockquote>With a $150 million investment from the Federal Government, the Adelaide City Deal builds on Adelaide’s global reputation in innovation, culture and the arts.<p></p>lotfourteen.com.au</blockquote>

  The French web was paralyzed after the fire that took place in a datacenter of OVH. For Cozy Cloud, despite 43 lost servers, no impact on the user side. We reveal why.

 <p>More than 3.6 million web servers representing 464,000 domain names went offline in a few minutes following the fire that broke out on Wednesday night, March 10, at our hosting company <a href="https://us.ovhcloud.com/">OVH</a>, including French government sites. Be assured: your Cozy domains were not affected by the fire and no data was lost.<br>
Our infrastructure withstood the fire despite the very rapid loss of 43 of our servers and in keeping with our strategy of transparency, we decided to detail you the impact of this incident on our business and how we were able to cope with it.</p>
 The French web paralyzed 
<p>The websites and services of more than 12,000 French companies that had chosen to have their data hosted by OVH were taken offline following the disaster.<br>
This is notably the case for :</p>
 
 the digital workspace (ENT) of the Île-de-France region 
 the Centre Pompidou 
 the data.gouv.fr website 
 the Simplified Procedures website 
 the CityScoot application 
 Coinhouse, a specialist in cryptocurrency transactions. 
 
<p>And the list of "burnt" machines is still long.</p>
<p>©SDIS 67</p>
 Why did your Cozy not be impacted by this fireplace? 
<p>At <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy Cloud</a>, our business is the protection of your data. Your data is hosted in geographically separated datacenters - Gravelines, Roubaix and Strasbourg, managed by OVH which guarantees for example that a "catastrophe" on one site will not affect the data hosted on the other sites. Each of your data is replicated 3 times in redundant systems, spread over several sites. Our infrastructures are also sized so that the loss of servers does not disturb the service.</p>
<p>Following this exceptional accident, 43 servers were destroyed out of a total of more than 200 and despite this, there was no noticeable impact on the service provided to our users, nor was any data lost.</p>
<p>©SDIS 67</p>
 What was our action plan? 
<p>First of all, nothing! The configuration and automation in place responded perfectly and isolated the affected components to maintain data and service despite everything.<br>
Then, as soon as we became aware of the fire shortly after midnight, our team established the following action plan:</p>
 
 Identify losses and prioritize actions to replace machines 
 Immediately order replacement machines from other OVH datacenters to restore redundancy and our scalability and performance capabilities 
 
 
 Re-installation of machines with priority given to restoring the redundancies most affected by the accident. Our configuration automation allowed us to perform these re-installations in only a few minutes per machine and thus minimize the time when our redundancy was reduced 
 
 
 4. Real-time communication to our various partners of the impact on their production and specific action plans 
 
<p>All of these actions performed by our team took place in less than 36 hours of intervention after the disaster was announced.</p>
 What is the total impact to you, the Cozy users? 
<p>This incident has not impacted the availability of your Cozy and its data. However, action is required on the part of Cozy Banks users to <a href="https://support.cozy.io/article/509-ma-banque-affiche-identifiantserrones-que-dois-je-faire">resume synchronization of their new bank data</a>.</p>
 "Keep calm: your data is safe" 
<p>Making data backups is essential today but it also requires technical skills. Our mission is to do it for you in order to facilitate your already complex digital life.</p>
<p>Testimony of an user who chose to save his data in a Cozy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had my laptop broken into and stolen. But thanks to Cozy, I didn't lose any data, and I have access to everything from my phone! I was able to print invoices partly recovered by the connectors, and other documents, from my Cozy on my phone. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I am very happy to be part of your users!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to all our users who have already chosen Cozy!</p>
 Support OVH 
<p>Faced with the challenges of digital sovereignty, and in order to keep our promise, we have always chosen to work with French and more European partners.<br>
The reason is simple: by interacting with them on a daily basis, we have control over our infrastructure and therefore your data. This makes it easier to act quickly and effectively in these extreme cases.<br>
We therefore reaffirm our confidence in OVH and give them all our support to overcome this ordeal.</p>
 Thanks to our team 
<p>We would like to thank all of the system administrators who have been able to work with us, since the beginning of the Cozy adventure, to set up an architecture that is sufficiently robust, redundant and resilient. It is because of their work that this incident has not impacted your data or access to your Cozy today.</p>

<p>The Fission team has had the pleasure of getting to know medical doctor and developer Abraham Samma. Abraham is based in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, where he practices medicine and develops software. His latest project is called Oneplaybook, and is built on TiddlyWiki.</p><p>We talked with Abraham about his work, digital note taking apps, TiddlyWiki, Oneplaybook and his thoughts about the future of all things privacy and security.</p> Q. When did you first Discover TiddlyWiki? <p></p><p>A. I discovered TiddlyWiki around 2016. I was looking around the web at the time for inspiration for my next web side project. I wanted to try to create a knowledge management system because, as a doctor and philomath, my primary concern was building and maintaining an organized personal knowledge base for the many things I learned over the years. However, I didn’t want to simply use someone else’s app. <br></p> Q. What is TiddyWiki in your own words? <p></p><p>A. Describing TiddlyWiki has become something of a mental exercise when introducing it to people outside of the TiddlyWiki community. It’s pretty hard because it is more than just another wiki application. For beginners, the succinct description of a “non-linear notetaking app” is usually sufficient to get them interested enough to have a look and try it out for themselves. The idea of creating free flowing linked thoughts is appealing because in many ways, that is how our minds usually work. We tend to meander in our thoughts, and at our own pace. It’s refreshing for many of us who can’t bear to fill diaries on a regular basis!</p><p>However, the moment beginners start to use TiddlyWiki and experience the many incredible features it has to offer like transclusion, metaprogramming and the ability to reproduce its own source code (making it a quine) and allowing it to save itself as a self-contained, decentralized single HTML file, they usually almost always experience a profound “aha” moment. All of these features aren’t really captured by the non-linear notebook description well enough. So I’d prefer calling it ‘a metaprogramable environment for your thoughts and knowledge’. Another apt high-level description I like to use is ‘like Excel, but in notebook form.’</p> Q. What do you use TiddlyWiki for personally? <p></p><p>A. I try to organize my life with TiddlyWiki as much as possible. I use it for brainstorming, creating shopping lists, noting down ideas, even saving web articles for offline saving that are too important to me to be put into another web article saving tool.</p><p>In some cases, I use TiddlyWiki’s built-in building blocks to create my own solutions. Other times I use a solution crafted by other TiddlyWiki users. I do all this not only for my own utility, but also to explore new ideas for plugins to fill in certain need gaps that may exist in TiddlyWiki.</p><p>I’m heavily invested in my notebook. So much so that it has become a living portrait of my life. I am sure advertisements networks would kill to have this kind of rich information about a single person. But they never will, and that’s the beauty of it! It’s all yours and no one else’s. Oh, it even has a built-in tool to encrypt your notes so there’s that!</p> Q. What have you built with TiddlyWiki? <p></p><p>A. I’ve built a number of plugins, including a Lean canvas manager that I’d like to revamp in the near future. I also created Maarfapad dot com which is a free community cloud service for hosting personal wikis. Now I am busy with the upcoming <a href="https://oneplaybook.app/">OnePlaybook</a> dot app service which will give users the ability to create and use wikis inside their preferred cloud service, like Google Drive or Dropbox. You could also deploy it onto a private server and use it completely offline.</p>From Oneplaybook.app<p>It’s been a work in progress since sometime last year. I came up with the basic concept in February and I’ve been refining the idea with a colleague of mine who is a software engineer.</p><p>We are testing it and seeing we can address some pain points for our future users. We’re staying customer focused on our side of things because we really want this thing to succeed. The pandemic is showing us different pain points that can be met with our product and with TiddlyWiki. For instance, Oneplaybook allows teams working remotely to work together asynchronously or in real time in a free and secure workspace.</p><p>People need to be empowered with their own agency and sovereignty again with these tools</p> Q. What are your favorite TiddlyWiki plugins? <p></p><p>A. Let me break it down into a list:</p>  For UI, I love the work that JD mobile is doing. I use his Whitespaces plugin that configures TiddlyWiki into a mobile friendly experience among other things.  Mohammed’s Kookma Todo list plugin is a very compact micro-app todo list maker for your wiki. Highly recommended  Noteself is an awesome edition of TiddlyWiki that creates a self-hosted wikis with your data being stored inside your browser. You can also sync it to a CouchDB server that you own  Projectify is a beautiful edition of TiddlyWiki reimagined as a project management tool with direct inspiration taken from basecamp by its author. Very nice that one.  Krystal plugin turns your wiki into Andy Matuschak’s notebook. If you don’t understand, Google this guy’s notes. It’s mind-blowing and he’s awesome!  <p>There are many more than I could go on about, but these are my absolute favorites. There is also a plugin that turns TiddlyWiki into a Roam Research lookalike called Stroll. This is a testament to the inventiveness of open source communities like ours. You never know what you might find tomorrow.</p> Q. What’s one thing that you wish TiddlyWiki did? <p></p><p>A. In terms of features, there’s not much it can’t do that’s essential. You can always create a plugin or macro to satisfy your needs. And more will come along, especially as the core developers work to make API easier to understand and work with in upcoming versions. More integrations with other external services for things like sharing and publishing would also be nice. But what I would like is more traction. And that’s somewhat more difficult to attain.</p><p>Although TiddlyWiki is already very popular as an open source software, with more than 5k stars on Github, it is still relatively unknown to many it’s meant to help. Its main ‘competitor’ in this space is Roam Research which tends to steal the show among academics, which is ok--we all have different tastes, but I feel people are missing out a lot. Particularly in terms of robustness; TiddlyWiki works fine no matter the browser you use or the state of your internet connection. You can’t say the same about most proprietary software-as-a-service apps.</p><p>And when it comes to knowledge management, you want that kind of robustness and versatility. TiddlyWiki is so much older than other similar apps today (more than seven years old now) and it has stayed very stable throughout that time. Backwards compatibility is keystone in the community. A TiddlyWIki from 2014 will work just as well and will be mostly compatible with a version from 2021. That kind of robustness is gold in an age of planned obsolescence and ‘move fast, break things’.</p> Q. What excites you about Fission and TiddlyWiki teaming up? <p></p><p>A. Whenever there is a new service integration for TiddlyWiki, there’s more to look forward to in terms of possibilities and opportunities. Hooking up TiddlyWiki to Fission allows for all kinds of interesting things IMO, such as web publishing, site creation, SaaS creation (difficult if you don’t employ a MERN or LAMP stack), things that might require domain experts or teams might now be possible for ordinary people from other fields of expertise to do.</p><p>The web should be open for creators from all walks of life, not just IT ninjas. I see this partnership as a step towards enabling that vision even more. We can imagine people learning only basic web skills creating B2B web services built with TiddlyWiki and hosted on decentralized infrastructure and improving their livelihood. It may feel like a stretch, but we must remember that all of the web today was once seen as a stretch too. It’s up to all of us to make it more mundane!</p> Q. What interests you about the future of web technology? <p></p><p>A. I’m really interested in decentralized web technologies--these are really good things and we need them more than ever. Last year we as a nation actually experienced for the first time some form of censorship during our elections. It was really unnerving for a lot of us. We couldn’t access Twitter...and evidence emerged online that Twitter was being locked on every level imaginable. They were blocking it wherever they could find it.</p><p>In fact, VPN became a meme of sorts because Tanzania was introduced to such a thing after this incident. It was really disorienting for people to need to think about this sort of thing. Some people even thought VPN was a magical potion to drink in order to access the internet.</p><p>The situation got me thinking about how vulnerable we are. Something needs to change on a fundamental level. We need to think about how we create stuff on the web and how we can be better protected.</p><p>This is a wakeup call of all of us over here. But, at least there is encouraging progress being made toward creating a lot of decentralized protocols. I hear that Mozilla and maybe Brave have taken up some of these protocols. So who knows? The future is bright. It’s encouraging.</p> <p>We here at Fission agree with Abraham--the future definitely looks bright! Especially with brilliant minds like Abraham's </p><p>If you’d like to be notified when Oneplaybook is ready, sign up for the waiting list at <a href="http://oneplaybook.app">oneplaybook.app</a>.

					 Meetup with Indicio to explore decentralized identity 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  As a public benefit corporation, Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized identity as a technology that will benefit everyone. To help people understand how this technology works, we are hosting Meetups once per month on a Wednesday, except holidays.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>We started in December last year, and this Wednesday the 24th will be our fourth get-together. I would like to briefly share with you some of the highlights from our past events. </p>
<p>Our first Meetup on December 23, 2020 saw Sam Curren (@TelegramSam) present an overview of decentralized identity, Lynn Bendixsen talk about the Hyperledger Indy Network community, and Daniel Bluhm (@dbluhm_) give an overview of Hyperledger Aries.</p>
<p>Our second Meetup in January, 2021 discussed our newly <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-tech-advances-decentralized-identity-with-release-of-critical-open-source-technology/">open-sourced mediator agent</a>, which makes it possible to communicate verifiable credentials to mobile devices via open source standards. Indicio’s Sam Curren (senior architect) &amp; Daniel Bluhm (software engineer) dived into the details. The recording (highly recommended!) is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXsELfUYrGM&amp;t=2s">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our February saw Mike Vesey, President of <a href="https://idramp.com/">IdRamp</a>, demonstrate how users of <a href="https://qiqochat.com/">QiqoChat</a> can take full control over their digital identity with a self-sovereign privacy-focused solution protected by state-of-the-art cryptographic blockchain security. Vesey showed just how easy it was to integrate verifiable credentials &nbsp;with various communication tools. You can watch the demonstration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94Wd9S66Is4">here</a>.</p>
<p>This Wednesday, the innovative app developers at <a href="http://global.id">GlobaliD </a>&nbsp;Alexis Falquier and Dev Bharel will show a brief video demonstration of their interoperable wallet connecting with, receiving a credential from, and verifying the credential with an agent on Trinsic’s studio. Sign up <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/276745615/">here</a>! </p>

					  Gleich sechs Business Angels beteiligen sich mit einer Pre-Seed-Finanzierung in sechsstelliger Höhe an der comuny GmbH aus Weinheim. Bereits im Dezember konnte der Pitch des Startups beim Online-Matching der Business Angels FrankfurtRheinMain (BA FRM) überzeugen. Neben Mitgliedern aus dem Frankfurter Investorennetzwerk wurde ein weiterer Business Angel aus dem Kölner Raum gewonnen. <p>Benutzername plus Passwort? Nicht mehr sicher genug. Unternehmen unterziehen ihre Kunden immer stärkeren Sicherheitsüberprüfungen, wenn sich diese an digitalen Services anmelden. Doch die Organisation sicherheitsrelevanter Nutzerdaten und Passwörter ist für Unternehmen anspruchsvoll, technisch aufwändig und teuer. Zudem unkomfortabel für den Kunden: Trotz Kundenkonto braucht er oft zusätzlich eine App oder zeitraubende Hilfsmittel wie Smartcards.</p><p>Dabei liegt die Lösung auf der Hand: Zum einen setzen sich mobile Endgeräte aktuell immer klarer als favorisierter Zugriffspunkt vieler Nutzer durch. Zum anderen benutzen Prüfverfahren Gerätefunktionen wie Kamera, Fingerprint, TAN-Apps oder schicken Codes via SMS. Wer dieses Nebeneinander verzahnt, generiert entscheidende Vorteile.</p><p>Hier unterstützt comuny über eine schlanke B2B-Komponente und etabliert sich als Spezialist für die einfache und sichere Realisierung von Registrierungs- und Login-Prozessen für Apps über mobile Endgeräte.</p><p>So können Unternehmen erstmals persönliche Daten des Kunden für verschiedene ihrer IT-Systeme effizienter, nämlich unter Einbeziehung des Mobilgeräts organisieren. Denn einmal verifizierte Daten des Kunden können auf dem Gerät verwahrt und anschließend für sicheren Zugriff bei Anmeldung sogar auf neue Dienste weiterverwendet werden.</p><p>Steffen Seifarth, einer der Investoren von comuny, erfahrener Business Angel und bekannt für kritisch-konstruktive Prüfung von Teams und Geschäftsmodellen bekräftigt: „Uns hat von Anfang an der konsequente WIN-WIN-WIN Gedanke von comuny imponiert, bei dem Nutzer, Unternehmen sowie die eingebundenen Dienstleister von einer sicheren, schlanken und gleichzeitig hochflexiblen Datennutzung profitieren.“</p><p>Und Nikolaus D. Bayer, preisgekrönter Business Angel des Jahres 2020 formuliert für alle Investoren von comuny: „Wir freuen uns darauf, das Team von comuny in den kommenden Wachstumsphasen zu begleiten und bei der Applizierung der Technologie auf weitere Branchen und Use-Cases zu unterstützen.“</p><p><a href="https://www.comuny.de/presse/">Vollständige Pressemitteilung vom 22.03.21 lesen</a></p><p>#startups #businessangelfrankfurt #verifizierung #authentifizierung #operator #trinity</p>

There are many reasons; from parts of the regulation that focused or constrained its use into the public sphere only, to the lack of total coverage across all of the EU. Likely the key missing piece was that the cultural climate was not yet ripe and the state of digital identity was really not ready. Too many technical problems were yet to be solved. Without these elements the realized state of eIDAS should not be unexpected.

<p>(originally sent on Sep 30. <a href="http://eepurl.com/coMMKT">Subscribe to our newsletter now</a>)</p><p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>I have a couple of follow-ups to Bitmark’s recent milestones mentioned in past newsletters.<br> <br> Last week, our team received the Cohack award for Autonomy, our public health app. Taiwan president 蔡英文 Tsai Ing-wen presented CEO Sean with the award, which upon seeing up-close photos of, I’m quite envious. <br> <br> See Sean at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1307962865777651714">:15 from this tweet</a> from the President.<br> <br> We also officially announced our collaboration with UC Berkeley and its school of public health via this <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uc-berkeley-and-bitmark-launch-autonomy-app-as-part-of-the-schools-covid-19-safe-campus-initiative-301134438.html">press release</a>. We’re excited to transition Autonomy to the entire city of Berkeley on September 30th. It’s completely free and users control the full rights to their data.<br> <br> If you know anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area, please have them try it out here: <a href="https://autonomy-pwa.bitmark.com/">https://autonomy-pwa.bitmark.com</a>. We’ve had some encouraging talks with other public health departments around the United States, and I hope we can be of&nbsp;help.</p><p><a href="https://autonomy-pwa.bitmark.com">Try Autonomy&nbsp;Now</a></p><p>I only have one link to share this month, so I’ll get to that first before going deeper into my current frame of mind. There is an irony that in many places, such as New York City, a tenant cannot install cameras (ex. doorbell cameras) to preserve everyone else’s privacy. Yet…landlords can.</p><p>There are few laws and regulations governing the collection and use of data in the context of Landlord Tech. Because it is generally sold to landlords and property managers, not tenants, Landlord Tech is often installed without notifying or discussing potential harms with tenants and community members. These harms include the possibility that sensitive and personal data can be handed over to the police, ICE, or other law enforcement and government agencies. Landlord Tech can also be used to automate evictions, racial profiling, and tenant harassment. In addition, Landlord Tech is used to abet real estate speculation and gentrification, making buildings more desirable to whiter and wealthier tenants, while feeding real estate and tech companies with property — be that data or real estate. Landlord Tech tracking platforms have increasingly been marketed to landlords as solutions to Covid-19, leading to new forms of residential surveillance.<br> <br> <a href="https://antievictionmappingproject.github.io/landlordtech/">https://antievictionmappingproject.github.io/landlordtech/</a></p><p>This got me thinking about the theme of today’s newsletter, how do we trust in the current age? A big part of why we built Autonomy during COVID-19 was that we heard how communities needed a way to trust, yet verify what they were being told. In an age of mass distributed disinformation, extreme politicking, and cancel culture, it’s hard to figure out if anything is real.<br> <br> For Bitmark, we like to believe that we can be a great partner because we are trustworthy, but how does one prove that? You really can’t. From the company’s inception, we needed to be able to create a digital rights standard. We felt we had to be effectively neutral without any ability to hold market power over stakeholders. Thus, we implemented blockchain in our infrastructure and open-source to let others verify what we were doing and be able to improve our work if we ever slacked behind. Using a decentralized platform ensured it would be extremely difficult for us to abuse our power (it would have been nice if we could say that about the Facebooks and Apples of the world right now).<br> <br> That said, you’d have to be pretty hardcore to go validate these things yourself. Unless there’s a lot of money in it or value in seeing Bitmark fail, not many people will be incentivized to investigate what Bitmark is doing.<br> <br> Perhaps the best we can do is signal our integrity and build relationships with you. When you have a chance to choose Bitmark to help you control the rights to a digital resource, we hope you feel comfortable doing so. One attempt is through this newsletter. Another is our new initiative to share Sean’s past reflections to our investors, which you can find here: <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/tagged/ceo-observation">https://medium.com/clean-titles/tagged/ceo-observation</a><br> <br> Sean writes these notes as part of his quarterly update to our investors. They’re often a bit raw, but they’re always an honest reflection of how he sees Bitmark’s role in the world at that time. Of course, if we go back, we might cringe at how naive we were, but that’s just part of the learning process.<br> <br> Moving forward, we’re going to share these with you, unedited, one quarter behind — you’ll see Q2’s notes in Q3. I’ve never seen another company do this, and I’m always fascinated by Sean’s viewpoint. I hope you can gain something from them too.<br> <br> I appreciate your continued support. If you enjoy this newsletter or our work, please help us by sharing it with a friend.

			  Xavi Aznal Prieto is Product Owner at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Xavi Aznal Prieto. I was born and still live with my wife and kids in the Barcelona area (Spain). I have a degree in Telecommunications Engineering and a masters in Computer Vision. Since I was a child I have always had an interest in knowing ‘how machines work’. I had the opportunity to have my own computer since I was 10 years old (8 bits CPU and 128KB RAM at that time), so I would say I am a vocational engineer. During my professional career I have developed several tech related roles, from big companies to startups. I have coded a lot, defined tech strategy and managed projects and teams. In particular, I have been involved in startup projects during the past 12 years, an environment that I feel very stimulating as I like new challenges and not getting bored 🙂</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I previously worked with our CCO Daniel Coheur in a startup project where I recruited and managed a tech development team in Barcelona. Tokeny had the idea of setting up a development team in Barcelona, so Daniel contacted me, we started discussing with Luc, our CEO, and I was quickly convinced by the potential of the business vision. I started with Tokeny by taking a Product Owner role and also with the goal of recruiting and managing Barcelona development office. Now we are seven people in Barcelona, and we will hopefully keep growing!</p>
 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I feel very comfortable being part of Tokeny’s team. People are very skilled and communication is fairly fluid in all directions. Because of last year’s situation, we have become very familiar with a fully remote working environment and our adaption has been excellent, which speaks volumes about the quality of the team.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I love to be outdoors and breathe some fresh air. I have been into endurance sports for many years, having finished some marathons, Ultra Trails and Iron Man triathlons. Now I do not train so hard but a good run across the countryside still charges my batteries.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>If all my beloved ones, wife and kids, stay healthy I have more than enough to be happy 🙂</p>
  
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I would say that every person in the world could have their basic needs covered: food, roof and health access. A utopia? I would like to think it’s not.</p>

 An Interview with the Hope in Crisis Podcast — Rights, Democracy and Technology <p>(originally sent on Nov 30. <a href="http://eepurl.com/coMMKT">Subscribe to our newsletter now</a>)</p><p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>It’s been a stressful few weeks to start November for the United States. First, the election, to which some claim is not over. Then, the rampaging COVID outbreak, to which some act as if public health <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/ted-cruz-sherrod-brown-dan-sullivan-mask-dispute/index.html">is not a big&nbsp;deal</a>.</p><p>I won’t say&nbsp;more.</p><p>Instead, I’d like to highlight our team’s recent work on the Hope in Crisis Podcast, a collaboration with Girls in Tech, a global non-profit organization focused on the engagement, education, and empowerment of women in technology.</p><p>Subscribe via — <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/tw/podcast/hope-in-crisis-rights-democracy-and-technology/id1533202834?l=en">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://player.soundon.fm/p/32c913b0-ec47-43d3-8e39-93e0d275d449">SoundOn</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3nJAypzF1mzVPL8YS0gn0g">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://castbox.fm/channel/Hope-in-Crisis-%7C-Rights%2C-Democracy-and-Technology-id3334893?country=us">Castbox</a>, <a href="https://podcast.kkbox.com/channel/OtMhkYujCgGRQRBKiB">KKbox</a>, <a href="https://radiopublic.com/hope-in-crisis-rights-democracy-G77XZk/episodes">Radio Public</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsASHCOua_3Qdy1M9QEabJg">YouTube</a>.</p><p>You can check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51GkA4RGE">the newest episode</a>, a talk with Quartz Reporter Mary Hui on Hong Kong’s cultural revolution 2.0, the free press, and the role of big tech in the region’s future. It features Bitmark CEO Sean and Girls in Tech’s Renee Yeh contrasting their experiences with technology, rights, and democracy in the east and the west. You can also find our audio podcast links in the video description of the link&nbsp;above.</p><p>I’ve asked some questions from our two hosts and producer Vivian&nbsp;Chen:</p><p>Who is this podcast for and what should they expect from&nbsp;it?</p><p>Vivian: This podcast is for those who care about rights and democracy and are wondering how we can improve&nbsp;it.</p><p>What’s been the most interesting learning you’ve had so&nbsp;far?</p><p>Sean: The most interesting learning I’ve had was with the National Taiwan Treasure project on the Hsiao A episode. It was surprising to me that it has had no impact on Taiwanese People. Finding out how this single bad decision has been affecting Taiwan as a country should have been a constitutional moment, but I was shocked that Taiwnese people didn’t care as much as I expected. In the United States in 2013, when Edward Snowden leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency, U.S. citizens thought of him as a traitor. After thinking deeper into the incident, people realized that what the government was doing was actually anti-democracy. But it seemed that people don’t really know what or how to change anymore, since these problems are so deeply rooted in our culture and governance.</p><p>I think that podcasts are, for now, the most important media to share information and educate the public. They can be independent without censorship and time limitations. During each episode’s discussions, we get to go as deep as we want. It’s unlike the current media, which is under the attention economy — eager for fast and short content. I feel privileged to talk with Renee and share things we care about, and getting people to start thinking about them. It’s basically pirate&nbsp;radio!</p><p>Renee: I enjoy communication and public speaking, and I would say that audience response is what drives me to share more. Podcasting is very different. It is like sailing in the dark for me. Producing each episode is like piloting Endurance (sorry for being an Interstellar nerd) into the unknown, and testifying to the truth, the cosmic truth — “Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and&nbsp;space.”</p><p>In each episode, we project love. Love for the world, love for each other, love for a better future. We are not sure when or where such love will be perceived, but we keep projecting.</p><p>Vivian: At the beginning of this podcast program, I imagined that our show would be purely rational. Talking about technologies for good and how technology could be the engine of growth in modern crises, Covid-19 especially. After episodes of discussion, I realized our program can be more than that. We started to cover all different elements that form our society, problems that lead to crises and tools people use to get through the crises. I was amazed by the complexity of the world and hope to discover more in our future episodes.</p><p>With everything going on in the world, which crisis should we most have hope for and&nbsp;why?</p><p>Sean: Covid-19 of course! This crisis brings forward the importance of health, and it activates science. For example, traditionally, it would take around 10 years to fully develop a vaccine. But due to Covid-19, the U.S. government was encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to innovate by simplifying and amplifying the process of development, and the government is willing to take the risk of failing by covering the money lost in failure. This is what the government should do — protect people’s civil liberties, unlock innovation and make it safe to&nbsp;fail.</p><p>Renee: Democracy. I think democracy is a value but we humans have little knowledge about how to realize this value through political means. Democracy as a political system may be failing, or struggling — to put it in a more hopeful way — but it only suggests that human civilization needs optimization. I hope people will join me in defending mutual&nbsp;respect.</p><p>Is there a dream guest you’d like one&nbsp;day?</p><p>Sean: Edward Snowden — In a more radical sense — we should get to a place where we don’t need government. Tools should be engineered so that people have control of their rights and with more fairness and justice in society. Edward Snowden is best at articulating what’s wrong with democratic government.</p><p>Lex Fridman — I like his way of thinking. Not only in terms of AI and technology. I think he has some really deep thoughts on love, happiness and society. He is a rising star in the podcast world right&nbsp;now.</p><p>Renee: Joseph Gordon-Levitt! Duh, do you really need a reason to talk to&nbsp;him?</p><p>How can listeners help?</p><p>Vivian:</p>  Subscribe: Subscribe to Hope in Crisis! We are available everywhere.  Interact: Leave us comments and give us 5 stars — we would love for more people to find our&nbsp;podcast!  Follow: Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/HopeInCrisis">Twitter </a>and<a href="https://www.instagram.com/hope_in_crisis_podcast/"> Instagram</a> for our&nbsp;updates  Share: Recommend the podcast to your friends, colleagues and&nbsp;family!  Suggest: Do not hesitate to give us any suggestions!

<p>by Shannon Appelcline.</p><p>As the Bitmark blockchain becomes more popular for NFTs, health data, music royalties and other types of digital property, we are frequently asked about the energy impact of the Bitmark blockchain and of blockchains in&nbsp;general.</p> Energy &amp; The Blockchain <p>The energy usage of blockchains has been in the news a lot lately. What’s that&nbsp;about?</p><p>Q: Why do Blockchains Use&nbsp;Energy?</p><p>A: The most widely used methodology for securing blockchains is the “proof-of-work” algorithm, which is at the heart of Bitcoin, as well as the Bitmark blockchain.This means that you have to do work in the form of extensive cryptographic calculations order to add a block of transactions to the blockchain. Since each block requires time and computational power, the blockchain grows more and more secure the more blocks are piled on top of each other, because it becomes increasingly difficult to go back and redo all those calculations.</p><p>Computers running calculations draw&nbsp;power.</p><p>Q: How Much Power is&nbsp;Needed?</p><p>A: The power needed to secure a blockchain is related to the total computational power working on a blockchain. The more computers that are trying to create blocks for the blockchain, the more power that’s required. That means that a very popular blockchain like Bitcoin has high energy requirements, while one focused on a much smaller area of expertise, like Bitmark, has a smaller power requirement.</p><p>That means that the power requirement of a blockchain can be directly measured by its computational power. That measurement is usually recorded as a “hashrate”: the number of hashes that can be made in a second by computers working on the blockchain, where a hash is the main cryptographic function used to make blocks and thus secure the blockchain.</p> Energy &amp;&nbsp;Bitmark <p>Like many other blockchains, Bitmark uses a proof-of-work algorithm, which means that it uses energy to secure its blocks. How much and how does that compare to other energy&nbsp;uses?</p><p>Q: What is the Hashrate of the Bitmark&nbsp;Network?</p><p>A: The Bitmark Network runs at about <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitmark/hashrate-chart">160 TH/s</a> and remains rock solid at that level. That’s terahashes per Second, or trillion hashes per second. In other words: 160,000,000,000,000 hashes per&nbsp;second.</p><p>In comparison, the Bitcoin Network’s hash rate has been rapidly escalating since 2017 and is currently running a bit under <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-hashrate.html">160 EX/s</a>, which is 160 exahashes or quintillion hashes per second, which is to say: 160,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per&nbsp;second.</p><p>The hashrate of the Bitcoin Network is literally a million times that of the Bitmark&nbsp;network.</p><p>Q: How Much Energy Does That Mean Bitmark&nbsp;uses?</p><p>A: We can measure energy usage by looking at the power costs of the mining rigs that secure blocks on blockchains. A relatively modern rig, the <a href="https://shop.bitmain.com/promote/antminer_s17pro/specification">Antminer S17 Pro</a>, uses 39.5 joules per terahash, which is the same as&nbsp;.011 Wh, or&nbsp;.000011 KWh, for a trillion&nbsp;hashes.</p><p>If Bitmark were run entirely on Antminer S17 Pros, in year it would use&nbsp;.000011 KWh/TH * 160 terahashes per second * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 365 days, which is 55,500 KwH or 55.5 MwH. That’s probably a lower boundary, as average energy usage is likely to be less efficient.</p><p>Q: How Does that Compare to&nbsp;Bitcoin?</p><p>In comparison, a variety of reports state Bitcoin energy usage currently runs 80 to 120 TwH, which is 80,000,000 MwH to 120,000,000 MwH.</p><p>That’s unsurprisingly the same one to a million comparison that we saw in hashrates between the networks: Bitmark’s energy usage is likely one one-millionth of Bitcoin’s.</p><p>Q: How Does that Compare to Centralized Financial Systems?</p><p>A: It’s very hard to compare a blockchain with centralized financial systems because the power costs of blockchains are quite transparent while those of centralized systems are full of hidden subsidies.</p><p>However, we can produce a quick thumbnail to reveal the scope of the cost of those centralized systems. Considering the financial sector as a whole, there are 9 million financial employees in the US, another 5 million or so in Europe, and even more in Asia, Australia, South America, and Africa, bringing the number to many tens of millions. They have a whole infrastructure of buildings, vehicles, computers, credit card machines, and stock markets underlying them. That energy cost is obviously astronomical.</p><p>Many of those employees work in skyscrapers, which allows for a more precise comparison: in New York City, a fairly average skyscraper <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90181905/a-block-by-block-look-at-the-energy-consumption-of-new-yorks-buildings">can use 40 MwH of energy a year</a>, which means that 1.5 skyscrapers would balance out Bitmark’s energy usage. However, the workers in the US centralized financial industry alone could fill 750 skyscrapers! That’s 500x more energy usage than Bitmark’s blockchain, just for the offices of those US&nbsp;workers.</p><p>So, even with all those hidden subsidies, it’s pretty easy to say that Bitmark at least uses a bare fraction of even the US financial market’s office&nbsp;energy.</p><p>For a more extensive look at the costs of the financial industry as a whole, please see our article, “Bitcoin: What are the Real&nbsp;Costs?”</p><p>Q: How Does that Compare to Other Property Blockchains?</p><p>A: Bitmark is specialized in digital property. We’ve worked to create <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/digital-property-rights-with-bitmark-nfts-evolving-the-artists-reserved-rights-transfer-and-sale-509ffd1f990a">the best combination of software technology with property law</a>. Fundamentally, there aren’t any other major blockchains with that focus. The closest is Ethereum, which has created some standards for tokens to support property. However, what they’ve created is ultimately an add-on to an existing system, so unsurprisingly their implementation is <a href="https://docs.bitmark.com/meta/bitmark-eth-comparison">less efficient</a>.</p> Energy &amp;&nbsp;Miners <p>It’s ultimately the miners who create (and secure) blocks that use the energy in a blockchain, thus examining them can tell us a bit more about energy&nbsp;costs.</p><p>Q: Where Are Miners&nbsp;Located?</p><p>A: Blockchain networks are decentralized, so they can be anywhere in the world. The University of Cambridge maintains <a href="https://cbeci.org/mining_map">a map</a> that suggests that the US, China, and Russia are the biggest homes of Bitcoin miners. (Other sources say that China may have more than 50% of&nbsp;mining.)</p><p>The more general answer is that miners tend to be located where energy is cheap, and that also tends to mean where energy is cheap because it isn’t being used. A lot of the Bitcoin mining in China thus uses hydroelectric power that was built up but was not used or is underutilized. In fact, Chinese cities have been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chinese-city-known-for-bitcoin-mining-seeks-blockchain-firms-to-burn-excess-hydropower">seeking Bitcoin miners</a> because they literally have billions of KwH of power going to&nbsp;waste.</p><p>More importantly, Bitcoin energy usage is very green. The best report on the topic puts <a href="https://coinshares.com/assets/resources/Research/bitcoin-mining-network-june-2019-fidelity-foreword.pdf">renewable energy usage at&nbsp;74.1%</a>.</p><p>Bitmark mining demographics are likely to closely follow Bitcoin demographics.</p><p>Q: How Distributed Are&nbsp;Miners?</p><p>A: Distribution is pretty much the heart of any blockchain.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/pools/">number of mining pools</a> each mine between 10–20% of all blocks. There is certainly some centralization here, though a mining pool doesn’t require all the mining rigs to be in the same&nbsp;place.</p><p>For energy usage considerations, the most relevant fact here is this: miners distribute themselves to where the cheap energy is, and that often means clean energy and unused energy. Miners do not tend to cluster in locations with existing high energy costs, which would suggest high usage, because it’s just not economical to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>For a carefully footnoted look at the overall problems with the framing of blockchain energy arguments, especially in relationship to Bitcoin, see our article, “<a href="https://medium.com/p/ba830d6df104">Bitcoin: What are the Real&nbsp;Costs?</a>”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/bitmark-blockchain-energy-usage-q-a-aeda13537228">Bitmark Blockchain: Energy Usage Q&amp;A</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles">Bitmark’s Official Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Crypto News Flash: Swiss blockchain company, Jelurida, has announced a deeper strategic collaboration with Simplex, the market-leading fiat infrastructure for crypto onramps. Users can now buy these blockchain’s native currencies through Simplex’s platform. Partnerships like these make it much easier for users to access a huge range of cryptocurrencies via fiat money.</p>

<p>This partnership between Simplex and Jelurida<a href="https://www.jelurida.com/">&nbsp;</a>confirms the mainstream appeal of cryptocurrencies. Users can now purchase NXT the native currency of the iconic first pure proof of stake blockchain Nxt and IGNIS the currency of the Ignis permissionless child chain of the Ardor multi-chain platform, through Jelurida’s website or Simplex’s partner network. As Jelurida agreed with Simplex to offer the same exposure to these currencies as the company does to Ardor and ARDR, an important milestone has been reached. Strengthening this partnership confirms that Jelurida wants to encourage new implementations through the Nxt, Ardor, and Ignis blockchains.</p>

<p>ZyCrypto:&nbsp;Jelurida, the company behind NXT, Ignis, and Ardor blockchains, has opened up the NXT coin market through its strategic partnership with Simplex. Notably, the dual has announced that anyone can now purchase NXT coins using the vast Simplex payment ecosystem.</p>

<p>The partnership is expected to channel more crypto enthusiasts to trade NXT coins. The huge demand combined with limited supply is set to work in favor of the NXT market price in the near future.&nbsp;“We’re excited to work with Jelurida to support the growing demand of seamless, worldwide access to cryptocurrencies, and to continue enabling our secure onramp solution for anyone, anywhere”, said Ari Last, VP of Business Development at Simplex.</p>

<p>Notably, anyone registered on the Simplex system can purchase NXT coins through methods like PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, SWIFT, Apple Pay, SEPA, and many more.</p>

<p>The March 2021 edition of Fission's monthly Demo Day covered updates and demos from Fission, an overview of how we use IPFS, and demos from TiddlyWiki and IndyWiki.</p> How does Fission use IPFS? <p>We covered a brief intro to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as part of our demo day. We had a lot of interest in our recent <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/ipfs-local-offline-collaboration-sig/">presentation to the IPFS Local Offline Collab group</a>, and so decided to talk a bit more about how we use IPFS and why it's important to us.</p> User Domains and Public File Sharing Link Types <p>Every Fission user account has a custom domain at <code>USERNAME.fission.name</code>. For files that are stored in a user's public folder, they can access them using a consistent link using their own subdomain.</p><p>Brian from our team gave a demo and explanation of the different types of links that are available, as well as a small piece of example code showing how this works.</p><p>Visit the <a href="https://benevolent-senior-pink-yeti.fission.app/">benevolent-senior-pink-yeti </a>to get all the links to sample code and to experiment with the live demo yourself.</p> Linking Fission Accounts on Desktop <p>People can link accounts between browsers and devices today. Developers use the command line interface (CLI) use developer-only accounts that can't currently link to the web. Our CTO Brooklyn gave a preview of how CLI linking will work.</p><p>When this is released, it also opens the door for desktop-based file syncing and many other features, so we're excited to have this close to release.</p> Community Demos <p>Below is the full video for March 2021 Demo Day. Unfortunately, because we had an accident with recording, we managed to not capture a big chunk of the middle of the demos. In particular, Jeremy's TiddlyWiki static file publishing demo!</p><p>Join us this week, <a href="https://lu.ma/5j50g810">Wednesday, March 24th, for a TiddlyWiki Community Chat</a>, where we'll showcase current features and progress of <a href="https://tiddlywiki.fission.app">TiddlyWiki on Fission</a>.</p><p>Gyuri, who can follow online as <a href="https://twitter.com/Trailmarks">@TrailMarks on Twitter</a>, gave us a brief demo and overview of <a href="https://indywiki.fission.app/">IndyWiki</a>.</p><p>The full slide deck is <a href="https://presentations.fission.app/demodays/2021-03-18-fission-demoday.pdf">available here as a PDF »</a></p><p>Thanks to everyone for coming, including brief reports from Neil and Jim on what they're working on at the moment!</p> <p>We do weekly tech talks most Thursdays, as well as our monthly Demo Days. <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">Sign up to get invited to future events »</a></p>

 Transcription: 
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Okay. We are live. Thank you, Adrian, for doing this with me today.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Hello, Mathieu – it’s a pleasure!</p>
 INTRO 
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Adrian – would you mind just giving a brief introduction and speak about how you got into self-sovereign identity?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yeah, sure. I’m Adrian. I’m 27, and I’m originally from Germany.</p>
<p>I have a technical background and a business degree, but I first heard about self-sovereign identity as an intern at HTC Exodus in Taiwan, where I did my internship. While I was there, I met Phil Chen, who told me about the emerging concepts of self-sovereign identity and surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by both topics, and then, roughly two years ago, I specialized more deeply on the subject of self-sovereign identity. Since then, quite a lot has happened. I converted my YouTube channel (my personal educational platform) from a rather crypto-wallet-focused track to focusing solely on the topic of self-sovereign identity. That’s how the <a href="https://twitter.com/SSI_Ambassador">SSI Ambassador channel</a> was born, more or less. Now, I’m also doing public relations and taking the lead on communication topics at <a href="https://idunion.org/">ID union</a>. I’m also involved in marketing and sales at Lissi.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Awesome. The topic of surveillance capitalism is one reason why many of the folks in our communities got into decentralized technologies, whether it’s crypto-wallets or even simply decentralized identity. When you first got into the SSI space, did you spend time on specific projects before getting into Lissi and ID union? I believe you also spent some time at Sovrin. Is that true?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yeah, that’s correct. Back then, it was probably the easiest way to get your hands dirty on the topic. I joined the ‘Business of SSI’ working group at Sovrin, and I was fascinated with all the different developments going on. I very much felt included by the Sovrin community. It was a fantastic starting point to get familiar with all the topics and to take a role contributing to some papers and other activities.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: While you were doing that, were you part of the Main Incubator at that time? Does that cross a similar timeline?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: No. Back then, the Main Incubator was already researching the topic, but they were not necessarily speaking publicly about it. That was when I was still working in Taiwan, so I didn’t actually know that the Main Incubator team was engaged in their research at that time.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Got it. When you got into the Main Incubator, was it more from a blockchain or crypto standpoint?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: They approached me directly on the topic of SSI. I’d like to say a couple of words about the Main Incubator here. Essentially, the Main Incubator GmbH is the Research and Development unit of Commerzbank. We are a 100% subsidiary. We do venture capital for small companies in the finance sector that could be integrated into Commerzbank. We also do prototyping, which encompasses the work at Lissi and the whole topic of decentralized identity. There are community activities, such as our “Quantum Circle” or “Between the Towers.” We look into a lot of different topics. The whole issue of digital identity was one topic that was explored roughly three to four years ago. The ongoing developments were introduced and reviewed at the blockchain summit at Deutsche Bahn, which is the largest German railway company.</p>
<p>Obviously, I was super interested and immediately booked my ticket to go to Frankfurt and listen. Then, I wrote an article about Lissi without being a part of the team because I was just interested in the topic as part of the work I did as SSI Ambassador. The conversation continued, and at one point, we decided it would make sense to collaborate and push the topic forward together.</p>
 LISSI 
<p>Mathieu Glaude: That’s great. For folks that aren’t familiar with Lissi, <a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a> is an output of the Main Incubator. Do you mind just explaining a little more about what Lissi is?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: At Main Incubator, we took a more in-depth look into how to jumpstart the whole topic of self-sovereign identity. We decided to take a look first at what frameworks exist. Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries, which we currently build on, is just one example out of many. Back then, there were several other different frameworks out there, such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> or <a href="https://erc725alliance.org/">ERC 725</a>, which nobody is talking about at the moment. They had done the research and a deep dive on that. Then they reached out to collaborate with players who had selected the same technological frameworks. Since we have the same research approach and the same topic we need experience in, why not collaborate?</p>
<p>On the subject of digital identity, it makes sense to step out of your own silo and actually approach other players. There were some big-name players who were active in the field at that time, such as the Federal Printing Office of Germany (the Bundesdruckerei) and Bosch, and esatus AG, and other players. That’s how the first research initiative was jumpstarted. We were looking for a name, and we chose the acronym “Let’s Initiate Self-Sovereign Identity” — in short, LISSI. So that’s how Lissi was born.</p>
<p>In a stroke of luck, the innovation competition of the German government came up at the same time. The competition is called “Showcase Programme for Secure Digital Identities” or “Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten” in German. Basically, the government said, “Hey, we have a problem.” Or rather, we need <a href="https://northernblock.io/">a solution for digital identities</a>, which works with international standards, is interoperable, and which will enable people to control their own identity without being exposed to all the surveillance going on.</p>
<p>We applied to the competition with our concepts, and we said, “Lissi is more a software project, where we actually developed software together. We need an ecosystem that Lissi can live within.” And this ecosystem enables Lissi to then build on it. The ecosystem we applied to was IDunion.</p>
<p>We were part of the first phase of the innovation competition. Now, we’ve applied for a second phase, and we hope that everything goes smoothly so that we can begin in three weeks, which is April 2021. With the second phase, we would be able to start for free with a full year of funding, with 30 players from the public and private sector in IDunion.</p>
<p>So things have moved pretty fast and gotten pretty big. We’re really looking forward to that. It’s amazing what’s going on right now.</p>
 INTERNATIONALIZATION CHALLENGES 
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Yeah. I had Andre from esatus AG on the podcast a couple of episodes ago. Honestly, from my perspective here in Canada looking at what’s happening within the German ecosystem overall, it’s incredible to see the traction coming from both the private sector and the public sector in Germany. In particular, I’m looking at the investment that is going into strong digital identities and decentralized identities.</p>
<p>I’ll get back to IDunion in a minute, but I wanted to touch on one of the things you hadn’t mentioned within Lissi. One of the objectives of Lissi is all-around usability, right? When we talk about the internationalization of <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">SSI digital wallets</a>, I’d like to hear from someone who has spent more time thinking about the challenge of internationalization. It’s one thing to simply label your wallet and the buttons in the wallet and different static content in the wallet, all in a specific language. Lissi supports 12 languages, which is incredible. But, how do you look at internationalization beyond just flipping content?</p>
<p>It seems that content is one issue. But, when you actually get down into exchanging credentials in the different protocols, you need to deal with credential schemas, attributes, and much more. What are your thoughts on drilling internationalization all the way down to these levels?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Okay. First, I want to give more context around the products we have or the solutions we offer at Lissi. We have one product, the Lissi wallet for end-consumers, which they can use on their smartphone as an app to store digital credentials and to interact with third parties. The other software we offer is for big institutions, so it’s an on-premise solution. It can be hosted in their own environment in order to establish connections, send credentials, or ask for them. Concerning the internationalization of all the products, it’s obviously not easy when talking about digital identity because it highly depends on the context at hand. As an example, we are familiar with green buttons on a touch-screen. Green is associated with something that works or that is supposed to “go.” On the other hand, red signals danger or “stop.” However, that’s all solely from a western perspective, which can be completely different for other cultures. This is just one out of many examples.</p>
<p>Colour is one example, and this continues with the use of gender in text, left-to-right or right-to-left writing direction. We face other issues around the information density of languages, the use of tenses, and so on. By translating our wallet into 12 different languages, we’ve already faced a number of these challenges.</p>
<p>We’re presently engaged in discussion with the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, or DIF. Periodically, we have a product manager call, which I’m one of two to co-organize. In the calls, we discuss all these different challenges that we face as product managers. Specifically, we talk about how do we design the user experience? How can we make sure that the information lives within the credential so that the attributes are fully understandable in other contexts and other languages, as well?</p>
<p>For another example, I could get a good grade at university, marked as a “One,” which is the best grade in Germany. But then, maybe we go to a whole different country, with a different grading system. Nobody there actually knows what “One” means. In other regions, maybe letters are used instead. We know that this is information that needs to be transmittable, and the semantics need to be understandable from one context to another. We see that there are many challenges with that, but I think they are solvable challenges, now that we have the foundation to build on, and we’re able to go deeper into details.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Got it. A lot of the contextualization you’re talking about has to do with UX flows, in general, to be supported not only by different languages but also by different cultures.</p>
<p>Here in Canada, we have two national languages: English and French, and we see some similar challenges. However, when we take a step back to a broader view, beyond talking about specific cultures, I do understand that in terms of contextualization, there’s a lot more that goes into it. At the Decentralized Identity Foundation, you’re focused on UX flows.</p>
<p>Do you give similar considerations to other issues, such as creating backup mechanisms or similar requirements? Would you mind talking a little more about the work that’s going on there?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: It’s funny that you mentioned the backup mechanism because that’s exactly what we’re talking about right now. We have a call every second Wednesday, and we recently discussed all the different backup mechanisms. For example, the classic approach with mnemonic seeds. That is, we use 12 words, which you write down — that’s probably the method that most people familiar with if you have been in blockchain and cryptocurrencies. That option can obviously be used for SSI as well. However, we all know that this isn’t the most user-friendly approach, and there are significant drawbacks to that solution. So, we have to think about other ways; for example, social key recovery, or device-based recovery. All of these other mechanisms have certain advantages but also certain drawbacks.</p>
<p>Let’s take a deeper look into what the drawbacks are: How can we integrate them? What are the best solutions for companies or end consumers? Even then, for the end consumer, what is the best solution for my grandmother or my mother, who might not be too comfortable around digital devices?</p>
<p>We have to find solutions that work for everyone. They have to work well in a range of situations. The highly decentralized ‘maximalism’ crowd wants to store all their data on their devices with everything under their control, but the solutions have to be easy to use. There might even be a third party who is acting as a guardian in order to restore all the information. I think that in the end, we won’t have one single solution or backup solution. We have to make sure that we have different solutions available for different target audiences. We must consider the needs of any given group and then find a suitable solution for it.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Yeah. A lot of the problems apply directly to crypto as well, right? When you have that self-sovereignty, whether it’s over your identity data, your digital credentials, your digital native assets, or over different crypto assets, you have all the power in the world. It all comes down to effectively managing your keys.</p>
<p>There are a lot of similarities between the two worlds there, for sure. Jumping back now, we talked about Lissi and some of these announcements that LISSI is helping contribute to. That is, we spoke about terms of contextualization and internationalization, backups and mechanisms, and other topics regarding the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p>
<p>Am I correct to say that Lissi is more of an international play, whereas IDunion is more specific to the German market, or potentially the EU?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yes. With Lissi, we want to make sure that this is a product that institutions from all around the world can use.</p>
<p>So, Lissi has a quite international focus. With respect to IDunion, we’re very German-driven for now and have German funding. We have a clear European focus, so we see that there needs to be a European solution. I’m not saying that IDunion will be the solution. It is only one way of doing things. We’ll see how things develop with the European blockchain service infrastructure, and other European SSI initiatives from other member States.</p>
<p>However, the final solution we go to, we say, “Okay, in the end, it’s all about governance.” Who controls it? Who can say how? What are the rules? And so on… There shouldn’t be a single entity that dictates the rules. We need to find a form of governance that can be influenced by all of the stakeholders involved – a very democratic approach.</p>
<p>So, we formed a European co-operative. That’s what we were planning when we founded that legal entity as the governance body to control the network. In that way, we can represent the interests of the sum of all members.</p>
<p>We took a long time to get deep into the nitty-gritty details of all the different aspects, which you need to consider when signing a governance framework. We spoke with lawyers and all the various stakeholders involved to make sure that we have a solid framework.</p>
<p>We’re at the stage of finalizing the legal documents. We’re looking forward to making the information and activity accessible to a broader audience. Then, we can found the European co-operative to ensure that we have a network that can run in a productive state.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Got it. In my opinion, we’re seeing a trend where different public identity utilities are popping up throughout the world, and they’re taking more consideration about localization, and better alignment to different data privacy laws. In the discussions before starting IDunion, were those things considered? Europe’s data privacy laws are world-leading and innovative. With the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> (General Data Protection Regulation) in place, are these major considerations for public identity utilities (or just blockchain projects in general) in Germany?</p>
 IMPACT OF PRIVACY REGULATION 
<p>Adrian Doerk: I would say that there are two regulations in particular, which are very important. One, which you already mentioned, is the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, and the other one is the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/trust-services-and-eid">eIDAs</a>, or the electronic Identification and Authorization trust services regulation. Both regulations are really having a big impact, not only on the European Union but also on a broader regulatory landscape in an international context.</p>
<p>Obviously, it’s very important to make sure that whatever you’re building is fully compliant with the regulations at hand. This was a big part of the decision to have a European governance infrastructure. Another reason we decided to go for a European co-operative is that we wanted to have a level playing field for all different companies or public stakeholders in the European Union. We want them to be comfortable that this is not a German foundation that is really close to German law, which might create an entry barrier for them to participate. That’s the primary reason why we went for this quite specialized European co-operative.</p>
<p>I believe there are 35 which exist, so this is not something common. It’s something that is relatively new and hasn’t been explored or leveraged yet.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: You wrote about that in a document that you contributed to the Trust over IP’s utility foundry working groups. There’s more information in there if folks are interested in learning about that. I know you’re active on social media about this topic as well.</p>
<p>Let’s switch gears. You did an interview with Tim Bouma last year. Tim is a thought leader, not only in the Canadian market (he’s part of the Canadian federal government) but internationally as well. There was a research question that you asked him concerning the growth factors of SSI solutions in Europe. The way Tim explained that was quite similar to the way that we’ve approached decentralized technology, crypto and blockchain. In general, end-users don’t really understand the plumbing. They probably shouldn’t fully understand it either. The growth is going to come from the plumbing; it’s going to come from the standards; it’s going to come from technology. It’s not stuff that the users need to be aware of. So, you have a Twitter account as <a href="https://twitter.com/SSI_Ambassador">SSI Ambassador</a> and a presence online where you’re strongly pushing education for the <a href="https://northernblock.io/removing-roadblocks-to-ssi-adoption/">adoption of self-sovereign identity</a>.</p>
<p>What made you get into doing this type of promotion through SSI Ambassador, and what topics are you preaching that are gaining a lot of traction?</p>
 SSI AMBASSADOR &amp; COMMUNITY SUPPORT 
<p>Adrian Doerk: That was a lot of different questions. Maybe I’ll begin with the SSI Ambassador.</p>
<p>I’m actually not too sure what the future plan is, in general. For now, the activity I’m doing is mainly providing content on Twitter, which is primarily educational. I can point to or share from people who wrote or have an opinion about SSI. I’ll quote them and say, “Hey, that’s what he or she is saying.” I want to give everybody a voice within their community without trying to be biased, which can be relatively tricky. I’m trying to make sure that you have one point of contact that you can follow and get different (and maybe critical) perspectives on SSI. So, you don’t have to follow two or three or 400 different people to get a sneak peek and insight into what’s going on. There’s no business model behind it; it’s a private endeavour for me.</p>
<p>I also write articles. I try to summarize different information about what’s going on in the community. I’ll quote people and point to resources and sources that are available. That was part of that interview with Tim Bouma because they developed the <a href="https://northernblock.io/digital-identity-in-canada/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>.</p>
<p>It’s pretty impressive! They took it quite far in terms of how to approach the subject from a technology-agnostic perspective. I think we can all learn a lot from the Canadian approach. In the end, we have so many different aspects we need to consider that it’s really difficult to follow everything that’s going on. I hope I can make it a little bit easier for people to find relevant resources.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: I would say that you definitely do. You make it very easy. For someone who’s just getting into the space, it’s a little tough at times; there’s so much stuff going on. Even for those of us who are in this space, seeing all the different initiatives, and working groups, and standards, and all the different things that are being worked on. It’s crazy; there’s so much stuff that is happening. There’s so much action, there’s so much momentum, but just keeping up with the activity is a challenge on its own. For someone just getting into this space or getting into the crypto space, you realize: “Oh, what have I gotten into here?”</p>
<p>How would you, for example, explain decentralized identifiers to a beginner without going into too much detail about any technology or standards?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Basically, an identifier is something that connects you to a specific system. My classic identifier is a telephone number, or an email address, or anything that might be unique and associated with you as a person. For many systems, this identifier is given to you or at least managed by a central authority, as is the case for emails or telephone numbers.</p>
<p>The idea for a decentralized identifier is that you can create your own identifier, give it to somebody and say, “Hey, if you want to talk to me, just use this identifier, and you’re sure that you will end up in my wallet. And then we can talk.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Right. The other part is that once we have that secure, private, direct two-way connection between two entities, we can now exchange verifiable information. That’s where the verifiable credential conversation comes in.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yes. Once you’ve established an encrypted, private peer-to-peer connection through the decentralized identifier, you can use this communication channel to exchange all sorts of information. It doesn’t need to be a verified source of information like a verified credential but can also be self-attested. It can also be a check or PDF document. The possibilities are quite endless.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: For sure. One of the reasons that led me personally into the self-sovereign identity space is the need to have verifiable data while maintaining the privacy-by-design and consent-driven interactions. We need to have this verifiable data in a decentralized manner that supports the centralized system. So, if I’m building a decentralized supply chain system, for example, I need to meet certain compliance requirements. I need to meet certain access and rule provisioning requirements if I’m going to onboard someone to this ecosystem solution for the supply chain.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to say, “Yeah, this is a very interesting model. Through this type of solution, we could create tons of transparency and traceability in a certain supply chain, that ultimately will benefit the end-user in many different ways.” But, to actually make that work, potentially in the world of government, you need to adhere to certain rules and regulations.</p>
<p>That’s what I got quite excited about: “Hey, look at this model with <a href="https://northernblock.io/verifiable-credentials-for-fintech/">decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials</a>.” Now, all of a sudden, this looks very complementary to these decentralized systems, whether it’s the supply chain or whether it’s crypto, whether it’s a decentralized browser like Brave.</p>
<p>You have been on both sides of the fence. Do you see that marriage between both being quite exciting?</p>
 DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY AND CRYPTO 
<p>Adrian Doerk: I think it’s really the connection between both, as you said. On one side, you have the whole decentralization crowd with <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a> maximalists and so on. On the other, higher, side you have the institutions, which are quite conservative; they don’t want to actually commit to things they aren’t sure about. They’re rather risk-averse, and to bring them together is the challenge we have here. We have some very strong base layers: the infrastructure, the standardization formats for our credentials, and the IDs, but also protocols with Bitcoin, for example. We can bring the players together to say, “Okay, this is common infrastructure, which we have standardized at an international level, and now we can use it to do whatever we need.”</p>
<p>Looking at use cases, we have almost no limit in terms of what we can do with it. Whether it’s a natural person, a legal entity, or an IOT (<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot">Internet Of Things</a>) device — you can use it for all of that. In the end, it comes down to getting the rubber on the road and merely starting with it.</p>
<p>Right now, it’s the time to explore and make different pilots possible, reflecting the interests of all the different public and private stakeholders. It’s amazing to see that they are willing to commit resources, not only financially but also to re-contribute to the open-source repository, for example.</p>
<p>We see that they clearly have the need and the vision to make it possible to have decentralized identities and the variables to enable their use for different use cases.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: I love that. As you said, on the one side, you have the maximalists. I laughed at one of your tweets recently where you said people were basically tweeting about the price of (I quote) “insert any cryptocurrency here.”</p>
<p>It doesn’t provide any value. There are these people on one side that are just maximalist, maximalist, maximalist, or just people trying to pump and not really adding value. But on the other side, there’s valid interest in crypto. There’s real interest in government-issued currencies. There’s real interest in NFTs (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211">Non-Fungible Tokens</a>) that we see now, where there’s a lot of pumping happening there too. I really like how you look at it, where you have the common infrastructure that’s able to bring both sides together.</p>
<p>If all these projects happening are successful, if they’re NFTs or whatever we’re talking about, do you think these will gain adoption at the same time as SSI is gaining adoption? It seems as though there’s an opportunity for them to fuel each other.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yeah, I would say so as well. They’re complementary, but it strongly depends on what you want to use them for. For example, if you want to use NFT to really solve digital identity, then let’s be honest. It’s not going to happen because NFTs are not built for privacy from the design aspects.</p>
<p>We saw that with a lot of people who put their Ethereum name system tag up on Twitter, for example. Anyone can see what they’re doing, what transactions they’re making, what NFTs they bought, and so on. That’s not a desirable call, right?</p>
<p>That’s not something we want. People tend to start using it, and then, in the end, they say, “Oh, damn it. Now everybody in the world can see what transactions I make, when I bought a certain object and so on.” That’s obviously not something we want, so it depends on what you’re going to use it for.</p>
<p>There is a niche or a demand for certain use cases when the time comes to jump to NFTs, or other cryptocurrency applications which combine with digital identity. But, it’s difficult to say now where that use case will be, because I’m not so deep into the whole NFT topic as I used to be.</p>
<p>I have some crypto Pokémons; I forget the name of which ones. I experimented with that a couple of years ago. But, I haven’t been able to deep dive on the topic recently due to all the different activities going on.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: I’m with you on that, too. I was deep in the crypto world a few years ago and still have excellent visibility. But then the whole yield-farming stuff was happening last year, and now just the craziness that’s taking place around NFTs. You understand what’s going on, but it’s just pure craziness. That’s the type of thing that happens with these subjects. Every year, there seems to be a new hyped-up thing within the whole crypto world.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: One more statement about these kinds of crypto projects: I see some projects working to solve this kind of digital identity issue, and they use a token. Having a token is not the problem. Rather, having a token which you can invest and speculate on and which is connected to your identity, that’s a problem. We don’t want to have an ecosystem where people have a financial incentive to comment below. They may have a stake of some kind, a portfolio investment, or they’re short-selling the token.</p>
<p>When it comes to digital identity, I personally try hard to avoid any project which has a speculative token.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: If you think about Ethereum, there are a lot of different digital identity projects happening around Ethereum. Uport is one of the ones you mentioned earlier. There are many different ERC standards (Ethereum Request for Comments), such as the 725 one that’s used for digital identity smart contracts.</p>
<p>Do you look at that the same way? If you use something like Ethereum as a public utility for your identity, does that mean there’s speculation happening on Ethereum?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: That’s something different again because Ethereum is obviously not built to solve digital identity. It’s so much more, and digital identity is just a small part of it.</p>
<p>We see the Ceramic network, and they’re trying to solve the whole topic of digital identity, but I think it’s more about the issue of reputation instead of digital identity. There’s always this line that you need to draw. When do you say if a particular project does something positive or negative, because you’ve invested in it? At a certain point, it’s really difficult to draw that line. I’m not quite sure where to draw the line with Ethereum.</p>
<p>I’ve recently seen that with other digital identity projects using a token. I don’t think that makes any sense because you can have a situation where bots are simply spamming comments on Twitter, using the hashtag of the token. That doesn’t get us anywhere; it makes things worse.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: I think a lot of the time, people come from the wrong side of things. They’re coming from the solution standpoint rather than from the problem side. It drives an approach to say, “Hey, we have the solution to everything. It’s decentralization, and let’s try to fit in everything to that model.” That’s a common problem we see over and over again.</p>
<p>But you touched upon reputation there. I’m curious to know – what are your thoughts on reputation for identity overall?</p>
 REPUTATION 
<p>Adrian Doerk: Trust is something that you build over time. Essentially, that’s the same thing as reputation. Ultimately, you have a new partner that you want to do business with, and you want to know, can I trust this person? The question is does this person or business have a reputation that gives me a reason to trust them, and actually engage in business activity.</p>
<p>You can build this reputation over time, through records. Ethereum might be a good solution for that. For example, if I can prove it through three years of constant updates to a contract with me as a business. It’s also possible that we could do audits, as well.</p>
<p>We can say that all these separate points accumulate to build my reputation on the system. And then you can use this reputation to engage in other conversations. It would be very valuable to have something like that. I think we still need to talk about that more as an SSI topic because we don’t talk about that so much at this time.</p>
<p>We talk about verified credentials, and active disclosure and so on. Reputation is a track record that you can show, which then might be embedded in all your credentials. In my opinion, this is an area that needs to be explored as a community.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Potentially, it doesn’t necessarily need to be all decentralized solutions either, right? We have the core of owning and managing your own data and all that. If it’s consented to, and you’re following the right principles, you could potentially use a centralized reputational system; if it gives you the benefits that you want, and you have transparency into what’s happening.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yes, it will be naive to think that we’ll have a full <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">decentralized ecosystem</a> in the end. It will be a combination of centralized components and decentralized components and obviously something in between — a hybrid.</p>
<p>We need to make both worlds able to co-exist simultaneously and to build bridges that connect them. Then, as an individual, as a company, or as a public stakeholder, you can choose to use whatever solution suits your needs best.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Exactly. For the institutions, you’re talking about creating a bridge, or SSI infrastructure could build a bridge between the institution’s needs and their ability to partake in this new digital or decentralized centralized economy at times. There needs to be a proper way to mix both together. For example, for a financial institution to do business, they’re regulated in a way that constrains them to do things in certain ways. Data needs to be stored in specific ways. They need to do certain types of reporting and have access to certain types of things. So, it’s silly to think everything could be dis-intermediated and decentralized, if there are valid other solutions that emerge. The way the world works today is that we have nation-states that are governing the states. We’re simply going to have to find a way to fit it into that environment.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yes. This co-existence is super important, and also we need to integrate all the different protocols that are still existing, such as Open ID Connect, for example. Obviously, these are the bridges that we need to build in order to connect to the existing world.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: I was curious about another tweet you had made, and I’d like to pick your brain on it. To quote you, you said, “It’s just a matter of time until the decentralized identity technology will be abused by an authoritarian dictatorship. However, this won’t happen with self-sovereign identity because it’s a philosophy and not a technology.”</p>
<p>Would you mind expanding on that tweet?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yeah, that’s maybe a controversial statement. But, essentially, when we take a look into the technology, it’s just a tool. You can use it however you want. If there exists a government, a party, or a stakeholder, who may not have the best interests for the people around you, then the technology can be abused</p>
<p>We see that with a lot of surveillance going on. Why not use decentralized technology, and tweak it a little bit in your favour? For example, if people cannot choose their own decentralized identifier, but instead, you simply provide them with one, then it’s possible to control many aspects within the system. If it’s implemented in that way, then you can actually assert control instead of providing control.</p>
<p>This is true for all technologies, right? It’s not a unique issue for the stuff we’re building. The same is certainly true for artificial intelligence, quantum computing, or whatever other hyped-up technology you have right now. However, in my opinion, that won’t happen to self-sovereign identity because it’s a way of thinking. It’s not a way of implementing technology; instead, it’s a way of asking the right questions in terms of “how can we protect the individual?” How can we ensure we have trusted relationships between two parties so that as a society, we can work together and have interactions and relationships that are meaningful, without total surveillance and controlling of every aspect of a citizen’s life?</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Yeah, I’m aligned to that. With the right foundational standards and norms and principles, then you’re able to build properly. By using a mindset where no matter what standards, norms, principles, and so forth that you had established, there won’t be an opportunity to bypass those, and you’re really building everything around that concept.</p>
<p>To close up here, Adrian: the last question or topic I wanted to ask you is: what excites you most at the moment? There are tons of activities happening; you’re involved in all sorts of different forums and with various projects. There are tons of use cases coming up that are being built around verified or verifiable people, and around verifiable organizations. There’s the whole IOT space, which is something different. What excites you the most right now about what’s happening in the space?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: As you said, there’s so much going on, and I could talk for three hours about all of the amazing projects which are happening right now.</p>
<p>For me, it’s quite a personal perspective, obviously, and I really enjoy seeing the public and private stakeholders come together and collaborate. You can see it here in Germany, with IDunion, and also with a lot of other projects. Not only in Europe, but also worldwide; all the different stakeholders are coming together, and that’s something that’s really good to see, because then we have ready solutions which can be put into production. Then, we’ll have use cases and so on.</p>
<p>Something else that I’m keen to see is that we have the first SSI digital wallets with more than 100,000 users. I think that will be a really big use case coming up, maybe as early as this year. So we have this significant need for a solution that everyone agrees will be the best solution for how to approach the problem. At that point, we’ll see a huge inflow of people who actually use the products and components in a real-life scenario. I think that we’ll see that leap this year.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Yeah, I think so too. It’s definitely coming, and there’s so much momentum going in that direction. So I’ll end it on that, Adrian.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for doing this with me today. Much appreciated. I really enjoyed the conversation.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yeah, it was very nice, Mathieu. Thank you for the invite.</p>

 KILT Protocol in the Real World — Machine&nbsp;Identity <p>KILT is a blockchain protocol for issuing decentralised identifiers and verifiable credentials. KILT brings the old process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driving licence, certificates, etc.) to the digital world, representing your identity while keeping your data private and in your possession.</p><p>But KILT Protocol is not just for people. It can be used for machines, services and anything that identities can be built on,&nbsp;too.</p> Machine Identity <p>Identity is multifaceted, made up of a unique combination of characteristics, attributes and properties that distinguish a person or object from&nbsp;others.</p><p>At KILT we break identity down into two key components:</p>  A decentralised identifier (DID), which uniquely identifies an entity or device,&nbsp;and  Verifiable, revocable credentials that are confirmed by trusted parties (“attesters”).  <p>In machine identity, these credentials would be the static and dynamic properties of the device, such as certificates, rights, roles or capabilities.</p><p>In order to add credentials to its identifier (DID), the device could create a claim that it wants to have confirmed by an attester. The attester would check that the attributes are correct and if they are, would send a credential back to the device, which would store it under its control. Additionally, the attester anchors the validity of the credential by creating a hash out of the credential that represents the credential on the blockchain.</p><p>If the attributes change or become invalid, the attester could invalidate the credential on the blockchain. When the device presents a credential to a third party (verifier), the third party could check if the entity presenting the credential actually owns it, and could verify the validity of the credential on the blockchain.</p><p>Using the KILT Protocol, only a hash that represents the credential and its validity is ever recorded on the blockchain, not the full certificate itself. Thus, a minimum of data is stored to maximise privacy, anonymity and security. The attested certificate itself remains the property of the device and can only be read with the permission of the device&nbsp;owner.</p> Energy Efficiency <p>How could that be used in the real world? A current example is our collaboration with <a href="https://www.dena.de/en/home/">dena</a>, Germany’s federal energy&nbsp;agency.</p><p>In a move towards greater energy efficiency, dena initiated a project to create the Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL), a decentralised digital registry to enable the integration of energy generating and energy consuming devices as active market participants.</p><p>To achieve this, assets such as energy meters, heat pumps, solar power systems, etc. could register their identity on the BMIL. As outlined above, this means that the device could generate an identifier in the form of a DID, with attributes assigned to this identifier as verifiable credentials whose validity is anchored on the BMIL as long as they meet the standards built into the system. More credentials could be added as needed, creating a digital identity.</p><p>These digital identities would allow data to be exchanged between the market participants and systems while meeting the required regulatory standards.The process contributes to the creation of the digital ledger as a dynamic registry of devices to be registered and have their data verified in a decentralised way. The owner of the unique identifier of each device could choose how much information is released by it, maintaining privacy and control over the&nbsp;data.</p><p>This pilot project provides the basis for building services and market-oriented applications, complementing the use of smart meters. The BMIL thus aims to coordinate and connect the rapidly increasing interfaces within the German energy system. In addition to being secure, reliable and traceable, the cost of sharing data could be kept&nbsp;low.</p> Cooperation <p>The dena project is being delivered by an alliance of 21 partners, made up of scientists, established players in the digital and energy sectors, and innovative blockchain startups like BOTLabs, the inventor of&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>KILT is participating as part of a consortium led by <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/2019/06/19/energy-web-foundation-launches-worlds-first-public-open-source-enterprise-grade-blockchain-tailored-to-the-energy-sector/">Energy Web Foundation</a>, a global non-profit organisation who use open-source technology to initiate a low carbon system that enables any energy asset owned by any customer to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web blockchain was launched in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>Other members of the consortium include <a href="https://www.riddleandcode.com/">Riddle &amp; Code</a>, <a href="https://www.50hertz.com/">50 Hertz</a>, and <a href="https://www.parity.io/">Parity Technologies</a>, the company behind the development of Substrate — the blockchain technology that KILT is built on — and Polkadot, a ground-breaking “blockchain of blockchains”.</p> Web 3.0 with&nbsp;KILT <p>This is just one example of the many ways KILT Protocol could be used to create digital identifiers and revocable, verifiable credentials while protecting the self sovereignty and anonymity of the data owner. We look forward to seeing how entrepreneurial developers use our universal protocol as blockchain technology moves into the next generation of the internet, Web 3.0, evolving beyond the hype to real-world uses.</p><p>We are proud to be part of the cutting edge of that revolution. In 2018 we were early adopters of Substrate, the modular system powered by Parity Technologies that makes it easy to build a customized blockchain using pre-built components. Substrate also allows seamless integration with Polkadot — an ecosystem of blockchains that overcomes the previous problems of security, scalability, and interoperability that have hampered blockchain adoption so far. Founded by Ethereum co-founder and former CTO Gavin Wood, Polkadot is paving the way for a new era of innovation.</p><p>In January 2021 KILT became one of the first projects in the world to join Rococo, the parachain testnet for the Polkadot ecosystem. When parachains have been fully tested and stabilised on Rococo and subsequently on Kusama, Polkadot’s canary network, we aim to participate in the first Kusama parachain auctions.

 5 Beauty ingredients you thought were&nbsp;clean <p>Clean Beauty is an up and coming industry with the potential to effect real, positive change. Unfortunately, many products branded as “clean beauty” contain hidden ingredients that negatively impact our health and the environment.</p><p>Here are five beauty care ingredients that you might not know are harmful to people and the&nbsp;planet.</p>  Exfoliating microbeads — many face washes and exfoliating body washes contain a plastic substance called polyethylene or microbeads. Microbeads are touted as good for your skin because they exfoliate to remove dead skin cells. Unlike natural exfoliants like salt that biodegrade, plastic microbeads cause <a href="https://cvskinlabs.com/7-cosmetic-ingredients-that-are-bad-for-the-environment/">real harm to the planet</a>. Although the beads are tiny, one container of facial cleanser can contain up to 350,000 beads! These beads accumulate in rivers, lakes, and oceans, causing plastic pollution.  <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/six-skincare-ingredients-which-are-harming-the-environment">Triclosan</a> is “an antibacterial agent sometimes found in toothpaste, shampoo, soap, face wash, and hand sanitizer.” Not only does it have harmful effects on algae and aquatic bacteria, but it may also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6126357/">negatively impact human&nbsp;health</a>.  Synthetic fragrances can be found in almost every beauty product from shampoo to bronzer and they may contain any combination of bad ingredients. <a href="https://coconutsandkettlebells.com/10-harmful-ingredients-makeup-skincare-products/">The problem</a> with fragrance in beauty and skin care products is that manufacturers aren’t required to say exactly what is in it. They can simply say “parfum” or “fragrance,” which could contain carcinogens, allergens, endocrine disruptors, or irritants.  Oxybenzone and octinoxate are ingredients commonly found in sunscreen and are known to have <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/news/sunscreen-corals.html">harmful effects</a> on coral reefs and marine life. In January of this year, <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=dc777751-66bf-4b68-abe4-3176bb93a589">Hawaii officially banned</a> the sale of over the counter sunscreens containing these ingredients, in an effort to preserve marine environments.  Last, but not least are Siloxanes, which are <a href="https://www.byrdie.com/toxic-beauty-ingredients-4782646">compounds found in many cosmetic and skincare products</a>. Not only have they been found to cause harm to the environment through bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms, but they have also been linked with <a href="https://davidsuzuki.org/queen-of-green/dirty-dozen-siloxanes/">endocrine disruption and fertility issues</a> in humans, making them a serious health&nbsp;concern.  <p>It is disappointing to learn how few regulations there are governing the beauty industry and manufacturers claiming to be “clean beauty” brands can get away with putting harmful ingredients in their products. <a href="https://www.greenamerica.org/green-living/ugly-side-cosmetics">According to the Environmental Working Group</a> “89 percent of 10,500 ingredients used in personal care products have not been evaluated for safety by the CIR, the FDA, nor any other publicly accountable institution.”</p><p>Thankfully, some companies are taking a stand to ensure that everything in their products are good for human health and the planet. Brands like <a href="https://www.drbronner.com/media-center/press-release/genuine-eco-friendly-brand-squeaky-clean-reputation/">Dr. Bronners </a>and <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/why-drunk-elephant-is-the-best-natural-skincare-line.html">Drunk Elephant </a>are paving the way in real clean beauty, ensuring that their products are free of any dangerous ingredients.</p><p>But how can serious clean beauty brands show customers that they are the real deal? Peer Ledger’s <a href="https://peerledger.com">MIMOSI Connect</a> empowers companies to uphold their social values and share proof of their responsible practices. We help companies prove not only what’s in the product, but where these ingredients came from. That’s not just good business, it’s good people and the&nbsp;planet.</p> References   Rebecca (April 18, 2016), 7 Cosmetic Ingredients that are Bad for the Environment, CV Skin Labs.

<p>When Kristy Kim moved to the U.S. with her family from South Korea, she worked hard to achieve the American Dream. But when she graduated from a top university and landed a high-paying job in investment banking, she realized her years of scrimping and saving didn’t pay off in one crucial way – she had no credit file, so she wasn’t eligible for a car loan. She had to pay cash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Kim has launched <a href="https://www.tomocredit.com/">TomoCredit Inc.</a>, a startup that uses with <a href="http://www.finicity.com/">Finicity’s</a> open banking platform to determine which applicants are qualified for credit, and how much credit to offer them. Traditionally, lenders use a credit score, but many people, including immigrants to the U.S. and young people, have not built up a credit history. TomoCredit’s research indicates that legacy lending policies keep 40 million people from accessing credit and the ability to build wealth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using consumer-permissioned real-time data from than 10,000 financial institutions, Finicity can help TomoCredit get a clearer picture of an applicant’s financial health, <a href="http://www.finicity.com/lend">improving risk assessment and credit decisioning</a>. Once approved, applicants receive a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210318005204/en/The-TomoCredit-Mastercard%C2%AE-Gives-Consumers-Access-to-Credit-Through-High-Limit-Offering-With-No-Fees-and-0-APR">TomoCredit Mastercard credit card</a> with no fees and 0% APR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Enabling people to access and control their data, while ensuring best practices to protect both that data and the consumer, will continue to drive tremendous innovation that increases financial literacy, inclusion and health,” Finicity CEO Steve Smith says.&nbsp;</p>

This announcement fits well into the SailPoint strategy of expanding their core offerings IdentityIQ and IdentityNow with additional SaaS services, such as AI-based identity analytics and, now, capabilities for in-depth management and control of access in business applications.</p>
 Acquisition will help SailPoint in further expanding their offerings for business applications 
<p>This acquisition also fits well into the SailPoint focus on managing users and their access across the entire lifecycle, and for all types of services. While SailPoint has been strong in managing SAP users and roles before, and also comes with considerable capabilities in SoD management, this acquisition will help them in further expanding their offerings for business applications.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the acquisition, once executed and once the two product sets are integrated, will give organizations an interesting option for a one-stop-shop for a solution that covers IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration, i.e., User Lifecycle Management, Identity Provisioning, and Access Governance) and delivers in depth SoD control and access control capabilities for environments containing business applications of various vendors.</p>
<p>While ERP Maestro’s biggest strength is in managing SAP environments, they also support some other business applications. SailPoint also provides support for a wide range of business applications.</p>
 Combining in-depth capabilities for ERP and core business applications serves current trends 
<p>With the business application landscape undergoing change, with SaaS offerings already playing a strong role in certain areas, and with a trend towards multi-vendor approaches for providing business applications, the combination of in-depth capabilities for ERP and other core business applications, and the breadth of supported systems SailPoint can offer, serves these trends well.</p>
<p>As for every acquisition, there is a need for unifying roadmaps and integrating the offerings, on which SailPoint must deliver. However, due to the specific strengths and focus of the existing solutions of both SailPoint and ERP Maestro, we see significant advantages in this strategy, and limited risk for existing customers of the companies.</p>
 CIOs should revisit their strategies around siloes of business applications 
<p>We recommend CIOs to revisit their strategies regarding access control, SoD control, and GRC for their business applications as well as their IT organizations, to reflect the move away from siloed solutions towards a more open ecosystem of business applications by various vendors, frequently deployed as SaaS.</p>

<p>The UEFA European Football Championship or the Euros is one of the most anticipated soccer competitions in Europe. The global sports betting volume is expected to increase massively – so providers have to ask themselves if they are ready to handle the player spike?</p>
<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the growth of the online gambling sector drastically. With fans watching from home, many are looking to engage through sports betting. Operators around the world are reporting record-high player numbers. We at IDnow noticed a surge in player onboarding since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 with impressive peaks during Super Bowl (+ 175%) and big football matches like Bayern Munich v Borussia Dortmund (+ 340%) – and we are expecting an even higher demand during the Euros.</p>
<p>Operators need to get ready to handle the spike in demand and keep their players happy. We prepared a convenient Infographic to give you an overview of what’s on the horizon:</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms are attracting a lot of attention from many organizations, from enterprises to government agencies and even those on the upper end of Small-to-Mid-Sized Businesses (SMBs). The reason for this is clear: the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve and get more complex in order to combat the corresponding rise in frequency and complexity of attacks.</p>
<p>SOAR platforms can be the capstone application for Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Most organizations have a plethora of security tools already, such as Endpoint Protection/Detection &amp; Response (EPDR), Next Gen Firewalls (NGFWs), Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR), Secure Web Gateways (SWGs), Email Gateways, Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, and so forth. SOC analysts have to interact with each of these systems in the course of daily management, investigations, and incident response. SOARs are designed to centralize many of the SOC analyst common and repetitive tasks, thereby decreasing the chance of errors and promoting efficiency.</p>
 From SIEM to SOAR 
<p>Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) tools have been on the scene for more than 15 years. SIEMs are the central repositories that hold security log data from all the upstream security tools. SIEMs can catch the data but have historically had difficulties with enterprise-wide orchestration and generating false positives. SOAR solutions have filled some of the functional gaps, adding orchestration, automation of enrichment and investigations, and providing the capability of simplifying incident responses.</p>
<p>Many SOAR products originated from specialized startups addressing the gaps in SIEM tools. Some SIEM solutions have upgraded and added SOAR type functions to their platforms; other SIEM and security stack vendors have acquired SOAR specialist companies to augment their offerings in that way. In some cases, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) management platforms have grown toward full SOAR capabilities. CTI management is a core feature of most SOAR tools, so this market development makes sense.</p>
 Orchestration and Automation 
<p>With a myriad of deployed security products in most SOCs, the lack of orchestration makes analysts’ work more arduous and time-consuming. Consider the following scenario. An analyst is alerted by EPDR via SOAR that registry entries have been added to a user’s workstation. These registry entries don’t match the baseline for deployed software within the organization; however, malware was not immediately detected. SOAR queries CTI and finds that these registry entries match newly discovered Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). SOAR can then automate a full scan on the affected machine and execute an enterprise-wide search for the same IoCs on all nodes.</p>
 Playbooks 
<p>Playbooks are the constructs that allow for default and customizable orchestration, automation, and response tasks. In the example above, the SOAR platform can profile the registry changes and query CTI sources to find out if others have encountered this type of event. SOAR can add the relevant CTI to the ticket for the analyst as it is opened and updated. Follow-up tasks such as the scans and multi-machine searches can be scripted in. Most SOAR solutions ship with dozens to hundreds of playbooks that address many of the common tasks that SOC analysts have to perform. Most SOAR playbooks are quite customizable, allowing customers to decide what level of automation they want to implement. Many organizations that use SOAR choose to automate preliminary investigation tasks and package response actions such that complex tasks can be reduced to a single analyst action. Another pertinent example would be allowing an analyst to remotely terminate network sessions to suspicious IP addresses while initiating scans and collecting file-level forensic evidence.</p>
 Integrations 
<p>Since SOAR must interact with various security data sources and downstream tools, integrations are the key. Integrations are typically packaged connectors that utilize APIs to pull information from and remotely command downstream security tools such as EPDR, NDR, NGFWs, etc. SOAR capabilities are constrained by the actions exposed by integrated tool APIs. When selecting a SOAR for your SOC, it is imperative to choose the vendor that has integrations for the tools you already have.</p>
 SOCs, SOC-as-a-Service, and MSSPs 
<p>Large organizations with mature security architectures and SOCs already in place can achieve a reasonably short time-to-value with SOAR implementations. Organizations that have SOCs but want to utilize outside help for SOAR functions, or those that want additional expertise may opt to use SOAR services delivered by Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs). Companies that do not have SOCs can still benefit from SOAR features if they engage SOC-as-a-Service solution providers. Many SOCaaS providers utilize SOAR products from the major vendors as a way to reduce the Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) for security incidents for their customers. &nbsp;</p>

<p>	Many global small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have limited access to financing which creates an uneven playing field for those who cannot acquire traditional data. Those outside the US struggle to finance their endeavors due to lack of a credit score, SMEs are cornered into financing through alternative options with high-interest rates. On the flip side, these alternatives will struggle to effectively validate sellers and transactions, inevitably increasing the risk for all parties. These international buyers and sellers are who TrafiGuard lends its services. Built on 0x’s Bloom platform, TrafiGuard uses a form of self-sovereign identity to deliver its mission statement as the “[Global] Trade Finance Solution for Micro Small and SMEs”.</p><p>	The “solution” allows the buyer to deposit funds into the TrafiGuard smart contracts, which are locked in the <a href="http://compound.finance/">Compound</a> protocol via USDC to collect interest and provide collateral allowing the seller to take out a loan in its local currency. The process is as follows: First both the buyer and seller must connect with the TrafiGuard Smart Contract. Then the buyer is required to submit proof of their digital identity via encryption on Bloom. In order to secure the loan, however, the seller must prove they are valid and trustworthy through steps that will then be stored as proof in the blockchain. The first involves the seller submitting their Bloom decentralized ID and ‘credit score’.</p><p>	TrafiGuard bridges the gap between global SME financing and global, verified players by removing documents that are often barriers in determining how trustworthy the user is in relation to risk via Bloom. Users are able to track their Bloom-unique credit score, utilization, age of credit, payment history, and inquiries, similarly to how credit karma is structured except with inclusivity. This opportunity allows international SMEs to become stronger candidates for financing regardless of their country’s differing credit systems. This is also beneficial for buyers or lenders since they are able to access risk efficiently and with more accuracy through Bloom’s Truth Platform.</p><p>	Bloom’s Truth Platform is composed of Validator, SourceSpring, and SafeSwap, to attain cryptographically secure alternative solution to KYC/AML compliance for the digital age.</p><p>	The seller must provide approved income, tax returns, and any additional financials to the connected data providers. The third and fourth steps regard the actual shipment of goods, in which case the seller must provide a Bill of Lading verification and a voyage complete event for settlement. All proofs will be supplied via Chainlink oracles to the smart contract. Here, multiple protocols are executed to enact the process. The first being Bloom’s share kit and smart contract bridge, (Currently under development through the name ‘OnRamp’) handles validation and trustworthiness; Chainlink external adapters that supply proofs to the smart contract, compound CTokenhandler &amp; Comptroller, and USDC stable coin for money flows and lending. Sample transactions and references are documented on their GitHub page for those who are not well versed in blockchain.</p><p>	Once all these steps are completed, a risk score is calculated and depending on the score, the seller can take out a loan. The buyer deposits an amount of currency in USDC into the compound protocol. There it is locked, leaving it to accrue interest and be used as collateral for security purposes. The seller has the ability to take out a loan between 10% to 50% of the deposited collateral. Once the goods arrive at their destination, the deposited amount from the buyer will be cleared with the loan and sent to the seller, with the financial also taking a share.</p><p>	TrafiGuard’s system is redefining trade finance, especially for those who trade and finance on an international level. Bigger companies that were held back before are able to finance their businesses, leaving small and medium enterprises struggling to obtain a loan or paying high-interest fees. With multiple varied credit scoring systems, it becomes complicated to gauge how secure or risky a seller is and if the seller is truly who they say they are, resulting in SMEs being underfinanced with limited alternatives and buyers who are constantly taking uncalculated risks. TrafiGuard’s system, while it does require a certain degree of knowledge pertaining to blockchain and program development, is much more accessible and stricter with validation, resulting in buyers who feel more at ease with financing sellers, which in turn creates a flowing market.</p>

<p>When Elon Musk simply tweeted ‘Use Signal’, he put a megaphone to the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">global data privacy conversation</a>.</p>



<p>Musk’s tweet was in response to widespread outrage that the Facebook-owned instant messaging app WhatsApp was demanding its 2 billion-plus users consent to sharing their personal information, including their phone number, with Facebook and its subsidiaries or have their accounts deleted. WhatsApp set an initial deadline for user consent of February 8, 2021 but later pushed it to May 15 following widespread backlash.</p>



<p>Since Facebook is in the business&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">data surveillance</a>&nbsp;it shouldn’t have been a huge surprise when its instant messaging app wanted to change its user terms and privacy policy so it could share user data with its parent company for targeted ad and product experience purposes. In fact, WhatsApp has been sharing user data with Facebook since 2016 and hasn’t stopped, effectively breaking the 2014 promise that both companies made on Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp that the two services would remain separate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why this latest news of WhatsApp sharing data with Facebook has shocked and riled so many then is that, for some, it was the first time they’d realized it was even happening (despite it going on for four years). Further, many users and some media interpreted the changes to mean that WhatsApp and Facebook would now be able to access the&nbsp;content, including text and photos, of users’ private messages, and spotted that the original opt-out statement giving them the choice to not have their data shared was now missing from the revised privacy policy. Many users rightly or wrongly saw this latest move as yet another Facebook data sweep and a further hit to their increasingly vulnerable privacy. Fair enough. But the story is even bigger than that.</p>



<p>When WhatsApp announced its controversial privacy policy change in early January,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer tension</a>&nbsp;was already at boiling point over&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/fight-the-fatigue-data-privacy-really-does-matter/">data privacy</a>&nbsp;and Big Tech’s&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">increasing surveillance and use</a>&nbsp;of customer information.&nbsp;So when Elon Musk ‘suggested’ people use private messaging app Signal, its popularity skyrocketed, gaining around&nbsp;7.5 million downloads in just four days. Similar app Telegram also experienced a massive boost in downloads because of the Musk tweet, and most privacy-focused apps, including&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, benefitted too.</p>



<p>Musk flagged Signal to his 42 million followers because it’s a recognized private messaging app, powered by the open source Signal Protocol, whose sole feature is end-to-end encryption of user content. Privacy and encryption are quickly becoming hot property indeed.</p>



<p>This is obviously a big and important story for data privacy. That millions of consumers are so tired and weary of trading their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;for access to services and would jump ship to a more privacy-focused alternative within hours of Elon Musk suggesting such, speaks volumes about where the world is at in the consumer data conversation. But this is also a big and important story for&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and here’s why:</p>



 MySudo has more privacy features than Signal, Telegram or any other privacy app on the market today.&nbsp;<br> 



<p>Signal and Telegram are&nbsp;private instant messaging apps. MySudo is a&nbsp;complete privacy toolkit.&nbsp;Just as it was before the latest data sharing uproar, MySudo is an excellent alternative for not only in-app messaging but also all out of network comms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MySudo uniquely offers private and secure voice and video calls, SMS, email, browsing and payments&nbsp;all in one app, and doesn’t require any of your personal information, like your phone number or email address, on sign up. So, even if you abandon WhatsApp to use Signal or Telegram for private instant messaging, if you’re serious about your right to data protection and privacy you will need even more privacy features than those apps can give you.&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo delivers those features</a>.</p>



 How does MySudo work?<br> 



<p>MySudo is based on the concept of a&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, a secure alternative profile or digital identity.&nbsp;You assign your Sudo its own identity data, like a real email, phone number, payment card (and more), and use that data online instead of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">your own</a>&nbsp;personal and private information. In this way, the Sudo identity shields your personal identity, and protects you from the type of data grabs we’re seeing from Facebook and Google (plus&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>, fraud and various other forms of data abuse).</p>



<p>Since you can create up to&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/01/5-ways-to-make-best-use-of-your-9-sudo-profiles/">nine different Sudo profiles</a>&nbsp;in the app, it’s possible to use a different Sudo for everything you do online across all your activities (searching, shopping, selling, socializing, etc.).&nbsp;This categorization and separation of your private data across various Sudos is called&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">compartmentalization</a>, the most powerful data privacy strategy there is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you download MySudo you get:</p>



  Market-leading privacy and security foundation: MySudo is built on Anonyome Labs’&nbsp;market-leading cybersecurity and privacy infrastructure. It powers outstanding UX and unprecedented data privacy and security, and features: encryption, authentication, key management, secure communication channels, and decentralized trust. For example, all data stored on our cloud is encrypted. Only you hold the unique encryption key. And all Sudo-to-Sudo messaging, calling, video, and email is end-to-end encrypted.  No personal information necessary: We don’t ask for your email address or phone number to register for MySudo or other personal information (except for virtual cards when we must do a one-time verification,&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/we-need-to-verify-your-identity-for-mysudo-virtual-cards-heres-why/">by law</a>&nbsp;like other financial products). And&nbsp;you can always access MySudo from your mobile app without a login or password.&nbsp;  End-to-end encrypted voice and video calls with other Sudo users:&nbsp;Every Sudo comes with one working&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;(and up to nine or more, depending on your&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/mysudo-plans/">plan</a>&nbsp;and needs). The phone number allows inbound and outbound calls, voicemail, and has a contacts database. You can call anyone from your Sudo number, even if they don’t have a Sudo. But if they do have a Sudo, you get end-to-end encrypted video chat with those users.&nbsp;&nbsp;  End-to-end encrypted messaging with other Sudo users: You can send standard SMS messages to any phone using MySudo, whether they have a Sudo or not. But if you’re messaging with other Sudo users, you enjoy enhanced messaging with complete end-to-end encryption, plus group messaging, set and send expiring messages, edit and delete message capabilities, and more.&nbsp;  Secure email: MySudo gives you up to nine&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email addresses</a>&nbsp;and all emails you send to other MySudo users are completely end-to-end encrypted.  Ad and tracker free private browsing:&nbsp;Each Sudo has a separate&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2019/07/what-are-the-benefits-of-using-the-mysudo-private-browser/">private browser</a>, which means you can keep your browsing history, bookmarks and tabs separated by Sudo (which might be particularly useful if you’re searching from your&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">medical Sudo</a>, for instance). You can open links in emails and text messages on the private browser and, because it’s totally ad and tracker free, you neatly sidestep the spam.  Private and secure online payments: MySudo&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/mysudo-virtual-cards-are-here-making-the-safest-way-to-live-online-now-even-safer/">virtual cards</a>&nbsp;are designed to powerfully protect online purchases and payments. You can have an active virtual card for every Sudo you create, and they offer a long&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">list of benefits</a>, the biggest of which are that&nbsp;merchants and your bank can’t track your spending habits&nbsp;and&nbsp;you keep your money safer.&nbsp;  In-built decentralized identity technologies and standards: Last but nowhere near least, the Sudo concept is on a critical path to making&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;usable for&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/how-sudos-are-making-decentralized-identity-usable-for-most-people/">most people</a>. Sudos incorporate emerging decentralized identity technologies and standards. Sudos digital identities will become the innovative alternative to traditional identifiers such as email address, password, and phone number for authentication. Sudos are being engineered to be fully interoperable with decentralized identity technologies as they are introduced. MySudo is incorporating decentralized identifiers, peer-to-peer communications, and payments—with more to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>You can see how MySudo gives you much more privacy than Signal or Telegram. We’re not saying to abandon those services but rather to use MySudo as a companion product.&nbsp;For example, Signal requires your personal phone number to register. You could use a MySudo&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;to sign up for Signal and then get all the extra privacy features of MySudo.</p>



 A few final thoughts on Facebook and WhatsApp&nbsp;<br> 



<p>WhatsApp has clarified that its privacy policy change includes “new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data”. It says the changes&nbsp;won’t affect the end-to-end encryption on users’ messages and the content they send and receive—the two providers won’t be able to see user communications. That’s fine, but there’s still a mountain of user information and metadata that WhatsApp can collect and share. For instance, while WhatsApp can’t share the content of messages, it can tell Facebook who you’re messaging, when and from where.&nbsp;It can also share&nbsp;account information including your personal phone number, information about for how long and how often you use WhatsApp, your device identifiers, IP address, transaction and payment data, and much more. Read this detailed breakdown of everything in a user’s WhatsApp data report from the&nbsp;<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/whatsapp-privacy-policy-user-data-report-how-to-download-what-does-it-contain-faq-7151248/">Indian Express</a>.</p>



<p>As Johns Hopkins University cryptographer Matthew Green is widely&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/">quoted</a>&nbsp;as saying: “WhatsApp is great for protecting the privacy of your message content. But it feels like the privacy of everything else you do is&nbsp;up for&nbsp;grabs.”</p>

<p>Payroll data is a tremendous resource upon which fintechs and financial services providers can build better experiences for consumers and, at the same time, enable consumers to benefit more from their financial data.<br>
<br>
But enabling access to payroll data isn’t as easy as flipping a switch. And we can’t build better experiences without a simple and trusted process for consumers. This is where open banking comes in. Open banking platforms can unlock payroll data, but such data access has to be done the right way with a consumer-centric model that ensures successful connections and collection of data.</p>
 How to Leverage Payroll Data the Right Way 
<p>Payroll data is a beneficial resource, but how it’s accessed is central to enhancing the customer experience and ensuring successful data collection. Let’s look at this in greater detail.&nbsp;</p>
 API Connections Vs Credentialed Access 
<p>In some cases, data providers look to access payroll data by using a consumer’s credentials. Unfortunately, this model is overly cumbersome for the consumer. Unlike digital banking, where consumers know the data source and have login credentials, consumers are largely unaware of their payroll provider, and in many cases haven’t even set up an account to access a payroll portal. Plus, many employers use a firewall-protected HR portal to enable employees to view paystubs and other income information, which means the employee never directly interacts with the payroll provider. That firewall also protects the payroll data from external access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These credentialed-access hurdles make it painful for employees to permission data access and significantly depress successful connections to payroll data. With a low hit rate, financial services innovators or others looking to leverage such data are left with an awkward, sub-par user experience at best and no data at worst.</p>
<p>The best way to leverage payroll data is to provide technology that enables the consumer to easily access their data, and protects them while they do so. This is achieved through direct API connections to payroll providers that eliminate the need for employees to have or know their credentials. It even eliminates the need to know who their employer is using as a payroll provider.</p>
<p>By connecting directly via an API, an open banking platform provider partners with payroll organizations that are equally committed to providing consumers with access to their financial data. The open banking platform can then connect the employee with their payroll provider for them, enabling the employee to more readily benefit from their payroll data and, should they choose, permission access of that data to a fintech or financial service provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity is already leveraging direct API connections to payroll providers and is quickly expanding those tested and proven connections to reach more employers and benefit more employees. We already provide direct connectivity that covers tens of millions of employees in the U.S. Finicity has a history of building partnerships with leading data sources, such as our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/finicity-lend-to-accelerate-next-gen-credit-decisioning-experience/">&nbsp;direct API connection with the largest payroll provider</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of payroll data, direct API connections have created the best experiences and led to the best outcomes for both our partners and for consumers. This remains consistent with our market push on direct API connections to a broad range of financial institutions.</p>
 Consumer-Centric Means Consumer Protection: Operating as a CRA 
<p>It’s not enough to promise consumer-centric processes or protection in word only. After all, leveraging payroll data the right way also comes down to how the open banking platform handles the data and how they involve the consumer in that process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the primary uses of payroll data is in lending. Our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/">Finicity Lend solution set,</a> for example, currently leverages payroll data to enhance income and employment verifications necessary for credit decisioning. In this use case, consumers can gain additional protection and strengthen engagement through the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). These protections hold the data provider accountable for data accuracy and ensure the consumer has a mechanism to dispute the data in case of issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While other data providers claim FCRA compliance, at Finicity we’re not just talk. <a href="https://www.finicity.com/data-aggregators-cra-fcra/">Finicity operates as a Consumer Reporting Agency</a> (CRA), which means we are legally required to adhere to FCRA requirements. When data providers are delivering income, asset, and/or employment data for the purpose of credit decisioning, operating as a CRA is not only the best way to provide the data, it’s the right way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But data access that truly empowers the consumer and keeps data secure doesn’t stop there. We also keep the consumer at the center of all our data-access experiences with <a href="https://www.finicity.com/the-finicity-perspective-whitepaper/">our CATTS data principles</a>: Control, Access, Transparency, Traceability, and Security. These principles inform our policies, our products, and ultimately our entire approach to empowering the consumer with their financial data.</p>
<p>It all comes back to trust. Consumer-centric principles, reinforced both in word and in deed, establish trust between data access providers and consumers, as well as with financial institutions, payroll providers, and other financial services providers.</p>
 How Can Open Banking Platforms Use Payroll Data? 
<p>Payroll data enables financial service innovators to leverage consumer data to improve decisioning and enhance lending processes, as well as create new financial services experiences.</p>
<p>While financial service providers have traditionally relied on ‘physical’ documents, such as bank statements, tax documents, paystubs, and more to verify information about consumers, digital payroll data via open banking provides quick access to all insights necessary to create next-gen financial experiences.</p>
<p>Finicity payroll partnerships provide access that enable or enhance various use cases, such as:<br>
</p>
 
 Mortgage lending 
 Auto lending 
 Personal lending 
 Tenant screening 
 Background checks 
 Government verification 
 Personal financial management<br>
 
 
<p>And where Finicity has been leading the market, the market is following. Along with an increasing number of financial institutions and other financial service providers, more payroll providers are recognizing that consumers can benefit from the data they hold. As a result, these providers are adopting API connections to open banking platforms that expand the use of financial data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Employees aren’t the only ones who benefit from consumer-permissioned data. Payroll providers ensure greater security when specific data is only shared with third parties for the use case, rather than released on a large, broad scale. They retain greater control in their role as data stewards.</p>
<p>Payroll data goes even further in delivering a more complete view of a consumer’s financial story when it’s paired with other open banking capabilities, such as validating information with bank transactions and, in appropriate cases, with digitized paystubs—another area where Finicity has led the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers own their payroll data, and they should be able to benefit from it. But to ensure the best experience for the consumer and the financial services innovators looking to use such data, enabling access to that data must be done right. <a href="https://www.finicity.com/fintech-demo/">See in action</a> how Finicity is leveraging partnerships with payroll providers and financial institutions to provide technology that empowers consumers to benefit from their financial data and improve their lives.</p>

A PDF of the full interview is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blockchain-Brad_Transcript.pdf">here</a>.</p> 1. TESTNET TO PARACHAIN <p>Ingo [00:54:38] Well, right now we are in testnet mode. We want to go live as soon as possible. So actually from the tech side, including everything that we are claiming and what not, on the verifiable credential and DID side, we are ready to go. The testnet is out there for a year now and has been tested by lots of people. And we have got a lot of feedback and we improved a lot of things that we didn’t see in the beginning. And so I think from that side, we are ready to&nbsp;go.</p><p>The only thing that is currently missing is the parachain. We’re waiting for that. But that’s going to come out — maybe not in the next weeks, but in the next few months, definitely. So we will have that and we will take part in the first parachain auctions and hopefully get one of them. And then we are basically… the next thing coming up is the go-live of the network. So we are ready to go. Just some external dependencies which we have to clear up and then we’re good to&nbsp;go.</p><p>Brad [00:55:42] You absolutely must be excited because it’s been years in the making. Now one of the things I wanted to ask you, and I hope you don’t mind if I do, is the backers. Now often when we’ve seen in the last few years, there’s been a lot of money raised in all kinds of ways. Some are controversial, some are not. But ultimately, it’s the backers in the long term that I care about, and I hope others do, in the space. Because that’s how they support you long term. One of the worries I have is that some of them don’t and they’re just out for the capital and they dump the value of your whole economy, your whole&nbsp;system.</p><p>But from what I’m understanding about you is that you’ve also built so much in that paramount to everything, even the fear of that, is the utility itself of the system. So what are your thoughts on this? When it comes to backers, when it comes to the long term position for your economy, for the quality of the technology, for the team and for really pushing this whole thing forward. So that people can start to use this more and more around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Ingo [00:56:42] Yeah, so, for backers, I think the fact that we are in this ecosystem from day one on basically, gives us a lot of connections to really nice people who back us. And they all come from the development circles. And I think it’s even more important to have those people behind you than to have a huge financial backer behind you. It’s always nice to have money in the bank. I think we do have some money in the bank which will actually give us the possibility to…</p><p>Brad [00:57:20]&nbsp;…have more runway as well. But the great thing is that you have the devs. You have real people building this, as&nbsp;backers.</p><p>Ingo [00:57:27] Yeah, especially in blockchain, things take longer than we thought. We have seen that with multiple things. Just look at Ethereum, how long we are waiting for Ethereum&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>Brad [00:57:40] Yeah, and respectfully so I mention that. Because we do see a lot of promises come out. But I mean, they were first mover in terms of smart contracts, as you’d appreciate. But again, that’s why you’re&nbsp;moving.</p> 2. LOOKING TO THE&nbsp;FUTURE <p>Ingo [00:57:51] Also see that that’s things like when we do the social KYC and those KYC things, those will first emerge inside the blockchain world, right? And the blockchain world is relatively small. And then we have those projects, which we call the lighthouse projects, together with European governments; and stuff like that. But those projects, they also take a very long&nbsp;time.</p><p>So we are in front of a runway. We have to recognise that. It’s not like “Hey, we go live next Tuesday, then we have two hundred million users” — this is not going to happen. It’s going to be gradual, a ramp-up period. And we know that we need the funds to survive that. And we’re pretty OK with the funds that we have. So we are looking to a positive&nbsp;future.</p><p>Brad [00:58:41] And that’s the great thing. That’s the great thing, because that’s what is beautiful about the crypto community, is that they do come together from top to bottom, from high net worth to the average person who wants to contribute. And that is where the movement is also potentially revolutionary because there are so many people that want to support endeavours like yours, quite sincerely.</p><p>So there’s a lot of excitement for KILT out there, especially with the support and the brand and the integrity of the top tier Polkadot teams. That’s the truth. And you’re up there. We can see that code. We can see the collaborations that are emerging, the integrations. So there’s a really good positioning that you are in right now for 2021. I’m really excited to see what’s coming very soon. You mentioned the switch to live state from the testnet. That’s also ahead on the road map. So that’s all a big deal for everything from speculation hype all the way across to the imperative of having more credentials built in and more tinkering on the blockchain.</p><p>But what about things like market economies? We talked about trust built in, rather. So those trust market economies, they’re really important to everything that makes sense when you build this out and when it unfolds. So that it all is seamless and, I guess, it’s being self regulated and automating because the protocol’s done. Are you excited about the potential of this once everything goes live,&nbsp;Ingo?</p> 3. ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPERS <p>Ingo [01:00:04] Yeah, definitely. I know this from my past. That was not only an industry, I was a board member of the Drupal Association. Drupal is one of the biggest open source projects out there in the world for a couple of years. And it’s really interesting how open source actually works. Because, well, it doesn’t go just by enthusiasm. It always needs&nbsp;money.</p><p>And the thing is, a project can only be successful if it is possible for others to earn money with the project. Of course, you can join and then hope that this coin gets rockets, but there must be a little more to that, actually. So with Drupal, what we learned is that we have to maintain just the core of Drupal. But then if somebody wants to build a website, they probably don’t turn to us. They turn to the Drupal shop on the next corner. And the Drupal shop on the next corner then makes a profit with that website and then draws out a little bit, but then also contributes back to the original software.</p><p>And this is how the whole thing grows. In Drupal we had more than 70,000 developers working for Drupal and we didn’t pay any of them, but they all got money. Because they all had jobs because it was possible to build business on top of Drupal. That’s the important thing.</p><p>And this is why we focus very much in KILT on the fact that it is possible to earn money with KILT. So if you are a trusted entity or building trust and want to build a trusted entity on top of KILT — like, half a year after we go live there will be another stage for that, so that you can build virtual organisations on top of KILT which accumulate trust — so if you are in a business like that or if you want to go into a business like that, then you can build that on top of KILT. But you can also be an integrator and just build software on top of KILT and start earning money with&nbsp;that.</p><p>I think building this economy is absolutely crucial for a lively ecosystem and this is why we have a strong focus on that. That every role, no matter if you are a validator, if you are a nominator, if you are a builder, if you are an entrepreneurial developer, if you are an attester, if you are an integrator, that all of those guys, according to their abilities, have the chance to grow on this. And there must be the possibility to live off it, right? You cannot trade on something you can’t live off in the long run. Sometimes you have to eat, right! And then you need some money to buy your&nbsp;food.</p> 4. BERLIN AS BLOCKCHAIN HUB <p>Brad [01:02:48] It’s amazing. And this is a decentralised global economy built in and embedded into this protocol. And that’s where the game-changer is. Not only is it the benefit of the block chain for the transparency and for the provability, but really it’s also a major game-changer because there’s something real built in that’s a unique technological addition to the layer one and layer zero tech&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>But you’re literally providing something that is an incentive by design to take on board and use and and reap the benefits of. I mean, that reward system that is being built in is really second to none. And it’s really what is, I guess, catching attention all the way to Wall Street, because it is a different classification. And this is what I did want to talk to you&nbsp;about.</p><p>Berlin and Germany are world leaders when it comes to being progressive in the blockchain. We know all the way to dena, we know to the government papers I’ve read. It is quite remarkable. And they definitely are supportive of this kind of innovation to really bolster, much like you see hubs of the world for tech. Berlin is no different, I guess, to Silicon Valley, some places in Hong Kong or in China, Shanghai, India. So you must be excited that you are in one of the world’s leading hubs to build out and play around with something that by design can really change the game when it’s married with something useful like these credentials that you are building into the layer&nbsp;ones.</p><p>Ingo [01:04:22] Berlin is fantastic. I can say that, I’m a born Berliner. Yes. It is, it’s fantastic. But it’s also really nice — when we saw the blockchain scene emerging here from 2015, 2016, 2017 on, where the Ethereum builders were here, where also other new companies like Ocean came up here. And it was very, very intelligent people and a very international crowd. It was really, really nice. We had blockchain meetups every night. You could get your pizza and beer there and listen to really highly intelligent people.</p><p>We’ve got the whole Parity team — or, not the whole Parity team, but most of the Parity team — sitting in Berlin. Which was very helpful for us, of course, because we could not only video conference with them, but also meet them in person. That’s just two kilometres away. That’s also nice because it builds personal relationships, and even in computer science, personal relationships are really important.</p><p>Brad [01:05:32] I want to ask you also, I follow a lot of the things that Gavin’s involved with, and he is obviously a staunch advocate for the tech first. You don’t see him in a lot of interviews, but you just know this guy is all about the integrity of the technology first and foremost. I would imagine the relationship you’d have with people like Gav would be pretty important because he sees the value of what you’re doing. You’re in Berlin. He’s been building Parity from the outset. So, do you liaise, do you engage, do you connect with who is essentially the co-founder of Ethereum and the builder of Polkadot?</p><p>Ingo [01:06:07] Well, basically, we know each other, but it’s not necessarily that we engage every day and make plans together. I think it’s far more important, actually, that the devs of the teams work together. That’s bigger because this is where the news comes from. Right? And when Parity changes something in Substrate or so, it’s so important for us to get very early information on that, to have somebody to talk to and say, “whoops, now my code is broken at this point. Did you change anything?”</p><p>Those things, I think, are much more important than the strategic alignment because the strategy of Polkadot is one thing. And it’s good that we know what’s happening there. But we don’t have to align all the time. The whole thing was built as an ecosystem. So we are basically doing what we think is important and what is right. And we do our stuff and we are just linking up to their system and utilising what they have built. So it’s not necessary that Gavin and I make strategic decisions.</p><p>Brad [01:07:11] Right, and that’s the way it should be. I have noticed that Gavin does support you with his own tweets of you. Obviously, you know, the fact that you’re on that testnet indicates a lot with regard to that mutual support indirectly.</p> 5. DEMO CLIENT AND KILT&nbsp;FAUCET <p>Brad [01:07:25] So it’s great to know and again, I agree with you, I think the tech needs to speak. It’s not about the fomo and the hype of certain personalities in the space leading things, and that’s certainly not Gavin’s agenda. It’s more about letting the tech talk and you utilising it how you see fit. And that’s definitely what you’ve noticed from the technology, from what you’ve been saying and what you’re doing now, which is essentially building upon what is already available. And then letting others use you for their own purposes.</p><p>So with regard to things like the full SDK. I want to understand, is it all ready now for access? Can anyone go and use that in this testnet phase? And also, any other things that you’ve built in beyond the SDK? How much is actually ready and being used&nbsp;now?</p><p>Ingo [01:08:11] Yeah, so the SDK is, I would say 100% ready. There’s going to be a new release, but this is minor changes in…next week I think. That should be the final release for the SDK actually before going live. So everything’s there, everything’s open source. Go to dev.kilt.io and find the Github pages there. Find the 101s and how to install it, how to use it. And if you get stuck, just jump on our Riot channels and get the devs directly and ask them why you’re not going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Brad [01:08:45] So the devs are relatively accessible for other devs if they need to&nbsp;connect.</p><p>Ingo [01:08:52] I think this is happening all around the ecosystem. So basically there are lots of Riot channels from all the projects. We never had any problem getting in touch with anyone. And we try to live up to the same standards, also be as accessible as possible. When five hundred projects ask at the same time, then it is a sign for us that we obviously need better documentation. Right now they still can&nbsp;develop.</p><p>Brad [01:09:25] Absolutely, and that’s great to know because having that access to you is going to mean so much as people are trying to just grapple with the gravity of what they’re embarking on; if they’re new, perhaps, to blockchain or new to some of the technology that you’re building out. And certainly the SDK is a great tool for them to engage. With regard to things like client demos as well. That’s available, as I understand. So how is that working in the context of the SDK? Are there other things and demos that you provide for parties as they are starting to really want to utilise the protocol&nbsp;itself?</p><p>Ingo [01:10:02] Yes, what we have is a demo client that everyone can access at demo.kilt.io. We have a faucet where you get some Mashnet coins, which is our testnet coin, and then you can play around with that and that’s basically built for if you have a great business case in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>And this involves credentials and well, maybe something like delegated trust. And so as one entity delegates trust to another entity and this entity then issues a credential and somebody then looks at it, and whatever. So with the demo client, you can basically build those scenarios very easily on the live testnet. It’s not a fake. So when you start it’s connecting directly to the blockchain and you can start building your business cases on&nbsp;that.</p><p>And then if you see that the business basically works with that technology, if you want to build your application, then, as the demo client is, of course, open source as well, you can just take this piece of software and hack it into pieces and reuse pieces of that to more easily build your application, because it’s a nice piece of software. So that as a developer, you can understand what’s happening there and you can just use the pieces and build up your system easier with that right on top of the&nbsp;SDK.</p> 6. PROOF OF&nbsp;STAKE <p>Brad [01:11:26] And it’s good that you have all of this ready now. I mean, you really are coming out of the blocks, literally, so to speak, with so much ready for 2021. And we like to see that when it comes to those who are exploring these new technologies, coupled with economies. And in that sense, I wanted to also ask you about your comment more generally about&nbsp;staking.</p><p>Because that seems to be a really innovative way to add democracy, to add support for legitimacy in what you’re building, but also just sheer value in enabling an economy. So do you think that staking more generally is something that is not only innovative but necessary to build out the initial support and attention and interest in something like&nbsp;KILT?</p><p>Ingo [01:12:15] I think staking is really, really important because we decided a couple of years ago to move away from proof of work. First, proof of work is not really sustainable.</p><p>Brad [01:12:26] A bit too much&nbsp;work!</p><p>Ingo [01:12:29] Yeah, that’s a catastrophe for the environment. And if we have better technologies at hand, like proof of stake, then we have to use that. We cannot go back and say “proof of work is also nice. Please have big KILT coins farms out there.” You don’t want that. I think that’s the first notion that we need to do. And then there’s a necessity inside any permissionless blockchain system that is decentralised to be de-incentivised to do wrong things. And this is what you do normally with the proof of stake system. And this is why you need&nbsp;staking.</p><p>And then after that was found out five years ago, then people started thinking about, hey, actually there are interesting economic models behind that, which can also not only de-incentivise people, but which can also incentivise people to do things, right? And there are different ways you can go there, like nominated proof of stake and stuff like&nbsp;that.</p><p>And I think the direction in which the Polkadot and Substrate things moved is actually extremely well thought out. Because it has a lot of democratic ideas behind that, which are extremely cool. And it’s not perfect. Nothing is perfect. And that is not a true democracy, of course, again. But it is far closer to a democracy than maybe all the other things we see out there. So we are absolutely happy to adopt these technologies and those mechanisms also for our&nbsp;system.</p><p>Because they are economically very sane, I would say, and they are producing the current maximum of democracy within the network, which is not the optimum probably that we will ever see — so there will be new developments after that — but I think it is the best we have right now. So, yeah, that’s it. And it’s there. So it’s there to use and be built. And this is another thing, right? Like other people are using KILT because they don’t want to implement this boring credential stuff; we can use Parity Substrate, Polkadot, Kusama mechanisms to actually not reinvent the wheel on this nominated proof of stake thing. So we’re basically tweaking it. But we are 98%, I would say, using the mechanism that Polkadot and Kusama already proved work, obviously.</p><p>Brad [01:15:17] Yes. And I think people underestimate Kusama thinking it’s just simply a testnet. And we know it’s so much more than that for specific use cases. For certain parties who want to have, perhaps, a less expensive — in terms of cost and tinkering — system as opposed to that really gold star or gold standard parachain with the Polkadot network itself. Making sure that differentiating use cases for both is important, not just simply saying that one is the step to the other. It’s just not the case. You would know that, because you certainly are involved in both of those core technologies.</p><p>Now, the roadmap, I wanted to ask you again, it’s not definitive, but I have read a bit into some of the interconnections, and I thought you could clarify or confirm. It does seem to me that certain entities in Berlin, beyond even the blockchain space, are paying attention to you and can see the benefits of this. And I mentioned this in the context of some of those local government bodies. I listened to some of those — the ones that aren’t just in German — I listened to some of the presentations that happened there. And it’s really interesting because there’s so much interest from the top down coming from Berlin and coming from Germany. Do you foresee in the near future, more of these kinds of announcements that come out that showcase that KILT is going to be embedded in the real world so that the average person can read in the paper that this company has partnered here and is doing&nbsp;this.</p> 7. KILT IN THE REAL&nbsp;WORLD <p>Brad [01:16:46] Will we see more exposure of KILT in the real world? So people understand it’s not just a blockchain game for crypto-savvy people.</p><p>Ingo [01:16:54] Yeah, we’re pretty sure that this is going to happen because we’re being involved. We tried to pay attention to our surroundings in the beginning. And one of the surroundings, obviously, is the crypto scene, which is important for us because we’re part of that. But there’s other worlds out there. And there are some people in the crypto scene who say we don’t have to recognise them because we are happy in our&nbsp;bubble.</p><p>But we said from the beginning, actually, we have to recognise the outside world and the outside world consists of people, industry and government. And we tried to make connections there as soon as possible. And the merits of that is probably that now governments are sometimes very much interested in building projects, not only in Germany, by the way. Right now, we are talking with a South American..</p><p>Brad [01:17:45] You can’t tell me too much, can&nbsp;you?</p><p>Ingo [01:17:46]&nbsp;…about a climate thing. That would be extremely exciting to also have a footprint there. And if you talk to those people, if you respect them — OK, you’re from government, you might have a little bit different views on things — but we are not being bad. We’re trying to build a supportive technology, which might be interesting for you as well. And if you consider thinking about using such a technology, maybe it’s also beneficial for you. And then people start thinking about&nbsp;that.</p><p>And this is why a project like the German Energy Association is doing a project with us. This is why we are part of the Gaia X project, which I’m extremely proud of, which is the European cloud infrastructure. We are one of the first members there as a company. And the other companies in there are basically like the German Telecom with two hundred thousand employees or something. And then it’s us. And it’s good to be&nbsp;there.</p><p>It’s beneficial for them because in this case, we definitely bring very, very new ideas. And it’s beneficial for us because if a thing like a European cloud infrastructure should ever be really, really successful, it’s already got KILT baked in then, that would be cool. So, yes, I think we will see a lot more of those things because we didn’t do any big marketing things around what we&nbsp;do.</p><p>Brad [01:19:16] Yeah, I don’t think you needed to. And you also are backed by some of the most reputable in this space when it comes to start-ups, when it comes to people. Or even if you are working relatively independently in that context, you are still using the underlying core technology. And we saw the likes of Energy Web, for example, and you mentioned some names that they’re also aligned with. And that’s because you see such immense support from that mainstream arena of business enterprise.</p><p>And what was great about the parties that you’re involved with is, you’re not discounting the value of enterprise either. It’s not just simply the narrative of DeFi, a.k.a. cypherpunk or right at the end of one continuum. You actually appreciate the whole broad spectrum from one to the other and everything in between. So with the roadmap, because it’s been a long interview and I do apologise for the length, there’s so much I want to get out of it. What excites you most coming up? Because you are the CEO, you certainly are privy to stuff you’re not telling us today and respectfully so. But what are some of the things that you’re excited that you can tell us about the KILT roadmap that’s coming, that you feel very confident is going to unfold in the way intended because you’re on time so&nbsp;far?</p> 8. A ROCKET WITH TRAINING&nbsp;WHEELS <p>Ingo [01:20:25] Yes. The most important thing for anyone who builds a blockchain is basically a token generation event. And then the phase after that until we set the thing to complete decentralisation. So this is going to be an extremely exciting time for us. We don’t have an exact timeline because we still don’t know when we get the parachain, because we don’t know when the parachain auctions&nbsp;are.</p><p>Brad [01:20:48] But not months&nbsp;away.</p><p>Ingo [01:20:52] We expect this for the very, very near future. And this is the most important time for us because the blockchains are a little bit like a rocket, right? You fire them off once and then they lift for themselves. And if you did something wrong, then it’s a really big mistake. Or you have this, like Polkadot did, this transitioning phase from after the token generation event to the decentralisation, where we have maybe six weeks to a month where we have the Sudo key and can still fiddle around with the&nbsp;system.</p><p>So we have a rocket with training wheels, which is good. And this period of having a rocket with training wheels is probably one of the most exciting periods of my&nbsp;life.</p><p>Brad [01:21:42] Absolutely. And, you know, what Ingo, I have to say, perfect timing. And this was fortuitous by circumstance, because now we see the market in the way it is. We see the conditions are ripe. We also see most importantly, that there is so much support in the crypto community for Polkadot and for multichains and for integration, for collaboration, for Ethereum, for DeFi, for Web 3. Now you’re coming out with the reputation of all of that, plus the credibility of all the time you spent building this. And we can see it. It’s transparent through the code and you have the use&nbsp;case.</p><p>So there’s so much going on. I’m very excited for you, for this new event that’s about to unfold. But beyond that — you’re going to be subjected to a lot of hype — is what excites you post that, when you really start to see, as a lead developer, as a lead, a sort of initiator in this movement, beyond the live moment, what’s something that is going to really showcase your value to those who want to start to tinker more? Is there anything at all that you know about that you can tell us post a major event coming&nbsp;up.</p><p>Ingo [01:22:48] We could talk about this project or that project,&nbsp;but…</p><p>Brad [01:22:51]&nbsp;…you’d have nothing to talk about&nbsp;later.</p><p>Ingo [01:22:55]&nbsp;..but they would be really, really disappointed because they didn’t get mentioned. But I think that everything that’s growing adoption, and maybe growing adoption in the big wave, is going to be very exciting for us. After that it’s basically growing adoption. That’s what we are going to do in the next two to three years after that, grow adoption for the whole&nbsp;thing.</p> 9. KILT COMPETITION <p>Brad [01:23:22] So just a couple more things I want to ask you. One was the competition question. Now we’ve seen the likes of Litentry emerge. Litentry is something that arguably has its own unique value proposition. It also has come forth prior to you. I wanted to ask you some specifics about that with regard to the claims potentially of all the differentiations of both in the context of identity. Because one, on the one hand, there’s arguments for KILT, there have been suggestions of off-chain authorisation to issue credentials as opposed to potentially on-chain. Another argument is put forth for Litentry. So I wanted to ask you, can you clarify exactly if there is even competition or are they different? And are there any others aside from Litentry that you have your eye&nbsp;on?</p><p>Ingo [01:24:08] Well, it’s always complicated to talk about other projects because I don’t know exactly what they’re doing today. So that can also change. What I have in my mind is that Litentry is more about producing reputation on-chain and utilising other chains for producing this reputation. So you have a reputation on this network, have a reputation on this network, and they are aggregating the reputation.</p><p>So this is actually an interesting use case that could be used also with KILT, because when you talk about reputation, you normally don’t talk about your reputation. Normally when you are in the credential space, you’re talking about the reputation of the attester. So when you show me your university degree, it’s not about your reputation. It’s about the reputation of the university. Because I look at the credential and say, oh the university is great, so this guy must be great. So it’s about this reputation.</p><p>Ingo [01:25:19] And I think that an area of cooperation could actually be that we could use the Litentry system to build the reputation of attesters in there. And then those attesters issue the normal credentials to the people. But this is something…we are talking for a couple of months with Litentry.</p><p>Brad [01:25:42] This is super interesting because you have all attestation information in your white paper. It goes into detail about that aspect as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Ingo [01:25:49] Exactly. And then they are concentrating on something else. They’re concentrating on the reputation part. We are not really concentrating right now on the reputation part. So if they do a good thing there and if they actually manage to utilise the Polkadot ecosystem for receiving some kind of reputation from other chains, that could be valuable to aggregate with them and then use this power of reputation for building attesters. So actually, for me, it’s not a case of competition. For me, it’s a case of potential cooperation.</p><p>Brad [01:26:29] Exactly. And that’s what I was hoping because when I was researching. I couldn’t really see how the idea of competition come up. It was just someone brought me the question actually, in the community and I wanted to clarify that with you. So it’s exciting to hear that they have a unique value proposition.</p> 10. BUILDING&nbsp;ADOPTION <p>Brad [01:26:45] Yours sounds like it’s very vast, though, in the sense that once again, you are specifically about that verifiable credential embedded in all potential startups and all potential uses of the technology right across the board. So it’s going to be interesting to see how this unfolds. And again, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a partnership that does emerge that’s meaningful between the two of&nbsp;you.</p><p>One last thing I want to ask you. I think I can already guess the answer, but are you going to engage in marketing or what’s the strategy here? Because I will say this. You don’t come across like someone who is playing games with a lot of the, sort of, more questionable things we say with influencers in some respects from certain sort of lower-tiered start-ups where they almost rely on immediate hype. Sounds like you’re going to approach this very differently.</p><p>Ingo [01:27:34] Well, yeah, so what will we do with marketing? So we will have to do more marketing based on the technology, because when the technology is out there and it has the first use cases, then I think it’s really, really interesting to have those lighthouse projects out there and then also talk more. So this is computer science and computer scientists don’t talk. So this is why we were a little bit silent maybe in the last three&nbsp;years.</p><p>We have to change that a bit and talk more about the technology. I don’t think It’s the right way to do this.:.well, I’m always happy when one influencer says KILT, because that feels to me like we are recognised, so that’s really cool for us, but this is probably not how we will actually get the word out to industries and governments and bodies like that. So I think, influencers are important and it’s good that they like us and I hope they like&nbsp;us.</p><p>But it’s also important that we are a part of, for example, the International Blockchain Association, that we are part of the Blockchain For Europe initiative and things like that. I think there’s a lot going on on the interface between the blockchain world and the old world, right? And so we engage a lot in those things as&nbsp;well.</p><p>So that’s really important because what our goal is actually, as I said, for the next three years, we have to build adoption. This is where everything comes together. It’s nice to have good technology out there, but if nobody knows about the technology, it’s useless, right? Now if you can build for three years the best possible&nbsp;rocket…</p><p>Brad [01:29:41] Exactly. And what a time to come out. Now you’ll ready to go, you’re ready to fire the engines and showcase that you are able to achieve adoption because you spent the years. And it is time for you to come out of the blocks as well and go with your team. And I had a look at them. If anyone wants to know more about the team, there is so much information. There are so many credentials, again, no pun intended, but there are a lot in the team itself of KILT Protocol.</p><p>Now. As I said before, there’s a lot that’s going to unfold here. It’s very clear you’re in a position that’s primed for the attention of all the crypto space right now. They’re hungry for more in this market. And they’re certainly looking for the best reputation, the best credentials, the best technology that can really prove itself as you move forward and you’re primed to go. So with that in mind, thank you so much for your time. For those who survived this very long interview, it’s been an honour speaking with the founder and CEO of KILT Protocol.</p><p>Again, if you’d like to know more, I put links in the social media. I’ll make sure that there are links for those who are devs who want to learn more and can interact with devs based on the feedback from Ingo after the interview. And also, just don’t forget, credentials is the word, but it’s all about embedding into the technology. It’s about making sure that it is provided for a very specific trust aspect of the trustless world that we are currently all trying to support for the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Ingo, is there anything you’d like to say as one final comment to the people on behalf of KILT Protocol?</p><p>Ingo [01:31:14] I don’t have anything else. I’d like to thank you for the excellent questions. That was really, really good and a very nice interview. Thank you very much for all the questions and for digging so deep into what we do, which would obviously enable you to ask those very specific questions. Very cool. Thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Brad [01:31:34] You’re super welcome. And if it’s okay with you I’d love to catch up with you again, especially after these events are about to unfold, because it is always about that continued support, free, transparent. Everything you represent is the same for me. I definitely want to see you grow in the future to really transform legacy models that need to change. And you are definitely part of that conversation. So keep going Ingo, keep leading this team out and don’t stop, mate. It’s only going to get more exciting, as we see the blockchain show what it can&nbsp;do.</p><p>Ingo [01:32:04] Thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Read to <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/blockchain-brad-interviews-ingo-rübe-essential-credentials-for-web-3-0-7ed856151aec">Part 1</a> of “Essential Credentials for Web 3.0” interview.</p>

<p>(Part 1 of&nbsp;2)</p><p>“KILT Protocol: Essential Credentials for Web 3.0 | Trust Enabler | Universal Blockchain Protocol”<br>February&nbsp;2021</p><p>Part 1 of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGuTaeVQ8S4">Brad Laurie’s wide-ranging conversation with Ingo Rübe</a> covers the below topics; a PDF of the interview is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blockchain-Brad_Transcript.pdf">here</a>.</p>  Credentials  Identity  Use Cases for Verifiable Credentials  Sovereignty  Trust &amp;&nbsp;Truth  Anonymity  Social KYC  Open Source  A Universal Protocol  Decentralized Identity Foundation  Ingo’s Background  KILT Use&nbsp;Cases  Why Polkadot?  XCMP and Polkadot Relay&nbsp;Chain  Ecosystem Collaboration  <p>Brad [00:00:06] Hello, it’s Brad Laurie, I’m Blockchain Brad. And today I’m honoured to speak with the founder and CEO of KILT Protocol. His name is Ingo and he’s here to explain everything that we possibly don’t know yet about KILT and what they’re actually building and have been building for some time. So Ingo, thank you very much for being here as the lead of this very challenging endeavour.</p><p>Ingo [00:00:27] Hello. Thanks for having&nbsp;me.</p><p>Brad [00:00:28] You’re very welcome. Now, in transparency, it’s important that all of you know this is entirely free. And obviously I know KILT. This is about making sure that there really is key information from the source. And that’s from Ingo himself. No better than the CEO and founder of any team anywhere in the world right now in blockchain.</p><p>So let’s talk about something that isn’t really talked about a lot Ingo, and that is credentials. Honestly, it’s a very complicated topic. A lot of people really haven’t dug deep, I don’t think, yet into KILT, and they don’t tend to do that until they start to see financial reasons to do so. So let’s start early. Let’s explore for the right reasons. That’s the tech ones. Why do we need to explore credentials in the context of Web 3 and blockchain Ingo?</p> 1. CREDENTIALS <p>Ingo [00:01:09] So the credential is something you all know. You have a lot of those. Normally they come on paper or on plastic. So for example, your identity card is one, your driver’s licence is one. And also if you have a university degree, you’ve got a piece of paper from the university. This is a credential. Also, your key which opens your door or your car, this is also a credential. So credentials are all around us basically, but normally they are not digital. Normally they are somehow physical. And we were exploring this thing from the side of the digital identity.</p> 2. IDENTITY <p>Ingo [00:01:43] So I think everybody agrees that digital identity is needed in digital systems. So we need to know who to talk with. We need to know if a service is actually the service it pretends to be and stuff like that. So there’s a huge need in identity. And when you look a little bit into identity, you can actually see that identity consists of two things. The first thing that you need is an identifier. So in this call, Ingo would be a nice identifier for me because I’m the only Ingo here and if Brad says “Hi Ingo”, I know that it’s going to me. But this is just an identifier and it doesn’t say anything about me. So this is not identity. This is just an identifier. It’s just like you put a QR code on an egg or you put a number on some packages or whatever. It is, it doesn’t say anything, it’s just a&nbsp;number.</p><p>And to have this become identity, actually, you need to put something more to it. So how does my identity grow? It grows with credentials, actually. So, I’m European, for example, I have a European passport, so that makes me European. And this passport mentions my identifier again. It says Ingo. So I can show it — this is Ingo, this is Ingo — this is part of the identity. Also, I can drive a car. This is why I have a credential for driving cars. I also have a company here which I can prove by having somebody look into the commercial register of the city I live in. And I also have a university degree and if I go to look for a new job, I might want to show this because then the guy trusts me, obviously, that I can do something, especially in computer science, and this is how my identity actually&nbsp;grows.</p><p>And if we want to have digital identity, it’s not enough to just have the identifiers and give everyone a name because then you don’t know anything about those things, it’s just names. You have to put credentials to it and you have to have the credential in a digital representation. And this is why we need those verifiable credentials — that’s the name for that — in a digital representation so that we can link them up to identifiers. And identifiers plus the credentials together form an identity. And this can be an identity of a person. It can also be an identity of a machine. It can also be an identity of an IOT device. It can also be the identity of a service which is just running in software. Right? So to build digital identity, we need those credentials because otherwise it’s just pure identifiers. And that’s boring and doesn’t help&nbsp;anyone.</p> 3. USE CASES FOR VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS <p>Brad [00:04:31] Well, let’s explore this also in the context, because the reality is that you want to have key use cases. You’ve been building this for some years and we’ve already seen in the blockchain arena DIDs, or those decentralised digital identification markers, nice experimentation on the blockchain emerge for real use cases. But one of the things that hasn’t come, perhaps so much, is the credential component that must happen. So in the context of, I guess, real world business and real world applications and more importantly, all the way to the very top of government, surely Ingo, this is really limitless in how this can be applied in this Web 3 arena. And obviously the blockchain is crucial to innovating, otherwise we’re just reinventing old&nbsp;wheels.</p><p>Ingo [00:05:16] Exactly, so it’s not… Actually what we do is protocol development. And if you do protocol development, it’s always very wise not to have a specific use case in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>Think of Tim Berners-Lee. He invented the http protocol. Nowadays you can sell your bicycle via http. This definitely was not Tim Berners-Lee’s goal, right? So if you do protocol development, you have to do something which is basically open for millions of use cases. Otherwise, it’s not going to be successful. So we were thinking in the beginning, shall we maybe go into some vertical? Should we concentrate on DeFi? Should we concentrate on government? Should we concentrate on whatever? And we said actually that would be the wrong way. Let’s be completely open.</p><p>And it now turns out that this was basically quite a good idea. Because now we have this base technology out there. We see use cases popping up left and right from us, which is really, really cute because we never thought of those things. So people come there and say, hey, can we do this for certificates for allergens inside food? And we never thought of that. And then people have come up and say, hey, we’re trying to make a genetics service which doesn’t store the genetic information about the people so it can’t be misused. Actually, you could do that with credentials can’t you? And then we say, yeah, actually, you can. That’s cool. And so, there are use cases all around us. And the cool thing is that we just concentrate on building the protocol and making it so flexible that everybody can possibly use it and then people around it build the use cases on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Brad [00:07:05] Yes. And that’s why I’m so excited about it, to be honest. I’ve been tweeting about this for a while and following you along because it really equates to, in many respects, the TCP/IP of credentials aligning with identity for really limitless use cases that aren’t specific to KILT Protocol itself. But in that context, I wanted to talk you through a few terms related to this universal potential of the protocol, such as self-sovereignty, the anonymity and the verifiability or the verification aspect. You mentioned that already, but they are key components to building this, I guess, universal protocol, because that’s really what it is from the&nbsp;outset.</p> 4. SOVEREIGNTY <p>Ingo [00:07:44] Yeah. So let’s dig into sovereignty first. So I think sovereignty is one of the most important things when you look at the internet as we see it today, and this is where the Web 2 and the Web 3 actually differentiate a lot. So when you look at digital identity in the Web 2, this identity is basically held with big companies. I don’t want to mention names, but they’re mostly in America. And so how does it work? So if you want to log into a huge social network, actually what you choose is a username and password, which is an identifier. Right? And then they look to see if the username is already taken, if the password is long enough and whatever. And if everything is fine, then they say, OK, this is now your username and password and you’ve got an identifier.</p><p>The first problem there is actually that they know your secret and you know your secret. Actually, you have a shared secret. From a security point of view that’s not so cool. What happens then, is that you start to behave on this social network and this aggregates data. And this aggregation of data is actually the credentials. This is your behaviour and this aggregates not with you, it aggregates there. Right? It aggregates on their database. And then it becomes really, really dangerous because it’s not only your data that’s aggregating, everybody’s data is aggregating there. So this is a huge honeypot for hackers. If you just hack in once and you’ve got all the information, pretty cool — for the hacker, not for the&nbsp;others.</p><p>The second thing is that this aggregates a lot of power with this social network because the social network then goes and says, hey, we got a messenger service as well. If you want to log into the messenger service, you can just use your identity or your identifer you have from your social network. That’s so convenient for you. But in the end, it’s all put together to one database and they have more information and they can start selling and misusing it. And there’s a huge, huge danger in&nbsp;that.</p><p>And the biggest danger is actually, if you have a better idea of how a messenger should work, how will you ever go to market? Because they can already say, hey, you have your log-in there already, it’s so convenient. And so they’re aggregating more and more users. And better technologies, brighter ideas will never come to market because no one is going to finance them because they don’t have the users. Right? And that’s a huge thing, which is which is hindering innovation. And so we have to somehow stop&nbsp;that.</p> 5. TRUST &amp;&nbsp;TRUTH <p>Brad [00:10:22] Can I just jump in there and ask you this in the context of trustlessness. We hear that a lot in DeFi. We hear that a lot in the broader blockchain speak. But you’re embedding a layer of trust within the framework so that all the engineering that is afforded by blockchain for trustlessness, so that any entity from top to bottom, grassroots or otherwise, governmental or enterprise, can actually start to engage. But with the security and provisions of trust built in for proper applications and use cases that we know can then be utilised in business, even.</p><p>Ingo [00:11:03] Yeah, that’s it. I think this is a complicated thing people have to get their head around. Because actually you’re completely right. What we’re doing in blockchain is we produce a trustless system. What does a trustless system mean? Trustless means basically, we exchange trust with the mathematical truth. So if I have a Bitcoin and I see a Bitcoin on my balance, this is mathematically calculated. I can be sure this is my Bitcoin. Right? So this is truth. When I have a dollar in the bank, I can see my balance there, but I have to trust the bank that their database is actually working well and that they give me the dollar back in cash or whatever. So this is&nbsp;trust.</p><p>So we have a truth system in the blockchain and we have a trust system outside the blockchain. So we can state that. But then also in our culture, we need some kind of trust. And this kind of trust is represented normally by entities. This basically starts in the beginning of your life. At first, you trust your parents. You can’t get away from&nbsp;that.</p><p>Maybe 12 years later, you start doubting this trust, but in the first 12 years and it’s just trusting that. And then we are educated to trust institutions. Some people trust judges. Some people trust governments. Normally you trust universities. And it’s not going to go out of our culture. So when I have an employee who wants to work here and he shows me a university degree, then I will actually look at it and say, OK, I’ve heard of this university. This is a good university. I trust this university or what they do. And of course, then I would like to have this employee here because he has this nice piece of paper. So this trust between me and the university is probably not going to go away just because we have a new technology here.</p><p>Brad [00:13:03] Right. And… sorry, go&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>Ingo [00:13:07] And if we want to implement something like credentials, we have to recognise that those structures are there. Right? So we have to give the university a chance. The trust relationship between me and the university is something that happens in the real world. So this is a trust relationship, this does not have anything to do basically with the blockchain. But you could actually also make your university diploma yourself and just show me a fake&nbsp;one.</p><p>And this is what we can actually prevent with the blockchain because we can — and this is what KILT is about — we can store a hash of this credential on the blockchain so that it is absolutely mathematically true and verifiable that the university actually issued this credential and issued it exactly to me. And this is what we can find out, where we can produce the truth&nbsp;upon.</p><p>Brad [00:14:04] This is so awesome. I want to jump in here because this does this at a level that really hasn’t been done before in terms of finite trust, provable by blockchain, provable by code. So rather than trusting people and systems that sometimes can be flawed, this can be a better way, arguably for the future of any system, whether that be open source design for the people with no enterprise, endeavour or otherwise.</p><p>The great thing you said there was that there is this true, valuable synergy between the blockchain’s trustless design that’s provable and verifiable through the chain itself and then coupled with credentials that we absolutely need in society. So that’s a really innovative thing. I think that has the potential that we really haven’t explored yet globally.</p> 6. ANONYMITY <p>Brad [00:14:50] So that verifiable aspect that’s nuanced by the blockchain. You’ve also referenced the importance of sovereignty as well, self-sovereignty. But what about anonymity? How does that fit into the context as well, especially when that’s had a bad rap Ingo, at the beginning of the blockchain movement, when the governments tend to be quite averse to anonymity sometimes.</p><p>Ingo [00:15:11] Yes, I think anonymity is something that comes in different flavours and that has to be provided in different ways. So, for example, take a real world example. So I want to get into a bar and I have to be eighteen for that. So I choose one of the credentials I have in my wallet, which is probably my driver’s licence. And then I show this to the bouncer. And the bouncer actually needs to see the picture so he can see that the credential matches the subject. And the bouncer also has to see my date of birth, obviously, so he can find out if I’m eighteen or not. And he definitely doesn’t need to know my name. Right? So what I can do is I can put my finger on the name and then he will still let me in. He will not know who I am, but he will see that I’m eighteen. This is what we call selective disclosure.</p><p>This is one part of anonymity we have to provide and this is also something that KILT can provide. So if you have a credential and this has four different things in it, you can choose which parts you show. So that’s one thing. The other thing that is important is that it must be possible for you to show up somewhere and prove something and then show up again and prove it again or prove something again without the verifiers, the bouncer in that case, knowing that it is you again. This is needed for many different DeFi applications and this is also something that we implemented. So I come to you and say, hey, I have a cat, I can prove I have a cat. And next I come back and say, Hey, I have a cat. You say, OK, he has a cat, but you don’t know that this was the same person. That is something that is also especially needed around blockchain projects.</p><p>So those things around anonymity have to be provided. And that’s necessary to get to the general acceptance of a system like that. Otherwise, it would be absolutely open to anyone to read that and that wouldn’t fit with data security. And sovereignty is also something that plays into anonymity, because when I have the sovereignty over my credentials, and this is what you have in a blockchain-based system and this is what you also have in the real world system, like with your real wallet, then I choose who I show which credential to and which part of the credential I&nbsp;show.</p><p>Brad [00:17:50] That’s a huge thing because many, many different parties want to be selective.</p><p>Ingo [00:17:55] Exactly. So this is why we need those features as well to be useful for a variety of use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Brad [00:18:05] Yes, I mean, it’s immense what you’re talking about. I mean, it really is immense because, again, it’s that standardisation. For those who aren’t really understanding perhaps yet, that’s a keyword, wouldn’t you argue Ingo, is that you are a standard as a true protocol.</p><p>Brad [00:18:21] But I would also suggest that you’re going to be more than that, because whilst you are the protocol, you’re building in specific potential, specific, technology, specific, perhaps even products, who knows — you’re going to teach us this — that really build out more than a protocol, but a whole platform. Because there’s a lot going on for the standard protocol that can be applied to a vast amount of use cases. But I wonder, from you, are you thinking of specific ones that really capitalise on the potential of this protocol?</p> 7. SOCIAL&nbsp;KYC <p>Ingo [00:18:50] Yeah, I think there are things that we already see which are going to have a very big potential. So, I think we’re KYC-ing is one thing that really has to be rethought in the world. And everybody’s really unhappy with KYC. That has to do with every country having a different legislation around it. This has to do with basically every bank or whoever you deal with has a different view on what he should do and what he shouldn’t. It has to do with being really annoying for people when they are around in the DeFi space to KYC basically every day. So that doesn’t make a lot of sense right now. So something has to be done about that. And we see the first projects coming and popping up and we are part of those projects.</p><p>For example, together with the companies, Polkadex and Fractal, we just started a really, really nice thing where we provide the KYCs from a well-known KYC provider as verifiable credentials which are in the possession of the user. Not only the KYC. You do the KYC and then the data is owned by the bank or by the service you signed up to. This is basically stupid, actually. You should have that because then you can reuse it. Right? And you don’t need to make the KYCs&nbsp;again.</p><p>We are also working on a project called Social KYC, which I think is going to be really important. Because there’s not only the government KYC, it’s also possible to do social KYCs around there, which means that you actually prove that you have access to different accounts like a LinkedIn account, a Twitter account, a Riot account, a Github account and your email address. And if you prove that you have all those accesses and if you store them in a credential, you can actually send people out there in the internet something that is basically much more valuable than a KYC which is issued by a government’s thing. Right? Because..why do I want to know where you live? Actually that’s really not important to me. But if I know who you are on Twitter, who you are on LinkedIn, who you are on three or four social networks and know your email address and your phone number, then I actually know who I’m dealing with. And if you can prove to me that you control all these accounts, then I’m pretty sure I’m working with you, right? That’s much more valuable.</p><p>Brad [00:21:28] Exactly. And you’re opening this up so that someone like me or anyone really who wants to engage with the open source nature of the code — and that’s what I wanted to check with you — can start to tinker with this and start to almost personalise it or to make it their&nbsp;own.</p><p>And something quite unique because we haven’t seen that kind of access in the past before either, especially in the context of credentials and especially in the context of systems that are built. And often they’re for people but not available as readily, as easily. So in that, where’s the value for this Ingo, when it comes to open source tech as opposed to proprietary? Given that this is in the spirit of block chain, how much of the protocol itself, through the GitHub, through the access, through the nature of open source, is available for everyone to interact with? And can it be forked? Can it be appropriated?</p> 8. OPEN&nbsp;SOURCE <p>Ingo [00:22:20] So, what we do is 100% open source. So anything that we produce is always open source. So as soon as it’s released, it’s also open source. I think this is a necessary component in the blockchain world. If you build something on blockchain and then it’s not open source, then who will trust you actually, that you don’t put traps in that? So that’s a precondition. I don’t think there are many blockchain-related projects out there which have closed source components, and I wouldn’t trust them, actually.</p><p>Brad [00:22:54] Thank you for letting us know that. So where does the value sit in then for you? So we clarify this because you’ve been spending years with your team on this code. You’ve been building this out for a very specific value universally for, as you’ve mentioned, limitless potential. So how does KILT as a team capitalise on the protocol?</p><p>Ingo [00:23:15] So we capitalise like any serious blockchain project just by producing our own currency. That’s what we do. So we don’t take any fees for licences or data from people and sell it later. We’re not going to go into the service thing. Because I think that an open source project actually works best when there are integrators around that. We have seen that in the past. So successful open source projects actually concentrate on their open source product, which is in our case, KILT Protocol.</p><p>And then around that you have people with bright ideas who want to build great services on that and have their own business models. And you have to encourage those guys actually to build the software. And then they can earn money with it and there must be different, multiple business models possible on top of that. While we stay very small, stay in our corner and just build the KILT Protocol.</p><p>Brad [00:24:24] So you’re the lean protocol team. And you also alluded to that important economic aspect of this. I mean, that’s the true utility fuel. The reality is that token economy is really important to the dynamics of how this can play out to enable everyone to engage with this, but also be incentivised. This is something quite revolutionary, I would think, given that this is something that people can then take to build out their own credential needs. They can add them in and embed them into their own technology, their own tech stacks, their own business models, whatever the use case may&nbsp;be.</p> 9. A UNIVERSAL PROTOCOL <p>Brad [00:24:59] But going back to you, one thing I did want to ask you: often when I talk to CEOs and founders, they also have in the back of their mind, perhaps we could also tinker ourselves as a team, not just build the protocol, but we could perhaps build some products. Have you ever thought about that on top of the work you’re doing, which is vast? I mean, let’s be real. This is a universal protocol. But is it a possibility later on where you may privatise some aspects in-house, that can use the protocol like anyone else? That are high quality, that are high tech and are very usable for, say, for example, governments. For, say, for example, enterprises. So they don’t have to build these products or these useful&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Ingo [00:25:42] Yeah, right now we are not doing this because we have enough to do with the protocol, actually. But like many blockchain companies you see, we also have two parts. We have the Foundation and we have the commercial entity. And the Foundation will always care for the protocol. But then we also have the commercial part. And the commercial part is absolutely free to move into building a service later. But right now, no time for that! But hey, next year things can&nbsp;happen.</p><p>But actually we don’t have any…this company doesn’t have an unfair advantage. It has the same source code as everybody else. And if we say we are going to build Service X, which is the super duper premium wallet for KILT credentials, someone else might come around and build a better one because it’s just normal competition. We don’t have any advantages.We could do that, but we are not even sure that we will. If we do, it must be a really bright idea. And we must also see that no one else is doing something better than&nbsp;that.</p><p>Brad [00:26:55] And you know what’s so exciting is that the protocol itself is the ability, the basis, the foundation for all of the economy to emerge. That’s what I’m hearing from you, is that the token economic design of this is really just to build out the value of the protocol, allow that to be the true core system at play when you can start to build these important credentials the world&nbsp;over.</p><p>So you must be pretty proud of the fact that you’re potentially a world mover here. First mover, rather. Do you know of anyone else in the space, given that you’ve been doing this for a few years, that is doing something similar or doing something even remotely as complex as you in the world of verifiable credentials, in the world of Web 3, in the world of self sovereignty?</p> 10. DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY FOUNDATION <p>Ingo [00:27:42] So that’s a very good question, because we are part of the Decentralized Identity Foundation, which has, I think, more than a hundred, maybe two hundred companies in there. Small ones, blockchain ones like us, but also bigger ones like IBM and Microsoft. We are all organised there. Why did we do that? We saw that if it goes to digital identity, this is a biggie. Right? And we are not competing with our ideas of a decentralised identity with just another small company. We’re competing with the real big ones, the GAFA, right? And so if I come with my little 15-people team here and say now I’m going to compete against the GAFA, I will probably not be successful, especially not if the next project, just a couple of streets down the road, has the same idea and does it a little bit different.</p><p>And so what we need to do is we first have to agree on how we do it and then we have to do it the same way for the user. So the credentials and the DIDs have to look the same way. So already in 2017 we gathered all those companies together and said we have to agree on standards so that we are compatible with each other, even though we might be competitors.Where the DIDs actually emerge from, this is where the verifiable credentials standard emerged from. So there are many companies in this field and they all differentiate a little bit by doing something a little bit different than others. But the credential which you hold in your wallet will basically be compatible with any other.&nbsp;Right?</p><p>And this is absolutely important because otherwise we can’t win. We are all, even if we are Microsoft and IBM, we are too small to win. So we have to put our strengths together and all go to a little bit of a different use case maybe, or go into a different vertical or have some speciality around it. Like maybe we are a little bit better in providing anonymity and we might be a little bit more in the blockchain world, which other companies maybe are not. But in the end the credential is the credential.</p><p>Brad [00:30:14] This is fascinating because I’ve spoken to only one other company in this context before where we were talking about standardisations. And we were talking about global standardisations that were reaching across into the mainstream, into those major players in enterprise, as you mentioned, in Microsoft. So what does that mean for something like KILT? So I can really understand, and everyone listening, when you’re collaborating at that level. When you’re having that inter-discussion about the internet of credentials, essentially. Having that TCP/IP really, to use that analogy, for having that credentials layer. That’s a big deal for every aspect of literally every application, and every person in the world really can benefit from&nbsp;this.</p><p>I’m wondering, why would Microsoft pay attention to little KILT, little KILT Protocol? What’s in it for them? What’s the reciprocal and mutual benefit? Because clearly, no disrespect to you, they have the money, the power, the capital, the centralised systems. But what they don’t have is the years of experience that you’ve had and you’ve built. So are you ahead of the game and they are catching up and working with you for that reason or what’s going on here&nbsp;Ingo?</p><p>Ingo [00:31:23] I think in the beginning of this Decentralized Identity Foundation it was, just, let’s gather the people and start to work on standards. That was the idea. So it’s more like really doing something together and being bigger. And even Microsoft isn’t big enough. They need us. It’s not only us. They need the 200 companies in there as well. And pretty quickly, actually, we took it away from the company-to-company talk because that doesn’t really make sense, because then everybody has their own&nbsp;agenda.</p><p>What we did is we asked and we were successful in asking the World Wide Web Consortium, the W3C to handle the standardisation process for us. So everybody now comes to the table and has their ideas. And so Microsoft has the same say in this as we do. And we all go to the standardisation bodies, bring in our ideas and what comes out is the standardisation. And we say beforehand, no matter what comes out, we are going to agree on that. Right? That’s the stuff that we&nbsp;did.</p><p>Brad [00:32:31] So it’s almost like the UN, Ingo, for credential standardisation, for a revolutionary protocol that’s going to change the game. Once the world comes together on&nbsp;this.</p><p>Ingo [00:32:46] It’s not meeting every day like the UN, but it’s actually…(laughs).</p><p>Brad [00:32:50] It’s mind boggling because we talk about DeFi but we have to have those board members at the dev table. And you’re one of them. So how does it feel to be one in two hundred approximately who are contributing to what is potentially — without trying to understate this — a game-changer for the entire world? I mean, as revolutionary as the internet was, this could be also something of that magnitude. Would you&nbsp;agree?</p><p>Ingo [00:33:14] I wouldn’t say… I would say that what we do with credentials and digital identity is a base layer which is needed for the next generation of the internet, which we normally call the Web 3. Which also needs some more things. But one of them is identity. Definitely. So you have to be able to do digital identity in a way that is self-sovereign — that’s absolutely necessary. No way around&nbsp;that.</p><p>So we are important, but we are only a building block within something much bigger — that is the Web 3 — with things like infrastructure, things like being able to produce blockchains for dedicated use cases, like Polkadot does. Where we need decentralised storage like Filecoin and IPFS does. I think all those things basically have to come together to actually change the world of the internet and bring us into a new and a little bit better scenario with the&nbsp;Web.</p><p>Brad [00:34:23] Well said. And you know what’s great is that you’re embedded, as you articulated. You’re a feature embedded in that layer, that fundamental foundational layer that is going to potentially sweep the globe in that Web 3 scenario. So you’re not something built on top. You’re actually embedded and built in as a key component with the credential aspect and the verifiable credentials specifically.</p><p>So let’s keep going, because there is so much to unpack. And it’s really exciting to talk to you. Your background — I just want to touch on that briefly. So that people understand again, you didn’t just move from an everyday job to build this. You had a lot of experience behind you. So do you just want to give yourself a bit of a&nbsp;plug.</p> 11. INGO’S BACKGROUND <p>Ingo [00:35:06] Yeah, so, after studying I had my first startup in the 90s of the last century. That was something completely different. It was medical informatics. And then we sold this company in 2000, I think, and that was nice. But then I did the thing that the normal serial entrepreneur doesn’t do. I didn’t set up the next company. I went into industry. And I think that was a good learning experience for me, because when you are always an entrepreneur and you’re always the boss, then you actually don’t know, don’t learn how the structures work and how complicated and complex structures work.</p><p>So it was very, very healthy for me to go into big industry for 12 years or so. And I worked mostly with huge publishing companies and media companies and made my industrial career there. And then after that I decided, now I’ve actually seen both things. I’ve seen the small companies, I’ve seen the tech, but I’ve also seen how you actually build business and what the mindset of those people is and what they actually require and how you can talk to those guys. And that’s a knowledge that is really, really valuable.</p><p>And then I decided, when the blockchain thing was coming up, I decided, OK, this is actually the big chance in my life because I understand this technology. How cool. And I know how to build a business and I know the surroundings. I know the needs of the industry. And I can still speak to the blockchain scene people and be respected by them because I studied the right thing. So why not build something there? And then, yeah, I left my everyday job as a CTO and said, OK, now let’s give it a try and build something which is actually useful for the&nbsp;world.</p> 12. KILT USE&nbsp;CASES <p>Brad [00:37:13] Well, let’s start with that comment for the next point of discussion, that’s useful. That is such a rare proof in this space. As you know, with blockchain and crypto coming together to be known as the crypto space, utility and use case, real proveability when it comes to being applied and useful is a rarity and a gem, even today. So are you confident that you really do have something that isn’t just a narrative, isn’t just another scenario with the token economy, but actually something that is genuinely going to be applied and useful for the everyday user who more importantly, does not even need to know about the blockchain.</p><p>Ingo [00:37:51] Yeah, we did a lot of research on that because actually, the idea behind the whole thing of KILT is do something useful and not do something to get rich quick or something. So it’s really about use. And we thought a lot about that. And many of the decisions that we have made are actually driven by this “use”&nbsp;thing.</p><p>So we were seeing that digital identity is really, really interesting. And we were also seeing that everybody is talking about the digital passport and how useful that would be. Actually, it might be useful in some edge cases, but talking to politicians, actually, it’s not going to happen in the next ten years. Because the politicians or the governments, they have a monopoly on identity right now and they don’t want to give it up. And let’s be also fair, it’s working for most people. Those people where it doesn’t work — when you don’t have a passport, when you are a refugee — for those people, it doesn’t work in a nice&nbsp;way.</p><p>My passport works nice, actually. So I don’t need to replace the very, very simple plastic card with a piece of really complicated technology. That’s really hard to explain to someone living in Australia and Germany. And this is maybe going to come — but not today, not tomorrow.</p><p>But then we saw that there’s a huge need in industry actually to have verifiable credentials for services and for things inside the internet. Because the only digital identity mechanism that we have is the OAuth2, which is basically the thing that the GAFA use to centralise the data. And it seems to be quite OK — not understandable for me — but it seems to me seems to be quite OK for people to have their credentials stored with a big American company and not with themselves.</p><p>Brad [00:39:56] No allusion there. Wouldn’t be F and B together, would&nbsp;it?</p> 13. WHY POLKADOT? <p>Ingo [00:39:59] It would be nice if we change that, but obviously this is also not the biggest necessary use case. The biggest necessity use cases are actually for companies, because when I build a product and this product owns a credential, then the credential is part of the value of the product. Right? And then if this credential or the validity of this credential is not with me — it is with Facebook or whoever — this is not acceptable for me as a production company. They need that. So then they need this fully decentralised machine, actually, where there’s no trust needed, where there is truth in there. Right? And there, blockchain is needed, by the way. This is somewhere you can do something useful with blockchain.</p><p>And then you come to the next phase where you go to potential industry partners and say, hey, we’re building this thing and it’s a fully decentralised blockchain and it has the truth in it and it holds your credentials and you hold your credential but it holds the validity. And then they say, OK, nice thing. But unfortunately, your blockchain produces unpredictable production costs. Because sometimes the gas is five euros and sometimes the gas is fifteen euros and sometimes it’s twenty four. And actually we can’t produce things like that because we don’t know how expensive the product is going to be in production so what price point would we&nbsp;set?</p><p>And then you could say, OK, let’s do a permissioned blockchain like Hyperledger, or whatever, and go into that and then you have a predictable price. But unfortunately then you don’t have the truth in the system, right? So you have a dilemma&nbsp;there.</p><p>And this is basically why we moved to Polkadot in 2018 because Polkadot is solving this problem. I think it’s the only technology out there which we have which solves this problem. Because when I have this — it’s called a parachain lease — I actually can build a small blockchain and have predictable gas prices, so I can say making a credential in KILT will never cost more than €0.10 or something. And then they can build their production costs on&nbsp;that.</p><p>But I can also say I have the truth of a truly, fully permissionless blockchain in there because I can send my blocks to the Polkadot Relay Chain and have them verify it for me. And if they are good, then they have the truth in the system again. So I have the mathematical truth and I have the price stability which I need. And we are really trying to make things which are useful and we are reflecting with the people who will use them later. And when they say it doesn’t work this way, then we use the technology or choose the technology that can actually fulfil the requirements of the potential users.</p><p>Brad [00:42:57] And can I just jump in there? Because, I mean, there’s a lot said in there. So clearly, you’re the sort of person who’s paying attention to the optimal blockchain platform; the optimal blockchain, full stack of services and provisions, tools and all the way down to that fundamental code. Now, you talked about Polkadot. Again, everyone knows I’m a fan of that, but I am certainly agnostically positioned in all the space. So I’d imagine you would be too, whether it be Polkadot or whether it be something in the future. The absolute criterion for you is that this system, whichever it is, is the best in the world in what you need. And right now Polkadot clearly is that for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Ingo [00:43:37] Yeah, that’s true. We were brought there by this dilemma of price and truth, so they were solving the price/truth dilemma. So that was clearly where we wanted to be. So this is why we started developing the whole thing on Parity Substrate in October 2018. Parity Substrate was in the beginning at that time, so it improved a&nbsp;lot.</p><p>Brad [00:44:04] That’s why we had the canary&nbsp;network.</p><p>Ingo [00:44:08] And then it turned out that it’s also a nice community actually. And this is another reason to stay because the Polkadot community obviously attracts very, very bright minds. And that is also a thing where we feel very well. Yeah, we feel very well talking to and exchanging with people in a relatively small community when you compare it to Ethereum or so. And a relatively small community which has bright people in there who come up with new ideas, who also criticise you in a positive&nbsp;way.</p><p>Brad [00:44:45] Well, let’s talk about that then Ingo, because we had the co-founder of Ethereum move across and build Parity, Gavin Wood. Then he tinkered with the highest standards of tech to build out what has now become the Polkadot ecosystem. We see that Substrate now emerged. We see Kusama with the canary network, and we see again, from many other key parachain initiatives or potentials, we see also very complex and emerging tech moving out for specific purposes, specific use cases and even more that is just really on the edge of the future of decentralised technologies.</p><p>So this is a very big deal, knowing that we’re talking about interoperability here. Cross collaboration, the potentials of working and enhancing even the likes of Ethereum, for example, and many others to come. So would it be fair in saying that you’re also not only pro Polkadot, but you’re pro interchain. You’re pro bringing things together just like you are with the credentials built into this foundational layer of the&nbsp;future?</p><p>Brad [00:45:44] Surely, because when we listen to Gavin, he doesn’t talk solely about Polkadot, he talks about what’s coming and integrating so much more into a more seamless Web 3&nbsp;world.</p> 14. XCMP and POLKADOT RELAY&nbsp;CHAIN <p>Ingo [00:45:56] Yes, sure. So when you do base layer technology, interconnecting is crucial because people have to somehow use the KILT Protocol. And there are different ways to do that. So for industry players we provide a nice JavaScript SDK on top of that so that they can use their own resources, basically. Because normally big companies have some JavaScript developers. To build KILT applications on top of that, that’s the industry part. We have to cover&nbsp;that.</p><p>We are very happy about XCMP now coming up, the cross-chain messaging protocol, so that we are able to natively speak through the Relay Chain in a very secured way to other projects which are also in the Polkadot ecosystem. And I’m very excited about what’s going to come up there. This technology is brand new, right. So there’s no one really out there already using it. It’s just there. We now know how it works and we start talking with the first projects and say OK, and could we send messages here and there, and start collaborating on this level as well? So this is too new to talk about, basically, but this is very, very exciting for us. And I think it’s a great chance to be an early part of this ecosystem, because in the beginning, it’s going to be relatively small. Right? This is going to grow.&nbsp;Yes.</p><p>And it’s good to be there in the beginning already and have some use cases also inside the ecosystem where we can show that communication through the Relay Chain is very valuable for projects to be part of this ecosystem. This will draw more people inside the ecosystem, which is good for us, because then we have more partners to talk to. And it’s also good for them because if they wait a little longer, they will already find a functioning infrastructure for a lot of problems that they will&nbsp;see.</p><p>Brad [00:47:52] Yes,&nbsp;exactly.</p><p>Ingo [00:47:54] And so it’s good for us to be in early and it’s good for the others that we are in early because we can solve some of their problems. They don’t have to wrap their heads around&nbsp;them.</p><p>Brad [00:48:04] Yes. Well, I want to dig a bit more because everything you’re saying suggests meaningful partnerships, which was on my agenda later in the conversation. But let’s do it now. So earlier in the conversation, you mentioned that blockchain itself is something you are knowledgeable about, or you had some understanding of. That makes you rare. Firstly, when you couple that with all the expertise you had technologically and even in your role as leading out some very important, I guess, engineering roles, important leadership roles, all the things you’ve done in the&nbsp;past.</p><p>Now, when it comes to crypto, we see a lot of partnerships that aren’t meaningful, that are just hype-driven and fomo-driven and drivel-driven. But then we see the ones that aren’t. You know the difference pretty quickly when you start researching why these partnerships happened.</p><p>What’s interesting about you is that you could potentially partner with literally every high quality initiative that is useful in and of itself and in inter-blockchain, inter-multchain scenarios with other core layer one solutions or layer one foundational technologies. And then even outside of the scope of all of those in the mainstream, too, with the compatibility you mentioned, with the alliances you’re forging. So let’s start with the smaller ones. With the Polkadot arena, with the Polkadot potential. Can you tell us a bit more about the meaningfulness or the importance of these relationships you are forging and partnerships. For them, what’s the mutual benefit and why are they saying, yes, partner with us? Because it is happening. It’s unfolding now.</p> 15. ECOSYSTEM COLLABORATION <p>Ingo [00:49:34] Yeah, that’s actually pretty simple. This credential thing and identity thing, I would call it, this is a lot of work. And it’s really not nice if you have a project which needs to identify a person, say you’re building up an exchange, or whatever. If you have a DeFi system where you need some kind of credibility for people in there to calculate their credit score or whatever. You are very often confronted with the problem that you have to identify a person. And then you could go and implement this yourself because there’s a standard or they’ll just use the standard implemented.</p><p>Then you will notice, OK, the standard is maybe not enough. We need some things on top of the standard, like delegated trust and stuff like that, which you come to when you think about it and which are not described in the standard but are implemented already. Then you have two choices. Either you delay your project by one and a half years and start implementing the stuff, or you just use the stuff that is already&nbsp;there.</p><p>Brad [00:50:46] Or you call KILT. That’s what you&nbsp;do.</p><p>Ingo [00:50:50] That’s it, we save the people one and a half years of development work.</p><p>Brad [00:50:56] So let’s be real, I mean, we’ve seen the value of some of these real and meaningful partnerships. Chainlink has led the way with the Oracle endeavour, and I’m sure you’ve seen that because they are essentially an agnostic technology that’s important for the whole space. And they’re working across a multitude of different layer ones. And even layer zeros, as we know Polkadot&nbsp;is.</p><p>So without, again, trying to add any kind of hype, it’s really impossible not to when we know that this is a technology that doesn’t really exist outside of the scope of you in the Polkadot context, I would imagine. Or if it does, there’s few of them. And that means that there’s a very high chance that there’s going to be a vast amount of partnerships because they would all want to add this credential layer&nbsp;in.</p><p>Ingo [00:51:39] Exactly. I think there are two types of partnerships. There is the type of partnership where people just use our system. You don’t have to ask us for that. It’s open source. So that’s the easiest partnership, when we’ve just noticed “Whoops, they are using KILT. That’s cool.” That’s cool for us. But then there are also dedicated partnerships. And we use those partnerships for building things together.</p><p>So this happens, for example, as I said in the beginning with the Polkadex example, that we set something up together because nobody has done that before and we decided that we have to do that together. Right? Or with Moonbeam, we also have a partnership. We’re building something. And this thing only works when we bring the devs together, actually. If we can’t do it alone, they can’t do it alone, let’s let’s work together. This is a partnership which really makes sense because it makes the thing&nbsp;bigger.</p><p>And then we do partnerships and actually also bring development resources to the table. In the normal case, say, the 95% case, it’s just a project which is building something and says, OK, if we use KILT, then we’re faster on the market and it also fits into the ecosystem. And let’s just use those guys. Maybe they call us and say hey, we use you. And of course, they&nbsp;can.</p><p>Brad [00:52:57] This is so fantastic. It’s fantastic to know this is already happening now. You haven’t even launched and really explored publicly what’s unfolding with your whole economy.But to hear that utility is built in now, this is a big deal. Because sometimes we see white papers at launch with other projects, as you would appreciate, or not. So we like to see years of tech built in, years of the team building. And you’ve been doing all of&nbsp;that.</p><p>But on top of that, now you’re starting to be able to be useful, prelaunch, with something that’s going to fuel a broader, more experimental economy on top. So this is a big thing, especially knowing that this is related to something that’s underpinning so much more above, like we see with layers twos and all the applications that can come forth on these new and emerging blockchains.</p><p>Brad [00:53:43] So one of the things you said is “simple”. And often the case is with a great CEO, they won’t explain that simple means very technical. But it does. You know, for you to get to something where it’s seamless and easy and simple for me, it means that it’s years in the making for you. And some of those key things that have come up are things like creating, issuing, verifying, presenting and also claiming when it comes to the digital credentials.</p><p>So do you feel like where you are in your roadmap now, that you can actually achieve those things in reality? When you see these partnerships, when you see these other businesses and entities and protocols start to want and need you as they emerge for the future, are you applied now? Are you usable? Are you ready to go? And is this moving forward something that’s only going to grow and prove itself with real functionality and real application?</p><p>Continue to <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/blockchain-brad-interviews-ingo-rübe-essential-credentials-for-web-3-0-73fdb4ab4427">Part 2</a> of “Essential Credentials for Web 3.0” interview.</p>

<blockquote><p></p><p>“Markets don’t wait for engineering timelines.”</p>–Vinny Lingham</blockquote>



<p>That’s Vinny Lingham describing why <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-announces-integration-with-solana-blockchain/">Civic is integrating with the Solana blockchain</a> in a special AMA last week, featuring a fireside chat with Anatoly Yakovenko, CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>.</p>



<p>As background, Ethereum transaction fees have soared since last summer, blocking the mainstream adoption of DeFi and squeezing companies that depend on a functional blockchain ecosystem. With a second layer solution requiring months of development, chain-agnostic Civic <a href="https://www.identity.com/embedding-identity-into-the-blockchain-with-solana/">and its non-profit partner</a>, Identity.com, are paving a better path by leveraging Solana’s blazing speed and low fees that scale as the ecosystem grows.</p>



<p>Vinny’s point was that companies experiencing the stranglehold of high ETH fees don’t have time to simply wait months for a software fix that may work. There are many available alternatives, including solutions like Solana that are better-positioned for the future.</p>



<p>For its part, Civic believes that with identity as a cornerstone of blockchain infrastructure, a safer, more sustainable financial ecosystem may develop. And, with its unique expertise in identity-based key management and recovery, Civic will help make financial tools more accessible to mainstream consumers.</p>



<p>The journey to working with Solana began several years ago, when Vinny was first introduced to Anatoly in the most unusual way. As Anatoly recounts to Vinny during the virtual event, they met through a mutual friend that plays underwater hockey, back when Solana was looking for its seed round of funding. Anatoly said it really was that weird sport with a small community that led to the check that got the company its start.</p>



<p>Key Takeaways</p>



  <a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=195">03:15</a>: Civic is integrating with the Solana blockchain to leverage blazing speed and scalable fees.  <a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=1398">23:18</a>: Solana CEO Anatoly Yakovenko joined Civic CEO Vinny Lingham for a fireside chat. Spoiler: they met through a mutual friend who played underwater hockey.  <a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=1815">30:15</a>: Why is Solana the right platform for DeFi?  <a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=2715">45:15</a>: The move away from ETH was prompted by high gas fees and a long timeline for Layer 2.  



<p>Other Highlights</p>



<p>During the event, Anatoly and Vinny cover a range of topics, including Solana’s vision for DeFi at inception (<a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=1815">30:15</a>), what it was like last summer when ETH gas prices spiked (<a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=1643">27:23</a>), and what the landscape will look like now that many corporations have invested in cryptocurrency (<a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=2444">40:44</a>). Importantly, they cover the near future of identity. Anatoly notes that the “Summer of DeFi” proved that small groups of 10,000 to 20,000 people can easily organize around the idea. By knowing that a fellow group member is a verified human, the community can very easily build decentralized trust, unleashing a brand new way to connect and take action around good ideas (<a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=2317">38:37</a>).</p>



<p>Check out the full AMA above and hear more about what it takes to move blockchains. With the integration well underway, Civic will have more announcements about <a href="https://civic.finance/">our consumer gateway</a> soon.</p>

<p>The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in partnership with the civil office of fraud enforcement, has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/irswatch/2021/03/06/operation-hidden-treasure-is-here-if-you-have-unreported-crypto-its-time-to-get-legal-advice/?sh=4052c06439c9">rolled out an action plan</a> for cryptoasset enforcement of tax violations, misreporting, and under-reporting. The newly launched "Operation Hidden Treasure" has been specifically designed to ensure cryptoasset tax compliance and prioritize unreported crypto-related income or fraud issues. IRS employees are training with European counterparts at the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL) to promote cross-jurisdictional coordination and enforcement.

				  Professionally-staffed MainNet supports mission-critical, enterprise-grade decentralized identity market solutions   
			   
				
				
				 <p>Technology provider Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation advancing decentralized identity software and solutions, today announced the public availability of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">Indicio MainNet</a>, a professionally-staffed decentralized identity network designed for global enterprises that need a reliable platform to develop and scale identity services and products. The development of the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>-based network follows on the successful deployment of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">Indicio TestNet</a>, a market leader in decentralized identity networks.</p>
<p>The Indicio MainNet uses distributed ledger technology—multiple identical databases spread across different nodes—to enable the use of privacy-preserving verifiable digital credentials. This provides the foundation for flexible, portable, and permanent digital identities that are always under the control of the identity holder—the individual—and which provide an evolutionary leap forward in security.</p>
<p>“Our clients asked for a stable, fully-staffed network based on Hyperledger Indy— one that could provide the&nbsp; Service Level Agreements their customers need for mission-critical workloads,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “Today, we are excited to announce that this MainNet is open for business.”</p>
<p>“This is the network we need to accelerate adoption of passwordless zero trust ecosystems for enterprise customers” said Mike Vesey, President of <a href="https://idramp.com">IdRamp</a>, a leader in decentralized identity and a Genesis Node Operator on the Network. “Our customers are developing service delivery ecosystems that require world class support, and leading edge features managed by a team with deep technical experience. The Indicio network provides exactly that.”</p>
<p>“The Indicio Network enables GlobaliD to deliver a digital identity platform that puts you in control of your identity and your data,” says Mitja Simcic, CTO of <a href="https://global.id">GlobaliD</a>, one of the first companies to use Indicio’s MainNet. “Most digital identity platforms take ownership and control of your digital identity and your data for their own purposes. For instance, social media companies make money from selling your data to unauthorized third parties. Indicio is creating an ecosystem for providers that are working to make this practice obsolete. This network is bringing real change to real people, all over the world.”</p>
<p>The Value of Decentralized Identity<br>Decentralized identity allows individuals to control their own data and solves the privacy and security issues that undermine current models for handling identity online. This privacy-preserving model for identity, where everyone controls their own information, makes it easy for companies and organizations to comply with data privacy laws, makes business partner integrations more secure, and does away with the need for third-parties to manage and hold personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
<p>It is important to note that as part of Indicio’s <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-network-governance/">governance</a>, no personal data, such as names, addresses, or birth dates, are written to any of the Indicio Network ledgers. Instead, machine-readable cryptographic information identifies the issuer of the credential and the details that demonstrate the credential is authentic. With just a few writes to the Indicio MainNet, millions of credentials can be issued, all pointing to the same few ledger writes making the system easily scalable.</p>
<p>How to use the Indicio MainNet<br>Anyone using technology to verify a verifiable credential that is presented to them may access the Indicio MainNet for free. Several wallets currently in production now point to the Indicio Network, enabling credentials to be issued on, and read from, the Indicio Network.</p>
<p>Global innovators interested in becoming part of the Indicio Network are welcome to become an Indicio Node Operator. This diverse, supportive, and collaborative network of dynamic companies, work together to support a copy of the ledger while helping to advance decentralized identity. <a href="https://indicio.tech/node-operator-program/">Learn more</a> about the other benefits of becoming a Node Operator.</p>
<p>Finally, those that want to use the publicly available ledger as a platform for an identity solution may write directly to the Indicio Network. <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1xPes3CuyQqeGBbWU8FtrNQ4frvz">Go here</a> to learn more about how you can write to the Indicio Network today!</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to advancing decentralized identity, Indicio is committed to being a resource hub by providing enterprise-grade open source tools so that everyone can start building solutions today. In addition to the public MainNet, Indicio offers a TestNet, and builds <a href="https://indicio.tech/private-networks/">Private Networks</a>. Indicio’s customizable, instructor-led <a href="https://indicio.tech/training-packages/">training programs</a> are an excellent introduction to understanding how decentralized identity works, and scale to all levels of expertise.</p>
<p>A note on environmental impact<br>As a public benefit corporation, Indicio takes environmental impact seriously. The use of a distributed ledger in decentralized identity does not involve “proof of work” or mining, both of which entail substantial energy costs. Instead, with the optimal network size being 25 or fewer nodes, writing to the Indicio MainNet is energy comparable to logging into a website or sending a form. Much of the activity in a decentralized identity ecosystem takes place off ledger. This all makes decentralized identity a low-energy consumption practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>ABOUT US<br>Indicio.tech provides technology development services for decentralized identity, and offers a complete software ecosystem for business, consumer, and mobile applications to issue, verify, and exchange verifiable digital credentials. Founded on the belief in privacy and security by design, Indicio supports the open source and interoperability goals of the decentralized identity community.</p>
<p>As a Public Benefit Corporation, Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized identity as a public good that enables people to control their identities online and share their data by consent. Identity and application teams rely on Indicio’s simplicity, extensibility, and expertise to make identity work for everyone.</p>

 Ocean Protocol smart contracts and Ocean Market are deployed on a low gas fees network with rapid community adoption <p>As part of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">Ocean’s multi-chain strategy</a>, we have partnered with <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a> (formerly Matic) to bring Web3 Data Economy tools to their chain &amp; ecosystem. Polygon has seen widespread adoption with over 90 dApps, 7 Million transactions, and 200,000 unique users, enabling high-quality user experiences for top dApps like Polymarket, Aavegotchi, Decentral Games, and Neon District. Polygon also offers a strong alternative to the high gas fees on Ethereum, meeting a key goal for Q1 in our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2021-6875bc1f804f">2021&nbsp;roadmap</a>.</p><p>With Ocean deployed to Polygon, this&nbsp;means:</p>  People can use Ocean Market to publish, swap, stake, and consume data assets in Polygon. Transactions now cost mere cents with lower latency. Users simply point their wallet in Metamask to Polygon, and Ocean Market will show data assets registered in the Polygon&nbsp;network.  Data marketplace builders and other dapp developers can use Ocean libraries (ocean.js, ocean.py) and frontend components (react hooks, market) with&nbsp;Polygon.  Token holders can <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/polygon-bridge">move their OCEAN to Polygon as mOCEAN tokens</a> and&nbsp;back.  <p>Ocean components supported in Polygon include: Ocean smart contracts, Ocean Market, <a href="https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/address/0x282d8efCe846A88B159800bd4130ad77443Fa1A1/transactions">mOCEAN smart contract</a>, OCEAN-mOCEAN bridge, Provider (for data services), Aquarius (metadata cache), and Ocean Subgraph (The Graph queries). For more details, visit our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#polygon-mainnet">Supported Networks</a>&nbsp;page.</p><p>The Ocean Protocol deployment to Ethereum mainnet, and related services, including Ocean Market, will continue as&nbsp;before.</p> Cross-chain mental&nbsp;model <p>Prior to Polygon, Ocean Protocol was deployed on Ethereum Mainnet, Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Ganache. An Ocean Market user could change the network by pointing their wallet (e.g. Metamask) to a different network, and Ocean Market would show data assets that are on that network. Ocean.js and ocean.py drivers are similar; the dapp developer simply specifies the “network” URL.</p><p>It’s the same for&nbsp;Polygon.</p><p>Polygon is the first network beyond Ethereum Mainnet that isn’t a testnet, where tokens on the network have real value associated, so token bridges across networks have been&nbsp;built.</p>  OCEAN on Ethereum mainnet gets bridged across as mOCEAN on&nbsp;Polygon.  ETH for gas fees on Ethereum mainnet corresponds to MATIC for gas fees on&nbsp;Polygon.  ETH on Ethereum mainnet gets bridged across as mETH on Polygon, though you won’t need mETH for Ocean&nbsp;Market.   New Datasets and&nbsp;Services <p>People can choose to publish datasets and services in Ethereum or Polygon. With Ethereum, there are higher gas fees and confirmation latency, but in exchange, the UX and familiarity of users is high. For Polygon, the costs and latency are much lower, but users need to use the mOcean bridged&nbsp;tokens.</p> Prior-Published Datasets /&nbsp;Services <p>Let’s say a publisher has an existing dataset/service as an Ocean datatoken contract published on Ethereum, along with a pool of sizable liquidity. They shouldn’t just publish a new datatoken contract to Polygon for the same dataset /service. This would be highly unfair to their existing datatoken holders and stakers on Ethereum because value in the new token siphons value from the&nbsp;old.</p><p>Ideally, there would be bridges for datatokens, just like the bridge for OCEAN. This might seem like it would come out-of-the-box since datatokens follow the ERC20 standard, but alas, it doesn’t work because there are technical “gotchas” related to datatoken metadata and more. These issues are solvable and currently being worked on, but not in time for this first&nbsp;release.</p><p>In the meantime, we have a pragmatic workaround for publishers and stakers. We call it the Republish Rule.</p>  General principle: republishing datasets and services as a new datatoken into Polygon is not unfair if most liquidity has been removed from the datatoken’s pool in Ethereum (low vested interest in the datatoken).  Republish Rule: it’s ok for a publisher to republish a dataset/service as a new datatoken (and pool) in Polygon if there is less than 1000 OCEAN in the dataset/service pool in Ethereum mainnet. Conversely, if they publish while there’s still greater than 1000 OCEAN, this is not ok, and the publisher and the asset will get placed into <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md">Ocean Market Purgatory</a>.  <p>This needs no further software implementation, as it uses the Ocean Market’s existing flows for purgatory. The community can flag assets breaking the republish rule, just as the community has already done for IP violations, sensitive data violations, etc.</p><p>The rule provides a natural incentive for stakers to remove their stake from Ethereum mainnet pools, so publishers can republish in Polygon and for the stakers to follow suit with staking on the&nbsp;new.</p> Further Resources on Ocean *&nbsp;Polygon   Ocean-related tokens and services in Polygon: <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#polygon-mainnet">https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#polygon-mainnet</a>  Tutorial on bridging OCEAN in Ethereum mainnet, to mOCEAN in Polygon: <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/polygon-bridge">https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/polygon-bridge</a>  mOCEAN contract in Polygon blockchain explorer <a href="https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/address/0x282d8efCe846A88B159800bd4130ad77443Fa1A1">https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/address/0x282d8efCe84</a>   Announcement Statements <p>“Polygon has a long history of collaboration with the Ethereum ecosystem with an eye towards scaling and security. The Polygon team has developed a first-class platform for running EVM-based contracts and bridging across chains. It’s our pleasure to leverage Polygon so that our users benefit from far lower gas costs in Ocean Market and in other emerging dapps &amp; protocols that use Ocean,” said Ocean Founder Trent McConaghy.</p><p>Sandeep Nailwal, Co-Founder and COO of Polygon, said, “We’re thrilled to have Ocean Protocol and their revolutionary data marketplace on Polygon. The Ocean Market will allow Dapps to build powerful marketplace-powered applications, leveraging the power of data and Polygon-grade transactions. We’re excited to see what devs&nbsp;build!”</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The OCEAN token is used to stake on data, govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability. OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage&nbsp;volume.</p><p>Visit <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">oceanprotocol.com</a> to find out&nbsp;more.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://blockfolio.com/coin/OCEAN_3">Blockfolio</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH8TXwmWWAE9TZO0yTBHB3A">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ocean_protocol">Reddit</a> | <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram Chat</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">Discord</a></p> About Polygon (Formerly Matic) <p>Polygon is the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development.

<p>(originally sent on Oct 28. <a href="http://eepurl.com/coMMKT">Subscribe to our newsletter now</a>)</p><p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>A major discussion we’ve been continuing internally is about how Bitmark can make the control of digital rights accessible (applicable) to everyone. As hard as we’ve worked in the areas of personal data, healthcare, music, and art, there remains a significant learning curve for most people to join in. Many of us in the United States are used to signing our rights away without really considering what we’re reading. That’s the way it&nbsp;is.</p><p>If you’re now told you should have better control over your rights and this [Bitmark] is a way to do so, it may not seem that obvious that you should care unless you already are someone who protects their rights at every opportunity — for example, maybe you refuse to use Facebook.</p><p>To be honest, most people are not in this bucket. While Bitmark believes in market solutions over well intended (but poorly executed) regulation, the market seemingly says rights are not important. Otherwise the US government wouldn’t be talking about Facebook in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/house-antitrust-committee-facebook-monopoly-buys-kills-competitors.html">monopolistic terms</a>.</p><p>Thus, I have a couple of asks of you this&nbsp;month:</p>  Where are you actively looking to have digital rights control? How could Bitmark&nbsp;help?  CEO Sean often tells me that Bitcoin is the first major success of giving users direct control over a digital asset where control (eg: transfer, subdivide) is based on cryptographic proof instead of trust. Along those lines, if you’re someone who’s passionate about BTC (the ethos behind it, not just a fan of making money from it), please reach out to me. I’d love to understand your relationship with BTC, your current frustrations.  <p>To respond, just reply to this&nbsp;email.</p><p>Continuing on with this question about accessibility, the Oct 19th iteration of the New York Times ON Tech Newsletter discussed what I feel is a way of taking away rights — simply don’t give people information on how to exercise them. I don’t mean the following situation was malicious in intent, but we know that people who need rights the most are the ones most unable to access them. In our first project in public health with UC Berkeley years ago, I remember learning that health research is made up primarily of middle aged white men because they have the resources to access health services, learn of opportunities, time to participate without affecting home life, and the least to lose in terms of potential privacy leaks. The people who could benefit the most from clinical trial research or better decision making from public health institutions were the very people being excluded!</p><p>So I present to you: A new<a href="https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/9DDbf-9Xs2GjjHxABXMsTg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRhcD2cP0TBaHR0cHM6Ly9jZW50cmVjb3VudHl2b3Rlcy5jb20vP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTE1OCZlbWM9ZWRpdF9vdF8yMDIwMTAxOSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD0yMzI3MyZubD1vbi10ZWNoLXdpdGgtc2hpcmEtb3ZpZGUmcmVnaV9pZD05MjQyNzgxNiZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTQxNTAzJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD0xYzc4ZDI0OTU5NmI5YzBiNTFjYzcyOGJiMDI1MmE1YVcDbnl0QgoALJy4jV-hWhosUhNtaWNoYWVsQGJpdG1hcmsuY29tWAQAAAAA"> election information website for Centre County, Pa</a>., that’s as easy to use as your favorite shopping&nbsp;site.</p><p>That’s it.

He was quoted costs of up to $40,000, he said. The county paid nothing for the election services that U.S. Digital Response volunteers helped&nbsp;create.</p><p>Now, about 1,000 people a day visit Centre County’s election website, Pipe said. “It’s been about saving personnel time and a better customer service experience for our residents,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>“You can’t do public policy if you can’t make the damn website work,” is how<a href="https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/pZt4wiAVbJiQpFlwDInaSw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRhcD2cP0TcaHR0cHM6Ly9iZWVja2NlbnRlci5nZW9yZ2V0b3duLmVkdS9wZXJzb24vcm9iaW4tY2FybmFoYW4vP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTE1OCZlbWM9ZWRpdF9vdF8yMDIwMTAxOSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD0yMzI3MyZubD1vbi10ZWNoLXdpdGgtc2hpcmEtb3ZpZGUmcmVnaV9pZD05MjQyNzgxNiZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTQxNTAzJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD0xYzc4ZDI0OTU5NmI5YzBiNTFjYzcyOGJiMDI1MmE1YVcDbnl0QgoALJy4jV-hWhosUhNtaWNoYWVsQGJpdG1hcmsuY29tWAQAAAAA"> Robin Carnahan</a>, a former Missouri secretary of state who is helping lead U.S. Digital Response’s election projects, put it to&nbsp;me.</p><p>Pipe said this is his 18th election as a county commissioner, and it’s a doozy. He said the new website, with clear information and election returns, is also a way for officials to build faith among voters in a year with lots of misinformation and mistrust about the election&nbsp;process.</p><p>In the United States, it took over a hundred years before everyone had the same, equal right to vote. But that hasn’t stopped some from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/24/861776313/federal-judge-rules-florida-law-restricting-voting-rights-for-felons-unconstitut">making it harder for some groups </a>to do so or basically <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/19/903886567/trump-while-attacking-mail-voting-casts-mail-ballot-again">restricting the access</a> to the right if not the right&nbsp;itself.</p><p>This has made me think, shouldn’t equal accessibility to a right be a right, not just the right itself? In the Bitmark sense, we can’t be satisfied with “build it and they will come”. We have to come to you, hold your hand, work with you — whatever it takes to give you the help you&nbsp;deserve.</p><p>Bitmark news and in the&nbsp;news:</p><p>Press</p>  [Chinese] Sean’s Op-ED in DIGITIMES talking about the collaboration with UC Berkeley on the Autonomy community health app:<a href="https://www.digitimes.com.tw/iot/article.asp?cat=158&amp;cat1=20&amp;cat2=25&amp;id=0000596558_6OY6OXAM4BD6NE9S7XPXY">【Sean Moss-Pultz專欄】台灣經驗激靈感 區塊鏈助柏克萊「自由」防疫</a>”  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cateinbigcity/posts/2721520034784658">Sean’s talk with Anchor Catherine Lu</a>.  <p>Our Hope in Crisis Podcast with Girls in Tech&nbsp;Taiwan</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjkISTTSEZI">How a software engineer can influence country’s policies ft.

Understanding GlobaliD’s vision <p>RealVision’s Santiago Velez <a href="https://www.realvision.com/shows/the-interview-crypto/videos/globalid-the-age-of-digital-identity?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=2021312_Crypto_MR_TW_W1_LINK">conducted a super interview with Greg Kidd</a> — and the end result is the best overview we have at the moment of GlobaliD’s vision.</p><p>Here’s an&nbsp;excerpt:</p><blockquote>Very frankly, we’re not excited about, maybe you like hitting ads, I hate that. We hate ads. We don’t believe the world should be built on advertising where the person is turned into the product. But we want people to make money. And so, our alternative vision, and we’re seeing it now with what we call monetization of content, or just NFTs, it’s non-fungible tokens.</blockquote><blockquote>People are willing to pay, they pay for subscriptions to things to get access to data, they pay per view, and they’ll just pay, and they might tip, they might pay for one time use, they might pay for ongoing use. But we see that the economic rights of content or the economic rights of things can be built into those things with lightweight smart contracts. I don’t need to go to Netflix to find out about some good movie on. Oprah will tell me about&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>I saw it on Oprah’s Instagram account, and I clicked on the link. And because I have an identity with a wallet attached to it, either custodial or noncustodial, and Oprah has a wallet and the creator has a wallet, that’s a flat world, and no ads. You could say that me listening to Oprah that Oprah is advertising but that’s not how I see it, I’m just listening to the people or listening to the causes I want. And if they mentioned some content that’s interesting to me, it’s a process of discovery, not advertising.</blockquote><blockquote>And that world can be very flat. It doesn’t mean we have to get rid of the intermediaries. If they really have such a great search engine, but I hate the concept that there’s all these silos and if I have to find the Beatles, I have to go here, because these guys locked it up, or I want to watch the Tour de France and I found out all the exclusive rights were sold to one entity. I’m like,&nbsp;why?</blockquote><blockquote>For all these things with great content, just let the creator create tickets or access and maybe it’s people in the movie that are advertising them. Anywhere you discover content, and you want to watch it, if there’s a model that lets that person who wants to pay for it, pay and reward the creator, and potentially the distributor, just embed those rights directly in the content. So, while we’re talking about GlobaliD for people and groups, things have identity too. Like a lot of diamonds, they last a lot longer than us people. We come and go, but that diamond ring is going to be one hand after another over generations.</blockquote><blockquote>So, put the economic rights into the things. But once again, from a regulation point of view, things ultimately are controlled by people or groups. There’s an ultimate beneficial owner. You could have title registries that don’t have owners in them but that’s silly, like, oh, here’s this great title registry of houses and cars. Well, who’s behind all those? Oh, we don’t know. But it’s really, really efficient, and&nbsp;slick.</blockquote><blockquote>And I’m like, okay, those guns and badges guys, they don’t like that stuff. Yes, technologically, that’s possible but we live still in a world of law and ethics. And so, these trustless systems that don’t have any identity but that are technologically efficient, it’s like that saying “ready, fire, aim”. Just because you can do it, it doesn’t mean you should do&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>And so, we really love all these new defi and registries and title this and non-fungible token that, monetization of content, but on behalf of who? And without identity, you’re back to like the Mad Max world. Why should I give you this? Well, my gun is bigger than yours, or I have bullets and you don’t. Well, okay, that’s a world we can live in. It’s fun to go to the movie theater and see Mad Max, but that’s not the world I want to live in at the end of the&nbsp;day.</blockquote><blockquote>And I want everybody, everybody to have a seat at that table. It doesn’t matter where you are on the economic spectrum, everybody has a right and a responsibility to an identity so they can transact in this world and be equally empowered. It doesn’t matter if you’re the richest or poorest person, like when you need that horse because you got to get out of town, you either have the authentication and the authority to do it, or you don’t and we want that to be a level playing for everyone.</blockquote><p>Check out the full interview:</p>  <a href="https://www.realvision.com/shows/the-interview-crypto/videos/globalid-the-age-of-digital-identity?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=2021312_Crypto_MR_TW_W1_LINK">Globalid: The Age of Digital Identity | Real&nbsp;Vision</a>  <p>Also relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCU32JjOj0A">Greg Kidd: Global Investment Trends for New&nbsp;Unicorns</a>   2.

This week in regulations: <p>We’ve talked quite a bit about Lina Khan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/tim-wu-white-house.html">Enter Tim&nbsp;Wu</a>:</p><blockquote>President Biden on Friday named Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor, to the National Economic Council as a special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy, putting one of the most outspoken critics of Big Tech’s power into the administration.</blockquote><blockquote>The appointment of Mr. Wu, 48, who is widely supported by progressive Democrats and antimonopoly groups, suggests that the administration plans to take on the size and influence of companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, including working with Congress on legislation to strengthen antitrust laws. During his campaign, Mr. Biden said he would be open to breaking up tech companies.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Wu has warned about the consequences of too much power in the hands of a few companies and said the nation’s economy resembled the Gilded Age of the late&nbsp;1800s.</blockquote><blockquote>“Extreme economic concentration yields gross inequality and material suffering, feeding the appetite for nationalistic and extremist leadership,” Mr. Wu wrote in his 2018 book, “The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded&nbsp;Age.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Most visible in our daily lives is the great power of the tech platforms, especially Google, Facebook and Amazon,” he&nbsp;added.</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Wu was a contributing writer for The Times before dropping that position for his appointment to the White&nbsp;House.</blockquote><blockquote>His role, with a focus on competition policy, will be a new one in the National Economic Council. Mr. Wu will also focus on competition in labor policy, such as noncompete clauses enforced by companies, and concentration in power in agriculture and the drug industry. The job does not require Senate approval.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-tech-critics-tim-wu-lina-khan-68af4526-8bd6-48f1-9fe9-f75da80f547b.html">Biden gives tech’s toughest critics seats at the policy&nbsp;table</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcMRr0frKj0">Sorry, Apple: Government Stepping&nbsp;Ina!</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/what-big-tech-antitrust-foe-lina-khan-could-do-at-the-ftc">What Big Tech Antitrust Foe Lina Khan Could Do at the&nbsp;FTC</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-tech-breakups-could-be-good-for-shareholders-the-informations-tech-briefing">Why Tech Breakups Could Be Good for Shareholders: The Information’s Tech&nbsp;Briefing</a>   4.
