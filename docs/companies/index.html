  The UK Crypto Travel Rule has no minimum threshold, as VASPs must collect basic information from all parties in a transaction, regardless of its&nbsp;value.  However, the breadth of information required depends on the transfer value, notably increasing for transactions exceeding £1,000.  With the Crypto Travel Rule active in the UK since September 2023, VASPs must diligently collect, verify, and share virtual asset transaction data to meet compliance standards.  <p>The Crypto Travel Rule came into effect in the United Kingdom <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-in-the-uk-challenges-and-concerns">on September 1st</a>, 2023. This event was a result of a series of regulatory actions, starting on July 22nd, 2021 when <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/amendments-to-the-money-laundering-terrorist-financing-and-transfer-of-funds-information-on-the-payer-regulations-2017-statutory-instrument-2022">the HM Treasury published</a> a consultation seeking views on amendments to the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017.</p><p>It took up to mid-October that year to conclude the consultation, and by July 2022, the United Kingdom had published the amended regulations.</p><p>As part of the new regulations, UK authorities rolled out <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel Rule</a>, a key requirement for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The introduction was followed up with a public consultation on Travel Rule guidance, which concluded on August 25th,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>In between, the FCA had also clearly set out expectations on the nature of compliance that UK VASPs were required to&nbsp;follow.</p> The Genesis and Evolution of the Crypto Travel: UK and Elsewhere <p>The <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-sets-out-expectations-uk-cryptoasset-businesses-complying-travel-rule">Financial Conduct Authority</a> was transparent and articulate about its motivation to implement the Crypto Travel Rule in the country. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/TheFCA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1692166998225010747%7Ctwgr%5Ed1576ae642f907dbed1fd32e3b15eabbc9d640a4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fuk-crypto-travel-rule-comes-into-effect">tweet</a> dated August 17th, 2023, the FCA&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>“The Travel Rule is designed to bring greater transparency to crypto asset transfers, making it harder for criminals to use crypto for illegal activity.”</blockquote><p>In brief, the Travel Rule requires UK-based VASPs to “collect, verify and share information” on crypto transfers.</p><p>For inbound payments from an overseas jurisdiction that has not implemented the Travel Rule yet, the VASPs were asked to conduct a risk-based assessment to ascertain whether the beneficiary qualifies to receive the transfer. The same should apply to outbound transfers.</p><p>Implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule in the United Kingdom had global precedents, as countries like the United States, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, Canada, South Africa, Netherlands, etc., have already adopted&nbsp;it.</p><p>Singapore, for instance, implemented the Travel Rule as early as <a href="https://sumsub.com/blog/what-is-the-fatf-travel-rule/">January 28th, 2020</a>. In Canada, it came into effect on <a href="https://sumsub.com/blog/what-is-the-fatf-travel-rule/">June 1st, 2021</a>. <a href="https://sumsub.com/blog/what-is-the-fatf-travel-rule/">South Korea and Estonia</a> implemented the travel rule on March 15th and 25th, respectively. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong</a> enforced the same since June 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>More countries began implementing the Travel Rule after the FATF called out countries to adopt it urgently, after its<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps.html"> March 2022 survey</a> found only 29 of 98 jurisdictions had enforced&nbsp;it.</p> UK Crypto Travel Rule Compliance Requirements <p>The UK Crypto Travel Rule compliance requirements apply to UK-based crypto asset businesses, abbreviated as CBs. The regulations define these businesses as crypto asset exchange providers or custodian wallet providers.</p><p>Crypto asset exchange implies entities that facilitate the exchange of the crypto assets or arrange for it. On the other hand, the job of a custodian wallet provider is to offer services of holding crypto assets and cryptographic keys for its customers or make arrangements towards the&nbsp;same.</p><p>When it comes to CBs collecting, verifying, and sharing the relevant information, the quantum of information to be dealt with depends on the transfer amount. If the crypto asset transfer is worth below 1,000 pounds sterlings, the information includes the name and account number of the originator and the beneficiary.</p><p>If the transfer is worth above 1,000 pounds sterlings, the quantum of information to be collected increases. If the sender or originator of funds is a firm, the CBs would have to ask&nbsp;for:</p><p>(i) Customer Identification Number<br>(ii) Address of the&nbsp;firm.</p><p>And when the sender is an individual, the CBs would have to collect the following:</p><p>(i) Birth certificate number</p><p>(ii) Passport number / National identity card&nbsp;number</p><p>(iii) Date and place of&nbsp;birth</p><p>To be compliant with the regulations, the UK-based CBs would have to conduct rigorous due diligence. It is the firm’s responsibility to become compliant with the Travel Rule, even if the firm is leveraging the services of a third party. The implementation of the rule has to be regularly supervised.</p> How Does the UK Crypto Travel Rule Impact the Crypto Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets? <p>The UK’s adoption of the Crypto Travel Rule has significant implications for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers, altering how they operate and interact within the global market. It mandates a new level of compliance, directly affecting various aspects of their business.</p> 1. Increased Responsibilities <p>UK-based cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers now face additional duties due to the Travel Rule. They must establish systems like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a> or hire third-party services to collect, verify, and share transaction data. This means more work and investment in resources.</p> 2. Cost Optimization and Efficient Data&nbsp;Handling <p>VASPs need to manage the added workload efficiently and cost-effectively. They must develop systems that can securely and swiftly handle data collection and transmission.</p> 3. Transaction Threshold Management <p>A key aspect is managing the transaction threshold, which is set at 100 pounds. Due to the high volatility in the crypto market, determining whether a transaction meets this threshold can be challenging.</p> 4. International Disparities <p>With varying implementations of the Travel Rule globally, UK crypto firms must make strategic decisions on how to interact with jurisdictions that haven’t adopted similar regulations.</p> 5. Gather Necessary Information <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) provides clear instructions for handling transfers to and from jurisdictions without the Travel Rule. UK firms are required to attempt to gather necessary information for outbound transfers and conduct risk assessments for inbound transfers from non-compliant jurisdictions.</p> 6. Adapting to Regulatory Evolutions <p>Lastly, these companies need to keep up with the changes in the Travel Rule and adapt accordingly as global regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies continue to&nbsp;evolve.</p> Travel Rule in the UK vs the World: A Comparison <p>Staying within the broad framework of FATF, different countries have tried different ways to optimize crypto travel rules in their&nbsp;country.</p><p>The United States, for instance, has a threshold of US$3,000. The European Union is yet to activate a threshold as the grace period is ongoing at present, with an enforcement date target of December 30th, 2024. Then, there are countries like Estonia that have already enforced the Travel Rule but have not kept any transaction threshold yet.</p><p>There are also differences in terms of how self-hosted wallets are approached across jurisdictions.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, the requirement is that of collecting information from the VASP’s customers, whereas, in <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Singapore</a> and Germany, the requirement goes a notch higher for identity verification of the unhosted wallet owner. In Switzerland, the requirements ask to establish proof of ownership over and above the identity verification needs.</p><p>With more and more countries implementing the FATF Travel Rule in their jurisdiction, new similarities and differences will&nbsp;emerge.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>While evolution and amendments would be a reality throughout the lifetime of the regulation, the authorities would always have to be mindful of the core purpose of the Crypto Travel Rule, which is to advance the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering</a> mechanism and put a stop to financial crime.</p><p>To achieve this objective, the VASPs need to ensure that suspicious transactions are promptly detected, and effective screening is carried&nbsp;out.</p><p>Fraudulent actors often exploit the pseudonymity of blockchain technology, which only requires knowing the wallet address of the beneficiary and the private cryptographic key of the&nbsp;sender.</p><p>While implementing the Travel Rule is a difficult requirement for crypto businesses to fulfill, it is for the benefit of the industry and its players that the Crypto Travel Rule UK implementation is dealt with utmost sincerity.</p><p>___________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Dear Community,</p><p>Metadium continued to make significant advancements in DID in the year’s second half. As we express our gratitude to everyone who has been with Metadium in 2023, we would like to take a moment to review and summarize the key achievements and developments from the past six months before launching our new goals for&nbsp;2024.</p> Summary   From October to December 2023, 10,191,291 transactions and 41,912 DID wallets were&nbsp;created.  Bokbunja hard fork was successfully applied to the&nbsp;mainnet.  Metadium Mainnet Explorer was renewed following Bokbunja Hard&nbsp;Fork.  The staking contract for Metadium Governance was upgraded.  Announcements were made regarding changes in BP and FeeCollector addresses, staking amounts, and META circulating supply.   Technology Updates:  Q4 Monthly Transactions <p>During the fourth quarter of 2023, there were f 10,191,291 transactions, and 41,912 DID wallets were created.(as of January&nbsp;2nd).</p> Launch of Wepublic&nbsp;Wallet <p>The existing DID wallet service, MYKEEPIN, was renewed and rebranded as Wepublic Wallet. Metadium’s DID technology was implemented in Wepublic Wallet, contributing to Wepublic DAO participants’ identity verification protocol.</p><p>Wepublic supports four decentralized protocols: identity proofing, credentialing, result proofing, and balance proofing. Metadium aims to enhance transparency in society and services within the DAO platform ecosystem by utilizing blockchain technology.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/mykeepin-renewal-open-with-wepublic-wallet-and-adding-dao-functionality-6d733c3f5ad3">here</a>.   Explorer Renewal <p>With the Bokbunja Hard Fork on October 31, the Metadium Mainnet Explorer was renewed. The Explorer was redesigned for improved functionality and usability, serving as the foundation to provide better services to the Community.</p><p>The renewal included a visually comfortable design, easy confirmation of transactions and DID creations, a reflection of Bokbunja Hard Fork details, adding the Name Tag&nbsp;feature.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-explorer-renewal-5db583d05b8a">here</a>.   Bokbunja Hard&nbsp;Fork <p>On October 31, at 12 PM, the Bokbunja Hard Fork was successfully implemented on the mainnet -this groundbreaking upgrade aimed to enhance the Metadium network by introducing features, including fee delegation.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-update-bokbunja-hard-fork-8147ea32080e">here</a>.   Governance BP&nbsp;Upgrade <p>The staking contract is where Metadium governance members store their staking assets. A bulk transfer of staking assets was carried out to upgrade the staking contract. All the assets within the staking contract were transferred to the BP1 node wallet, serving as the contract owner. The total staking amount within the BP1 node wallet was subsequently moved to the newly upgraded staking contract.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-governance-upgrade-dabc9cc693a7">here</a>.   BP Staking Contract Asset&nbsp;Transfer <p>Assets were transferred to standardize the number of staking contracts to 5 million. If the BP quantity exceeded 5 million, the excess amount was unstaked and withdrawn. If the BP quantity was less than 5 million, an additional deposit was made for the insufficient quantity. The remaining amount was transferred to a non-circulating wallet that does not contribute to the circulating supply. Throughout this process, there was a change in the total staking&nbsp;amount.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/bp-staking-contract-asset-movement-amount-320b2e32126e">here</a>.   BP, FeeCollector Address Change and Circulating Supply&nbsp;Update <p>Voter addresses of BPs were changed, and the address of FeeCollector was registered. This change aimed to separate Voter addresses from Staker addresses and directed transaction fees to accumulate in the FeeCollector’s address.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-bp-update-details-b775447240dc">here</a>.   Business Partnerships:  Purchasing META for THEPOL&nbsp;Rewards <p>THEPOL purchases META from the market to use as a reward for app users. As the number of THEPOL users and activities increases, the reward demand grows, and THEPOL buys additional META from the market. This signifies the growth of Metadium’s DApp in&nbsp;action.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/thepol-has-bought-metadium-meta-to-use-as-a-user-reward-f4722257f047">here</a>.

  <p>Let’s continue our discussion on preventing data exfiltration. In previous blogs, we shared Microsoft’s <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/apply-zero-trust-principles-to-authentication-session-management/ba-p/3615343">approach to securing authentication sessions</a> with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation">Continuous Access Evaluation</a> (CAE) and discussed <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/how-tenant-restrictions-v2-can-be-used-to-prevent-data/ba-p/3915339">securing cross-tenant access</a> with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/tenant-restrictions-v2#step-4-set-up-tenant-restrictions-v2-on-your-corporate-proxy">Tenant Restrictions v2</a>. Today our topic is stolen authentication artifacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stolen authentication artifacts – tokens and cookies – can be used to impersonate the victim and gain access to everything the victim had access to. Up until a few years ago, token theft was a rare attack and was most often exercised by corporate Red Teams. Why? Because it’s simpler to steal a password than a cookie. However, with multifactor authentication (MFA) becoming more prevalent, we’re seeing real-life attacks involving artifact theft and replay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before diving into details, it’s important to note that Microsoft recommends that the first line of defense against token theft is protecting your devices by deploying endpoint protections, device management, phishing-resistant MFA, and antimalware, as described in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/11/16/token-tactics-how-to-prevent-detect-and-respond-to-cloud-token-theft/">Token tactics: How to prevent, detect, and respond to cloud token theft | Microsoft Security Blog</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let’s discuss types of authentication artifacts and what techniques are recommended for each type to minimize the impact of theft. All authentication artifacts can be roughly divided into two buckets:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Sign-in session artifacts, maintain single sign-on (SSO) and app state between the client and Entra ID. 
 Apps session artifacts, grant data access to client applications. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be obvious that the first priority would be protecting the most powerful device SSO artifacts - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token">Primary Refresh Tokens</a> (PRT). The good news is that PRTs on all operating system&nbsp;platforms have been hardened against theft from day one. The level of protection depends on operated system capabilities, with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token#how-is-the-prt-protected">Windows offering the strongest protection</a>. PRT protection is not controllable by policy and is always on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offering similar protection for all artifacts is on our roadmap, but delivering these capabilities is going to be a multi-year journey. If you want to learn more about various challenges of building comprehensive protection against token theft, watch this <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/library/presentation/usa/2022/token%20theft%20hip%20kids%20are%20doing%20it%20now%20what%20are%20we%20going%20to%20do%20about%20it">RSA presentation</a>. In the meantime, you can reduce token theft by carefully orchestrating Entra ID security products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Addressing token theft of sign-in session artifacts 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/public-preview-token-protection-for-sign-in-sessions/ba-p/3815756#:~:text=Token%20Protection%20ensures%20that%20tokens%20can%20only%20be,users%20and%20data%20against%20breaches%20involving%20token%20theft.">Conditional Access: Token protection policy</a>&nbsp;offers cryptographic protection against replay of stolen tokens. This feature leverages and builds on top of already existing cryptographic protections of PRTs. When token protection policy is on, use of unprotected sign-in sessions is blocked. In combination with PRT protection always being on, it extends cryptographic protection to all renewable artifacts. Token protection is in public preview for Office and Outlook on Windows. Start in report-only mode first to evaluate the impact for your organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Client Applications that are not yet in scope of token protection can be protected by enabling <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-compliant-network">compliant network check</a> for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access">Entra Global Secure Access</a>. This policy will ensure that authentication artifacts always come from your organization’s network. It means that stolen tokens can only be replayed from your organization’s network, thus significantly reducing blast radius of the attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Addressing token theft of app session artifacts 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on your network configuration, you might be able block usage of stolen access tokens and workload cookies outside of your corporate network by using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-location">Conditional Access: Block access by location</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation-strict-enforcement">strictly enforce location policies for continuous access evaluation (CAE)</a>. This new CAE enforcement mode blocks access from outside allowed IP ranges, thus blocking any usage of stolen tokens from outside your network and significantly reducing blast radius of the attack. To take advantage of this capability, your users must access both Entra ID and workloads from enumerable IP addresses. CAE strictly enforce locations policy can be enforced for corpnet users accessing data via Entra Global Secure Access (GSA) because Entra GSA is able to pass along IP address of user’s device. When configuring <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/security/conditional-access-framework#named-locations">Named Locations</a> in Conditional Access (CA), make sure to include range of IP addresses from which your users access both Entra ID and workloads (e.g. SharePoint Online).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Detecting token theft 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To detect stolen artifacts, you can enable risk detections with Microsoft Entra ID Protection to elevate user risk when token theft is suspected. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#anomalous-token">Anomalous token</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#token-issuer-anomaly">token issuer anomaly</a>, and adversary in the middle detections can be indicative of token theft. Each detection is calculated offline, whereas anomalous token can also be calculated in real-time at sign-in to catch the threat and flag the sign in as compromised. To take full advantage of these detections, we recommend configuring <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies">risk-based access policies</a>&nbsp;to ensure your users have the proper policy controls applied when token theft is suspected. When risk-based access policies are applied against token theft detections, it forces the user to complete multifactor authentication and reset their password, and when applicable, require an admin to revoke user tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation">Continuous Access Evaluation</a> works together with risk-based access policies to block resource access with tainted artifacts. When user risk increases, CAE issues signals to all CAE-capable workloads to enforce risk-based access policy immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As token theft attacks are becoming more prevalent Microsoft constantly improves defenses against such attacks. Stay tuned for new updates in this area soon.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic revealed disturbing data about health inequity. In 2020, the National Institute for Health (NIH) published a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762908/">report</a> stating that Black Americans died from COVID-19 at higher rates than White Americans, even though they make up a smaller percentage of the population. According to the NIH, these disparities were due to limited access to care, inadequacies in public policy and a disproportionate burden of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and lung diseases.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1490134/">NIH</a> further stated that between 47.5 million and 51.6 million Americans cannot afford to go to a doctor. There is a high likelihood that historically underserved communities may use a generative transformer, especially one that is embedded unknowingly into a search engine, to ask for medical advice. It is not inconceivable that individuals would go to a popular search engine with an embedded AI agent and query, “My dad can’t afford the heart medication that was prescribed to him anymore. What is available over the counter that may work instead?”</p>



<p>According to researchers at Long Island University, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/10/health/chatgpt-medical-questions?utm_term=1702293880158317ccf3b5860&amp;utm_source=cnn_Five+Things+for+Monday%2C+December+11%2C+2023&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;bt_ee=LA5o6KArsX9GfxJWhPkiOnYS0SWGPZ%2F998H3drAly7SCVfWOpsmV2lqGaLAR8i2w&amp;bt_ts=1702293880161">ChatGPT is inaccurate 75%</a> of the time, and according to CNN, the chatbot even furnished dangerous advice sometimes, such as approving the combination of two medications that could have serious adverse reactions.</p>



<p>Given that generative transformers do not understand meaning and will have erroneous outputs, historically underserved communities that use this technology in place of professional help may be hurt at far greater rates than others.</p>



 How can we proactively invest in AI for more equitable and trustworthy outcomes? 



<p>With today’s new generative AI products, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">trust, security and regulatory issues remain top concerns for government healthcare officials</a> and C-suite leaders representing biopharmaceutical companies, health systems, medical device manufacturers and other organizations. Using generative AI requires AI governance, including conversations around appropriate use cases and guardrails around safety and trust (see AI US Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, the EU AI ACT and the White House AI Executive Order).</p>



<p>Curating AI responsibly is a sociotechnical challenge that requires a holistic approach. There are many elements required to earn people’s trust, including making sure that your AI model is accurate, auditable, explainable, fair and protective of people’s data privacy. And institutional innovation can play a role to help.</p>



 Institutional innovation: A historical note 



<p>Institutional change is often preceded by a cataclysmic event. Consider the evolution of the US Food and Drug Administration, whose primary role is to make sure that food, drugs and cosmetics are safe for public use. While this regulatory body’s roots can be traced back to 1848, monitoring drugs for safety was not a direct concern until 1937—the year of the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/files/about%20fda/published/The-Sulfanilamide-Disaster.pdf">Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster</a>.</p>



<p>Created by a respected Tennessee pharmaceutical firm, Elixir Sulfanilamide was a liquid medication touted to dramatically cure strep throat. As was common for the times, the drug was not tested for toxicity before it went to market. This turned out to be a deadly mistake, as the elixir contained diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical used in antifreeze. Over 100 people died from taking the poisonous elixir, which led to the FDA’s Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act requiring drugs to be labeled with adequate directions for safe usage. This major milestone in FDA history made sure that physicians and their patients could fully trust in the strength, quality and safety of medications—an assurance we take for granted today.</p>



<p>Similarly, institutional innovation is required to ensure equitable outcomes from AI.</p>



 5 key steps to make sure generative AI supports the communities that it serves 



<p>The use of generative AI in the healthcare and life sciences (HCLS) field requires the same kind of institutional innovation that the FDA required during the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/files/about%20fda/published/The-Sulfanilamide-Disaster.pdf">Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster</a>. The following recommendations can help make sure that all AI solutions achieve more equitable and just outcomes for vulnerable populations:</p>



 
 Operationalize principles for trust and transparency. Fairness, explainability and transparency are big words, but what do they mean in terms of functional and non-functional requirements for your AI models? You can say to the world that your AI models are fair, but you must make sure that you train and audit your AI model to serve the most historically under-served populations. To earn the trust of the communities it serves, AI must have proven, repeatable, explained and trusted outputs that perform better than a human. 



 Appoint individuals to be accountable for equitable outcomes from the use of AI in your organization. Then give them power and resources to perform the hard work. Verify that these domain experts have a fully funded mandate to do the work because without accountability, there is no trust. Someone must have the power, mindset and resources to do the work necessary for governance. 



 Empower domain experts to curate and maintain trusted sources of data that are used to train models. These trusted sources of data can offer content grounding for products that use large language models (LLMs) to provide variations on language for answers that come directly from a trusted source (like an ontology or semantic search).&nbsp; 



 Mandate that outputs be auditable and explainable. For example, some organizations are investing in generative AI that offers medical advice to patients or doctors. To encourage institutional change and protect all populations, these HCLS organizations should be subject to audits to ensure accountability and quality control. Outputs for these high-risk models should offer test-retest reliability. Outputs should be 100% accurate and detail data sources along with evidence. 



 Require transparency. As HCLS organizations integrate generative AI into patient care (for example, in the form of automated patient intake when checking into a US hospital or helping a patient understand what would happen during a clinical trial), they should inform patients that a generative AI model is in use. Organizations should also offer interpretable metadata to patients that details the accountability and accuracy of that model, the source of the training data for that model and the audit results of that model. The metadata should also show how a user can opt out of using that model (and get the same service elsewhere). As organizations use and reuse synthetically generated text in a healthcare environment, people should be informed of what data has been synthetically generated and what has not. 
 



<p></p>



<p>We believe that we can and must learn from the FDA to institutionally innovate our approach to transforming our operations with AI. The journey to earning people’s trust starts with making systemic changes that make sure AI better reflects the communities it serves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this article, we explore the vLEI (verifiable Legal Entity Identifier) and KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure). KERI is the technology that vLEI is built on.</p>
 What is vLEI? 
<p>vLEI is a new form of digitized organizational identity representing a secure digital form of a conventional LEI. To understand these concepts first, we have published <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/" title="articles introducing both LEI and vLEI">articles introducing both LEI and vLEI</a>.</p>
<p>vLEI is also an implementation of Verifiable Credentials, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-management/verifiable-credentials-understanding-key-principles/" title="read our introduction on the concept of Verifiable Credentials">read our introduction on the concept of Verifiable Credentials</a>. In short, “verifiable” means each vLEI credential has cryptographic proof that enables a recipient or Verifier to cryptographically verify its integrity and authenticity.</p>
 What is KERI? 
<p>KERI is a modern Distributed Key Management System (DKMS) and is the protocol on which vLEI is built.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll look at how vLEI builds on the KERI architecture and what the most important KERI features are for vLEI.</p>
 &nbsp;KERI Architecture 
<p>This diagram represents a typical KERI architecture for vLEI. See below for a description of each term included in the diagram.</p>
<p></p>
 Signify Client 
<p>The end user or controller uses a Signify Client instance to perform KERI operations. Only the Signify Client has access to the private keys of the controller. It implements a “Signing at the edge” concept where the private keys are never exposed outside the context of the Signify Client. The Signify Client adds controller signatures to key event log entries.</p>
<p>Signify Client is not an end user application itself. Instead, it is a library that is embedded as a component in other applications, such as mobile wallets, web applications etc.</p>
 KERI Agent 
<p>This is the backend of a Signify Client. The KERI Agent manages the key event logs of each Signify Client and publishes signed key event logs to witnesses.</p>
 Witness Network 
<p>A KERI Witness receives key event logs with controller signatures from KERI Agents. For authenticity, the witness adds witness signatures to the key events, then makes the key event logs available to Verifiers.</p>
 Verifier 
<p>A controller uses Signify Client to create digital signatures and to send presentations of verifiable credentials to Verifiers. The Verifier will access key event logs provided by KERI Witnesses when verifying digital signatures and credential presentations. Comparing key event logs from multiple witnesses lets the Verifier mitigate against duplicity and other types of threats against key event logs.</p>
<p>Many types of applications can act as Verifiers. For example, Verifier functionality could be integrated in the backend of a web application or in document management systems where signatures of signed documents are verified.</p>
 KERI Features 
<p>The KERI key management system has many features. Below I expand on some of the most important features for vLEI.</p>
 Key management 
<p>Key management is the main function of KERI. Key management solves problems such as:</p>
 
 How do you make sure you are using the correct keys with your peers? 
 How do you signal to your peers you have changed or terminated your keys? 
 
 Key Event Log 
<p>The Key Event Log (KEL) is the basic construct of KERI. The KEL is a hash linked chain of key events. A KERI identifier represents a single distinct KEL. The KEL is the cryptographic ledger or block chain of KERI.</p>
<p>Inception, rotation, and interaction are examples of common events in a KEL. Every KEL begins with an inception event followed by other events. The hash value of the first inception event becomes the KERI identifier of a KEL. Many key event logs will be relatively small and rather static with only a few entries.</p>
<p>The controller of a KEL adds its controller signature to each event that gets added to a KEL. As events are added the controller continuously publishes the KEL to one or more witnesses who add their witness signature to each event in the KEL. Once the KEL has been published to witnesses, the KEL becomes immutable, and no past entries in the KEL can be modified or removed. The witness makes the KEL available to Verifiers.</p>
<p>By comparing KELs from multiple witnesses a Verifier can make sure the KEL is authentic and has not, for example, been duplicated, branched, or otherwise tampered with.</p>
 Pre-rotation 
<p>Pre-rotation is a unique feature of KERI, where only the current public key or keys are published in a KEL. Only the hashes or commitments of the next public keys are published. Pre-rotation improves security because no parts of the key material of the next keys are made public.</p>
 Delegation 
<p>KERI delegation is a cooperative mutual agreement between two KERI identifiers. Delegation requires cryptographic commitment from both parties. KERI delegation delegates signing authority to the delegate.</p>
<p>In vLEI, delegation is used between the GLEIF root (a KERI identifier that links back to everything within the eco-system, this link is what provides the delegate-able abilities to vLEI) and external identifiers, and between the GLEIF external and QVI identifiers.</p>
 Multi-sig 
<p>KERI multi-sig is a KERI identifier formed from a group of public keys. Each multi-sig may be given a signing threshold to control who has signing authority and to improve resilience. </p>
<p>For example, a group with a signing threshold of three out of three always requires participation of all members. This threshold sets a strict control on signing authority but does not improve resilience. If any of the members lost control of their key, the group could no longer operate and recover from the loss.</p>
<p>In vLEI currently, the GLEIF root has a threshold of three out of seven. GLEIF external is two out of five. The minimum requirement for QVI and Legal Entity identifiers is a group of two members.</p>
 ACDC credentials 
<p>The wider ‘KERI’ ecosystem provides a verifiable credential format known as Authentic Chained Data Container (ACDC) credentials. Credential chaining is a unique feature of ACDC credentials compared to most other Verifiable Credential formats present today.</p>
<p>When verifying an ACDC credential the Verifier will check the revocation status of the received credential and each of the chained credentials. This allows implementing advanced use cases where, for example, credential revocation authority is delegated to other actors than the issuer of the credential.</p>
<p>In vLEI, every credential is on a chain that leads up to the QVI credential issued by GLEIF (Global LEI Foundation) to the QVI.</p>
 vLEI Trust Model&nbsp;  
<p>The vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework describes the trust model of vLEI in full. This is a distilled view of the most important roles and types of credentials.</p>
 GLEIF 
<p>The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) controls the vLEI root of trust with two multi-sig identifiers: GLEIF root and GLEIF external. The two identifiers are established with a delegation agreement. A member of the GLEIF multi-sig groups is called GLEIF Authorized Representative (GAR). The GARs will perform identity verification needed to issue QVI credentials.</p>
<p>The QVI credential is issued by the GLEIF external identifier to Qualified vLEI Issuers. The root identifier will never issue any credentials. This way the root identifier can remain offline, while only the KEL of the root identifier is made public.</p>
 <p>Figure 2 – GLEIF identifiers for vLEI root of trust.</p> 
 Qualified vLEI Issuer 
<p>The Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) is an organization that has been qualified by GLEIF to act as an issuer of vLEI credentials.</p>
<p>The QVI controls a multi-sig identifier with at least two members and that has established a delegation agreement with GLEIF external. </p>
<p>In addition, a QVI credential is issued by GLEIF external to the QVI. The QVI credential claims contain the LEI code of the QVI. The QVI credential is the top-most credential in the chain of vLEI credentials.</p>
<p>A member of the QVI multi-sig group is called Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorized Representative (QAR). The QARs will perform identity verification needed to issue vLEI, OOR and ECR credentials.</p>
 <p>Figure 3 – GLEIF authorizes the QVI by setting up delegation and issuing a QVI credential.</p> 
 Legal Entity  
<p>The Legal Entity (LE) is an organization that receives the vLEI credential.</p>
<p>The LE controls a multi-sig identifier with at least two members.</p>
<p>A LE-vLEI credential is issued by the QVI to the LE. The LE-vLEI credential claims contain the LEI code and name of the LE. The LE-vLEI credential is chained to the QVI credential of the issuer. </p>
<p>A member of the LE multi-sig group is called Legal Entity Authorized Representative (LAR).</p>
 <p>Figure 4 – The QVI issues a vLEI credential to the Legal Entity.</p> 
<p>The LE may issue OOR and ECR authorization credentials to a QVI, to authorize the QVI to issue individual OOR and ECR credentials on its behalf. The LE may also directly issue individual ECR credentials.</p>
 OOR and ECR Authorization Credentials 
<p>Authorization credentials are issued to the QVI by the LE. The credential’s claims contain the person’s name and role. The authorization credentials are chained to the vLEI credential of the LE. This way the LE has authority to revoke any OOR and ECR credentials. </p>
 OOR Credentials 
<p>Official Organization Role (OOR) credentials are issued to an individual person by the QVI. The credential’s claims contain the person’s name and official role as defined by ISO, from the authorization credential. The OOR credential is chained to the OOR authorization credential.</p>
<p>The QVI will verify information about Official Role assignment such as Chairman of the Board, CEO etc. from public records and perform identity verification needed to issue the OOR credential.</p>
 <p>Figure 5 – An OOR credential has many levels of chaining, leading up to the QVI Credential.</p> 
 ECR Credentials 
<p>Engagement Context Role (ECR) credentials are issued to an individual person either by the LE itself or by the QVI. The credential’s claims contain the person’s name and context role. The role name is context specific and defined by the LE. The ECR credential is either chained to the vLEI credential or the ECR authorization credential.</p>
<p>If the LE issues the ECR credential, then it is the responsibility of the LE to perform identity verification to a level that satisfies requirements of the LE.</p>
<p>If the LE authorizes the QVI to issue the ECR credential, for example to external contractors, then the QVI will perform identity verification needed to issue the ECR credential.</p>
 <p>Figure 6 – An ECR credential has many levels of chaining, leading up to the QVI Credential.</p>

It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>“<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa">Predictoor Data Farming</a>” is a new Ocean incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via 37.5K OCEAN + 20K ROSE (≈$20.5K USD) in weekly extra sales to Predictoor data feeds [1]. This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF71 is live today, Jan 4. It concludes on Jan 11. 150K OCEAN and 20k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF71   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF71 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  Read how to optimize Predictoor rewards&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">here</a>.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $20.5K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Jan 4, 2024: $0.4785 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.1279 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.4785 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $17,944&nbsp;USD  $0.1279 / ROSE * 20,000 ROSE = $2,558&nbsp;USD  Total: $17,944 + $2,558 = $20,502 ≈ $20.5K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

   The new LSM is our most accurate speech model yet, outperforming&nbsp;OpenAI’s Whisper&nbsp;model on short-form English use cases.

<p>Most everyone has heard of large language models, or LLMs, since generative AI has entered our daily lexicon through its amazing text and image generating capabilities, and its promise as a revolution in how enterprises handle core business functions. Now, more than ever, the thought of&nbsp;talking&nbsp;to AI through a chat interface or have it perform specific tasks for you, is a tangible reality. Enormous strides are taking place to adopt this technology to positively impact daily experiences as individuals and consumers.</p>



<p>But what about in the world of voice? So much attention has been given to LLMs as a catalyst for enhanced generative AI chat capabilities that not many are talking about how it can be applied to voice-based conversational experiences. The modern contact center is currently dominated by rigid conversational experiences (yes, Interactive Voice Response or IVR is still the norm). Enter the world of Large Speech Models, or LSMs. Yes,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models">LLMs</a>&nbsp;have a more vocal cousin with benefits and possibilities you can expect from generative AI, but this time customers can interact with the assistant over the phone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past few months, IBM watsonx development teams and IBM Research have been hard at work developing a new, state-of-the-art Large Speech Model (LSM).&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ibm-watson/watson-assistants-new-transformer-architecture-brings-greater-accuracy-with-less-effort-b8badf12864b">Based on&nbsp;transformer technology</a>, LSMs take vast amounts of training data and model parameters to deliver accuracy in speech recognition. Purpose-built for customer care use cases like self-service phone assistants and real-time call transcription, our LSM delivers highly advanced transcriptions out-of-the-box to create a seamless customer experience.</p>



<p>We are very excited to announce the deployment of new LSMs in English and Japanese, now available&nbsp;<a href="https://form.asana.com/?k=ElxhxG66qgc1CJDsehfKYQ&amp;d=8612789739828">exclusively in closed beta</a>&nbsp;to Watson Speech to Text and watsonx Assistant phone customers.</p>



<p>We can go on and on about how great these models are, but what it really comes down to is&nbsp;performance.&nbsp;Based on internal benchmarking, the new LSM is our most accurate speech model yet, outperforming&nbsp;OpenAI’s Whisper&nbsp;model on short-form English use cases.&nbsp;We compared the out-of-the-box performance of our English LSM with OpenAI’s&nbsp;Whisper model across five real customer use cases on the phone, and found the Word Error Rate (WER) of the IBM LSM to be 42% lower than that of the Whisper model (see footnote (1) for evaluation methodology).</p>



<p>IBM’s LSM is also&nbsp;5x smaller&nbsp;than the Whisper model (5x fewer parameters), meaning it processes audio 10x faster when run on the same hardware. With streaming, the LSM will finish processing when the audio finishes; Whisper, on the other hand, processes audio in block mode (for example, 30-second intervals). Let’s look at an example — when processing an audio file that is shorter than 30 seconds, say 12 seconds, Whisper pads with silence but still takes the full 30 seconds to process; the IBM LSM will process after the 12 seconds of audio is complete.</p>



<p>These tests indicate that our LSM is highly accurate in the short-form. But there’s more. The LSM also showed comparable performance to Whisper´s accuracy on long-form use cases (like call analytics and call summarization) as shown in the chart below.</p>







 How can you get started with these models? 



<p>Apply for our closed beta user program and our Product Management team will reach out to you to schedule a call.As the IBM LSM is in closed beta, some features and functionalities are still in development2.</p>

<p>1 Methodology for benchmarking:</p>



 
 Whisper model for comparison: <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages">medium.en</a> 



 Language assessed: US-English 



 Metric used for comparison: Word Error Rate, commonly known as WER, is defined as the number of edit errors (substitutions, deletions, and insertions) divided by the number of words in the reference/human transcript. 



 Prior to scoring, all machine transcripts were normalized using the whisper-normalizer to eliminate any formatting differences that might cause WER discrepancies.

It is used to deploy <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-server">virtual servers</a> or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/bare-metal-dedicated-servers">bare metal servers</a> using different architecture types.</p>



<p>These images are set up so you can provision a server right away; they are prepared with all the configurations needed so you can deploy instances quickly and easily. IBM refreshes stock images, but it is also a good practice to apply the latest fixes and packages provided by each vendor when provisioning an instance.</p>



<p>IBM offers a wide range of options for you to choose from. The main OS that we support on IBM Cloud VPC are Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Windows Server, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Debian, Ubuntu, Rocky Linux, CentOS Stream and Fedora. For more details, <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images#stock-images">see here</a>.</p>



<p>Most of these images are provided by different vendors, and IBM will align to the end-of-support (EOS) dates set by each vendor. To manage the lifecycle of an image, IBM will use three statuses for the stock images, depending on their stage:</p>



 
 Available 



 Deprecated 



 Obsolete 
 



<p>If an OS is still supported by the vendor, the latest stock image released by IBM will always have the “available” status. Older versions will be set to the “deprecated” status.&nbsp;Stock images whose OS has reached end of date set by the vendor will be set to the “obsolete” status.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that while you can deploy instances using available and deprecated images, you will not be able to deploy new instances using an obsolete stock image. For details about end-of-support dates, <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-guest-os-lifecycle">see here</a>.</p>



<p>One of the main benefits of using stock images is that you can deploy instances and start using them right away for any desired task. Stock images can also be used as a base for creating custom images.</p>



 Deploying an instance using stock images 



<p>1. On the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/provision/vs">instance creation page</a>, under the image and profile section, select Change image:</p>







<p>2. A side panel will pop up with all the stock images available so you can select the desired architecture:</p>







<p>3. On the Stock images tab, you can use the filter to type the OS name you are looking for, select it and click on Save:</p>







<p>4. The side panel will close, and you should see the new stock image selected in the UI:</p>







 What are custom images? 



<p>Custom images contain the operating system images with specific configurations customized by each customer, and they are used to create virtual servers with your own settings. Custom images can also include additional software, such as antivirus, databases or other tools. You can create a custom image in two different ways—by using an existing instance with a base stock image that you have previously customized or by creating the image on-premises and importing it.</p>



<p>Unlike stock images, where IBM is responsible for setting and managing the lifecycle status, each owner is responsible for managing and setting the image status (available, deprecated or obsolete) for custom images.</p>



<p>While end-of-support (EOS) images are not automatically moved to “deprecated” like stock images, the same EOS considerations apply. Planning the lifecycle of your images will allow your company to save time and resources and keep striving toward continuous innovation by using the latest OS versions available on the market.</p>



<p>One of the benefits of custom images is being able to save your own settings and configurations. You can use a custom image to deploy additional instances in the same region, manage their lifecycle and use export followed by import into a different region to deploy instances there, as well.</p>



<p>Creating a custom image</p>



<p>1. On the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/compute">VPC menu</a>, select Images and then click on Create:</p>







<p>2. Provide a name for your custom image:</p>







<p>3. You can create a custom image from an existing instance. The instance must be stopped before creating the custom image:</p>







<p>4. You can also create a custom image by selecting the boot volume of an existing instance. Just like in the previous step, the instance must be stopped before creating the custom image:</p>







<p>5. You can also import an image from Cloud Object Storage (COS). The image must be stored in a COS bucket—then you select the location and provide the information about the base operating system that you are importing:</p>







<p>6. Another way to import from COS is by providing the image file URL and then specifying the base OS:</p>







<p>7. Select the encryption type:</p>







<p>8. Optionally, you can manage the lifecycle of your custom image. You can set the deprecation date, obsolete date, or both in advance either by specifying a date or number of days:</p>







 Deploying an instance using a custom image 



<p>1. Under the Image and profile section, click on Change image:</p>







<p>2. After selecting the architecture type, click the Custom images tab and select the custom image you require to deploy an instance and then click Save:</p>







 What are catalog images? 



<p>Catalog images (also called marketplace images by other cloud providers) are existing custom images that you or an IBM partner put into a private or public catalog. Each catalog image will have a tile on the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog">IBM Cloud Catalog</a>. Catalog images are only available on virtual servers; bare metal servers are not supported at this time.</p>



<p>For enterprise accounts, you can use private catalogs to share custom images with other accounts within your enterprise. You can manage access to products for multiple accounts (or only to selected accounts) while those accounts are within the same enterprise. The only limitation is that you can’t put an encrypted image in any catalog and the image must be in the “available” status.</p>



<p>Regarding catalog image lifecycle management, the “available,” “deprecated,” and “obsolete” statuses are managed at the catalog level. The following are the statuses that you can set on the catalog:</p>



 
 “Available” status in VPC is “published/verified” in the Catalog. 



 “Deprecated” status is the same in both VPC and the Catalog. 



 “Obsolete” status in VPC is “archived” in the Catalog. 
 



<p>IBM Partners or ISV can use public catalogs to publicly share images in the IBM Catalog. &nbsp;Public catalog sharing is restricted, and partners and ISVs must follow an onboarding process before being able to share images publicly.</p>



<p>As of today, IBM partners can only onboard free products. However, with future project deliveries, they will also be able to onboard chargeable images and get paid based on consumption by other IBM customers, just like other cloud providers do in their marketplaces.</p>



 Deploying an instance using a catalog image 



<p>1. <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/provision/vs">Under the Image and profile section</a>, select Change image:</p>







<p>2. Under the Catalog images tab, you can select one of the catalog images available to your account:</p>







<p>3. Click on Save and create the instance:</p>







 Learn more 



<p>Depending on what you are trying to accomplish, we provide different types of images for multiple business needs.</p>



<p>If you want an image to quickly deploy an instance, a stock image is the best image type for you. If you want to replicate your configurations or move them to other regions or zones, custom images are the best fit. Finally, if you want to use an image provided by a verified third-party vendor or share your images within your enterprise, a catalog image is the way to go.</p>

   Ready to get a start on understanding the latest digital identity credential standards? Two influential standards, ISO/IEC 18013 and W3C's Verifiable Credentials, offer different solutions for digital identity. Is one clearly better than the other? Well, no. Whether one is better than the other depends on. your use case. Choosing among these standards depends on your users' needs, the browsers you

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Staying informed about the latest digital identity standards and technology is more than a full-time job. Even focusing on just what’s available for the<a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/16/"> identifiers</a> that provide a way to recognize a (digital) identity is enough to keep a person gainfully occupied for a few years. Why a few years, you ask? Because these standards are still under development in many ways – this is a bleeding edge of digital identity. Let’s talk about the two of the most influential standards under development that inform so much of the activity in this space: the ISO/IEC 18013 specifications and the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) Verifiable Credentials.</p>



 The tl;dr 



<p>The<a href="https://www.iso.org/search.html?q=18013"> ISO/IEC 18013</a> family of documents specifies the technical and operational requirements for physical and mobile driver’s licenses (mDL). The mdoc format, part of ISO/IEC 18013-5, refers to the structure and specifications for mobile driver’s licenses and similar electronic ID solutions. (18013-5 and the in-progress 18013-7 are the ones most identity people focus on). If you would like to read and implement according to these standards, be prepared to pay money to access them.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> is a standard developed by the Verifiable Credentials Working Group within the World Wide Web (W3C) consortium. You can use Verifiable Credentials for any type of credential, from educational degrees to government IDs. Unfortunately, the identity industry has confused matters by using the generic term “verifiable credential” to sometimes mean something more or less different from the W3C Verifiable Credential format. If you want to read and implement according to the W3C Verifiabl Credential data format, go for it. Access to the specification is free.</p>



 Comparing mdoc/mDL and Verifiable Credentials 



&nbsp;ISO/IEC 18013-5W3C Verifiable CredentialPurposeDesigned explicitly to represent driver’s licenses and possibly other official IDs in a mobile format. It can be used for “secondary use cases,” such as anything you might use a physical driver’s license for that doesn’t involve driving. The ultimate case of YMMV.A standard that<a href="https://gataca.io/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials/"> can be used</a> for any type of credential, from educational degrees to memberships, and not limited to driving licenses or IDs.Standardizing BodyISO/IEC (a treaty-based, government-supported standards organization)&nbsp;Be prepared to pay to read the standard. If you’d like to<a href="https://www.iso.org/get-involved.html"> participate</a> in developing the standard, you have a few more hoops to jump through.W3C (an industry-based standards organization that uses a tiered model for membership and engagement)&nbsp;Access to the standards is always free. The ability to vote on approving the standard requires a (paid)<a href="https://www.w3.org/membership/"> membership</a>. The ability to be a part of developing the standard or incubating an idea can be part of (paid) membership or (free) invited experts.Privacy and SecurityPrivacy is a strong consideration, but the focus is on a government credential and how governments need to use it. Protections are built in to ensure that data is shared only when necessary and (mostly) based on individual control. Because of the complexity involved, the use of am mDL is, at least as far as the specification is concerned, an in-person action. Remote use of these credentials is still a work in progress.Privacy is a strong consideration for the W3C as well. Since this specification is designed to support a broader set of use cases, there are privacy considerations to help the individual control what data is shared. There are also considerations about what data is collected since not all use cases require the same data.InteroperabilityThe ISO/IEC 18013-5 specification is trying to ensure interoperability across different jurisdictions, ensuring that a mobile driver’s license issued in one state or country can be read and verified in another, assuming both places follow the same ISO standard. Other use cases may take advantage of being interoperable if everyone uses the same format, but it’s worth remembering the underlying assumption of government use.The W3C VC specification is, as noted, designed for broad interoperability across the web. Interoperability means ensuring that various platforms, websites, and services can understand and verify the credentials. The underlying assumption here is that these credentials must be able to support use on the web by anybody, whether they be a company, a government, or the local pizza delivery service.



 Drama! Intrigue! Big Tech! 



<p>What we appear to have here is a general versus specific-purpose identifier format. Why not just use the one that fits your use case? Why all the drama?</p>



<p>In part, it comes down to resource availability. The costs grow for every standard or technology an organization has to support. Developer costs, UX designer costs, support team costs, they all add up. Even organizations the size of Google and Apple would very much like to limit what technologies they have to support. Anything else gets crazy expensive AND frustrates the individuals using their platforms with too many options.</p>



<p>In this case, Apple has<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wallet/get-started-with-verify-with-wallet/"> focused on supporting</a> the ISO specification only, which frustrates some developers. Google hasn’t decided whether it will support one or both of these standards. Outside of browser-land, the European Union is working on an<a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/"> entire digital identity ecosystem</a>. It willsupport use cases in education, social security, and other services; their<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework"> architecture</a> specifically mentions the W3C work.</p>



<p>Let’s not forget that the technology sector loves its ideology wars. From the command line<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war"> editor wars</a> between vi versus emacs to decades of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars"> browser wars</a>, technologists get attached to their favorite tools. This also appears to be playing out here in the mdoc versus VC drama.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>Both ISO’s guidelines and the W3Cs specifications are still evolving. Several critical features are still under active development, sometimes in other standards organizations (I’m looking at you, <a href="https://openid.net/openid4vc/">OpenID Foundation</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/search?name=selective+disclosure&amp;sort=&amp;rfcs=on&amp;activedrafts=on&amp;by=group&amp;group=">IETF</a>). Some of those features are raising <a href="https://github.com/WICG/identity-credential/blob/main/custom-schemes.md">significant concerns</a> from privacy advocates.  If you are going to implement something, be prepared to be flexible to future changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exploring these formats is necessary if you’re moving to a Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) model. But that said, it’s not just about the content of the specifications. Also, review the use cases they are designed to support, what browser you expect your users to use, and even where you are in the world.</p>



 ETA: A Few More Thoughts 



<p>I love it when my posts spark discussion and feedback! <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@aniltj/111692855215449887">Anil John</a> offered some great insight in a thread on Mastodon that I’m sharing here (to keep it in one place) with permission:</p>



<p>❖ The starting point for the W3C VC work and the ISO mDL work were radically different; the mDL work was directly focused on in-person use cases while the W3C work was focused on remote/online use cases. Both are trying to address the other at present, but the starting point has influenced the design choices that are inherent in both standards.</p>



<p>❖ The W3C VCDM is a data model for describing a broad range of credentials and does not explicitly define the protocols used to move credentials defined using the VCDM from point A to Point B (provisioning and presentation)</p>



<p>❖ The ISO mDL is a tightly coupled mix of an explicitly defined set of data attributes that make up a digital version of a driver’s licence AND a protocol interface description for moving a credential composed of those attributes from a mobile device to a reader/verifier using NFC, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Aware protocols (in-person presentation); how that credential is provisioned to the mobile device from an issuing infrastructure is explicitly out of scope for the ISO mDL standard.</p>



<p>❖ The W3C VCDM supports and encourages the use of attribute and vocabulary transparency akin to how schema.org works; the ISO mDL vocabulary is part of the standard and as such is under the control of the ISO working group.</p>

Verida Mainnet is&nbsp;live Verida Network Mainnet is&nbsp;live <p>On December 28th, 2023, Verida Mainnet officially went live, marking the arrival of the first private self-sovereign data network for&nbsp;web3.</p><p>The Verida Network is the first self-sovereign database network for storing private data. The Verida Network is decentralized public infrastructure (DePIN) providing secure and private database infrastructure for users to own and control their private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Today marks a massive milestone for the Verida community. The network is now a reality four years after its beginnings, and two years after the release of the Verida Whitepaper.</p><p>The Verida Testnet has reached over 35,000 accounts in late 2023 and we are excited to migrate those users across to Mainnet as soon as possible.</p> A new era for data control with&nbsp;DePIN <p>The Verida Mainnet launch signifies more than just Verida going live. It’s the start of a new era for personal data ownership. A time where anyone can choose to take control and ownership of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Whether you’re checking into a hotel, signing up for a new app, going to a doctor and filling out patient forms, or joining a crypto exchange, you’re always finding yourself in a situation where you’re handing over licence numbers, passport details, your home address, the list goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>One in two people are victims of data breaches, caused by the centralization of user data, while large corporations have a monopoly over how to use our personal information.</p><p>We have no agency over what information we can share and what we can keep private in any given situation. Every time we share information, we increase our risk of being exposed in a data leak and falling mercy to data&nbsp;theft.</p><p>Verida is changing this status-quo and providing a new architecture for data ownership and application development that puts users front and centre, in control of their digital identity and personal&nbsp;data.</p> The growing Verida ecosystem <p>Verida is not enabling the personal data ownership vision alone. A growing ecosystem has emerged to contribute new capabilities and extensions to the infrastructure stack.</p><p>We’ve been working with key partners across web3, crypto and identity and data ecosystems to bring privacy-preserving decentralized technology to the&nbsp;world.</p>Verida Ecosystem<p>Explore the Verida Ecosystem further&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem">here</a>.</p> Introducing the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet <p>The Verida Mainnet is the production ready deployment of the Verida network for storing private, user data on mainnet storage nodes, controlled by private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>This release includes the deployment of the Verida DID method on Polygon PoS blockchain, enabling users to manage their self-sovereign identities. The Verida developer SDKs now support both Verida Testnet and Verida Mainnet for building dApps that handle private user data. See Developer Docs for more&nbsp;details.</p><p>Existing <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/extras/demos">demo applications</a> have been upgraded to operate on the Verida Mainnet, while the <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a> has been upgraded to support data storage using the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet.</p> Getting started on the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet <p>You will need to update to the latest <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a> (iOS and Android) to access the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet.</p><p>We strongly recommend all Acacia Testnet users migrate their accounts to Mainnet. This process can be managed directly in the latest version of the Verida Wallet. Any data on your Testnet account will be permanently deleted once this process is completed.</p><p>The <a href="http://missions.verida.network">Verida Missions</a> rewards program will continue on the Verida Mainnet. It’s critical that existing Testnet users who have completed activities on Verida Missions, migrate their Testnet account to Mainnet, in order to retain their existing XP&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create a new Mainnet identity from scratch in the Verida&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Important: The Verida Wallet blockchain wallet currently supports testnet blockchain networks. Mainnet blockchain network support will be available shortly. Do not send mainnet tokens to your testnet addresses. See our <a href="https://community.verida.io/user-guides">user guides </a>on using testnet faucets to send tokens to your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Use your Mainnet identity to connect and use these&nbsp;apps:</p>  Verida Missions: <a href="https://missions.verida.network/">https://missions.verida.network/</a>  Markdown Editor (Demo): <a href="https://markdown-editor.demos.verida.io/">https://markdown-editor.demos.verida.io/</a>  <p>Explore the Verida&nbsp;Network:</p>  Network Explorer: <a href="https://explorer.verida.network/">https://explorer.verida.network/</a>  <p>Get started with the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet:</p>  <a href="https://community.verida.io/user-guides/verida-mainnet-soft-launch-user-guide">Verida Mainnet launch user&nbsp;guide</a>   How to migrate to the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet <p>Users on the Acacia Testnet are recommended to migrate to Myrtle Mainnet. This process can be managed directly in the latest version of the Verida Wallet. Any data on your Testnet account will be permanently deleted once this process is completed.</p> Verida Wallet&nbsp;Users   Update to the latest Verida Wallet version (available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verida-vault/id1546599632">Apple App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.verida.vault">Google Play&nbsp;Store</a>)  Choose the Testnet identity you want to migrate, and select “Migrate to Mainnet” on the home&nbsp;screen.  <p>Important: Do not close the Verida Wallet or switch to a different app while it is migrating. As a decentralized network, your mobile device is responsible for replicating your data between networks. It will likely take 2–5 minutes to migrate your data, depending on how many applications and how much data you have stored on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>See the<a href="https://community.verida.io/user-guides/verida-mainnet-soft-launch-user-guide"> Verida Mainnet Launch guide</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p> Application developers <p>Developer documentation has been updated to include details on switching between testnet and mainnet. There are two key changes for application developers to upgrade their applications to use the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet:</p>  Update to latest&nbsp;SDKs  Change network from “TESTNET” to “MAINNET”  <p>See the Developers<a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/extras/migrate-mainnet"> Migrate to Mainnet page</a> in the Developer Portal for more information.</p> Verida Missions and XP&nbsp;Rewards <p>Verida Missions and the <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-missions-now-live-join-the-mission-and-pave-the-way-for-a-decentralized-future-8e9da990c5bb">incentivized testnet program</a> has been instrumental in testing the performance of Verida network infrastructure and Verida applications. We’re thankful for everyone in our amazing community who have participated to&nbsp;date.</p><p><a href="http://missions.verida.network">Verida Missions</a> has now transitioned to the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet.</p><p>Important: You must upgrade your Testnet account to Mainnet to transfer your XP points and be eligible for future&nbsp;claims.</p><p>Your XP rewards will soon be convertible to VDA tokens as we move closer to the token launch. Stay tuned for more information on&nbsp;this.</p><p>This marks the end of our incentivised testnet, and beginning of our ongoing Mainnet rewards program.

Web 3.0 is driven by secure keys, typically represented in hexadecimal, that are pseudo-randomly generated by an initialization vector and complex computational algorithms. We demonstrate that the statistical physical Kirchhoff-law-Johnsonnoise (KLJN) scheme eliminates the additional computational power by naturally generating truly random binary keys to drive the creation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that are appended to an Ethereum blockchain.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12268.pdf">Web 3.0 and a Decentralized Approach to Education</a> Sarah A.

<p>Leading travel industry analyst publication <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/phocuswire/">PhocusWire</a> has chosen Indicio as one of its “<a href="https://www.phocuswire.com/Travel-movers-shakers-newsmakers-2023?utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">Movers and Shakers</a>” of 2023 for developing-award-winning seamless travel technology (with our partner SITA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heathercdahl?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAG1mncB9siO_1vzhRrWgNAtko4MTLPxB4M">Heather C. Dahl</a> was named along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/">OpenAI</a> co-founder and CEO Sam Altman; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/airbnb/">Airbnb</a> CEO Brian Chesky; Steve Hafner, CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kayak/">KAYAK</a>; Vanessa Hudson, CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/qantas/">Qantas</a> Group; Robert Isom, CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-airlines/">American Airlines</a>; Aloke Bajpai, co-founder and group CEO, and Rajnish Kumar, co-founder and chief product and technology officer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ixigo/">ixigo</a>; Alix Boulnois, chief digital officer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/accor/">Accor</a>; Ben Drew, president, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/viator/">Viator</a>; Ethan Lin, co-founder and CEO, and Eric Gnock Fah, co-founder and COO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/klook/">Klook</a>; Rathi Murthy, chief technology officer and president of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/expedia/">Expedia Group</a> Product &amp; Technology; Andreas Slettvoll, co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/chooose/">CHOOOSE</a> ; Johnny Thorsen, vice president of business development for content distribution, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/spotnanatechnology/">Spotnana</a> ; Richard Valtr, founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mewssystems/">Mews</a>; and Rose Yao, vice president of product management, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/">Google</a> for transforming travel in 2023 — and among those to watch in 2024.</p>
<p>Here’s what Dahl had to say about the news.</p>
<p>It’s an honor to be listed among leading innovators who are changing how the world interacts and moves. We founded Indicio to do just this — to remove the friction, the obstacles, and the limitations of how we move through the world, digitally, and to make every interaction simple, seamless, instant.</p>
<p>For travel, this meant reimagining airports without lines, where everything, from check in to border crossing would be digitized and managed with the traveler’s consent — from their sofa.</p>
<p>The solution would be simple to implement across airline systems and radically improve operational efficiency. It would be secure and trustworthy and protect privacy. Everything would be seamless, streamlined, and stress-free. Everything could be integrated from booking to rewards programs to airport services, hospitality and beyond. People could just go and keep moving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, thanks to partners SITA and the Aruba Tourism Authority, that’s what we delivered with the <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-873429964.html">Digital Travel Credential</a>. A seamless solution that works on any system and provides award-winning (<a href="https://indicio.tech/what-the-eic-decentralized-identity-award-means-for-indicio/">KipplingerCole</a> EIC and <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-wins-the-supernova-award-from-constellation-research-for-disruptive-technology-leadership-in-digital-safety-governance-and-privacy/">Constellation SuperNova</a>) privacy protection.</p>
<p>What it means today: You can now cross a border in the time it takes to smile.</p>
<p>What it will mean in 2024: Everything you need as a traveler will be accessible seamlessly — car rental, hotel check in, event booking, you name your need, we’ve got a simple, secure way to integrate it into your experience.</p>
<p>And, because verifiable credentials have digital superpowers, everything can be configured, with the traveler’s consent, to provide boss-level personalized interaction.</p>
<p>We’ve even <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-trusted-copilot-using-decentralized-identity-to-manage-an-ai-virtual-assistant/">shown</a> how verifiable data and identity are essential for AI to access and leverage personal data.</p>
<p>In 2024, travel will show the world a new way of interacting digitally. It’s both a practical solution and a metaphor. With Indicio, we’re broadening the horizons of where you can go and what is possible when you bring the real and digital worlds together.</p>

It leveraged a primitive home grown cloud agent, mediator agent, and edge wallet. During the pandemic times, we were super busy in integrating the platform with Aries Python Cloud Agent, thus making the solution more compliant and standards driven. Post pandemic days, our team was focused on serving a few customers.</p> V2.0 (Q2/2023) — What’s&nbsp;new? <p>This release was unique. Beginning in the year 2023, we completely revamped the architecture of <a href="https://credebl.id">CREDEBL</a> Platform &amp; ADEYA SSI Mobile App / SDK to make it more lightweight, scalable and easy for developers to start developing digital identity solutions on top of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Keeping priority for population-scale demands, we shifted from Aries Python Agent (ACA-Py) to Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ), besides having a single codebase for both cloud (org) agents &amp; mobile edge agents. Now you can set up your organization and AFJ-based multi-tenant agent quickly and thus, be able to start using the platform.</p><p>Some of the key features we added in V2.0&nbsp;are:</p>  Ability to deploy CREDEBL on your own cloud environment, or use&nbsp;SaaS  Aries Framework JS support resulting in — i) W3C JSON-LD credentials, Multi-tenant org agents, ii) Support for did:web, did:key, did:peer, did:cheqd, iii) Mobile &amp; Cloud agents using the same AFJ code&nbsp;base  Bulk issuance of credentials  Passkey authentication using FIDO&nbsp;WebAuthn  Supabase as a database for CREDEBL Platform — using Auth&nbsp;module  Option to deploy the new CREDEBL Studio (UI) on Deno Deploy or on your&nbsp;cloud  CREDEBL Docs built using&nbsp;Astro   DPG Status <p>In October this year, CREDEBL was announced as Open Source under Apache 2.0 license and <a href="https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/10902">registered</a> under the DPGA (Digital Public Goods Alliance) — an United Nations endorsed entity which assesses the DPGs globally and maintains <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/">the registry</a>.</p><p>With the DPG status, CREDEBL is also being used by several Governments for implementing population-scale decentralized digital identity solutions for citizens benefits.</p> Release — v0.2 — beta.03&nbsp;Features <p>We are keen to listen to the demands and expectations from the customers, so are our future roadmap for&nbsp;CREDEBL.</p>  Out-of-band by issuance for multiple credential records  Delete organization invitations  Token based authentication for Aries Agent&nbsp;(AFJ)  Pagination and sorting for tables on connections, issuance, and verification screen  Set organization to private by&nbsp;default  <p>See the full details of the latest release — <a href="https://github.com/credebl/platform/releases">https://github.com/credebl/platform/releases</a></p> What to expect in next major&nbsp;release   Issue &amp; verify JSON-LD credentials  Support for Polygon &amp; Hedera as VDR (Verifiable Data Registry) for writing DIDs, Schemas &amp; Credential Definitions  Support for Keycloak as an IDP &amp; for OpenID4VC  Support for Post-quantum crypto such as Crystal Kyber, Crystal Dilithium  <p>As Simon Sinek says ‘Business is an infinite game and your competition is your former self’, one should continue to improve..</p><p>With that in mind, we look forward to an even brighter and successful 2024.</p>

It was all about getting together to learn, create, and connect. And wow, did it take&nbsp;off!</p><p>By the end of February, it turned into a home for all dreamers, builders, and crypto buffs. It’s been amazing to see how our dedication, teamwork, and innovation brought us all together.</p><p>As the months flew by, we saw so many new faces join. Our Ambassador Program wasn’t just growing — it was thriving.</p><p>And <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-dao/meet-the-wotnot-made-of-fire-release-shyft-dao-nfts-for-all-ambassador-program-members-170b33d855c9">those WotNot Made of Fire NFTs</a> we introduced in June?

Our leaderboard was buzzing with activity, celebrating everyone’s hard work and achievements. It was all about being fair and giving a pat on the back to everyone who contributed.</p><p>We didn’t stop there, though. Extending the NFT minting period and bringing in special NFTs for our Level 2 Ambassadors was our way of saying, “Hey, we see you and appreciate you!”</p><p>Later in the year, we shifted gears to make our engagements even more meaningful. Thanks to your feedback, we brought in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-dao/shyft-daos-november-review-strategic-shifts-fair-play-focus-and-nft-ideas-81279881e161?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">qualitative tasks in November</a>, which added so much more depth to our interactions.</p> Tracking the Roadmap Milestones <p>2023 wasn’t just about community vibes.

We’re leaping in with big plans and dreams. It’s all about building on what we’ve achieved and taking it to the next&nbsp;level.</p><p>So, as we say goodbye to a phenomenal 2023, let’s gear up for another year of making waves, bonding over blockchain, and having a blast while we’re at&nbsp;it.</p><p>Here’s to us — the Shyft DAO community — and all the amazing things we’ll do together in&nbsp;2024!</p><p>_____________________</p><p>The <a href="https://shyftdao.org/">Shyft DAO</a> community is committed to building a decentralized, trustless ecosystem that empowers its members to collaborate and make decisions in a transparent and democratic manner.

 Stakers can claim DF69 rewards. DF70 runs Dec 28 — Jan 4,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 69 (DF69) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 100K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Dec 21, 2023 and ended 12:01am Dec 28. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>“<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa">Predictoor Data Farming</a>” is a new Ocean incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via 37.5K OCEAN + 100K ROSE (≈$27K USD) in weekly extra sales to Predictoor data feeds [1]. This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF70 is live today, Dec 28. It concludes on Jan 4. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF70   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF70 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  Read how to optimize Predictoor rewards&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">here</a>.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $27K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Dec 7, 2023: $0.511 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.0798 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.511 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $19,163&nbsp;USD  $0.0798 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,980&nbsp;USD  Total: $19,163 + $7,980 = $27,142.5 ≈ $27K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 ERC-3643 Validated As The De Facto Standard For Enterprise-Ready Tokenization 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in December 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Ready for an exciting year of tokenization?</p>
<p>Last week, the ERC-3643 standard achieved a significant achievement by attaining<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/ethereum-community-approves-erc3643-as-the-first-tokenization-standard?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">&nbsp;‘Final’ status in its Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)</a>. This indicates its validation by the official Ethereum community.</p>
<p>The EIP is a rigorous process mandatory for all Ethereum-based standards, including prominent ones like ERC-20 and ERC-721. Achieving the final status signifies a major milestone for the tokenization industry, as&nbsp;ERC-3643 now provides an official token standard for compliant tokenization.</p>
<p>As the initial creator of the ERC-3643 standard, we identified an essential requirement for a unified standard to achieve interoperability. From its inception, we committed to an open-source approach. Initially known as the T-REX (Token for Regulated EXchanges) protocol, this protocol embodied our vision for a more interconnected and efficient tokenization ecosystem with built-in compliance.</p>
<p>In 2021, we submitted the T-REX protocol to the EIP, aspiring to establish it as an official standard. This journey, though extensive and intricate, involved the process of evolving from Draft to Stagnant, then to Review, and ultimately achieving Final status after two years of dedicated effort.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Today,&nbsp;ERC-3643 is the de facto standard for enterprise-ready tokenization,&nbsp;with highlights including:</p>
<p>✅ Validated&nbsp;by the Ethereum community: Earning&nbsp;<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3643?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">the ‘Final’ status</a>&nbsp;ensures official recognition and trust from the EVM developer community.</p>
<p>✅ Audited&nbsp;by Hacken:&nbsp;The audit results yielded&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/hacken-grants-tokenization-protocol-erc3643-a-10-10-security-audit-score/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">a flawless score of 10/10</a>, serving as a testament to the high level of security and integrity that the protocol offers.</p>
<p>✅ Supported&nbsp;by institutions: Prominent institutions and firms, like Apex Group, Invesco, Aztec, CMS, DLA Piper, and Polygon have formed<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">&nbsp;a non-profit association</a>&nbsp;to catalyze worldwide adoption of the ERC-3643.</p>
<p>✅ 6-year track record:&nbsp;The standard has been used to tokenize over&nbsp;$28 billion in assets for hundreds of projects over the past six years.</p>
<p>2023 marks the dawn of institutional tokenization, and we believe that institutions will increasingly embrace tokenization.&nbsp;The audited and validated ERC-3643 standard is set to expedite this shift in 2024!</p>
<p>It is an exciting day for Tokeny’s brainchild. We encourage anyone interested in tokenizing or wanting to implement ERC-3643 to access the code on GitHub&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/TokenySolutions/T-REX?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, building a tokenization platform is&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/what-should-you-expect-from-a-tokenization-platform-in-2024/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">more than just deploying smart contracts</a>. We have built a no-code and API-ready platform for enterprises to start securely and quickly with an easy UI and UX.</p>
<p>We wish you a Happy New Year!</p>

<p>“Fast” and “frictionless” onboarding for customers, workers and citizens is an elusive goal. Sure, identity verification is crucial, but so is verifying claims such as educational qualifications, an industry certification, health data, citizen status, residency and more. Striking the right balance with defenses against another, less desirable “F” word—fraud—in a manner that protects privacy and reduces the chances of compromise, yet another challenge</p>
<p>Whether it’s for onboarding, new customer account origination, or provisioning additional digital services to qualified requesters, organizations need to replace and digitally transform outdated and manual verification using AI, data triangulation and machine verification of identity and credentials. The new and better way to do this is to give users reusable, verified “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/07/20/why-reusable-smart-credentials-will-win-over-physical-analog-identity-verification/?sh=6349fdf03373">smart credentials</a>“neatly packaged in a digital identity wallet that users keep up-to-date, present on demand, and grant specific sharing permissions.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials leverage data registries that include trusted databases, decentralized databases, government ID databases, and distributed ledgers. The credential holder mediates between the registry or trusted “issuer” and the verifier authenticating the holder—creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials#:~:text=Verifiable%20credentials%20(VCs)%20are%20digital,ownership%20of%20a%20bank%20account.">triangle of trust.</a> A holder’s credentials can be verified without any data being exchanged – a zero knowledge proof. In this way, verification is assured, privacy concerns are ameliorated, and the risk of identity theft or compromise is minimized or eliminated. Here again, the 1Kosmos architecture excels because this all needs to be done in an auditable, tamper-evident way to ensure high assurance and trust.</p>
 IAM Verified–Quickly, Easily, and Accurately 
<p>In Parts <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">Two</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/ditching-the-feds-why-decentralized-digital-identity-is-key-to-effective-iam/">Three</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/the-immutable-chain-of-custody-why-distributed-ledger-is-critical-to-modern-iam/">Four</a> in this series, we explained how the<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/"> 1Kosmos architecture</a> provides a secure and reliable way to verify user or applicant identity and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">biometrically authenticate</a> them with 99.6% accuracy via decentralized digital identity (DID) mechanisms within our BlockID solution, including a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">reusable digital identity wallet</a> while removing the centralized PII honeypot hackers target for exploitation.</p>
<p>The final pillar of the 1Kosmos <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">architectural advantage</a> is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verifiable-credentials/">Digital Claims and Credentials Verification</a>, which delivers automated, cryptographically secure verification of identity, qualifications, competencies, authority, and more while respecting an individual’s privacy.</p>
<p>Why did we feel this pillar was so important? Because it provides progressively higher levels of identity assurance for authentication and digitally transforms a broad range of business processes—from worker or contractor onboarding to new customer account origination to the provisioning of new digital product lines and beyond. Often, there is more than one type of verifiable data registry utilized, depending on use cases that span:</p>
 
 Education: Utilize a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-credential-repository">credential repository</a> service to provide digital transcripts and digital credentials representing certificates or degrees verified to be earned by the individual 
 Finance: Perform Know-Your-Customer (KYC)- and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)-compliant identity verification using government-supplied <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> and issue a digitally-signed <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-credential">credential</a> 
 Retail: Verify retail and payment account ownership, payment amount, and sufficient permission to approve payment 
 Healthcare: Facilitate patient-approved sharing of electronic healthcare records with a Qualified Health Information Network (AHIN) 
 Government: Enable government agencies to function as Credential Service Providers by performing Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) and issuing a digitally-signed Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) credential certified to NiST 800-63-3 and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a> standards 
 Enterprise: Share current and past employment to prospective employers and other entities that need to verify status 
 
 A Trustworthy Method for Verifying Claims and Credentials 
<p>1Kosmos BlockID automates manual identity and credential verification with a secure, rules-based workflow, reducing errors and improving accuracy. High assurance along with cryptographically secure storage and sharing establish repeatable, high-trust, and seamless re-verification by business partners or by additional lines of business. Key features of the 1Kosmos solution include the following.</p>
 Data Triangulation to Verify Claims Across Trusted Data Sources 
<p>To reach identity verification and authentication assurance to <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a> standards, BlockID triangulates claims across multiple verifiable sources. These include personal details such as the individual’s full name, date of birth, address, place of birth, photo ID, phone number, employer, etc. The triangulation is based upon government- or bank-issued documents such as a driver’s license, national ID card, passport, credit card, and Social Security Number.</p>
<p>Information can be matched across multiple sources to validate documents as current, or flagged as lost or stolen. Our verification accommodates government-issued credentials in 205 countries with +99% identity proofing accuracy and spoofing/counterfeit detection. Verification at lower levels of assurance is achieved through banking, telco (SIM binding), email, Social Security Number, phone number, and more.</p>
<p>This kind of digital verifiable credential can represent all of the same information that a physical credential represents while also including additional assurances against fraud, such as a digital signature.</p>
 Standards-based Design for Maximum Interoperability 
<p>With 1Kosmos, verifiable credentials allow for the digital proofing of an individual’s claims information through public-private cryptography. Our solutions follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model</a> defined at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a>, which provides a common mechanism for the interoperable implementation of digital credentials that are cryptographically secure, tamper-evident, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.</p>
<p>A standardized data model enables credential packaging, cryptographic signing, and proof expression. This creates a verified credential (VC) ecosystem with interoperable credentials that can be processed and understood across and between disparate systems.</p>
 Powerful, Easy-to-Use Administration and DevOps Tools 
<p>We developed the 1Kosmos BlockID platform to require no custom coding, special firewall rules, or unique security configurations. Deployment is simple and fast, with over 50 out-of-the-box <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/">integrations</a> and a robust SDK/API framework that complies with the strictest GDPR, SOC2, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/privacy-by-design-iso-standard/">ISO 27001</a> certification standards for handling and retaining sensitive data.</p>
<p>This enables ID proofing to be quickly integrated into native apps via an API, mobile, web, or desktop integration. This flexible, standards-based approach can meet the needs of virtually any workflow and enables BlockID to satisfy both workforce and customer identity verification.</p>
<p>Our cloud-based administration panel makes configuring and managing the BlockID platform easy. And our <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/">DevX portal</a> provides a hosted sandbox for developers to test FIDO-based authentication and verification options integrated into your applications. The <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=dlverify">Developer Sandbox</a> offers an easy, hands-on way for developers to test use cases using available APIs for FIDO-based <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=passwordless">authentication</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=fidowebauthn">WebAuthn</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=magiclinks">Magic Links</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=dlverify">Driver’s License Verification</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=vc">Verified Credentials</a>, and more.</p>
 A Modern IAM Architecture That Means Business 
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_in/forensic-integrity-services/ensuring-fraud-free-hiring-with-technology-powered-employee-background-check">Ernst &amp; Young survey</a>, nearly 70% of organizations report having manual verification processes that are riddled with errors, highly time-consuming, or both. By automating manual identity and credential verification with a secure, rules-based workflow, BlockID eliminates errors, improves accuracy, and reduces administrative overhead. Its high assurance and cryptographically secure storage and sharing, help establish repeatable, high-trust re-verification by business partners or additional lines of business. And its automated machine verification, combined with the high level of trust from a tamper-proof design, reduces the need for manual reviews and enables digital processes to scale or evolve rapidly.

This summer, we<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/encode-university-hackathon-2023/"> participated in the Encode Future of Blockchain University Hackathon</a>. Over the course of four weeks, university students from blockchain clubs across the world learned about decentralized identity, built projects, and competed for prizes. Read more about our <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/encode-university-hackathon-2023/">bounties</a> and the <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-our-encode-hackathon-bounty-winners/">winners</a>.  At the end of August, SpruceID <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-license-interoperability-event/">hosted the first fully remote asynchronous interoperability test event for mobile driver’s license implementations</a>. This event provided a collaboration forum over the course of two weeks for implementers of the draft technical specification for unattended or fully online presentation of mobile driver’s licenses (ISO/IEC 18013-7). Read more about the event results <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/iso-iec-18013-7-interoperability-event-results/">here</a>.  We rounded out the year by hosting a webinar with GovTech featuring a fireside chat between Wayne Chang, SpruceID Co-Founder and CEO, and Ajay Gupta, Chief Digital Transformation Officer at the State of California DMV. <a href="https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/console/apollox/mainEvent?eventid=4419861&amp;sessionid=1&amp;username=&amp;partnerref=&amp;format=fhvideo1&amp;mobile=&amp;flashsupportedmobiledevice=&amp;helpcenter=&amp;key=2C578405F3FE22F30ADF478630724166&amp;newConsole=true&amp;nxChe=true&amp;newTabCon=true&amp;consoleEarEventConsole=false&amp;text_language_id=en&amp;playerwidth=748&amp;playerheight=526&amp;eventuserid=653726278&amp;contenttype=A&amp;mediametricsessionid=561697865&amp;mediametricid=6227059&amp;usercd=653726278&amp;mode=launch&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">Watch the webinar</a> to learn more about:  How the California DMV is offering mobile driver's licenses and other digital credentials, such as car registrations, to its residents and best practices for success  The importance of open-source development to enable myriad use cases across public and private sectors for verifiable digital identity  The security and accessibility advantages of digitally verifiable credentials     🛠️ Our Products<br>  Credible <p>This year, we’ve been honing in on Credible — an entire credential lifecycle management product with security and privacy at its core. From credential issuance and presentations to updates and revocations, Credible is made to integrate into high-assurance environments that require certain safety and security certifications.</p>  After working with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for 18 months to bring mobile driver’s licenses to residents of California, we were thrilled to help launch the pilot program to allow California residents to <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">download a mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> on their smartphone in August of 2023. This project demonstrated a successful implementation of Credible and our open-source libraries.  We ended this year on a high note with a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/awards/government-eye-on-innovation?utm_source=int-mktg&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2023_ITDIS_SOC_SOC1_EOI23SOCIALBUNDLE">Gartner Eye on Innovation Award for Government</a>. The State of California Department of Motor Vehicles won this award for their Open Source Mobile Wallet for Decentralized Digital Credentials, which was built by SpruceID. We couldn’t be more proud to have played a role in winning such a prestigious award.   SpruceKit <p>If you’ve been keeping up with our developer community, you may be familiar with many of our open-source libraries, such as Sign-In with Ethereum, DIDKit, and TreeLDR. This year, we moved these open-source libraries all under SpruceKit, an open-source toolkit for decentralized identity. SpruceKit enables secure wallet construction by allowing builders to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with data vaults.</p><p>Sign-In with Ethereum</p>  As of the end of this year, Sign-in with Ethereum has 2,890,141 total downloads on NPM (and 2,000,000 just in this year alone), as well as 53,848 downloads on PyPI!  This year, we <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-integrates-sign-in-with-ethereum-into-metamask-for-better-user-experience-and-safety/">integrated Sign-In with Ethereum into Metamask</a>. These efforts to provide user-friendly security and safety enhancements across Web3 wallet experiences should increase users' confidence in interacting with dapps.  <p>Kepler</p>  Kepler had an extensive refactor to extract the core logic into a new crate separate from the HTTP API and to implement its state tracking using SQL (SQLite, Postgres, and MySQL are supported) (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/143?ref=blog.spruceid.com">kepler #143</a>).  This year, we added support for a capability read function so clients can read capabilities delegated to them and others if authorized (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/134?ref=blog.spruceid.com">kepler #134</a>).  We moved host key management into the OrbitDatabase in kepler-core via the Secrets trait and provided an implementation of the trait based on simple per-orbit derivation from a static secret (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/146?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#146</a>).  <p>SSI/DIDKit</p>  Support for DataIntegrityProof proof suites was introduced (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/515?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#515</a>).  We rewrote our VC API implementation in Axum (didkit <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit/pull/351?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#351</a>) and added it to the W3C-CCG interoperability test suites (<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api-test-suite-implementations/pull/64?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#64</a>).  A major refactor of ssi was initiated. This refactor will help us to handle Linked Data better and generally improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised IDs specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#508</a>). The general API redesign is over, and we are now rewriting all ssi tests and making sure the new implementation does not introduce regressions.  <p>TreeLDR</p><p>This year, we improved every aspect of TreeLDR: layouts, DSL, and generators.</p>  Layouts:  We introduced a new version of <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/blob/v0.2/layouts/README.md?ref=blog.spruceid.com">TreeLDR's layouts</a>, simplifying their definition and how developers can interact with them. We are working on the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/tree/v0.2/layouts/book?ref=blog.spruceid.com">layout book</a>, containing an overview and formal specification of TreeLDR's layouts. This update introduces a lot of breaking changes for the better. We are still working on making all TreeLDR features work with these new layouts.    DSL:  We started using RDF as our intermediate representation for layouts. This change will allow the compiler to accept any RDF syntax as input in the future. Besides the TreeLDR DSL, the compiler supports N-Quads (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/108?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #108</a>) and RDF-Turtle (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/119?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #119</a>).  The DSL is not yet compatible with the new layouts. As a first step, we extracted the RDF handling part of TreeLDR's compiler into a separate project, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/inferdf-rs?ref=blog.spruceid.com">InfeRDF</a>. This standalone RDF engine is dedicated to the inference and interpretation of RDF datasets so the compiler can focus entirely on its primary purpose: layouts.    Generators:  We redesigned the Rust code generator to simplify maintenance and future extensions (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/143?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #143</a>), generate code for restricted data types with runtime validation (such as numerical constraints, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/145?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #145</a>), support for default values (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/147?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #147</a>), and more. In addition, the procedural macro used to embed TreeLDR layouts directly in Rust can now use external modules, allowing modular code generation (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/130?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #130</a>). The Rust code generator will be the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/162?ref=blog.spruceid.com">first to support the new layouts</a>.    <p>Rebase</p>  We've added large amounts of prototype work to support two new flows, POAP ownership and NFT ownership (Rebase <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/44?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#44</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/45?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#45</a>), and added basic credential verification to the Rebase witness (Rebase <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/47/files?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#47</a>).  We've added the ability for Rebase Witnesses to arbitrarily validate any VCs that have types supported by ssi (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/69?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #69</a>).  We’ve added the ability to support delegate keys to allow users to issue their own credentials without a signing prompt for each one (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/82?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #82</a>).  <p>SSX</p>  We released support for NextAuth via our ssx-react package <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples/ssx-test-nextauth?ref=blog.spruceid.com">with an example</a> to show how to integrate it.&nbsp;  We reworked the library architecture of SSX. The previous functions of SSX have been moved into a new module named UserAuthorization, which is responsible for end-user signing-related operations. A new storage module was added, which provides functionality to store and retrieve data in Kepler. Check out the <a href="https://www.sprucekit.dev/ssx?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SSX v2.x Docs</a>.  We’ve added Credential Modules, which allow you to fetch credentials issued on <a href="https://issuer.sprucekit.dev/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SpruceKit Credential Issuer</a>, which can be used as a faucet for credentials.  <p>Example Apps</p>  In June, we released three new reference apps, <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-the-sprouts/">The Sprouts</a>, to demonstrate how you can leverage the SpruceKit open-source libraries to introduce decentralized identity in the next app you build. These included an AI chat interface, an app for book reviews, and a sample social networking app.   📝Standards and Working Groups   <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-owf/">We joined OpenWallet Foundation</a> as one of their founding members. The OpenWallet Foundation is a new open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation Europe. This collaborative effort will develop best practices for open-source digital wallet technology.  This year, we continued participating in working groups or global standards bodies and foundations to champion open-source, interoperable solutions that help create a more privacy-forward, user-centric internet. These include W3C working groups, ISO working groups, OpenID Foundation working groups, and more. To learn more about standards we’re contributing to, whitepapers we’ve published, and more, see an example of our quarterly Standards and Working Groups update <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/q2-2023-wgs-udpate/">here</a>.   See you in 2024 <p>2023 was an exciting year full of opportunities and growth. We can’t wait to see what’s in store for 2024 as we continue on with our mission to let users control their identity and personal data across the web in a way that facilitates trusted interactions. Here’s to a fresh new year!</p> <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>VASPs can now take advantage of Veriscope’s <a href="https://demo.usersigning.shyft.network/">User Signing</a> feature to comply with the FATF Travel Rule. This feature not only assists VASPs in meeting their Travel Rule obligations but also equips them to directly request cryptographic proof from users’ non-custodial wallets, which is essential for validating withdrawals and reinforcing the self-custody process.</p><p>The Travel Rule, as established by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), requires Virtual Asset Service Providers to share specific information about the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers. It is aimed at adding transparency to digital asset transactions, which is a key consideration for VASPs that strive to align with international standards while preserving the integrity of their operations.</p><p>To address these regulatory requirements, Shyft Veriscope is specifically designed to help VASPs comply with the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">FATF Travel Rule</a>, with a keen focus on user privacy and data security. This balanced approach is significant in the crypto industry, where the exchange of personally identifiable information (PII) among VASPs is a sensitive matter.</p><p>Through its innovative features like User Signing, Veriscope not only provides a secure and transparent method for compliance but also sets a new standard in the crypto compliance space, demonstrating how regulatory needs can be met without compromising on user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>However, User Signing is just the beginning, as it paves the way for future developments, such as user consent features based on cryptographic keys, furthering our vision of a more empowered, secure, and transparent digital asset ecosystem.</p> Technical Aspect <p>User Signing streamlines the Travel Rule compliance process by providing a VASP-branded interface that guides users from the initial withdrawal request on the VASP’s platform to creating a Veriscope Address Proof with their hardware wallet or other non-custodial wallet, such as those supporting WalletConnect, Metamask, or bitcoin hardware wallets such as Ledger and&nbsp;Trezor.</p><p>The interface seamlessly directs users to the Veriscope User Signing application, where clear instructions and animation help them complete the signing process with their personal crypto wallet. After this, they are automatically redirected back to the VASP’s withdrawal page.</p><p>For more technical details, please refer to our documentation on<a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/latest/learn/addressproofs.html"> address&nbsp;proofs</a>.</p> Installation and&nbsp;Hosting <p>Here’s a brief on the installation process to implement our new&nbsp;feature:</p>  Start by copying the project contents and run scripts into a docker container or final machine destination.

<p>Authors: Yanisa Sunanchaiyakarn &amp; Nuttawut Kongsuwan, Finema Co.&nbsp;Ltd.</p><p>As global business transactions are increasingly conducted online, the rise of digital fraud and impersonation have become a growing threat. Consequently, digital means for the identification and verification of businesses have emerged as indispensable facilitators for seamless business transactions. Nevertheless, cross-border commerce is hindered by the diverse practices, standards, and regulations used by individual countries, presenting a substantial obstacle for businesses.</p><p>The global challenge of identifying businesses saw a significant step forward with the introduction of the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a> by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) in the 2010s. While LEIs have proven to be a successful and reliable means of identifying organizations on a global scale, there remains a gap in effectively identifying organizations’ representatives.</p><p>Consequently, GLEIF has introduced an innovative solution to address this gap through the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a>. The vLEI is a globally interoperable framework that enables individuals to digitally verify their status as authorized representatives of LEI-registered organizations worldwide. Stephan Wolf, GLEIF’s CEO, has articulated the necessity and significance of this revolutionary approach in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=F4WGybUNjElwWjeT&amp;v=3mhuL9_q-hs&amp;feature=youtu.be">Organizational Identity and the&nbsp;LEI</a>.</p><blockquote>The vLEI is a globally interoperable framework that enables individuals to digitally verify their status as authorized representatives of LEI-registered organizations worldwide.</blockquote><p>The vLEI harbors the potential to revolutionize the dynamics of digital interactions among organizations, fostering seamless global business transactions online. It is imperative for large organizations and regulators worldwide to diligently heed this transformative advancement.</p><p>In this blog, we provide a visual guide for GLEIF’s vLEI ecosystem and explore how it stands out from any other organizational digital identity infrastructures.</p> vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework <p>In 2022, GLEIF introduced the verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework">Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF)</a>, aligning with the Trust over IP (ToIP) Governance Specifications and Templates. The vLEI EGF meticulously outlines the following details:</p>  Rules, responsibilities, and obligations for all stakeholders involved in the vLEI ecosystem, including GLEIF&nbsp;itself.  Hierarchical relationships among the stakeholders, including organizations and their representatives.  Identity Verification processes for all human stakeholders.  Detailed qualification processes for vLEI issuing stakeholders, known as qualified vLEI issuers&nbsp;(QVIs).  Technical specifications for the management of cryptographic keys and self-certifying identifiers, known as autonomic identifiers (AIDs).  Technical specifications for six types of vLEI credentials.  Rigorous technical and business processes governing the issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials.  <p>According to Drummond Reed, a member of the Trust over IP Foundation Steering Committee, the strategic choice to build vLEI EGF on the ToIP governance model is poised to foster a secure and interoperable system on a global scale. This move has the potential to revolutionize the global digital trust ecosystem, bringing substantial benefits to businesses and individuals across various industries and international borders.</p><p>As of December 2023, the vLEI EGF stands out as arguably the most comprehensive digital identity framework to&nbsp;date.</p> vLEI Stakeholders <p>Within the vLEI ecosystem, there are four key stakeholders that are issuers and holders of vLEI credentials. The key stakeholders include GLEIF, qualified vLEI issuers (QVIs), legal entities (LEs), and organization representatives. The first three in the list are organizations, which are made of representatives who are authorized to participate in the vLEI ecosystem. The overview of all vLEI stakeholders is displayed below.</p>vLEI Stakeholders, including organizations and their representatives.<p>1. Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF): GLEIF appointed representatives, called GLEIF Authorized Representatives (GARs), to participate in the vLEI ecosystem and issue the QVI vLEI Credential. There are three types of GARs as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Root GARs: The root GARs collectively serve as the root of reputational trust of the entire vLEI ecosystem. Root GARs do not directly participate in the vLEI ecosystem but, instead, delegate their authority to internal GARs and external&nbsp;GARs  Internal GARs: The internal GARs participate directly in the vLEI ecosystem as a collective holder of an LE vLEI credential.  External GARs: The external GARs are responsible for the issuance and revocation of QVI vLEI credentials as well as performing identity assurance of&nbsp;QARs.  <blockquote>Note: There are two types of trust in a digital identity system: reputational trust and attributional trust. The former is the human side of trust whereas the latter is the technical side. In the vLEI ecosystem, GLEIF serves as the root of reputational trust, providing trust for identity assurance of all stakeholders. The attributional trust, on the other hand, is purely cryptographic in the vLEI ecosystem and is provided by the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI protocol</a>.</blockquote><p>2. Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI): A QVI is an organization that is qualified by GLEIF to participate in the vLEI ecosystem as an issuer of vLEI credentials. Prior to being a QVI, a candidate organization has to undergo thorough qualification processes by GLEIF to ensure that they are capable financially and technically of issuing vLEI credentials. QVI authorizes two types of representatives:</p>  Designated Authorized Representative (DAR): The DAR of a QVI is the primary representative that is authorized to sign contracts with GLEIF and legal entities. The DAR designates and replaces the QARs of the&nbsp;QVI.  Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorized Representatives (QARs): The QARs are a collective holder of a QVI vLEI credential. The QARs perform identity assurance, issue, and revoke LE, OOR, and ECR&nbsp;vLEIs.  <p>3. Legal Entity (LE): Within the vLEI ecosystem, an LE is an LEI-registered organization. The LEs also appoint two types of representatives:</p>  Designated Authorized Representative (DAR): The DAR of an LE is the primary representative that is authorized to sign contracts with a QVI. The DAR designates and replaces the LARs of the&nbsp;LE.  Legal Entity Authorized Representatives (LARs): The LARs are a collective holder of an LE vLEI credential. The LARs perform identity assurance, issue, and revoke ECR and AUTH&nbsp;vLEIs.  <p>4. Organization Representative: An organization representative is a person who is authorized to represent an LE. Representatives are categorized by either their official or functional roles within their&nbsp;LE.</p>  Official Organizational Role Person (OOR Person): An OOR person represents an LE in an official organizational role.  Engagement Context Role Person (ECR Person): An ECR person represents an LE in a functional role.  <blockquote>Note: A person may hold any number of role vLEI credentials from a single or multiple&nbsp;LEs.</blockquote> Official Organization Role&nbsp;(OOR) <p>In <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/80603.html">ISO 5009</a>, an official organization role (OOR) is defined as an “official role of a person within an organization or legal entity within a particular jurisdiction that is publicly discoverable in formation, registration or other official documents of the organization or legal&nbsp;entity”.</p><p>GLEIF has released the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/code-lists/iso-5009-official-organizational-roles-code-list">Official Organizational Roles (OOR) Code List</a>, comprising over 2000 OORs across 89 jurisdictions. While this list provides an overview of OORs in respective native languages, it is by no means exhaustive, and there are still numerous countries awaiting inclusion.</p><p>A legal entity may assign an OOR that is not in the official OOR code list as long as the OOR is publicly discoverable in a business registry or defined in official documents of incorporation for the organization. For example, Stephan Wolf has an OOR as the CEO of GLEIF. While GLEIF is registered in Switzerland, the CEO role does not exist in the official OOR code list for Switzerland.</p> Engagement Context Role&nbsp;(ECR) <p>An engagement context role (ECR) is loosely defined by GLEIF to widely include as many use cases as possible. Here are some examples of&nbsp;ECRs:</p>  ECR as an “unofficial” organization role: An organization role that is neither publicly discoverable nor defined in official documents may be considered an ECR. For example, an employee could have an ECR as a software engineer.  ECR as an internal functional role: An ECR could be defined and used internally within an LE. For example, an employee who is officially a software engineer could also have an ECR as a Cultural Ambassador.  ECR as an external functional role: An ECR could be defined and used externally to an LE. For example, the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/">European Banking Authority (EBA)</a> may define an ECR called an “<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">EBA Submitter</a>”. An LE may designate an employee to be their EBA Submitter so that the employee may submit a financial report to&nbsp;EBA.   Collective Identifiers for&nbsp;vLEIs <p>The vLEI ecosystem is designed to be used by organizations that are made of humans and inevitably prone to human errors and shortcomings. For the vLEI to be reliably used on the global scale with the utmost trustworthiness, the vLEI EGF chooses a decentralized approach to digital identity management, also known as self-sovereign identity (SSI), to eliminate a single point of failure to the entire ecosystem by a single human administrator.</p><p>On the flip side, the absence of an administrator leaves an organization without a safety net in the case of disastrous mishaps. Consequently, the architecture of decentralized identity management for an organization should prioritize fault tolerance, avoiding dependency on a singular person or key. Otherwise, there’s a potential risk of an organization permanently losing control over its digital identity — such as in the unfortunate event of a key employee’s sudden&nbsp;demise.</p><p>The section outlines how the vLEI EGF specifies the usage of a collective identifier for an organization that is collectively controlled by multiple individuals using the KERI protocol and a multi-signature autonomic identifier.</p> Key Event Receipt Infrastructure <p>To achieve the highest level of security, scalability, and decentralization for the vLEI ecosystem, the vLEI EGF chooses the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a> protocol for the management of cryptographic keys and decentralized identifiers.</p><p>Invented in 2019 by Samuel M. Smith, KERI is a decentralized protocol for the management of cryptographic keys and identifiers that utilizes hash-chain data structures in a similar manner to traditional distributed ledger technology, also known as blockchains. Unlike traditional distributed ledgers, the KERI protocol is not subject to the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/blockchain-trilemma">blockchain trilemma</a> because KERI does not rely on a distributed consensus mechanism such as proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.</p><blockquote>Note: For more information and a glossary related to KERI, I recommend <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/">KERISSE</a>, which is the KERI Suite Search Engine, and an upcoming browser extension <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/test/kerific?level=3">KERIfic</a>.</blockquote> Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs) <p>As mentioned above, GLEIF only provides the root of reputational trust — i.e., human trust — within the vLEI ecosystem. The root of attributional trust — i.e., technical trust — is purely cryptographic and provided by <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">autonomic identifiers (AIDs)</a>.</p><p>Without going into too much technical detail, an AID is a variant of a self-certifying identifier (SCID), which is used within the KERI protocol. This means an AID is derived by a cryptographic protocol in a decentralized manner. An AID has the following properties:</p>  An AID does not rely on any centralized entity, e.g., a human administrator. An AID is derived and controlled purely in a cryptographic manner.  An AID is persistent and is suitable for long-term use. This is because an AID is not tied to a single cryptographic key pair via a mechanism called <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#0a82">pre-rotation</a>.  An AID does not rely on a distributed ledger. However, it may be used in combination with one or more distributed-ledger networks.  An AID is portable across multiple platforms. In the case that an AID is used with a distributed ledger, an AID is not locked to that specific ledger and may be migrated to another&nbsp;ledger.  An AID is quantum-recoverable. In the case that an AID is attacked by a quantum computer, the control over the AID can be recovered from the&nbsp;attack.   Collective AIDs <p>In the KERI protocol, an AID may be cryptographically controlled via a multi-signature scheme that allows multiple individuals, called controllers, to collectively control a single identifier. This makes the KERI protocol and AIDs particularly suitable for organizational uses.</p><blockquote>Note: It is called the multi-signature scheme because multiple digital signatures from multiple private keys are required to control a single&nbsp;AID.</blockquote><p>Arbitrary levels of control authority over an AID may also be given to its controllers. For example, an AID of an LE may be controlled by three LARs — a CEO, an IT administrator, and a human resource manager — with the following control authority:</p>  The CEO of the LE has “2/3” control over the LE&nbsp;AID  The IT administrator has “1/3” control over the LE&nbsp;AID  The human resource manager has “1/3” control over the LE&nbsp;AID  <blockquote>Note: This type of scheme is called a fractionally weighted multi-signature scheme.</blockquote><p>A multi-signature AID requires signatures with a combined control authority of “1” or more. In the above example, the CEO may authorize a transaction with either the IT admin or the HR. However, the IT admin and the HR—without the CEO—are not able to authorize a transaction since their combined control authority is only “1/3” + “1/3” =&nbsp;“2/3”.</p> Multi-device AIDs and&nbsp;MFA <p>The multi-signature scheme also allows an AID to be controlled by multiple devices. For example, an ECR person may control their AID using a mobile phone and a laptop, each having control authority of “1”. In this example, the ECR person may either use their mobile phone or laptop to, e.g., sign a contract with the ECR vLEI credential.</p><blockquote>Note: To be more technically precise, the ECR person uses a private key that is associated with an AID to sign the contract. The AID must be the same as the AID specified in their ECR vLEI credential.</blockquote><p>The multi-signature scheme could be utilized to enable KERI-native multi-factor authentication (MFA). For example, an ECR person may assign “1/2” control over their AID to a mobile phone and another “1/2” to a laptop. In this example, the ECR must use both the mobile and the laptop to, e.g., sign a contract.</p><blockquote>Note: The multi-signature scheme may be used recursively. For example, an LE AID may be controlled by three individuals, each with control authority “1/3”. Each “1/3” could be further divided into two halves using two devices. For more details, see <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/discussions/602">Key Management for Organizational Identity</a> by Samuel M.&nbsp;Smith.</blockquote> AID Management by vLEI Stakeholders <p>The vLEI EGF requires that all vLEI issuing organizations — including GLEIF, QVIs, and LEs — hold collective AIDs using such multi-signature schemes. This enables the maker-checker process that requires the approval of at least two individuals for all workflows related to the issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials.</p><p>An example of the management of the AIDs and associated cryptographic keys for all vLEI stakeholders is shown&nbsp;below.</p>Management of AIDs and associated keys by representatives of vLEI stakeholders.  GLEIF Root AID: The GLEIF Root AID enables the root of reputational trust of the vLEI ecosystem. The role of the GLEIF Root AID is to delegate to GIDA and GEDA. Currently, the GLEIF Root AID is controlled by 7 Root GARs, each with control authority of&nbsp;“1/3”.  <blockquote>Note: Delegation in the vLEI ecosystem utilizes the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#c421">cooperative delegation mechanism</a> in the KERI protocol. It requires a cryptographic commitment from both the Delegator and the Delegate to initialize or update the key states of&nbsp;AIDs.</blockquote>  GLEIF Internal Delegated AID (GIDA): The GIDA is used to participate in the vLEI ecosystem as the holder of the LE vLEI credential. Currently, the GIDA is controlled by the 5 Internal GARs, each with a controlled authority of&nbsp;“1/2”.  GLEIF External Delegated AID (GEDA): The GEDA is used to issue and revoke the QVI vLEI credentials. Currently, the GEDA is controlled by the 5 External GARs, each with controlled authority of&nbsp;“1/2”  <blockquote>Note: The key management for the GLEIF’s AIDs can be inspected from their KERI witnesses as follows: <a href="https://www.gleif.org/.well-known/keri/oobi/EDP1vHcw_wc4M__Fj53-cJaBnZZASd-aMTaSyWEQ-PC2?name=GLEIF%20RoOT">GLEIF Root AID</a>, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/.well-known/keri/oobi/EFcrtYzHx11TElxDmEDx355zm7nJhbmdcIluw7UMbUIL?name=GLEIF%20Internal">GIDA</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/.well-known/keri/oobi/EINmHd5g7iV-UldkkkKyBIH052bIyxZNBn9pq-zNrYoS?name=GLEIF%20External">GEDA</a>.</blockquote>  QVI AID: A QVI AID is delegated by the GEDA and must be controlled by at least 3 QARs where at least 2 QARs are required to authorize issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials. For example, a QVI AID could be controlled by 4 QARs with control authority of [“2/3”, “2/3”, “1/3”, “1/3”] such that the QVI cannot authorize a transaction without either of the first two&nbsp;QARs.  <blockquote>Note: All QVI AIDs are also delegated by the GEDA using the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#c421">cooperative delegation mechanism</a> in the KERI protocol. As a result, key rotation of a QVI AID must be approved by the External GARs. For example, if a QVI wishes to change one of their QARs by rotating the key of the leaving QAR, the QVI must inform the External GARs to approve the key rotation&nbsp;event.</blockquote>  LE AID: An LE AID must be controlled by at least 3 LARs where at least 2 LARs are required to authorize issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials. There is an exception to this rule when an LE has fewer than 3 employees. In this case, the LE cannot directly issue a vLEI credential and must authorize a QVI to issue it on their&nbsp;behalf.  Role AID: There is no requirement for a multi-signature scheme for ECR and OOR persons. An organization representative may control their AID using a single signing key. They may also use a multi-signature scheme to divide the control authority of their AID to multiple&nbsp;devices.   Types of vLEI Credentials <p>The previous sections have outlined the stakeholders, their relationships, and the management of their identifiers, called AIDs, in the vLEI ecosystem. We are now well-positioned to explore what the vLEI credentials actually are. The vLEI credentials, in fact, consist of six types of verifiable credentials that are issued and received by different vLEI stakeholders. Their schemas can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI/tree/dev/schema/acdc">here</a>.</p><blockquote>Note: vLEI credentials utilize<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html"> Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs)</a>, which are considered a variant of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data&nbsp;Model</a>.</blockquote> (1) Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) vLEI Credential <p>A QVI vLEI credential is issued by the External GARs (i.e., the GEDA) to a candidate QVI after they complete the formal qualification process. The issuance of the QVI vLEI credential serves as the formal qualification by GLEIF that the QVI is now eligible to participate in the vLEI ecosystem.</p><p>Before the issuance of a QVI vLEI credential, the External GARs must perform identity verification on all of the QARs. After the issuance of the QVI vLEI credential, if the QVI wishes to add more QARs, the identity of the new QARs must also be verified by the External&nbsp;GARs.</p> (2) Legal Entity (LE) vLEI Credential <p>An LE vLEI credential is issued by a QVI to an LE. The issuance of the LE vLEI credential allows the LE to issue role and AUTH vLEI credentials.</p><p>Before the issuance of an LE vLEI credential, the QARs must perform identity verification on all of the LARs. After the issuance of the LE vLEI credential, if the LE wishes to add more LARs, the identity of the new LARs must also be verified by the&nbsp;QARs.</p><blockquote>Note: A QVI may issue an LE vLEI credential to the GIDA. The GIDA’s LE vLEI was initially issued by <a href="https://provenant.net/">Provenant Inc.</a>, the first&nbsp;QVI.</blockquote> (3) &amp; (4) Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) Authorization (AUTH) vLEI Credentials <p>A QVI AUTH vLEI credential is issued by an LE to a QVI to authorize the QVI to issue a role vLEI credentials, including the LE ECR and LE OOR vLEI credentials. A LAR of the LE has to input the accurate data of their representative — including the legal name and role — in the QVI AUTH vLEI credential. There are two variants of the QVI AUTH vLEI credentials as&nbsp;follows:</p>  OOR AUTH vLEI credential, which authorizes a QVI to issue an OOR vLEI credential  ECR AUTH vLEI credential, which authorizes a QVI to issue an ECR vLEI credential  <p>Before the issuance of a QVI AUTH vLEI credential, the LARs must perform identity verification on the representative, who is either an OOR or ECR&nbsp;person.</p> (5) Official Organizational Role (OOR) vLEI Credential <p>An OOR vLEI credential is a role vLEI credential issued by a QVI to an OOR person. Before issuing an OOR vLEI credential, the QVI must be first authorized by the OOR AUTH vLEI credential, which has been issued by the LE that the OOR person represents.</p><p>Before the issuance of an OOR vLEI credential, the QARs must perform identity verification on the OOR person. The QVI must also verify that the OOR person genuinely holds the specified OOR using official public sources or documents of the&nbsp;LE.</p> (6) Engagement Context Role (ECR) vLEI Credential: <p>An ECR vLEI Credential is a role vLEI credential issued to an ECR person. Unlike other types of vLEI credentials, an ECR vLEI credential may be issued by two approaches as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Direct issuance by an LE: The LARs of the LE perform identity verification on the ECR person and directly issue the ECR vLEI credential.  Issuance by a QVI: The LARs perform identity verification on the ECR person and issue an ECR AUTH vLEI credential to a QVI. The QARs of the QVI then perform identity verification on the ECR person again before issuing the ECR vLEI credential.   Credential Chaining <p>One of the unique properties of vLEI credentials, which utilize authentic chained data containers (ACDCs), is credential chaining. vLEI credentials are chained using strong cryptographic digests, starting from QVI vLEI credentials issued by the External GARs. For example, an OOR vLEI credential of an OOR person is chained in the following manner:</p>  (5) the OOR vLEI credential, which is issued by a QVI, is cryptographically chained to (3) an OOR AUTH vLEI credential issued by an LE that the OOR person represents,  (3) the OOR AUTH vLEI credential is cryptographically chained to (2) an LE vLEI credential that the same QVI issues to the&nbsp;LE,  (2) LE vLEI credential is cryptographically chained to (1) a QVI vLEI credential that the External GARs (GEDA) issue to the&nbsp;QVI  The GEDA is cryptographically linked to the GLEIF Root&nbsp;AID.  <p>Due to credential chaining, every vLEI credential can be cryptographically verified, all the way, to the GLEIF Root&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>Note: The cryptographic digests for ACDCs are generated using the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-2-said-and-acdc-de6bc544b95e">Self-Addressing Identifier (SAID)</a> protocol.</blockquote> Conclusion <p>The verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) has laid a foundation for a globally interoperable digital identity system for organizations. The vLEI EGF defines a hierarchical governance structure where GLEIF is the root of reputational trust. It employs a novel approach to key management using Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) and autonomic identifiers (AIDs) that serve as the root of attributional trust. This approach enables multiple authorized representatives to collectively control their organizations’ decentralized identifiers. Most importantly, the vLEI EGF defines 6 types of vLEI credentials with rigorous cryptographic relationships that reflect the hierarchical structure of the vLEI ecosystem. Every vLEI credential is cryptographically chained and can be verified, all the way, to the GLEIF Root&nbsp;AID.</p><p>The vLEI EGF facilitates the issuance of vLEI credentials, providing the highest level of identity assurance. These credentials enable digital verification of organizations and their authorized representatives globally and across industries. The vLEIs stand as a cutting-edge, interoperable, and decentralized solution in the organizational digital identity ecosystem, positioning them as the utmost secure and trustworthy choice for global business transactions.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-1-comprehensive-overview-212349c09643">vLEI Demystified Part 1: Comprehensive Overview</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Holochain started the year with the release of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-released/">Holochain Beta 0.1.0</a> and it’s been an avalanche of development and achievements since then. We can’t talk about everything here, but want to share some highlights with you. As we bundle up for winter in the northern hemisphere (and rejoice at summer in the southern hemisphere), let’s walk through the year together to remember where we have been.&nbsp;</p> Spring: Holochain Beta <p>The Holochain beta release continued through the spring with <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/tag/dev-tools-explainers/">dev tooling</a>, updates to the 0.1.x series, and even an early release of 0.2.x. Paul d’Aoust started work on our dev documentation and refreshed <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Dev Portal</a>, and the team could feel the excitement as we continued to improve on a stable codebase.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking Holochain back out on the road, we <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-at-ethdenver-2023/">attended EthDenver</a>, hosting a series of satellite events where we gave blockchain devs a hands-on opportunity to feel what Holochain can do, and collectively we imagined the future of the web.</p><p>In March, we had our first of two online <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-training-recap/">Dev Trainings</a>. The course was taught by Marcus Phillips, co-founder of the immersive software engineering school <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/hack-reactor/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hack Reactor</a>, and community developer Guillem Cordoba (check out his work at <a href="https://darksoil.studio/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Dark Soil</a>). The cohort of eighteen students learned how to work with Holochain’s backend code, preparing them to build custom distributed applications.</p><p>This spring we felt Holochain really <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/becoming-viable-seeds-to-saplings/">become viable</a>.</p> Summer: DWeb Camp <p>Summer took us to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dweb-camp-2023-holochain/">DWeb Camp</a>. For those that don’t know it, DWeb Camp is a sort of Mecca for the distributed web community. Getting to think, work, talk, and present alongside and with all of the other projects building the next web (from Filecoin and OpenAI to Secure Scuttlebutt and Spritely) was truly an honor. But we might have learned the most from the <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/fellowships/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb fellows</a> who brought their openness, honesty, situated need, and greatly innovative ideas to the gathering.&nbsp;</p><p>As a co-sponsor of the event, Holochain showed up in force, with dozens of team and&nbsp; community members attending. In addition to presentations, workshops, and panels, we developed a custom app for the event. We decided to create an app for scheduling and managing emergent sessions across the event. But this app had to work in the woods, and on people’s phones. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/emergence-lessons-in-contextual-complexity/">In the end, we stumbled and learned.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>The need for mobile on Holochain has pushed us to develop a deep relationship with smartphone manufacturer <a href="https://volla.online/en/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Volla</a> as a first test case for a mobile native Holochain. In May, community devs <a href="https://twitter.com/Holochain/status/1663847940853571586?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hedayat Abedijoo and Nick Stebbings showcased a small Holochain application at the Volla community event</a>. Since then we have been in a collaborative process of application design and testing to get Holochain apps running on their privacy-first OS.</p> Fall: Connecting to Web3 <p>Fall took the team from conference, to podcast, to conference, including a number of appearances as speakers and moderators. Check out a few of the opportunities we had to talk to the world about Holochain throughout the year.</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain/status/1689684274390212622?ref=blog.holochain.org">Mary on the Diving into Crypto podcast</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain/status/1692092474506752391?ref=blog.holochain.org">Mary on the Web3 Disruptor podcast</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7puEjHI2J4&amp;list=PLOuXrtFJO6zXsTs56d0bpPmVpHjMO7m50&amp;index=1&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Zebu Live 2023: How Verifiable Data Powers Up Web3</a>  <p>This fall also saw Holochain used in Web3 and blockchain contexts in new ways. <a href="https://welcometonor.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Nor</a>, is a Web3 gaming platform using Holo and Holochain for a variety of systems, such as identity and login. Nor is creating new models of skill based gaming and reward in Web3.</p><p>Similarly <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fractal-tribute-bridging-blockchains-and-holochain/">Fractal Tribute</a>, developed by Josh Hardy of the <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rain Protocol</a>, in partnership with our Executive Director Mary Camacho showed that it was possible to secure NFT assets on a Holochain app. The app is a live play, distributed art game, inspired by r/place, where players collaboratively make art which they can mint into NFTs. We showcased this game at events from <a href="https://www.zebulive.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Zebu Live</a> in London, to <a href="https://devconnect.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DevConnect</a> in Istanbul, and we even <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain/status/1721146092593586602?ref=blog.holochain.org">hosted our own event</a> spinning off from <a href="https://nftsanfrancisco.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">NFT SF</a> when the conference was sadly put on hold. Fractal Tribute acts as a proof of concept for new ways to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/augmenting-nfts-with-holochain/">augment NFTs using Holochain</a>.</p><p>In October we also held our second online <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/joins-us-and-learn-holochain/">Dev Training</a>. Check out these clips from the demos:</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xZmBZQ3KywA?si=YW933FuCumG8Qvf3&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">A Design Pattern for Private Data — Dev Training hApp Demo</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xZmBZQ3KywA?si=YW933FuCumG8Qvf3&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/KvkmfPaRqjs?si=6Ne0KSqb7N9FUb9x&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">A Deck Building Game — Dev Training hApp Demo</a>   Winter: Holo Feature Complete <p>The end of this year brings the next big leap for Holochain as we step into 2024. The Holo network is built on the Holochain framework to provide distributed hosting to hApps. With the release of the Holo Network-RC and the upcoming Holo Launch, we have a real case study showing a performant Holochain used for a commercial application. This will spur development of Holochain apps, and we expect an increase in both apps hosted on the Holo network and operating directly in peer networks as a result. Read <a href="https://press.holo.host/232769-holo-delivers-network-release-candidate-in-december?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holo’s Lead/Org announcement</a> to learn more.</p><p>As we enter into 2024, we are excited for what is to come: New and developing collaborations like those with Nor and Volla; the growth of ecosystem projects like Neighbourhoods’ <a href="https://blog.neighbourhoods.network/neighbourhoods-offers-support-to-the-green-climate-funds-sri-lankan-initiative-3532a70264b7?ref=blog.holochain.org">pilot program</a> with the Green Climate Fund in Sri Lanka; and continued application development as Holochain apps become more accessible through Holo’s hosting network. This is just the beginning. Welcome to a New Year.</p> Looking to Catch Up? <p>We’ve been catching up on reading over the holidays and wanted to recommend a few articles from this last year.</p> From Holochain:   <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/what-is-digital-identity/">What is Digital Identity?</a>  <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/acorn-under-the-surface/">Acorn: Under the Surface</a>  <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/distributed-collective-action-network/">Building Group Cohesion Horizontally with Holochain</a>  <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/data-commoning-with-holochain-pt-1/">Data Commoning with Holochain Pt.1</a> and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/data-commoning-with-holochain-pt-2/">Pt.2</a>   From Fellow Travelers:   <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-cloud-is-a-prison-can-the-local-first-software-movement-set-us-free/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Cloud Is a Prison.

 As we look back on the past year, we’re amazed by all our incredible accomplishments. <p>Read on to take a look at our journey through 2023, the exciting milestones we reached together, and what 2024 looks like for the Veramo community.</p> Increased community contributions and participation <p>Our community has witnessed an upsurge indicating a flourishing engagement ecosystem. This surge reflects the collective effort of our community, poured into building Veramo. Community contributions and discussion participation soared this year, creating an environment where diverse perspectives meet. We also received lots of positive feedback which has been particularly heartwarming.</p><p>2023 was the [first] year of the community for Veramo.<br>Since the first lines of code, Veramo was meant to be a public good project. It was developed in the open under the old <a href="https://github.com/uport-project">uport-project</a> org on GitHub with the intent that it would be the tool to use when getting started with SSI &amp; verifiable data.</p><p>This intent is manifested in 2 ways, the architecture and the basics.<br>The architecture we chose is open, modular, and extensible. The choice was obvious to us as we were looking for a way to work in a rapidly evolving space with new and growing standards and protocols. In such a space, it would have been hard for our team to do everything internally and reasonably keep up with everything. We opted to reuse existing tooling and libraries as much as possible instead of writing new implementations, and this option now manifests as a way for anyone to use their existing tools and libraries to create plugins for Veramo.<br>The basics are all the plugins developed alongside the core package to use as a starting point to build products and apps as well as new protocols. They cover most of what you would need to function in the issuer-holder-verifier triangle of Verifiable Credentials, like key and DID management, credential issuance, storage, messaging, presentation, and verification, with a diverse set of formats and algorithms built&nbsp;in.</p><p>The ease of adding new functionality and the ability to decide which plugins to use instead of hauling around a monolith has brought a lot of attention to the Veramo framework and has prompted many folks to not only adopt it for their projects but also to contribute back some of their additions. It’s worth highlighting some of the new features and the teams that were the most active developing them: new sub-protocols supported for did-comm: coordinate mediation, trust-ping, message-pickup, routing, as well as message attachments; support for Secp256r1 for signing credentials; a new storage plugin based on kv-store; native support for did:peer, did:jwk, did:pkh and meta-transaction support for did:ethr.</p><p><a href="https://masca.io/">Masca</a>, <a href="https://sphereon.com/">Sphereon</a>, <a href="https://www.tuum.tech/">Tuum tech</a>, <a href="https://www.spherity.com/">Spherity</a>, <a href="https://www.ltonetwork.com/">LTO network</a>, and <a href="https://www.geoweb.network/">Geo Web</a> are some teams that contributed these features and deserve a shoutout.</p> Tech updates <p>Besides the contributions from the community, the recent releases of Veramo have focused on stability and interoperability improvements. Having a growing set of projects use Veramo means there is an increase in the number of corner cases encountered, new ways in which it is deployed, or plain interoperability friction. This is a great way to discover and fix bugs and make the platform as a whole much more robust. To that end, Veramo is now much more lenient with the encoding quirks of certain libraries, DIDs, or systems, and we upgraded the encryption capabilities for the did-comm package to adhere to the spec requirements and recommendations for key wrapping and content encryption.</p><p>Alongside the Veramo framework, we’ve had some interesting collaborations and projects this year. Our team was a launch partner for the Collab.land marketplace, creating <a href="https://dev.collab.land/help-docs/marketplace/apps/kudos">one of </a>its first mini-apps.</p><p>We significantly upgraded the architecture of <a href="https://explore.veramo.io">the agent-explore tool</a> and it now follows the same principles of modularity and extensibility as the Veramo framework. We hope this tool will foster the same kind of innovation in the user interface space as the Veramo framework already has done in the DID/Credential space. We used some of the learnings from that to build a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Veramo.veramo-vscode">VSCode extension</a> for improving the experience of working with raw Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>We also used this basis to participate in the <a href="https://jokerace.xyz/contest/polygon/0x7C8420e6237C9A592EFcAC7777d28FAe78C42394">Newforum identity hackathon</a> where our BrainShare plugin for agent-explore got us a spot among the winning projects.</p> Veramo donated to&nbsp;DIF <p>​​In October this year, <a href="https://mesh.xyz/insights/the-veramo-project-donated-to-the-decentralized-identity-foundation">Veramo was donated to the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a> to ensure continuous collaboration and support within the broader decentralized identity community.</p><p>As part of DIF, we’ll continue to build and develop the project, alongside our community with support from the foundation. A Veramo User Group will be created in 2024, and all the members of our community, code contributors, and partners are welcome to join. The user group will be open to all regardless of DIF membership. More details about this will be shared in January, stay&nbsp;tuned.</p> Outreach <p>Veramo had a strong presence at various events throughout the year, fostering connections and sharing insights with the wider community. From the Rebooting Web of Trust to Berlin Blockchain Week, IIW38, and Eth Denver. Alongside Ceramic, we co-hosted RepConnect at DevConnect Istanbul. Outreaches like this are great opportunities to learn, share, and connect with other people in the reputation space.</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVpCGfoSk1Q">Demo at RepConnect</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jvf5r33UtXk?feature=shared">Panel on Insights &amp; Action Items for Building Real Apps With Decentralized Reputation at RepConnect</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/veramo/veramo-didcomm-bringing-identity-to-ai-f7efd1fbdf5d">Veramo and DidComm: Bringing Identity to AI</a>&nbsp;[Blog]  <a href="https://youtu.be/LYcIjBppkGE?feature=shared">What medium is our message?</a> [EthDenver]   Conclusion <p>Community and open source will remain at the forefront of our efforts, as they have been integral to what we’ve built.

<a href="https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/contract-upgrade-failed-because-variables-are-deleted-in-openzepplin-5-0/38341">unsafe upgradability note</a><p>OpenZeppelin is a well-known and trusted company in the blockchain world. It provides secure open-source smart contracts and libraries, which accelerate the blockchain development worldwide. For more than two years, developers from all over the world have been using OpenZeppelin’s v4 contracts to build applications. The v4 contracts were maintained, well-documented, and audited over a long period. However, On the 5th of October, a new journey began with the release the v5 of OpenZeppelin contracts. In this article, we will explain - with an example - why it is not safe to upgrade existing deployments from OpenZeppelin Contract v4 to&nbsp;v5.</p> TLDR <p>The v5 of the contracts includes significant changes and improvements. Some contracts and libraries have been restructured, while others have been removed. However, the most crucial reason for the incompatibility is that the v5 contracts of OpenZeppelin integrate a significant change to the storage layer. The contracts in v5 adopt the namespaced storage layout, which is defined in <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7201">ERC-7201</a>. This change implies that the new logic of v5 contracts will query existing data and write new data in incorrect storage slots, making an upgrade from v4 to v5 not safe. Developers have several options to update an existing contract, such as reinitializing the contract, deploying it as a new proxy, or choosing to continue with updated v4 contracts. Each option has its own unique challenges and requirements.</p> Prerequisites <p>We consider the knowledge of upgradeable smart contracts and rudimentary knowledge of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) storage as a requirement for understanding this article. The following tutorials give a good overview about upgradability of smart contracts:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgSj7IiE4jA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgSj7IiE4jA</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWUDTZhxKZI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWUDTZhxKZI</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZV9uiDbJI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZV9uiDbJI</a>  <p>For the EVM storage layer we recommend the following articles:</p>  <a href="https://steveng.medium.com/ethereum-virtual-machine-storage-layout-beb9a72a07e9">https://steveng.medium.com/ethereum-virtual-machine-storage-layout-beb9a72a07e9</a>  <a href="https://www.adrianhetman.com/unboxing-evm-storage/">https://www.adrianhetman.com/unboxing-evm-storage/</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/@Knownsec_Blockchain_Lab/knowsec-blockchain-lab-depth-understanding-of-evm-storage-mechanism-and-security-issues-50509acea373">https://medium.com/@Knownsec_Blockchain_Lab/knowsec-blockchain-lab-depth-understanding-of-evm-storage-mechanism-and-security-issues-50509acea373</a>   Comparing how state variables are stored in OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts in v4 versus&nbsp;v5 <p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stores state variables in a key-value store with 256-bit keys and 256-bit values. These state variables are stored in a compact, continuous manner. Therefore, the order of the state variables in a smart contract determines their position in the&nbsp;storage.</p><p>OpenZeppelin v4 upgradeable contracts primarily use the default approach for storage management. The storage slots for state variables are determined by their sequential order in the contract. Therefore, base contracts often include a ‘storage buffer’ — defined as uint256[49] __gap; — to reserve storage slots. This will allow future versions of that contract to use up those slots without affecting the storage layout of child contracts. This approach of storage handling complicates contract management and upgradeability by increasing the risk of mistakes and storage conflicts, where new upgrades may unintentionally overwrite existing storage&nbsp;slots.</p><p>To simplify upgradability and minimize storage conflicts, OpenZeppelin v5 adopted the namespace storage layout, which has been proposed officially as ERC-7201 on June 20, 2023. The ERC-7201 recommends using pseudorandom locations derived from a namespace as the basis for new storage trees in base contracts. The root slot for storage is calculated using a <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7201#formula">specific formula</a>. This approach does not require changes on the EVM level and can be implemented by grouping state variables within a struct and using assembly language to access specific storage slots directly, as shown in the&nbsp;example:</p>Example of namespace-based storage locations in a smart contract following <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7201">ERC-7201</a><p>In the example smart contract x and y are state variables. However, they are not stored on the first and second slots in the storage as default. They will be stored in the storage tree under the given root MAIN_STORAGE_LOCATION = 0x183a…b500, which is calculated using the suggested formula in ERC-7201.</p><p>When a v4 upgradeable contract is deployed on the network, the state variables of the contract are initialized, stored, and managed using the default storage pattern based on their order in the contracts. However, if the implementation contract is upgraded using v5 contracts, a critical issue occurs. The new v5 contracts are designed to interact with storage in a different way, using the namespaced storage layout introduced in ERC-7201. As a result, these updated contracts will not recognize or access the original storage slots used by the old contract. This mismatch in storage access will lead to dangerous and incorrect states where variables may not reflect the intended values, and functions may behave unpredictably, leading to loss of funds or compromised security.</p> Unsafe Upgradability Example <p>The following ExampleV4 contract uses OpenZeppelin v4 and imports the following contracts Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable, and UUPSUpgradeable. It sets the value of exampleStateVariable, the address of the owner, the address of implementation contract, and the status of the contract to Initialized during the initialization process when it is deployed as&nbsp;proxy.</p>example upgradable contract using v4&nbsp;version<p>To check the storage keys of the state variables, we can deploy it as <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_proxy_contracts.html">proxy using Remix IDE</a> and then debug it using the <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugger.html">Debugger</a>.</p>the storage of the&nbsp;contract<p>As shown in the picture, slot 0x000…000 (slot 0) has the value 0x01 marking the contract as initialized. At Slot 0x000….033 (Slot 51) the, address of the owner of the contract is stored. At 0x000…0c9 (Slot 201) the value 7 of the exampleStateVariable is stored (Note: The variables are not sorted at slots 0, 1, 2 due to the buffer gaps between the contracts). At Slot 0x36089…82bbc the address of the implementation contract stored (Note: The slot of the implementation contract address was already hardcoded in v4 in a similar way to the namespaced storage layout to prevent conflicts).</p>map current slots to values in&nbsp;v4<p>For demonstration purposes, we will update the implementation contract to ExampleV5 using OpenZeppelin v5 contracts, without introducing new logic. To execute the upgrade, we must import the new v5 contracts, make minor modifications to the original contract to align with the new structure, and then deploy it. Then, we invoke the upgradeTo function on the proxy contract, providing the address of the new implementation contract as an argument.</p>Code of the upgradeable smart contract in OpenZeppelin version&nbsp;5<p>After upgrading the contract we can call the two state variables in the proxy contract to check their&nbsp;values.</p>the values of the state variables after the&nbsp;upgrade<p>The value of exampleStateVariable is now 1 and not 7 because the upgraded contract reads the value from the first storage slot, which was the same slot of the initialized status. Furthermore, the owner is the zero address 0x000…000 because the new implemented contract following v5 of OpenZeppelin looks for the address of the owner at another storage slot. Inspecting the v5 contract, we will find that the owner value is read from slot 0x9016…9300, which is&nbsp;empty.</p>the <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/v5.0.1/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol">OwnableUpgradeable</a> v5&nbsp;contract<p>The same issue applies to the Initialization status of the contract. It is read from slot 0xf0c5…6a00 and not from 0x000…000 as it was in v4 contracts</p>the <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/v5.0.1/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol">Initializable</a> v5&nbsp;contract<p>This means our very simple updated contract has incorrect values, is not initialized, and has the zero address as&nbsp;Owner.</p>compare current slots to values before and after upgrade shows the misplacing of state variables between old and new v5&nbsp;contract<p>At this point, anyone would be able to initialize it again giving the address of owner to control the contract. Even if the original owner still managed to initialize the contract before anyone else the contract will stay in an unsafe state. To explain this we will re-initialize and debug the storage of the upgraded contract using&nbsp;Remix.</p>The storage keys and values after the upgrade and re-initialization of the&nbsp;contract<p>As displayed on the above storage snapshot, the original (v4) storage slots at 0x000…0c9, 0x000…033 are not empty. Therefore, new state variables added to the contract could unintentionally use these slots, creating invalid&nbsp;values.</p> Going Forward with Existing Contracts <p>For developers, finding the best way to update existing contracts is crucial. There are several options for updating deployed v4 upgradable contracts, some of these options&nbsp;are:</p>  Reinitializing the Contract: This process involves clearing the storage and migrating the data within the contract. While this approach might be feasible for simple contracts, for complex contracts with dynamic data types such as arrays, strings, and mappings, the storage becomes overly complicated, making migration within the contract impractical, if not impossible.  Deploying as a Proxy: Similar to the <a href="https://sergiomartinrubio.com/articles/how-to-release-new-versions-of-smart-contracts/#social-migration">Social Migration</a> approach for non-upgradable contracts, this method involves deploying the new contract as a new proxy with a new address, followed by migrating the data and users to this new contract. Depending on the contract type and existing data, this process can become complicated. Additionally, it requires users’ involvement.  Updating using v4 Contracts: Likely the most advisable approach is to continue using v4 contracts. This method eliminates the need for data migration or storage restructuring. Developers need to maintain their existing OpenZeppelin v4 contracts, extending or updating only the necessary components for their specific needs when required.   Summary <p>In Ethereum, upgradeable contracts are complicated due to potential storage conflicts. The introduction of a new storage layout aims to make the upgrade process easier and cleaner. However, old upgradable v4 contracts will face issues with the new layout, as their state variables could be dislocated, leading to an invalid contract state. Therefore, a native upgrade from v4 contracts to v5 is considered as not safe and is not recommended, requiring careful selection of strategies for updating v4 Upgradeable Contracts.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/why-upgrading-openzeppelin-smart-contracts-from-version-4-to-version-5-is-unsafe-e08be30efd8a">Why Upgrading OpenZeppelin Smart Contracts from Version 4 to Version 5 is Unsafe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			 What Should You Expect from a Tokenization Platform in 2024 
<p>Season’s Greetings from all of us at Tokeny!</p>
<p>As we approach the new year, it’s the perfect time to upgrade and take a look at your tokenization strategies. Let’s clear up a common misconception first: Far from being a straightforward task,&nbsp;building a robust tokenization stack demands more than just deploying smart contracts.</p>
<p>The platform should not only support advanced smart contracts such as ERC-3643 for on-chain compliance but also&nbsp;offer tools for transfer management, automation, data management, interoperability with existing financial systems, and a seamless investor experience. Let’s break these down below.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Tools for Automation and Token Lifecycle Management: 
<p>🎛️&nbsp;Onchain Compliance Rules: &nbsp;The platform must allow for setting up compliance rules via smart contracts (e.g., jurisdictions of investors, KYC checks, etc.) and utilizing a permission system to manage and appoint agents, for example, KYC agents for signing KYC credentials to investors’ digital identity.</p>
<p>🆔&nbsp;Digital Identities: &nbsp;Every stakeholder, and especially investors, must be properly identified on the blockchain to apply permissions and compliance rules. For this, an encrypted on-chain identity system is needed as wallets ownership cannot be used as proof of identity.</p>
<p>⛓️&nbsp;Blockchain Operations:&nbsp; As most operations result in blockchain transactions, the platform must prepare the needed parameters based on the issuers’ or their agents’ inputs, to facilitate the selection of concerned investors, gas fees, etc. Once ready, these transactions are sent for signature to the authorized agent. This should be made possible for all the functions provided by the token smart contracts (e.g., around 120 functions for the ERC3643 standard).</p>
<p>🔐&nbsp;Secure Wallet Solutions:&nbsp; Wallet solutions are needed for the issuer, its agents, and each investor. For issuers and their agents, they must support signature policies without impeding automation. For investors, they should offer non-custodial options to avoid regulatory constraints. Ideally, the wallet solution is integrated into the tokenization platform to automatically generate wallets, ensuring regulatory compliance and enabling seamless interchangeability through account abstraction.</p>
<p>🖥️&nbsp;User-friendly Interface:&nbsp; The platform must be user-friendly so that any stakeholder, regardless of coding or blockchain experience, can seamlessly navigate the platform. For investors, it should also offer an e-commerce-like experience akin to commonly used mainstream platforms with features like built-in self-custody wallets and gas tanks to eliminate friction points.</p>
 Data Management: 
<p>📊&nbsp;Real-time On-chain Data:&nbsp; The platform needs a performant indexer to sync blockchain data with the smart contracts orchestration platform. This is done by reading different nodes on the network. The platform has to provide an infrastructure management service to listen to the token and compliance smart contracts events, route to the most performing RPC, and provide a real-time data stream to the software and its users.</p>
<p>📑&nbsp;Investor Data Management: &nbsp;Managing investor data requires an automated cap table that aggregates off-chain data like personal identity data and on-chain data (i.e transaction records, digital identity credentials, etc.). In addition, issuers should be able to choose where they prefer the off-chain data to be stored.</p>
<p>📁&nbsp;Asset Data Management:&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate distribution, it is crucial to provide detailed documents and information about the tokenized assets to investors. The tokenization platform should enable the enrichment of the token with documents, third-party certifications (e.g., ESG), valuation, etc.</p>
 Interoperability with Financial Systems: 
<p>🔌&nbsp;Legacy Systems: &nbsp;Large institutions need API-ready solutions to plug and play in their legacy systems to ensure the adoption of new technologies is seamless. Synchronizing investors with their on-chain identities, or integrating token actions in existing investor portals are usually the most needed integrations.</p>
<p>🌐&nbsp;Trading Venues and DeFi Services:&nbsp; Broad distribution and diverse liquidity options are the most important reasons issuers tokenize assets on-chain. Therefore, the platform must enable issuers to connect natively to the best trading platforms (centralized exchanges, OTC, etc.), distributors, and DeFi applications (DEX, collateralization, etc.), to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>As we enter this new era of finance, asset managers, banks, and asset servicers must accelerate their tokenization market presence to stay ahead of the curve in 2024. It is crucial to collaborate with a seasoned tokenization platform provider, rather than starting from scratch.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF68 rewards. DF69 runs Dec 21 — Dec 28,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 68 (DF68) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 100K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Dec 14, 2023 and ended 12:01am Dec 21. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF.

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF69 is live today, Dec 21. It concludes on Dec 28. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF69   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF69 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  Read how to optimize Predictoor rewards&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">here</a>.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $27K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Dec 7, 2023: $0.511 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.0798 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.511 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $19,163&nbsp;USD  $0.0798 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,980&nbsp;USD  Total: $19,163 + $7,980 = $27,142.5 ≈ $27K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.govtech.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Government Technology</a> and SpruceID hosted a webinar featuring a fireside chat between Wayne Chang, CEO and Founder of SpruceID, and Ajay Gupta, Chief Digital Transformation Officer at the State of California DMV, about their <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/">recently launched mobile driver’s license</a> (mDL).</p><p>This conversation between Wayne and Ajay gave an inside look into the past couple of years working together to bring the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/awards/government-eye-on-innovation?utm_source=int-mktg&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2023_ITDIS_SOC_SOC1_EOI23SOCIALBUNDLE">Gartner-award-winning</a> mDL to the State of California residents — from addressing complexities with implementation, working to adhere to global standards, understanding the rapidly evolving market ecosystem, and more.</p><p>Read through the top 5 takeaways of this conversation, and listen to the full recording below to learn how the State of California DMV worked alongside SpruceID as their technology partner to bring this project to life.</p><p></p> 1 - People Expect a Digital Experience <p>At the start of this discussion, Ajay touched on how people expect a digital experience when interacting with any establishment in today's increasingly digital world. This expectation has been accelerated drastically by the pandemic when businesses were required to offer services online. With the shift to digital, people will inevitably be asked to verify their identity online in various situations.</p><p>Offering both a mobile driver’s license and an online self-serve onboarding experience provides increased efficiency and convenience for the user so they are not stuck in long lines waiting for a human to help them renew their driver’s license. It also greatly reduces the cost of operations within a DMV.</p><p></p> 2 - Implementing an mDL Comes with Complexities <p>Standing up a program that provisions mobile driver’s licenses has many advantages, such as reducing fraud (seen today in situations such as the billions of dollars lost by false claims to unemployment benefits online) or eliminating fake IDs. However, getting to this point isn’t without challenges and complexities.</p><p>Starting out, one question the California DMV had was how they would gain residents’ trust when they started using their digital ID. In the webinar, Wayne and Ajay touch on how SpruceID helped to introduce cryptography and other security elements, such as biometrics, to allow California to securely provision mobile driver’s licenses that could be trusted and help to eliminate issues such as fraudulent claims.</p><p>Another challenge was creating transparency with users regarding how their information is handled in the California DMV wallet app. The California DMV and SpruceID prioritized keeping users’ data private without there being any digital trail of how and where residents use their mDL. </p><p>In addition, they mention how important it was for selective disclosure to be built into the app so that residents provide only the minimum amount of information required when being asked to present their digital ID. It should be clear to users exactly what information they consent to share in each situation. For example:</p><p>Despite having to work through several complexities with the technology and ecosystem along the way, both the California DMV and SpruceID describe how they're confident this solution best serves California residents while preserving their privacy and keeping their data secure. In the full webinar recording, listen to both Wayne and Ajay dissect some of the complexities they encountered throughout this undertaking, and how they were addressed by technology.</p><p></p> 3 - Open-Source Has Its Advantages <p>One quality unique to SpruceID’s mobile driver’s license implementation is having built an open-source mobile wallet. The many benefits of using an open-source solution include things like customization, third-party audits, and increased trust and transparency. When discussing some of the open-source tools used, Ajay mentioned:</p><p>Allowing users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the software by checking the source code helps build accountability within a community of users.</p><p>In addition to the open-source approach, SpruceID also participates in a number of different working groups in order to contribute to some of the standards bodies on which our software is based. These standards bodies create technical frameworks to promote the safe and secure use of technology and define requirements for security, data elements, and more.</p><p>Wayne mentions how being an active participant and <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-license-interoperability-event/">helping lead events</a> for these standards groups has benefited SpruceID as an organization and has been a catalyst to drive the standards forward.</p><p></p> 4 - Market Ecosystem Opportunities are Endless <p>A high point of the webinar was hearing Wayne and Ajay talk through the multitude of market opportunities that will be brought about by the launch of California’s mobile driver’s license.</p><p>SpruceID and the California DMV talk through the market ecosystem that is being developed around digital credentials today, as well as their current efforts working with organizations that will begin accepting mobile driver’s licenses as part of their business model: </p><p>Facilitating market growth, including momentum from both users of mobile driver’s licenses and businesses accepting these digital credentials, will open many doors and opportunities for growth in the overall ecosystem.</p><p></p> 5 - The Future for California is Bright <p>As the webinar came to a close, Ajay talked through some of the exciting plans for the California DMV that lie ahead on their roadmap. To name a few, working with credit unions and banks to start accepting the mDL as an identity verification mechanism and creating digital registration cards, titles, and disabled placards. They are also collaborating with law enforcement on a way for police officers to safely and securely accept a mobile driver’s license.</p><p>SpruceID is looking forward to seeing what’s in store for the State of California DMV and working together as the current landscape evolves. We feel grateful and honored to have been able to partner with the California DMV team on this groundbreaking initiative.</p> Watch the Webinar <p>We’ve barely scratched the surface of what was covered during this inspiring and educational fireside chat, so head over to our YouTube channel to listen to the whole conversation between Wayne and Ajay.</p><p>Interested in chatting with us more about your own digital credentials, whether it’s augmenting existing infrastructure or creating something new? <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Contact us today</a>.</p> <a href="https://youtu.be/oy7ycRoCiws?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Watch Webinar Recording</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>Reshoring manufacturing to the US­ has been a significant trend in recent years, driven by geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, proximity to customers and markets, eco-system synergies and the need for positive impact on the domestic economy. However, reshoring presents several challenges—mainly workforce, technical and economic issues.</p>



<p>AI, automation and digital labor can help tackle these challenges. For organizations willing to take these challenges head on and become <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/cloud-manufacturing">Transformational Optimizers</a> from the start, this is also an opportunity to skip ahead generations of manufacturing evolution and adopt technologies that will help outperform competition from the start.</p>



<p>Here are some concrete recommendations and examples from IBM for companies considering reshoring manufacturing:</p>



 Workforce challenges 



<p>One of the primary obstacles to reshoring is accessing a skilled manufacturing workforce. According to <a href="https://themanufacturinginstitute.org/press-releases/manufacturing-industry-faces-unprecedented-employment-shortfall-2-4-million-skilled-jobs-projected-to-go-unfilled-according-to-deloitte-and-the-manufacturing-institute/">a report by the Manufacturing Institute</a>, 5 out of 10 open positions for skilled workers in the US manufacturing industry remain unoccupied today due to the skills gap crisis. Reshoring production requires workers with technical skills to operate computer-controlled equipment as well as soft skills like problem-solving.</p>



<p>To address this challenge, companies can use digital labor to supplement the existing workforce by automating repetitive, dangerous or complex tasks. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/boston-dynamics">collaborative robots (cobots)</a> can work alongside human workers to perform tasks that require precision or dexterity, freeing up human workers to focus on higher-value tasks. Additionally, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate">AI-powered tools</a> can help identify skills gaps and provide personalized training programs to cross-skill employees.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/xe/en/insights/focus/human-capital-trends/2023/human-capital-and-productivity.html">studies quoted by Deloitte</a>, it is estimated that AI and machine learning will contribute to a 37% increase in labor productivity by 2025. Moreover, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/press/2020/10/recession-and-automation-changes-our-future-of-work-but-there-are-jobs-coming-report-says-52c5162fce">a study by the World Economic Forum</a> found that by 2025, automation and a new division of labour between humans and machines will disrupt 85 million jobs, but they will also create 97 million new roles, highlighting the need for workers to acquire new skills.</p>



 Technical challenges 



<p>Reshoring production presents process and infrastructure challenges. Manufacturing overseas allowed longer production runs with cheaper changeover costs between products, whereas reshoring requires greater flexibility and agility in production systems.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant">Digital labor</a> can make processes more adaptable. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin">Digital twin technology</a> creates virtual representations of physical assets to simulate changes, allowing companies to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/hong-kong-astri-engineering-rhapsody">test and optimize production processes</a> before implementation. Machine learning algorithms can continuously optimize operations, improving efficiency and reducing waste.</p>



<p>The total number of service robots sold for professional use hit 158,000 units in 2022—an increase of 48% according to <a href="https://ifr.org/ifr-press-releases/news/staff-shortage-boosts-service-robots-sales-up-48">a report by the International Federation of Robotics</a>. Implementing these technologies requires upfront investment but results in more efficient, cost-effective production overall. This can help US manufacturers catch up in critical EV components like batteries, where Chinese firms currently lead.</p>



 Economic challenges 



<p>While reshoring removes supply chain risks of overseas production, the economics must still make sense. <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/harnessing-tectonic-global-shift-in-manufacturing">Boston Consulting Group estimates</a> reshoring will add 10-30% in costs versus offshoring. A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ZYJ2QVX8">report by Forrester found</a> that businesses that implemented automation were able to reduce operational costs by 25-50%. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/deloitte">Automating tasks with digital workers</a> also lowers overall labor costs compared to (comparatively) lower wage countries like China.</p>



<p>Companies must balance short-term implementation costs against longer-term savings and strategic benefits. Companies that invest in digital technologies can achieve cost savings and revenue growth. Moreover, <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24196/w24196.pdf">a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found</a> that automation can lead to short-term job displacement but can also lead to long-term job growth.</p>



 Case studies 



<p>Below, we look at two case studies—the semiconductor industry and EV batter manufacturing—which show how digital labor can help address the challenges of reshoring manufacturing to the US.</p>



 Case study 1: Semiconductors 



<p>The semiconductor industry provides a pertinent example of reshoring challenges and solutions that could be applied. Semiconductors are essential components for critical industries like computers and communications, but disruptions to their supply chain threaten the global economy.</p>



<p>The current semiconductor supply chain is global and complex, with design, equipment manufacturing, fabrication, and assembly happening in different countries. The <a href="https://blog.mitai.ai/chips-science-act-impact-after-1-year-on-us-semiconductor-industry">US’s share of fabrication has declined</a> from 37% in 1990 to only 12% currently. To meet capacity for critical applications, the US needs to add about 18-20 new semiconductor fabrication plants (“fabs”), requiring 70-90,000 new jobs—a 50% increase over the current workforce. However, many semiconductor manufacturing roles are declining due to automation while engineering roles are rising. This creates a need for upskilling and reskilling of the existing workforce.</p>



<p>Digital technologies can help address the workforce challenges in the semiconductor industry. AI-powered tools can identify skills gaps and provide personalized training programs to cross-skill employees. Digital twin technology can simulate and optimize production processes, reducing the need for physical prototypes and accelerating the development of new products. Collaborative robots can work alongside human workers to perform repetitive tasks, freeing up human workers to focus on higher-value tasks.</p>



<p>Implementing digital technologies requires upfront investment, but it can lead to more efficient, cost-effective production overall. Reshoring semiconductor manufacturing to the U.S. can also reduce supply chain risks, improve proximity to customers and markets and create an ecosystem of suppliers and innovation. It can also help address the skilled workforce gap by creating new job opportunities and upskilling the existing workforce.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the semiconductor industry provides a compelling example of how digital labor can help address the challenges of reshoring manufacturing to the US. By leveraging digital technologies, companies can overcome workforce, technical and economic challenges and achieve strategic benefits.</p>



 Case study 2: EV battery manufacturing 



<p>EV battery manufacturing in the US presents unique challenges in workforce, technology, and economics. However, as with the previous example of semiconductor manufacturing, these challenges can be addressed through the adoption of AI, <a href="https://www.batterytechonline.com/design-manufacturing/how-automation-advances-sustainability-in-ev-battery-production">automation</a> and digital labour.</p>



<p>The global EV battery supply chain is largely <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2023/06/study-unveils-policy-insights-reshoring-ev-battery-production">centered in Asia</a>. To meet its ambitious EV goals, the US needs to increase domestic battery manufacturing capacity. This requires <a href="https://netl.doe.gov/bwi">significant infrastructure expansion and workforce training</a>. Automation can address workforce challenges by taking over repetitive tasks, freeing up the workforce for more complex tasks. Digital twins can simulate the battery production process, allowing for testing and optimization before actual implementation. Implementing these technologies requires <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/recharging-economies-the-ev-battery-manufacturing-outlook-for-europe">significant upfront investment</a>. However, automation can lead to more efficient, cost-effective production, enabling US manufacturers to compete globally. It can also contribute to reducing battery pack costs, a major component of overall EV costs.</p>



<p>EV battery manufacturing located in the US can also provide strategic benefits. It can secure the supply chain, reduce dependence on foreign suppliers, foster innovation, contribute to job growth, and help bridge the skills gap.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The challenges associated with reshoring manufacturing to the US are addressable: workforce, technical and economic issues can be tackled by the adoption of AI, automation and digital labor. Additionally, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for manufacturers as they “greenfield” their way back into the US.

  The Crypto Travel Rule threshold in Hong Kong is set at HKD 8,000 or US$1,000, above which detailed information, including the originator’s address or ID number, is required.  For transactions below this threshold, only the name and account number of the originator and beneficiary are&nbsp;needed.  This threshold approach aligns Hong Kong with countries like Singapore, Indonesia, and the UK, differing from places like Malaysia, Estonia, and the EU, where no threshold applies.  <p>The Crypto Travel Rule came into effect in Hong Kong on June 1st, 2023. This was the final step of many regulatory actions that Hong Kong saw in the previous months, known as the enforcement of FATF Recommendation 16, or the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Before this, on December 7th, 2022, <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/en/legco-business/council/bills.html?bill_key=10015&amp;session=2022">the Hong Kong Legislative Council approved</a> the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Bill 2022. This change aimed to include virtual asset service providers (VASPs) under rules for customer checks and record-keeping.</p><p>Then, on February 20th, 2023, the Securities and Futures Commission put out a paper for discussion on proposed rules for VASPs. They received 152 pieces of feedback on&nbsp;it.</p><p>After looking at all the feedback, the commission made and shared detailed guidelines on <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering (AML)</a> and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) for VASPs with SFC licenses. Finally, the Crypto Travel Rule began in Hong Kong on June 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Hong Kong: Technological Solutions to Help Financial Institutions <p>To implement <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the Crypto Travel Rule</a>, Hong Kong adopted a risk-based strategy, focusing on both institutional and customer risk. This approach involved assessing technological solutions that financial institutions (FIs) could use to ensure their virtual asset (VA) transfers complied with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>According to the implementation guidelines, FIs in Hong Kong can choose any technological solution to collect and submit the necessary information for VA transfers. However, the chosen solution must enable the FI to adhere to the Travel Rule requirements. In this context, an FI could function as an ordering institution, an intermediary, or a beneficiary institution.</p><p>For compliance with the FATF Travel Rule in Hong Kong, two primary conditions must be&nbsp;met:</p>  Effective and efficient identification of VA Transfer counterparties.  The technological solution employed must be able to submit the required information for a VA transfer in a timely and secure&nbsp;manner.  <p>Furthermore, when selecting a technological solution for VA Travel Rule compliance, FIs must consider several factors. These include the solution’s interoperability, its capacity to process information for a high volume of VA transfers, and its effectiveness in enabling FIs to implement controls for scrutinizing VA transfers.</p><p>Additionally, the solution should be capable of performing due diligence and securely retaining the required information. This comprehensive approach ensures both the safety and regulatory compliance of VA transfers under the Hong Kong Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/addressing-the-new-fatf-report-shyft-veriscope-solving-the-travel-rule-challenges-like-no-other">Shyft Veriscope stands out as an ideal Travel Rule solution</a> in line with Hong Kong’s Travel Rule compliance requirements. Built to perform thorough checks and ensure information safety, it addresses key aspects of the Hong Kong Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope simplifies identifying parties in VA transfers and facilitates the quick and secure sharing of necessary details. Its compatibility with various systems makes it suitable for all financial institutions. This efficiency and versatility make Shyft Veriscope a smart choice for complying with the FATF Travel Rule in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Specifics of the Hong Kong Crypto Travel Rule Compliance <p>While Financial Institutions may adopt qualified technological solutions to help them, all the related stakeholders need to know the specifics that make a VA transfer Travel Rule compliant.</p>  The supervisory body for VASPs in Hong Kong is the Securities and Finance Commission.  Travel Rule implementation does not have a threshold. Irrespective of the transaction value, obtaining Travel Rule information is a must in any VA transfer. However, the volume of required information is less when it comes to transactions under HKD 8,000 or US$1,000.  The Travel Rule compliance requirements apply to all VASPs. For self-hosted wallets, Travel Rule data is to be collected as well, including account numbers associated with the&nbsp;FI.   Compliance Requirements <p>According to the provisions, the originator VASPs of a VA transfer would have to obtain, record, and transmit the required information to the beneficiary VASP in the following manner.</p>  If the transaction amount is less than 8,000 HKD, information required on the originator and beneficiary customer would only include the name and account&nbsp;number.  However, if the transaction amount goes above the threshold of 8,000 HKD or US$1,000, the required information categories would also include the originator customer’s address, customer identification number, identification document number, or date and place of&nbsp;birth.  <p>The SFC mandates that Travel Rule compliance be performed pre-transaction since, in virtual asset transactions, the settlement is immediate and irreversible.</p> Impact on Crypto Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>Any sort of VASP, including exchanges and wallets, would have to make increased efforts to make their process Travel Rule compliant.</p><p>The VASPs must verify the customers’ wallet ownership when transacting with self-hosted wallets. This implies they need to establish a mechanism for confirming their customer’s ownership or control of the wallet address, which can be achieved, for instance, through a message signing&nbsp;test.</p><p>Additionally, the VASPs are required to conduct more intense monitoring of VA transfers with self-hosted wallets. They must impose transaction limits wherever necessary, possibly including setting appropriate limits on the amount of VA transfers with self-hosted wallets.</p> Global Landscape &amp; a Comparative Analysis <p>When it comes to Hong Kong’s implementation of the Travel Rule, it has many similarities and dissimilarities with its global counterparts.</p><p>For example, Hong Kong’s threshold model aligns with Singapore, Indonesia, and the UK, where a broader scope of Travel Rule obligations is triggered when transactions exceed a certain limit. In contrast, countries like the US, Philippines, and Canada only enforce Travel Rule when a transaction surpasses a threshold. Yet, there are places like Malaysia, Estonia, and the European Union where no such threshold exists.</p><p>The approach to self-hosted wallets also varies significantly across jurisdictions. The United States and Canada, for instance, have not set specific guidelines. On the other hand, countries like Lichtenstein and Estonia have adopted enhanced due diligence measures. The UK and Gibraltar are moving towards gathering more information.</p><p>Hong Kong, which requires verification of information for self-hosted wallets, shares this standard with countries like Germany, Singapore, Switzerland, the European Union, and Hong Kong&nbsp;itself.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The implementation of the FATF Travel Rule in Hong Kong aligns with global trends in the crypto space, marking a shift towards increased clarity and transparency. Mirroring this trend, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan also implemented the Travel Rule</a> on June 1st, 2023, followed by Portugal on July 15th, 2023, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-in-the-uk-challenges-and-concerns">the United Kingdom</a> on September 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>As a result, VASPs will need to intensify their compliance efforts, and more solutions are expected to emerge within the country to assist financial institutions and VASPs in adhering to these regulations. With over <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/over-80-crypto-firms-eyeing-presence-in-hong-kong-financial-secretary">80 crypto firms</a> from mainland China and other countries showing interest in setting up operations in Hong Kong, the effective implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule is poised to significantly bolster the country’s crypto&nbsp;economy.</p> Frequently Asked Questions Around Crypto Travel Rule Hong&nbsp;Kong  Q1: What is the threshold for the Crypto Travel Rule in Hong&nbsp;Kong? <p>The threshold is set at HKD 8,000 or US$1,000.

 Despite recently introduced regulations, gambling on the black market in Germany is still alive and well. We gathered experts from the industry to discuss why that is and what could be done to curb the illegal industry. 



 



<p>The drop in tax revenue from €55 million to €10 million per month is due to an inhospitable regulatory environment in Germany, according to Nico Jansen, CEO at Bet IT Best GmbH, who was speaking at our recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/germanys-problem-illegal-market-gambling/">webinar on black market gambling in Germany</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the introduction of the State Treaty on Gambling in 2021, German players have been flocking to either offshore operators, or unregulated black market operators. Why is this happening, and what can be done to stop it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the recent IDnow webinar, ‘Germany’s problem with the black market’, we gathered experts from the field, including Ted Menmuir, Content Director at the Sports Betting Community, Jochen Biewer, Managing Director at Chevron Consultants, Bernd Henning at IGamingConsult.com, Laszlo Pados, Brand Manager at Greentube GmbH, Nico Jansen, CEO at Bet IT Best GmbH, and our own Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming to delve deeper into the subject and explore what operators across the board need to know.</p>



 
   
     
                     Germany’s problem with the black market. 
                     Watch a panel of experts debate why Germany has witnessed a sudden increase in black market gambling, upcoming regulatory challenges, and what the future of gambling in the German market may look like.

 The current state of gambling regulation in Germany. 



<p>Historically, Germany has had a rather complex and fragmented approach to gambling legislation, with individual states retaining considerable autonomy. Recognizing that an outright ban on online gambling was unsuccessful and had allowed offshore operators to flourish, a new State Treaty on Gambling was enacted in 2021 to regulate the market and offer licenses to German operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gluecksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Glücksspielstaatsvertrag (GlüStV)</a> was first luanched, it introduced a centralized licensing system for online sports betting and casino games and aimed to unify and modernize the regulation of gambling across the country. A noble cause indeed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, while the requirement of operators to have a license opened the market and allowed private operators to break the state monopoly on certain forms of gambling, it also introduced several restrictions and player protection measures, that, some argue, have largely driven players to the black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These include:&nbsp;</p>



  Deposit and stake limits<br>  Identity verification<br>  Strict advertising guidelines<br>  Centralized database for monitoring activities  



<p>Read more in our blog post, ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">Online Gambling in Germany: regulations, restrictions and ramifications</a>‘.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online casinos licensed by the national gambling authority (<a href="https://www.gluecksspiel-behoerde.de/de/">Glücksspielbehörde der Länder, GGL</a>) must enforce a deposit limit of €1,000 per player per month across all operators. This is monitored through a centralized database to check player behavior. To prevent excessive gambling, players are subjected to a €1 stake limit on casino games and a 5-second delay on slot machines. Operators must also pay a 5.3% turnover tax on each bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sportsbook operators face similar restrictions regarding deposit limits. Taxes are even higher, with a whopping 8% tax levied on sports betting. Certain types of betting, such as live betting and fantasy sports, are prohibited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As pointed out in our webinar, the DSWV report shows that between 2021 and 2022, total <a href="https://europeangaming.eu/portal/compliance-updates/2023/03/13/131693/german-sports-betting-association-calls-for-rethinking-of-regulation-to-combat-the-black-market/">sports betting stakes fell from €9.4 billion to €8.2 billion</a>, and as a result, taxes collected fell from €470 million to €433 million, a drop of 13%.</p>



 What are the risks of black market gambling? 



<p>Perhaps because of the above, the German Betting Trade Association (DSWV) has reported a 65% increase in illicit gambling activities and sports betting activities and is calling for more action against black market activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling sites that operate without the necessary licenses from the GGL or use alternate licenses from international authorities such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta Gaming Authority MGA</a> or Curaçao are operating in defiance of the legal frameworks established by the government, and are therefore considered black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumers who use illegal or unregulated online platforms are doing so at their own risk, as consumer protection standards may not necessarily be enforced, which increases the risk of fraud, a lack of fair play, or responsible gambling mechanisms for players. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/money-laundering-threat-online-casinos/">Illegal gambling operations can also be used for money laundering</a> and other illicit activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lack of accountability and transparency can also contribute to difficulties in tracking financial transactions and investigating illegal activities.</p>



 Betting bad: What factors contribute to the growth of illegal gambling? 



<p>A lively discussion point from the webinar was what forced law-abiding German citizens to the black market. Participants suggested several reasons.&nbsp;</p>



  Better entertainment: Players are attracted to offshore gambling sites because they offer more games, betting options and bonus offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  No limits: There is no pre-set deposit limit, but players are often encouraged to set a daily, weekly, or monthly deposit limit as part of the operator’s responsible gambling strategy. Similarly, there is no €1 stake limit. Players can choose stake size according to preferences and financial capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  More features: Black market online casinos also offer features such as automatic betting, which spins the slot machine reels a pre-defined number of times without the need to manually click after each spin. There is also no 5-second delay on virtual slots.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Higher RTP: Due to the high tax rates for German operators, RTPs (return-to-player) on games are much lower, leading to smaller pay-outs on regulated platforms. As players often opt for games with the highest RTPs, they are invariably drawn to the black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Better experience: No deposit and stake limits, no predefined spin duration, more features, and more games can lead to an overall better user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>While there are a multitude of reasons for consumers to opt for black market gambling sites, a long and expensive licensing process also means many operators may find it more attractive to be licensed elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although being a licensed operator has its advantages, not least of which is being able to show you are compliant and adhere to fair play and responsible gaming measures, it does not necessarily make financial sense. Revenue is capped due to deposit limits, taxes are high, and the offering is limited as every game needs to be tested and approved by GGL (even if another operator already offers the exact same game).</p>



 The challenges, loopholes and regulatory hurdles of the German market. 



<p>Since coming into effect, the German State Treaty has proven to be largely ineffective in preventing access to the black market. Attempts at geo-blocking websites are often ineffective, as a recent example from Turkey showed, where one unregulated site was blocked but within minutes had sent a new URL to players via an SMS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main tool German authorities have in the fight against the black market is the ability to pressure payment providers to not process payments for illegal operators. However, when one payment method fails, players invariably just switch methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another important factor driving players to the black market is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC check</a>. As per KYC requirements, German operators are required to verify players at the registration stage or within 72 hours to weed out fraudsters and prevent underage users from accessing games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the user experience, especially for privacy-conscious Germans can be seen as a hurdle many are simply unwilling to surmount. Few people want to hand over personal details to use a product or service they don’t know much about. Many offshore operators don’t require immediate <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-verification/">identity verification</a>, and usually only do so when players withdraw (a lot of) money from the site. In the case of the Malta Gaming market, this is usually north of €2,000.</p>



 Challenges faced by regulators. 



<p>With a steady decline in tax revenues from legal gambling activities, regulators need to create a more supportive and inclusive environment for players and operators alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the <a href="https://www.dswv.de/">German Betting Association (DSWV)</a> has pledged to work closer with operators to crack down on illegal operators. Industry experts don’t necessarily see this as the right approach, as more bans won’t solve the problem of players being drawn to more attractive offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prohibition and restrictions can drive consumers directly to the black market. As covered in the webinar, high barriers to entry for operators, such as a lengthy licensing process and high taxes on stakes, can be a significant barrier to entry for many operators, while players are often deterred from regulated operators by the monthly deposit and wagering limits, as well as the need to verify their identity before placing a bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the webinar, Bernd Henning of <a href="https://www.igamingconsult.com/en/">IGamingConsult.com</a> agreed that while steps must be taken to prevent players from using the black market, the main conundrum facing operators is “How can we operate within the confines of the law and still make a profit?”</p>



 Does LUGAS help or hinder? 



<p>LUGAS, which is Germany’s Interstate Gambling Evaluation System, is used to evaluate the data submitted by operators and ensure deposit limits and other regulations are met. It is mandatory for all online gambling operators to connect to LUGAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a cross-operator database, it includes deposit limits and regulates access to the regulator’s platform. The system enforces a rule that restricts a player to accessing only one platform at a time, coupled with a specific deposit limit. However, the system is not without its detractors, with even the DSWV raising concerns about data protection. A common criticism is that operators themselves have no way of auditing LUGAS, which raises serious concerns about transparency and accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gluecksspiel-behoerde.de/de/aufsichtssysteme/technische-richtlinien-und-zugang-zum-testsystem-des-laenderuebergreifenden-gluecksspielaufsichtssystem-lugas">LUGAS</a> appears to be contributing to the growing trend of players turning to the black market. In Denmark, for example, the imposition of a deposit limit led to a significant shift of players to unregulated casinos. However, as soon as this restriction was lifted, players returned to the regulated market. This underlines the importance for regulators to monitor developments in other regulated markets and learn from their experiences with different regulations to effectively navigate the dynamic landscape of online gambling.</p>



 The way forward for regulators, operators, and players. 



<p>The current landscape of gambling regulation in Germany is a valiant, but perhaps misguided attempt to modernize the industry and strike a balance between consumer protection and market openness. However, ironically, it also appears to be driving users and operators to the black market, which suggests a misalignment with the original goal of player protection. A comprehensive re-evaluation of the entire regulatory process may be necessary to achieve the desired results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep players within the regulated sphere, cooperation with established international regulators like the <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/">MGA</a> is essential. Working together to simplify processes and gain a deeper understanding of the market will benefit German regulators, operators, and players alike. For example, the removal of deposit and wagering limits could help to retain players, while the introduction of a game whitelist could streamline the licensing process for operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ongoing discussions within the German regulatory landscape underline the importance of adapting strategies to adjust to shifting trends and market development. Whether this is done by launching a series of consultations with invested stakeholders like what is currently happening in the UK will ultimately be the decision of German regulators and policymakers. What is clear though is that a collaborative and adaptive approach will be key in creating a thriving, regulated gambling industry that addresses the challenges of an attractive black market.</p>

<p>Today, we announced a new logo for Bluesky:</p>

 Why did we choose a butterfly? 
<p>Well, of course, it flies. But more importantly, it is a symbol of change and transformation. Early on, we noticed that people were organically using the butterfly emoji 🦋 to indicate their Bluesky handles. We loved it, and adopted it as it spread. The butterfly speaks to our mission of transforming social media into something new.</p>
<p>Like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, we are starting to open up. Posts on Bluesky have been public from the start through the open protocol, but today we’re making them publicly accessible through the app. We’re unfolding a little bit at a time, and are excited to bring you along on this journey of metamorphosis!</p>
 What’s in a name? 
<p>The name “Bluesky” was originally a placeholder for the project started by Twitter to build an open social protocol. I decided to keep the name when I was chosen as the lead of the project. It’s memorable and symbolizes the open space of possibilities: the Twitter bird freed from a closed platform to fly in Bluesky’s open ecosystem.</p>

The last slide of the presentation I gave to Twitter in my proposal for how to build Bluesky.
<p>As the project matured, we named the underlying standard the AT Protocol, or atproto. Bluesky, as the more colorful (and less technical) name everyone was familiar with, is also what we named the first app we built on atproto. But Bluesky is not the limit. Many more apps and experiences are already beginning to emerge — there are thousands of custom feeds, dozens of other clients, and atproto will eventually support other apps. We hope that Bluesky, as the first app, will be a catalyst for change and transform how social media works, like a butterfly flapping its wings.</p>
 What if I don’t like butterflies? 
<p>The great thing about an open network is that anyone can build on top of it and customize it further! Maybe you like birds more. Well, someone could build BirdSky, and you could switch to using that and still be in the same network, still have the same friends, and still see the same posts.</p>
<p>The protocol that makes Bluesky, BirdSky, and endless other options possible is also what makes Bluesky “billionaire-proof.” Just like you can change email providers or cell phone carriers and bring all your contacts, photos, or messages with you, in an open network, you’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too.</p>
 Explore Bluesky 
<p>We built Bluesky to be a home for public conversation — breaking news, commentary and analysis, jokes and more. And we’re taking one step closer to this goal by releasing a public web view, which means that you don’t have to be logged in to view posts on Bluesky.</p>
<p>Starting today, you can easily view Bluesky posts without being logged in. Sharing will be more convenient — whether it's a joke you want to text a friend, or a post you want to embed in an article.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">Machine learning</a> (ML) technologies can drive decision-making in virtually all industries, from healthcare to human resources to finance and in myriad use cases, like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/computer-vision">computer vision</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models">large language models</a> (LLMs), speech recognition, self-driving cars and more.</p>



<p>However, the growing influence of ML isn’t without complications. The validation and training datasets that undergird ML technology are often aggregated by human beings, and humans are susceptible to bias and prone to error. Even in cases where an ML model isn’t itself biased or faulty, deploying it in the wrong context can produce errors with unintended harmful consequences.</p>



<p>That’s why diversifying enterprise AI and ML usage can prove invaluable to maintaining a competitive edge. Each type and sub-type of ML algorithm has unique benefits and capabilities that teams can leverage for different tasks. Here, we’ll discuss the five major types and their applications.</p>



 What is machine learning? 



<p>ML is a computer science, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">data science</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) subset that enables systems to learn and improve from data without additional programming interventions.</p>



<p>Instead of using explicit instructions for performance optimization, ML models rely on algorithms and statistical models that deploy tasks based on data patterns and inferences. In other words, ML leverages input data to predict outputs, continuously updating outputs as new data becomes available.</p>



<p>On retail websites, for instance, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning-algorithms">machine learning algorithms</a> influence consumer buying decisions by making recommendations based on purchase history. Many retailers’ e-commerce platforms—including those of IBM, Amazon, Google, Meta and Netflix—rely on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to deliver personalized recommendations. And retailers frequently leverage data from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbots</a> and virtual assistants, in concert with ML and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a> (NLP) technology, to automate users’ shopping experiences.</p>



 Machine learning types 



<p>Machine learning algorithms fall into five broad categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised and reinforcement learning.</p>



 1. Supervised machine learning 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supervised-learning">Supervised machine learning</a> is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset (i.e., the target or outcome variable is known). For instance, if data scientists were building a model for tornado forecasting, the input variables might include date, location, temperature, wind flow patterns and more, and the output would be the actual tornado activity recorded for those days.</p>



<p>Supervised learning is commonly used for risk assessment, image recognition, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/predictive-analytics">predictive analytics</a> and fraud detection, and comprises several types of algorithms.</p>



 
 Regression algorithms—predict output values by identifying linear relationships between real or continuous values (e.g., temperature, salary). Regression algorithms include linear regression, random forest and gradient boosting, as well as other subtypes. 



 Classification algorithms—predict categorical output variables (e.g., “junk” or “not junk”) by labeling pieces of input data. Classification algorithms include logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines (SVMs), among others. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/naive-bayes">Naïve Bayes classifiers</a>—enable classification tasks for large datasets. They’re also part of a family of generative learning algorithms that model the input distribution of a given class or/category. Naïve Bayes algorithms include <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decision-trees">decision trees</a>, which can actually accommodate both regression and classification algorithms. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">Neural networks</a>—simulate the way the human brain works, with a huge number of linked processing nodes that can facilitate processes like natural language translation, image recognition, speech recognition and image creation. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/random-forest">Random forest algorithms</a>—predict a value or category by combining the results from a number of decision trees. 
 



 2. Unsupervised machine learning 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised learning</a> algorithms—like Apriori, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and principal component analysis (PCA)—draw inferences from unlabeled datasets, facilitating exploratory data analysis and enabling pattern recognition and predictive modeling.</p>



<p>The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which uses clustering algorithms to categorize data points according to value similarity (as in customer segmentation or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/anomaly-detection">anomaly detection</a>). Association algorithms allow data scientists to identify associations between data objects inside large databases, facilitating data visualization and dimensionality reduction.</p>



 
 K-means clustering—assigns data points into K groups, where the data points closest to a given centroid are clustered under the same category and K represents clusters based on their size and level of granularity. K-means clustering is commonly used for market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation and image compression. 



 Hierarchical clustering—describes a set of clustering techniques, including agglomerative clustering—where data points are initially isolated into groups and then merged iteratively based on similarity until one cluster remains—and divisive clustering—where a single data cluster is divided based on the differences between data points. 



 Probabilistic clustering—helps solve density estimation or “soft” clustering problems by grouping data points based on the likelihood that they belong to a particular distribution. 
 



<p>Unsupervised ML models are often behind the “customers who bought this also bought…” types of recommendation systems.</p>



 3. Self-supervised machine learning 



<p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) enables models to train themselves on unlabeled data, instead of requiring massive annotated and/or labeled datasets. SSL algorithms, also called predictive or pretext learning algorithms, learn one part of the input from another part, automatically generating labels and transforming unsupervised problems into supervised ones. These algorithms are especially useful for jobs like computer vision and NLP, where the volume of labeled training data needed to train models can be exceptionally large (sometimes prohibitively so).</p>



 4. Reinforcement learning 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/rlhf">Reinforcement learning</a>, also called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), is a type of dynamic programming that trains algorithms using a system of reward and punishment. To deploy reinforcement learning, an agent takes actions in a specific environment to reach a predetermined goal. The agent is rewarded or penalized for its actions based on an established metric (typically points), encouraging the agent to continue good practices and discard bad ones. With repetition, the agent learns the best strategies.</p>



<p>Reinforcement learning algorithms are common in video game development and are frequently used to teach robots how to replicate human tasks.</p>



 5. Semi-supervised learning  



<p>The fifth type of machine learning technique offers a combination between supervised and unsupervised learning.</p>



<p>Semi-supervised learning algorithms are trained on a small labeled dataset and a large unlabeled dataset, with the labeled data guiding the learning process for the larger body of unlabeled data. A semi-supervised learning model might use unsupervised learning to identify data clusters and then use supervised learning to label the clusters.</p>



<p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs)—<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">deep learning</a> tool that generates unlabeled data by training two neural networks—are an example of semi-supervised machine learning.</p>



<p>Regardless of type, ML models can glean data insights from enterprise data, but their vulnerability to human/data bias make responsible AI practices an organizational imperative.</p>

<p>Customer experience strategy (CX strategy) is when organizations optimize customer engagements to create happy customers, drive customer loyalty and help to recruit new customers.</p>



<p>Providing a better <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer experience</a> takes into consideration the entire customer journey and every customer touch-point. It identifies new customers through awareness, consideration, and purchase, aims to retain customers, and drives word-of-mouth through the post-purchase phase.</p>



<p>Customer-centric organizations prioritize great <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer experience</a> as an important piece of their brand identity. Meeting customer expectations requires discipline and compassion across the entire customer journey map.</p>



<p>Creating happy customers should be a major business goal of every organization, as those types of customers are more likely to become repeat purchasers and make the effort to recommend products to their friends and family through word-of-mouth. Doing so increases the potential for profitability and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-retention">customer retention</a>. </p>



 <a></a>Seven hallmarks of a successful customer experience strategy 



<p>Customer experience requires the right strategy and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-trends/">dedicated actions</a> to drive success. Here are seven components every organization should include in their CX strategy:</p>



 1. Invest in the right technology  



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-chatbots-can-provide-a-better-customer-experience/">Automation and chatbots</a> are two such technologies that are revolutionizing customer experience, especially with the increasing rise of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-future/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) that adds more sophistication to these tools. As more customers look to solve their issues online or through self-service, organizations that fail to use advanced technologies to better serve customer needs will fail at customer experience. In a recent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/customer-service">IBV CEO Guide to Generative AI for Customer Service study</a>, CEOs identified <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-types/">customer service</a> as the number one priority for incorporating generative AI investment.</p>



 2. Address pain points 



<p>Meeting customer needs is a key component of customer experience and the best way to avoid customer churn. While not every customer who is dissatisfied with a product will voice their bad experiences, those who do voice them expect the organization to address and solve them quickly. When customer support teams pay attention to issues raised by loyal customers, they are more likely to retain those customers and make them strong advocates for the brand.</p>



 3. Create personas 



<p>Every customer is different. A way organizations can better personalize their outreach is to group similar-minded customers into person groups so they can better target the right messaging and targeting. Examples of personas are those who are price sensitive, and likely to switch brands if the organization’s prices rise, or those who are early adopters, who buy the latest technologies as soon as they are available.</p>



<p>One way to create personas is to track customer interactions such as purchases, time of purchase, and types of purchases in a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/crm">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) database. CRMs help organizations better understand their customers and find ways to provide more value. A comprehensive and up-to-date CRM can identify whether a particular customer is ready to buy or whether a highly valuable customer may be in danger of switching brands.</p>



 4. Measure everything 



<p>Establishing and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) is an important component of customer experience management. Organizations have several powerful ways to solicit and analyze customer feedback. It’s important to collect a variety of customer experience metrics to understand the user experience and track progress on key organizational goals. Here are some of the most important metrics to track:</p>



 
 Net promoter score (NPS): This customer data point identifies how likely a customer would be to recommend an organization’s products to friends and family. It is a good representation of how satisfied customers are, given that they would go out of their way to talk about the product with people in their orbit. 



 Customer satisfaction score (CSAT): This score focuses specifically on how happy a customer is with an organization’s products. It is often expressed as a percentage from 0-100, which enables organizations to track their improvements (or decline) over time. 



 Customer effort score: This is a metric that measures how much work it takes for a customer to interact with a business. This is effectively a customer support metric, which identifies how well that service is helping customers solve issues and get the most out of their products. Examples of issues that could affect a customer effort score are poor response times to customer questions, difficulty achieving technical support or long stock-outs that require a customer to routinely check back to see if the product they want is available. 
 



 5. Prioritize employee experience 



<p>Providing a good customer experience requires input and dedication from multiple stakeholders. Prioritizing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/employee-experience">employee experience</a>—making sure employees are happy, well-trained and fairly compensated—is an important component of any customer experience strategy. Team members who are treated well and trained extensively are more likely to provide excellent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-care">customer care</a> and go out of their way to serve their customers’ needs.</p>



 6. Embrace omnichannel customer relationships 



<p>Organizations have a variety of channels in which they can reach customers and build stronger relationships, and it is important to embrace this <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/omnichannel-customer-service">omnichannel customer service</a> approach. For instance, consumers are increasingly spending time on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-experience">digital experiences such </a>as social media and mobile apps. That provides an opportunity for organizations to learn more about what they want and respond directly to their questions or complaints. Some organizations also create knowledge bases where customers can search for answers and solve their issues without needing to interact directly with a human worker.</p>



 7. Invest in customer success 



<p>Leading organizations realize that the post-purchase period can be just as important for the overall customer experience as the awareness and consideration phases. Customers who regret their purchases or have unsolved issues are less likely to become repeat customers. They also are less likely to recommend or promote those products and companies to their networks. That’s why organizations are increasingly investing in customer success teams that work directly with customers post-purchase to ensure they are maximizing the value they get out of their purchases.</p>



 <a></a>Customer experience represents the pathway to repeat engagement 



<p>Providing a positive customer experience can become a competitive advantage, especially when customers have been more likely to switch brands since the height of the Covid-19 <a href="https://www.ifs.com/assets/service-management/state-of-service">pandemic</a>.</p>



<p>IBM has been helping enterprises apply trusted AI in this space for more than a decade, and generative AI has further potential to significantly transform customer and field service with the ability to understand complex inquiries and generate more human-like, conversational responses.</p>



<p>At IBM, we put customer experience strategy at the center of your business, helping you position it as a competitive advantage.

<p>A successful business strategy dictates the allocation of resources and outlines how a company will achieve its strategic goals. Whether the organization is focused on developing new products or marketing an existing service to an under-served demographic, having a solid strategy will help an organization realize its long-term goals. Typically, a strategy will be informed by core business objectives and keep key performance indicators (KPIs) in mind. It’s also essential to understand an organization’s market position, as the following business strategy examples will show.</p>



 Types of business strategy 



<p>Over the last decades, researchers and business leaders have identified a handful of so-called <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/business-strategy-types/">“generic strategies”</a> with broad application across the business landscape. These core business strategies are:</p>



 
 Broad cost leadership strategy 



 Broad differentiation strategy 



 Focused differentiation strategy 



 Focused cost leadership strategy 
 



<p>But there are dozens of variations on these core concepts, and an organization may choose to enact certain types of strategies at different points. Good business strategies are carefully considered, but that doesn’t mean they’re static. Successful leaders will routinely review a strategy’s key components and update their plans.</p>



<p>For instance, entrepreneurs looking to increase profits might pursue a cost-cutting strategy, while a business hoping to expand would consider a growth strategy. If customer churn or dissatisfaction is a particular issue, a customer retention strategy would be more appropriate.</p>



<p>For economically healthy companies attempting to move into new markets, a diversification strategy—involving new customers or product lines—or a partnership strategy—involving the acquisition of new companies—might be best.</p>



<p>Still, exploring the core generic strategies can provide insight into how some of the world’s most successful corporations have leveraged market research to create phenomenally profitable roadmaps. Some examples of business strategies that embody these foundational theories are explored below.</p>



 Broad cost leadership strategy example: Walmart 



<p>When Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, started his retail career in the 1940s, he had a simple idea: To find less expensive suppliers than those who served his competition and pass those savings on to the customers in his variety stores. Where many business leaders might attempt to profit directly from such favorable margins, <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/sam-walton-great-from-the-start">Walton decided to pursue an economy of scale</a>, profiting by attracting more customers rather than charging those customers more. In the more than seven decades since, Walmart has become one of the most famous examples of cost leadership strategy, which undercuts competition by offering goods or services at the lowest possible price.</p>



<p>As the company grew, it was able to take advantage of its ubiquity to demand lower prices from suppliers and sell goods for even less over time. Many of these savings have then been passed on to customers shopping in the stores, resulting in progressively cheaper goods. The retailer’s advertisements underscore this fact, encouraging customers to “Save money. Live Better.”</p>



<p>By the early 2000s, Walmart’s cost leadership strategy had been so successful <a href="https://pressbooks.lib.vt.edu/strategicmanagement/chapter/6-3-cost-leadership/">one-third of Americans were frequent Walmart customers</a>, illustrating how winning the price game can lead to a massively successful bottom line. This has been crucial for the big-box retailer as it increasingly competes with e-commerce giants like Amazon.</p>



 Broad differentiation business strategy example: Starbucks 



<p>When Starbucks was founded as a small business in 1971, high-end coffee was a niche market in the United States. But Howard Schultz, the company’s founder, believed there was an opportunity to import Italian coffee culture and differentiate his business from competitors like Dunkin Donuts.</p>



<p>To gain a competitive advantage over stores offering cheap coffee in fast food-type settings, Schultz opened a series of cozy cafes that encouraged long visits. Though the items sold at Starbucks were more expensive than those of the competitors, they were highlighted in marketing campaigns as unique and superior quality goods. Starbucks also paid careful attention to its supply chain, ensuring is products were ethically sourced and offering specialty drinks that in some geographic locations could be difficult to find. The company’s early focus on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/talent-management">talent management</a> for service employees was a major differentiator, as well.</p>



<p>Over time Starbucks also focused heavily on personalization, encouraging customers to create favorite drinks. Later in the company’s tenure, the company introduced loyalty cards and other advantages for repeat customers to encourage customer retention.</p>



<p>Today, Starbucks stores are ubiquitous across the globe, and the company’s success has made it one of the prime examples of differentiation strategy that undercuts competition by providing a premium product that is significantly more desirable than existing goods.</p>



 Focused differentiation strategy example: REI 



<p>A focused differentiation strategy—unlike a broad differentiation strategy, which seeks to gain massive market share by providing a premium good—tailors its business plan to a select group of consumers. The outdoor outfitter REI has had significant success in focused differentiation through a series of business decisions and marketing strategies that underscore the values of its target demographic. In REI’s case, product differentiation relies on how the business communicates its core values and provides a unique customer experience.</p>



<p>REI frequently positions itself as an ethical and sustainable outdoor brand: As the company says, it prefers to put “<a href="https://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/outdoor-retailer-reis-path-to-purpose-01649282063">purpose before profits.</a>” Since its inception, the company has underscored initiatives like its co-op membership model and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-sustainability">sustainability commitments</a> as a way to distinguish itself from competitors catering to more general audiences. Recently, the brand engaged in a relatively risky marketing strategy that reflects its goal of capturing a specific group of loyal customers.</p>



<p>Starting in 2015, <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/what-retailers-can-learn-from-reis-marketing-success/504324/#:~:text=REI%20and%20other%20specialty%20retailers%20have%20the%20unique,is%20less%20of%20a%20cut-throat%20battle%20among%20competitors">REI closed its stores on Black Friday</a>, the most popular shopping day of the year, and encouraged employees to spend the day outdoors. The initiative was accompanied by a social media campaign to bolster the brand’s reach. REI might sell products at a higher cost than its competitors, and operate fewer than 200 stores, but its business model is based on the idea that a loyal group of customers will find its messages and products relevant enough to pay a premium for goods they could easily find somewhere else.</p>



 Focused cost leadership strategy example: Dollar General 



<p>Where Walmart’s cost leadership strategy relied on becoming ubiquitous and operating at massive scales, the discount chain Dollar General has captured price-conscious consumers in more specific markets. Rather than trying to enter an entirely new market, the company focused on providing low-cost goods to rural consumers. Its strategy has been to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dollar-general-opens-where-walmart-isnt-pays-off-in-pandemic-2020-5">open small stores in areas where big-box stores might not</a> be and offer a complementary pricing strategy that attracts budget-conscious consumers.</p>



<p>This strategy has allowed Dollar General to grow into a smart and efficient operation with a strong target market and relatively low overhead. Typically, the chain <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dollar-general-low-price-strategy-2018-8">leases its stores</a> and keeps them small and bare bones, saving money on real estate and extensive labor costs. Stores also typically stock a smaller number of products targeted to its specific customer base, cutting costs and allowing it precise control of its supply chain process. By spending less to open stores, allocating fewer resources to advertising, and targeting regional cost-conscious customers, the chain expanded successfully into a niche market.</p>



 The importance of agility in business strategy 



<p>As the previous effective business strategies illustrate, strategic planning is crucial for an organization working to achieve its business goals. A strong sense of where the company should be heading makes decision-making easier, and can guide operations across all business units, from the organization’s corporate-level strategy to its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/product-development">product development</a> plans. At their most effective, business strategies can be utilized on a functional level, meaning every department from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/finance-transformation">finance</a> to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/human-capital-management">human resources</a> is guided by the business’ broader goals.</p>



<p>But not all successful businesses strategies will conform precisely to the four generic models outlined above. Often, a company will combine aspects of one or more strategies, or pivot as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-transformation">markets and technologies change</a>. This has been particularly true for startups, which often serve a diverse set of stakeholders and may base their value proposition on new technologies. Still, as the above examples show, the optimization of a business’ operations relies on thinking critically about how its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-process-management">disparate parts can work together</a> to achieve a singular goal.</p>

<p>Hybrid cloud has become the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/infrastructure">IT infrastructure</a> of choice, providing the interoperability and portability organizations need to access data where and when they need it. Yet navigating the complexities of building and managing a hybrid environment poses unique challenges. To capture the most value from hybrid cloud, business and IT leaders must develop a solid hybrid cloud strategy supporting their core business objectives.&nbsp;</p>



 Hybrid cloud architecture 



<p>A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a> computing environment combines and unifies <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/public-cloud">public cloud</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/private-cloud">private cloud</a> and on-premises infrastructure to create a single, flexible IT infrastructure:&nbsp;</p>



 
 On-premises infrastructure&nbsp;(also referred to as “on-prem”) is a traditional form of computing infrastructure that includes on-premises <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers"></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a> and computing resources that a business owns and operates at its own physical location. 



 Public cloud infrastructure&nbsp;is a&nbsp;type of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> where a third-party cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Services, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure) makes computing resources—like ready-to-use software applications, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machines (VMs)</a>, enterprise-grade infrastructures and development platforms—available to users over the public internet. 



 Private cloud infrastructure&nbsp;is a dedicated cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by a third party.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Modern hybrid cloud environments also include orchestration and management tools. These software applications integrate off-premises and cloud-based environments to deliver unified cloud deployment and management capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cloud computing services and management products fall into three primary categories:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</a>&nbsp;offers applications hosted on a cloud server and distributed to end-users over the public internet. Common SaaS product examples include Zoom (for video conferencing) and Google Drive (for file management). 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas#:~:text=Infrastructure-as-a-Service">Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)</a> offers consumers fundamental compute, network and storage resources on demand. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/paas">Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</a>&nbsp;offers complete hybrid cloud platform capabilities for developing, running and managing applications. 
 



 The hybrid multicloud model 



<p>Today most enterprise businesses rely on a hybrid multicloud environment.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud">Multicloud</a>&nbsp;is a cloud computing solution that combines public cloud services from more than one cloud vendor and is portable across multiple cloud providers’ cloud infrastructures. A hybrid multicloud approach creates greater flexibility and reduces an organization’s dependency on one vendor, therefore preventing vendor lock-in.</p>



<p>Hybrid multiclouds are typically built on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/open-source">open-source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">cloud-native</a>&nbsp;technologies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>. Also known as “k8s” or “kube,” Kubernetes is a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">container orchestration</a> platform for scheduling and automating the deployment, management and scaling of containerized applications. Hybrid multicloud cloud environments also include tools for managing workloads across multiple environments. These include single consoles or dashboards that help create a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/single-pane-of-glass">single pane of glass (SPOG)</a> so teams can easily view and control resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A hybrid multicloud environment supports <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices (or microservices architecture)</a>, the cloud-native architectural approach in which a single application comprises many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components or services. Microservices enable faster development and deployment of software because each service can be developed and deployed separately. For instance, a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> team can quickly scale or extend an application’s functionality by adding new microservices without having to add a line of code or affecting other aspects of the application. Examples of industries that have switched from monolithic architecture to microservices include subscription-based streaming services like Netflix, which uses microservices to track user activities, their history and other data to make real-time recommendations for enhanced engagement and better customer experiences.</p>



 Building a successful hybrid cloud strategy&nbsp; 



<p>Every organization must contend with its own infrastructure, distinct workloads, business processes and workflow needs. To that end, developing a hybrid cloud strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach but must be tailored to meet individual business needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To map out a successful hybrid cloud strategy, here are a few critical steps:</p>



 1. Create a vision 



<p>The initial phase of a hybrid cloud strategy should center on defining a clear and compelling hybrid cloud vision plan that reflects both immediate and long-term business goals. For instance, organizations can capitalize on a hybrid cloud environment to improve customer experience, comply with regulations, optimize costs, enhance data security and more.</p>



<p>Start by carefully analyzing your existing systems, applications and workforce skills. Identify the current and emerging business and technology challenges that a hybrid cloud approach could address and allow you to achieve digital transformation without significant disruption or downtime. Does your company need services to accelerate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-migration#:">cloud migration</a>? Or are you looking to accelerate business transformation by leveraging cloud-native technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers">containers</a> and microservices to optimize and modernize your workloads?</p>



 2. Outline business use cases 



<p>A well-defined hybrid cloud strategy should clearly articulate potential business use cases that would bring overall benefits to your organization. Many enterprise businesses use a hybrid cloud approach for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/backup-disaster-recovery">backup and disaster recovery</a>, which involves periodically creating or updating one more copies of files, storing them in one or more remote locations, and using the copies to continue or resume business operations in the case or of data corruption, cyberattack or natural disaster.</p>



<p>Hybrid cloud-based backup and disaster recovery solutions can support both on-premises and cloud-based production environments. For instance, hospitals and health systems used to store all of their business and medical records on-premises. In response to rapid data growth, healthcare entities have turned to hybrid cloud as an effective way to better help store and secure data in a private cloud. Additionally, healthcare&nbsp;and medical providers now governed by <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html">HIPAA</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) regulations must retain redundant business and medical records. A hybrid cloud setting is ideal for extensive cloud storage and cloud backup, as both capabilities ensure business continuity and data recovery (BCDR) to protect sensitive data in the event of a disaster. </p>



<p>Another potential use case to consider when mapping out a hybrid cloud strategy is cloud bursting, a configuration between a private cloud and public cloud that uses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/load-balancing">load balancing</a>. This technique is used to redirect traffic overflow when spikes in demand require more computing power, thus eliminating the need for over-provisioning. Online retailers, for example, can use cloud bursting during peak holiday shopping seasons by shifting necessary workloads to public cloud infrastructure where processing demands won’t exceed capacity.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Determine cloud migration needs 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-migration">Cloud migration</a> has become a pivotal business imperative for streamlining IT operations, implementing cost-saving measures and accelerating overall digital transformation. To create a successful cloud migration, organizations should create a workflow that includes comprehensive planning, execution and optimization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While each company’s exact cloud migration approach is different based on their business and technology needs, several migration strategies can help streamline the process. These strategies&nbsp;include “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/lift-and-shift">lift-and-shift</a>” (the process of migrating an exact copy of an application or workload from on-premises to public or private cloud), refactoring (modifying an application by leveraging cloud-native capabilities) or rebuilding new applications to re-architect as needed.</p>



 4. Assess workloads 



<p>In cloud computing, a workload refers to any service, application or capability that consumes cloud resources (e.g., virtual machines, databases, applications, microservices and nodes). A hybrid cloud strategy includes assessing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/workload">workloads</a> and determining where you want to locate them in a hybrid cloud environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Workloads involving web content, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/big-data-analytics">big data analytics</a> and AI are ideal for a hybrid cloud infrastructure. For instance, hybrid cloud can help accelerate <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a> for customer service. By supporting access to high-performance computing resources&nbsp;needed to support large volumes of customer data, hybrid cloud enables technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-agent">virtual agents</a> to deliver personalized answers and recommendations and offer tailored suggestions and solutions to enhance the customer experience.</p>



 5. Choose the best cloud service partners 



<p>Translate your vision into an action plan by carefully choosing the right cloud service providers. Your hybrid cloud provider should help you bridge private and public infrastructures by supporting technology you may already have in place, such as virtualized machines, to create minimal downtime and limit costs.</p>



<p>By choosing a unified hybrid cloud platform approach, your organization can harness a full range of services. Choose a hybrid cloud management platform that can run on any cloud and an orchestration tool that spans clouds to support workloads that can be deployed seamlessly across a multicloud environment for optimal business and operational performance. Then align your multicloud ecosystem partnerships under one strategy to bring together the best cloud services and technologies.</p>



 6. Evaluate overall costs 



<p>Bear in mind that cloud service providers offer different pricing models and service levels to help you align cloud IT resources and costs with application needs and business value. These pricing models include a range of service costs—including cloud storage costs, platform costs, server costs and software maintenance costs—that are often complicated and need to be evaluated carefully. For instance, some public cloud providers charge extra for data egress (e.g., removing data from the cloud), which makes the act of switching cloud providers more expensive.</p>



<p>Cloud service provider costs can climb higher than anticipated, especially with multiple vendors involved, which is why monitoring&nbsp;cloud spend is critical. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-cloud-cost-optimization/">Cloud cost-optimization</a> software tools can help monitor workload demands for maximum cost-efficient performance.</p>



 7. Weave in robust security 



<p>The IT industry has traditionally relied mainly on perimeter security strategies like firewalls to protect valuable resources, such as user data and intellectual property. A hybrid multicloud infrastructure where resources are distributed throughout multiple IT environments with many endpoints (including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">IoT</a> devices and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">edge</a> environments) with varying levels of visibility and control calls for an end-to-end&nbsp;holistic security approach. Organizations need to implement a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/zero-trust">zero-trust</a> framework where data must also be <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">encrypted</a> to ensure only valid users can access it.</p>



<p>Overall, your hybrid cloud strategy must include&nbsp;a unified security program that steers business initiatives, optimizes security resources and transforms operating culture to be security first. Today, hybrid cloud security platforms combine <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> to ingest high volumes of complex security data, enabling near-real-time threat detection and prediction.</p>



 8. Consider compliance and regulatory standards 



<p>Building a hybrid cloud strategy includes incorporating the regulatory environment specific to your industry. For instance, companies that must adhere to <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> compliance can specify locations where data is not permitted to reside, whether in a public or private cloud, and tailor data migration and protection rules accordingly. The beauty of a hybrid cloud environment is that it offers organizations the agility to keep up with the ever-evolving regulations that alter rules governing the use and storage of personal data.</p>



 Key hybrid cloud benefits 



<p>A hybrid cloud approach helps businesses achieve significant benefits, including the following:</p>



 
 Scalability:&nbsp;Use public cloud compute and cloud storage resources to scale up quickly, automatically and cost-effectively. 



 Business acceleration: Harness the latest cloud technologies, such as generative AI&nbsp;and&nbsp;machine learning, to gain a competitive edge. 



 Developer productivity: Enable DevOps and other teams to collaborate with greater agility and velocity. 



 Infrastructure efficiency:&nbsp;Carry out mission-critical digital transformation initiatives like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization">application modernization</a> (i.e., shifting legacy apps to the cloud). 



 Risk and compliance management: Draw on the latest cloud-based security and regulatory technology tools to ensure&nbsp;data protection. 



 Long-term strategic flexibility: Meet ever-changing market demands and integrate new cloud-based technologies with ease as they emerge.

 In November 2022, the European Banking Authority issued its guidelines for the use of remote entry solutions in the banking and financial sector. High-level or substantial identification schemes and qualified electronic signature solutions took the spotlight. So what’s the difference between these two solutions? How do you choose? PVID vs QES: Which solutions are best for banking and financial relationships? 



 A changing regulatory environment: an overview. 



 The six requirements of the Monetary and Financial Code. 



<p>Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) sets out six means of customer identification, to ensure that the customer enters into a remote relationship in complete confidence. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">banking establishment</a> must apply at least two of these measures (generally number 1 plus another complementary measure) in order to comply with local <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">anti-money laundering directives</a>.</p>



 







 European Banking Association recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Since October 2, 2023, the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Guidelines/2022/EBA-GL-2022-15%20GL%20on%20remote%20customer%20onboarding/1043884/Guidelines%20on%20the%20use%20of%20Remote%20Customer%20Onboarding%20Solutions.pdf">European Banking Association (EBA) has been recommending the use of solutions</a> such as qualified electronic signatures and substantial or high-level identification schemes, such as PVID, in order to strengthen the fight against fraud when entering into a relationship.</p>



 The position of the AMF and ACPR in France.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In line with the EBA’s recommendations, the authorities that regulate the French financial market, Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) and L’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de (ACPR), point out the vulnerabilities notably linked to the first installment in the fight against fraud. However, this third measure remains compliant, and is often perceived as less burdensome in terms of user experience, and simpler for regulated institutions to implement, than the measures outlined by the EBA.</p>



 Focus on complementary entry methods. 



<p>Following the EBA’s recommendations, solutions such as qualified electronic signatures and substantial or high-level identification schemes like PVID are favored by regulators when it comes to guaranteeing a more secure entry into the relationship. But what exactly does this mean? Let’s take a closer look.</p>



 Qualified electronic signature.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)</a> offers the highest level of security and guarantee of all electronic signatures. It reliably identifies the signatory and protects it against falsification or alteration. It uses a qualified certificate issued by a certified supplier and it is a particularly robust solution from an anti-fraud point-of-view, and inclusive from a user experience point-of-view.</p>



<p>How does the solution work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The user takes a picture of his or her identity document&nbsp;  The user’s face is then captured on video&nbsp;&nbsp;  Finally, the user signs his or her contract electronically  



 







 PVID certified by ANSSI.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In March 2021, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-baseline-and-challenges/">ANSSI issued a set of requirements for Remote Identity Verification Service Providers (PVID)</a>. The aim of this certification is to create a uniform, trusted service offering for identity verification providers. This solution is built for security, and is designed to limit identity fraud and advanced forgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does the solution work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The user takes a video capture of his or her document and face.&nbsp;  These captures are then automatically and manually verified by an agent specialized in document and identity fraud.&nbsp;  A file of evidence is built up, and a verdict is reached on the authenticity of these captures and on the identity of the person concerned.  



 







<blockquote><p>Financial operators need to strike the right balance between having a system that filters out as many fraud attempts as possible, while letting legitimate customers through.</p>Baptiste Forestier – Head of Compliance &amp; DPO at Hero</blockquote>



 The choice of solution: PVID vs QES. 



<p>To strike the right balance, both PVID and Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) offer substantial advantages, as mentioned above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-certification-interview/">IDnow is one of the few certified providers</a> of both electronic signature and identity verification solutions who can help you achieve compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our qualified e-signature solution boasts broad geographical coverage and an easy-to-use workflow, while meeting the main needs of today’s financial players: compliance, fraud prevention and an optimized customer experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence</a> (AI) is a transformative force. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> of tasks that traditionally relied on human intelligence has far-reaching implications, creating new opportunities for innovation and enabling businesses to reinvent their operations. By giving machines the growing capacity to learn, reason and make decisions, AI is impacting nearly every industry, from manufacturing to hospitality, healthcare and academia. Without an AI strategy, organizations risk missing out on the benefits AI can offer.</p>



<p>An AI strategy helps organizations address the complex challenges associated with AI implementation and define its objectives. Whether it’s deeper data analysis, optimization of business processes or improved <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer experiences</a>, having a well-defined purpose and plan will ensure that the adoption of AI aligns with the broader business goals. This alignment is essential for extracting meaningful value from AI and maximizing its impact. A successful AI strategy will also provide a roadmap for addressing challenges, building necessary capabilities and ensuring a strategic and responsible application of AI into the fabric of the organization.</p>



<p>Organizations that make efforts to understand AI now and harness its power will thrive in the future. A robust AI strategy will enable these organizations to navigate the complexities of integrating AI, adapt quickly to technological advancements and optimize their processes, operational efficiency and overall growth.</p>



 What is an AI strategy? 



<p>An artificial intelligence strategy is simply a plan for integrating AI into an organization so that it aligns with and supports the broader goals of the business. A successful AI strategy should act as a roadmap for this plan. Depending on the organization’s goals, the AI strategy might outline the steps to effectively use AI to extract deeper insights from data, enhance efficiency, build a better supply chain or ecosystem and/or improve talent and customer experiences.</p>



<p>A well-formulated AI strategy should also help guide tech infrastructure, ensuring the business is equipped with the hardware, software and other resources needed for effective AI implementation. And since technology evolves so rapidly, the strategy should allow the organization to adapt to new technologies and shifts in the industry. Ethical considerations such as bias, transparency and regulatory concerns should also be addressed to support responsible deployment.</p>



<p>As artificial intelligence continues to impact almost every industry, a well-crafted AI strategy is imperative. It can help organizations unlock their potential, gain a competitive advantage and achieve sustainable success in the ever-changing digital era.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/a-look-into-ibms-ai-ethics-governance-framework/">Read more about IBM’s AI Ethics governance framework</a>



 Benefits of a successful AI strategy 



<p>Building an AI strategy offers many benefits to organizations venturing into artificial intelligence integration. An AI strategy allows organizations to purposefully harness AI capabilities and align AI initiatives with overall business objectives. The AI strategy becomes the compass for meaningful contributions to the organization’s success. It empowers stakeholders to choose projects that will offer the biggest improvement in important processes such as productivity and decision-making as well as the bottom line.</p>



<p>More specifically, an AI strategy outlines the steps that will enable AI projects to smoothly transform ideas into impactful solutions. This calls for the organization to also make important decisions regarding data, talent and technology: A well-crafted strategy will provide a clear plan for managing, analyzing and leveraging data for AI initiatives. It will also determine the talent the organization needs to develop, attract or retain with relevant skills in data science, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a> and AI development. It will also guide the procurement of the necessary hardware, software and cloud computing resources to ensure effective AI implementation.</p>



<p>In essence, a successful AI strategy is indispensable, acting as support for business objectives, facilitating prioritization, optimizing talent and technology choices and ensuring an organized integration of AI that will support organizational success.</p>



 Steps for building a successful AI strategy 



<p>The following steps are commonly used to help craft an effective artificial intelligence strategy:</p>



 Explore the technology 



<p>Gain an understanding of various AI technologies, including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">generative AI</a>, machine learning (ML), natural language processing, computer vision, etc. Research AI use cases to know where and how these technologies are being applied in relevant industries. List issues AI can address and the benefits to be gained. Note the departments that use it, their methods and any roadblocks.</p>



 Assess and discover 



<p>Understand the organization, its priorities and capabilities. Review the size and strength of the IT department, which will implement and manage AI systems. Interview department heads to identify potential issues AI could help solve.</p>



 Define clear objectives 



<p>What problems does the organization need to solve? What metrics need to be improved? Don’t assume AI is always the answer, choose business objectives that are important for the business and that AI has a track record of addressing successfully.</p>



 Identify potential partners and vendors 



<p>Find companies in the AI and ML space that have worked within your industry. Create a list of potential tools, vendors and partnerships, evaluating their experience, reputation, pricing, etc. Prioritize procurement based on the phases and timeline of the AI integration project.</p>



 Build a roadmap 



<p>Create a roadmap that prioritizes early successes that will bring value to the business. Choose projects based on identified practical needs. Determine the tools and support needed and organize them based on what’s most crucial for the project, specifically:</p>



 
 Data: Make a data strategy by determining if new or existing data or datasets will be required to effectively fuel the AI solution. Establish a data governance framework to manage data effectively. 
 



 
 Algorithms:&nbsp;Algorithms are the rules or instructions that enable machines to learn, analyze data and make decisions. A model represents what was learned by a machine learning algorithm. Determine who will deploy algorithms and design, develop and validate models, as expertise is needed to effectively manage these tasks.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Infrastructure: Determine where your AI systems will be hosted and how they will be scaled. Consider whether to deploy on your own infrastructure or on third-party platforms. 
 



 
 Talent and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-process-outsourcing">outsourcing</a>: Assess the readiness of and skills gaps within the organization to implement AI initiatives. Determine if a talent pipeline exists to fill roles such as data scientists and developers or if skills can be developed internally through training. Also assess if certain tasks, such as deployment and operations, should be outsourced. 
 



 Present the AI strategy 



<p>Present the AI strategy to stakeholders, ensuring it aligns with business objectives. Attain buy-in for the proposed roadmap. Clearly communicate the benefits, costs and expected results. Secure the necessary budget to implement the strategy.</p>



 Begin training and encourage learning 



<p>Start upskilling ai teams or hiring individuals with the right AI expertise. Encourage teams to stay updated on the cutting-edge AI advancements and to explore innovative problem-solving methods.</p>



 Establish ethical guidelines 



<p>Understand the ethical implications of the organization’s responsible use of AI. Commit to ethical AI initiatives, inclusive governance models and actionable guidelines. Regularly monitor AI models for potential biases and implement fairness and transparency practices to address ethical concerns.</p>



 Assess and adapt 



<p>Keep up with the fast-paced developments of new products and AI technologies. Adapt the organization’s AI strategy based on new insights and emerging opportunities.</p>



<p>Following these steps will enable the creation of a powerful guide for integrating AI into the organization. This will allow the business to take better advantage of opportunities in the dynamic world of artificial intelligence.</p>



 







 



 Common roadblocks to building a successful AI strategy 



<p>Several issues can get in the way of building and implementing a successful AI strategy. Their potential to impede the process should be assessed early—and issues dealt with accordingly—to effectively move forward.</p>



 Insufficient data 



<p>How and where is your data, really? AI models rely heavily on robust datasets, so insufficient access to relevant and high-quality data can undermine the strategy and the effectiveness of AI applications.</p>



 Lack of AI knowledge 



<p>A lack of awareness about AI’s capabilities and potential applications may lead to skepticism, resistance or misinformed decision-making. This will drain any value from the strategy and block the successful integration of AI into the organization’s processes.</p>



 Misalignment of strategy 



<p>If the AI initiatives are not closely tied to the organization’s goals, priorities, and vision, it may result in wasted efforts, lack of support from leadership and an inability to demonstrate meaningful value.</p>



 Scarcity of talent 



<p>Professionals are needed to effectively develop, implement and manage AI initiatives. A shortage of AI talent, such as data scientists or ML experts, or resistance from current employees to upskill, could impact the viability of the strategy.</p>



 AI strategy and IBM 



<p>Recent developments within artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated the scale and power of this technology on business and society. However, businesses need to determine how to structure and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance">govern</a>&nbsp;these systems responsibly to avoid bias and errors as the scalability of AI technology can have costly effects to both business and society. As your organization uses different datasets to apply machine learning and automation to workflows, it’s important to have the right guardrails in place to ensure data quality, compliance, and transparency within your AI systems.</p>

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>This 3-part blog series has been written to explore why money in its current form is a primary driver of the metacrisis¹ and what an alternative system could look like. We have divided our reflections into three sections to address the following questions:</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic?  What could a desirable future scenario look&nbsp;like?  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel&nbsp;system?   Part 1: what are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? <p>The global monetary system sits at the centre of every crisis we face, yet it is often excluded from mainstream diagnostics and potential response strategies. In this blog we will trace a number of issues from the intrinsic qualities of money itself, through layers of the economy such as money issuance rights and the profit motive, to the brutal service level manifestations of monetary colonisation and transactional oppression.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mrthetrain?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Joshua Hoehne</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><blockquote>1. Money as an intrinsically extractive technology</blockquote><p>In economic textbooks and in the general public discourse, money is often framed as a neutral tool that enables the real economy to function. Perceptions have shifted somewhat following David Graeber’s work highlighting that its origins were bound to social relationships rather than to barter². Despite this, there is still a persistent idea that whilst money might represent underlying social contracts, it is not a powerful force in its own right. In contrast to this benign conception of money, Daniel Schmachtenberger has recently described it as a “unit of game theoretic optimality”³. He argues that it is a uniquely destructive technology for the following reasons:</p>  Money as a highly liquid and abstract value layer: when we exchange goods or services for fiat money (i.e. currency that is not backed by a physical resource such as gold) we are taking complex, entangled values and ruthlessly converting them into a single, indiscriminate and highly liquid token of opportunity. In doing so we are incentivised to consume, exploit and pollute the base layer value of everything.  Singularly upside returns: in an exchange based situation there is a point after which having more of a tangible good or service leads to diminishing returns. In the case of money the opposite is true. Once a base resource is converted into money, it can then be leveraged to generate further monetary returns (e.g. interest, dividends, speculative trading). Thus the liquid token that was exchanged for an underlying resource can self-perpetuate, giving rise to greater claims on other resources and creating an ever increasing cycle of extraction.  <p>As an example, imagine somebody who runs a rose farm and agrees to exchange roses for another commodity such as oil. Having arranged the trade there would be a limit to how many roses would be deemed useful by the supplier of the oil. At this point the roses would have a low liquidity value and there would be a diminishing return on harvesting them. Contrast this scenario with the reality of being able to exchange the roses immediately for money. If the current demand for roses is high, there is a strong incentive to force grow them and sell as many as possible, irrespective of the impact on the intrinsic health of the plants and soil. The money received in exchange for the physical plants can then be used to gain access to more oil (or anything else, including converting the rose farm into a car park if it is more profitable to do&nbsp;so).</p><blockquote>2. Profit as an extractive force that harnesses the liquid optimality of&nbsp;money</blockquote><p>Money can also be understood as the crystallised outcome of profitable activity. Whilst profit generation might be the surface level target, the fundamental goal is to secure the rights over future choices and resources. Profit is money and money is liquid optimality.</p><p>Profit itself is variously described as a distributed signal of value, an appropriate reward, a driver for innovation and the cause of the economic growth obligation. Under different circumstances each of these claims is both true and disputable. If we want to avoid unhelpful, binary reactions to the idea that in its current form profit (and indirectly money) is an extractive force, then these dual ‘truths’ are important to unpack. How would our behaviour change if we understood profit to be a shapeshifting force depending on the&nbsp;context?</p><p>As a signal of value, profit is an important way for people to indicate their preferences and thus collectively shape economic activity. Without such a mechanism we would be reliant on a type of authoritarian centralised planning. In terms of motivation and inspiring progress, it also provides a powerful incentive. However, if we consider how narrowly we define profit can we legitimately claim that it represents value creation? Can a genuine measure of value be bounded by time or geographical context? In an interconnected world, externalities are a delusion yet they are currently excluded from our calculations of&nbsp;profit.</p><p>The way that we define, measure and use profit determines its form. Thus, profit can continue to exist as an extractive claim over undefined future value flows, but it could also be reimagined as a generative tool for decentralised inclusion.</p><blockquote>3. Commercial bank money issuance as a multiplier of future extraction and repression</blockquote><p>The lion’s share of money issued in today’s economy is digitally created by commercial banks in the form of debt. The flexibility of this system has its benefits but its unregulated impact on living systems is profoundly destructive. When debt is issued in this way it creates a future claim on energy, materials and human labour. The right to use the credit (and its associated interest) in the present day creates a future obligation to convert biophysically linked reserves into decoupled monetary units of repayment.</p><p>A second observation is that entrusting the money supply to a niche group of profit incentivised bankers, skews the distribution of who receives funding and thus perpetuates structural inequalities.</p><blockquote>4. Transactional oppression</blockquote><p>In 2010 Wikileaks was permanently blocked from accessing its Paypal account. More recently, a number of journalists and activists have reported having their accounts blocked or removed. A less publicised but equally debilitating phenomenon is that millions of people worldwide are denied the right to a bank account at all. In the UK alone, 1.3 million adults are described as being ‘debanked’ with no access to an account⁴. For some people, this may be a personal choice, but for many others it results from failing to meet KYC (know your client) requirements.</p><p>It is hardly a coincidence that many of the countries with the highest cryptocurrency usage are also amongst the most financially exclusive. For example, Thailand, Nigeria, the Philippines and South Africa all have an uptake of between 19–20% on a per capita basis and an unbanked population higher than&nbsp;30%⁵⁶.</p><p>If money is a social contract, then the ability to transact could be embedded as a fundamental human right, yet our current system ensures that for many this is far from the case. Whilst existing cryptocurrencies offer some reprieve, the dominance of centrally issued and controlled money still forces many communities and even countries into the&nbsp;margins.</p><blockquote>5. Monetary colonisation as a brutal expression of capitalist self-preservation</blockquote><blockquote>Colonialism may be over, but the system that it created — a system designed to siphon wealth from South to North — remains very much in place — <a href="https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2018/10/13/the-case-for-reparations#:~:text=Colonialism%20may%20be%20over%2C%20but,problem%20is%20in%20the%20past.">Jason&nbsp;Hickel</a></blockquote><p>The statues of colonists, slave traders and racists are being torn down across the US and UK. These protests reject past actions and condemn the suffering, extraction and violence on which the wealth of such nations was built. What they perhaps fail to acknowledge is that the colonisation is not something that happened in the past. Instead, it is still actively being deployed as a tactic to ensure the comfort and stability of the countries who hold the greatest monetary&nbsp;power.</p><p>One shocking example of this can be seen in the Franc de la Communauté Financière Africaine (<a href="https://taxjustice.net/2021/03/22/the-cfa-franc-as-a-vivid-symbol-of-colonial-continuities-in-francophone-africa/">CFA Franc</a>) which was introduced to Western Africa by the French in 1945. The fourteen countries that use it today are still required to trade internationally in Euros via the French Treasury. They also continually rank amongst the poorest countries in the world. On a wider scale, the US dollar as the global reserve currency creates multiple advantages for its issuing country. With that privilege comes a responsibility that is rarely acknowledged. MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) has a large following in the US, because for a country that mints the most prevalent global currency, the ability to print money is in fact a viable option to stimulate economic activity. Firstly, they can use it to buy goods and services from foreign countries who have a constant requirement for dollars. Secondly, their exchange rate is extremely resistant to devaluation. For the vast majority of countries that do not have a widely desired sovereign currency, this is simply not an option. On the flip side, when the US, UK or Eurozone raise their interest rates to maintain local financial stability, they are also outsourcing their inflation and often accompanying austerity to countries that hold debt in those currencies.</p><p>In our view, the five drivers outlined above are insidiously powerful forces. Left unaddressed they will render a just transition or even a survivable future impossible. This opens up some difficult questions. If we don’t make the self-sovereignty of money a priority, are inclusivity initiatives such as redistributing philanthropic funds futile? Whilst money exists as a singular, abstractive and indiscriminate medium of exchange, do we have any chance of first repairing and then regenerating our planetary home? As the spread of AI and web3 intensifies, how will this extraordinary technological power be&nbsp;wielded?</p><p>Whether such tools are deployed towards further speculation, extraction and exploitation or in service of our collective vitality is the fundamental question of our&nbsp;time.</p><p>As always, we are sharing these thoughts to provoke discussion and to invite feedback. Some initial ideas for alternative monetary futures are the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>This blog was written by Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) under Dark Matter’s Next Economics LAB. We aspire to start working on some tangible proofs of possibility for bioregional currencies in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>References:</p>  We are using the term metacrisis to describe the underlying crisis driving a multitude of crises.

<p>Have you been reading about digitally verifiable credentials and wanted to know more about them? Are you interested in digitally verifiable credentials but do not know how to get started? Well, then, you are at the right place – this blog post is all about getting started with verifiable credentials and seeing how they change how credentialing is done.</p>



<p>Credentialing is a simple enough workflow we all understand – an organisation issues the credentials to a recipient. In turn, the recipient can present, share or exchange the credentials to seek new opportunities, services and other things. Today, along with printed credentials, there are digital credentials as well – these are often in PDF and can be easily stored and exchanged. Verifiable credentials improve this workflow – they are secure, tamper-evident data representations that help anyone verify the credentials’ issuer and authenticity.</p>



<p>MARK Studio from Dhiway is a credential lifecycle management platform which empowers issuers to design, issue and manage verifiable documents as blockchain-anchored credentials. Including the blockchain as a system of record leads to immutable records, and thus these are tamper-evident. With MARK Studio, anyone can create certificates online and quickly issue them through well-thought-out steps. Transitioning from traditional print-ready credentialing flows to blockchain credentials could be daunting. So, MARK Studio has a Free plan to try out the workflows before committing to adoption. You can sign up to <a href="https://studio.dhiway.com/auth/register">FREE PLAN</a> and get started. The videos on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dhiwaynetworks">YouTube channel</a> can help you build and issue your first verifiable credential.</p>



<p>MARK Studio comes “batteries included” with over 60 templates and designs to choose from when creating Learning and Education Records (LERs), Skilling and Knowledge Records and Workplace Experience Records. Starting the credentialing journey with MARK Studio ensures that while you get a feel for verifiable credentials, you look at all kinds of records and data that need provenance – and you are soon on your way to verifiable documents. The verifiable documents issued on MARK Studio help reduce the risk of data abuse and thus add value to your data governance strategies. With secure blockchain-anchored credentials now readily available, you can even look at needs such as temporary passes, event passes and IDs to be designed and issued on MARK Studio.</p>



<p>Verifiable credentials on the CORD network blockchain enable recipients to request, receive, store and exchange a whole set of documents they collect as a learner and in their professional roles. The ease of machine verification, data security and integrity, and combining various sets of credentials into a need-based verifiable document (a “digital resume”) makes it a compelling proposition for all key stakeholders – the issuer, the verifier and the recipient. Today, many organisations are switching to blockchain-anchored verifiable credentials with MARK Studio – sign up and try it out for yourself.</p>

<p>Identity and access management (IAM) is a crucial security component and a business enabler for the modern enterprise — but it’s clear that current systems are falling short on both fronts. Enterprises remain rife with legacy systems, technology silos, and manual and disconnected processes that were never intended to cope with today’s complex identity environment. New threat vectors, often aided by generative AI, exploit the gaps in this patchwork of systems, with increasingly alarming consequences.</p>  
<p>A robust identity security strategy requires the consolidation of a broad set of identity assurance capabilities into a unified approach. A new position paper by industry analyst Simon Moffatt of the Cyber Hut explores the current state of IAM security and proposes guidelines for organizations to build a comprehensive Identity Assurance approach that can tackle these challenges.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Key Findings  
 Enterprises Face Multiple Operational and Identity Security Challenges  
<p>The current technological landscape has become increasingly complex, characterized by hybrid deployments, fragmented technology silos, and inadequate visibility and metrics. Employee onboarding and credential management processes remain manual and disjointed, creating friction and security gaps. The rising volume and variety of remote work and people supply chains puts further strain on systems and business.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Outdated Authentication and Identity Verification Processes Prevalent  
<p>Authentication stands out as a critical pinch point in user interactions, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Many organizations employ multiple MFA solutions without a clear pathway to consolidation or adoption of phishing-resistant passwordless authentication.</p> 
<p>Moreover, the lack of coherence and continuity in identity verification and validation processes severely impacts business and security, leading to issues such as cumbersome employee verification, fraud, credential theft, account takeover, and data breaches.</p> 
 The Need for Converged Identity Assurance  
<p>A comprehensive <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> strategy involves viewing authentication in stages of maturity, moving from siloed and coarse-grained methods to relying on an assured identity that is continually verified. The goal is to reduce fragmentation and trust boundaries, and overlay existing authentication with verified identities on an ongoing basis.</p> 
<p>By embracing a converged Identity Assurance approach, organizations improve identity security, accelerate adoption of Zero Trust principles, improve IAM productivity, and reduce their compliance exposure.</p> 
<p></p>

 What happened? 
<p>On December 16th Truffle Security disclosed a <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-oauth-is-broken-sort-of/">Google OAuth vulnerability</a> that allows employees, even after leaving a company, to retain access to applications like Slack and Zoom. The vulnerability arises from the ability to create Google accounts where the email address has the domain of the corporate organization but does not actually belong to that organization. This poses a risk to organizations, service providers like Zoom and Slack, and Google itself.</p>
 How does it work? 
<p>1. First, the user must have an account in your corporate Google workspace, such as <a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a></p>
<p>2. Then the user creates a new personal Google account, using their existing email, but they add “+something” to the user name part of the email, eg. <a href="mailto:user+something@example.com">user+something@example.com</a>. Because Google will essentially ignore anything after the + in an email address, the user will be able to receive all the verification emails in their corporate inbox. (They need to do this in advance of leaving the organization.)</p>
<p>User must click “Use your existing email” and use the alias user+something@example.com</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Now the user can use this google account to sign into 3rd party apps under the corporate domain. This is possible because many of these 3rd party apps only verify that the domain part of the email used when logging into the account is a known corporate account. (<a href="mailto:user+something@example.com">user+something@example.com</a> ⇒ domain = <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a>)</p>
<p></p>
 Was YeshID Affected? 
<p>No, users attempting to use this technique to log into YeshID would not be successful.</p>
 Recommendations 
 Detection 
 
 If your organization has tools to perform an email search (such as the Security Center Investigation Tool in Google Workspace), look for emails sent to addresses containing your domain and a “+” symbol to detect these shadow account creations. 
 Review the user lists in the applications your organization uses to look for accounts with email addresses containing a “+” symbol to detect users who may have exploited this vulnerability. 
 
 Prevention 
 
 If your organization uses applications that allow any user to sign in as long as they are from your domain, consider disabling that feature. For example, in Slack: <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/115004856503-Manage-how-people-join-your-workspace">https://slack.com/help/articles/115004856503-Manage-how-people-join-your-workspace</a> 
 Switch the application to use SAML for SSO if possible 
 
<p>Regular auditing of your user environment is important and YeshID can help.

<p>Businesses face an ever-expanding array of cyber threats. Phishing, the deceptive practice of tricking individuals into divulging sensitive information, sits prominently at the top. It’s not just about lost data; it’s about lost trust, credibility, and in many cases, significant financial repercussions. Enter Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), an established tool in the cybersecurity arsenal. But as cybercriminals become savvier, the call for more advanced, phishing resistant MFA grows louder.</p>
 
Understanding Phishing Resistant MFA 
<p>Phishing resistant MFA takes the foundational principles of MFA and enhances them. While traditional MFA might rely on something you know (a password) and something you have (a mobile device for an SMS code), phishing-resistant variants add authentication request elements much harder to replicate or steal. This could be a physical device like a hardware token or something inherent to hardware security keys the user, like a biometric detail.<br>
The biometric authentication and login process, for instance, utilizes unique physical or behavioral attributes – from fingerprints to voice patterns. Its strength lies in its uniqueness; while a password can be stolen or guessed, replicating a retina pattern remains profoundly challenging.<br>
Today, cybercriminals employ various tactics to deceive individuals and organizations such as:</p>
 
 Spear Phishing: Unlike generic phishing attacks that target a broad audience, spear phishing is tailored to a specific individual or organization. Having done meticulous research, the attacker crafts a personalized message, making the deceit harder to spot. A typical scenario might involve mimicking communication from a senior executive or an HR representative requesting sensitive data or actions. 
 Whaling: This is a subset of spear phishing but targets high-profile individuals like CEOs or CFOs. Given the potential high return, attackers invest time in understanding the executive’s behavior, likes, dislikes, and even personal schedules, aiming to bypass traditional detection methods. 
 Smishing and Vishing: As mobile usage grows, attackers have begun to target users via SMS (Smishing) and voice calls (Vishing). For example, one might receive an SMS from a “bank” claiming unauthorized activity and requesting immediate action. Vishing attacks, meanwhile, involve human interaction, with attackers using social engineering techniques to extract information over a phone call.<br>
To fully grasp the gravity and evolution of these contemporary cyber threats, it’s crucial to delve into the historical backdrop from which they emerged. Historical Context of Phishing and MFA 
 
 Historical Context of Phishing and MFA 
<p>Over the past few decades, as the digital world has expanded, so too have cyber threats. Phishing began as simple email scams but rapidly evolved, targeting more prominent organizations and employing more sophisticated tactics. In response resist phishing, the cybersecurity industry introduced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure authentication and add an extra layer of protection.<br>
Early MFA systems were rudimentary, often relying solely on passwords and security questions. But with the increasing sophistication of modern phishing campaigns and techniques, MFA had to evolve, leading to the advanced phishing-resistant systems we see today.</p>
 
Why Phishing Resistant MFA is Essential 
<p>Recent years have witnessed a surge in phishing attempts targeting businesses, and online services regardless of size or domain. Beyond the immediate financial losses, which can be substantial, phishing attacks erode client trust and tarnish an organization’s image for years.<br>
Furthermore, the data they store grows as more businesses undergo digital transformations. This makes them attractive targets for cybercriminals. Incorporating phishing resistant technologies and security keys into MFA can act as a formidable barrier, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
 
ROI of Phishing-Resistant MFA 
<p>When considering any significant change in organizational processes, especially one that involves costs, it’s essential to evaluate the Return on Investment (ROI). With phishing-resistant MFA, the ROI isn’t just measured in monetary terms. Yes, there can be direct cost savings from averting potential cyberattacks, but the intangible benefits are equally vital.<br>
Enhanced brand reputation, infrastructure security agency increased customer trust, and adherence to industry regulations can result in long-term business benefits, from customer retention to easier stakeholder negotiations. In essence, the investment in phishing-resistant MFA could yield returns far beyond the financial.</p>
 
Preliminary Steps Before Implementation 
<p>Rushing headfirst into implementing any security solution without a strategy is a recipe for potential failure. Start with a comprehensive security assessment. Engage experts to understand where your vulnerabilities lie and which assets are most at risk.<br>
An equally critical component is understanding your users. An overly complex system might have substantial resistance, leading to workarounds compromising security. It’s essential to strike a balance – a system robust in its security but user-friendly.</p>
 Best Practices for Implementing Phishing Resistant MFA 
 
User Education and Training 
<p>Technological measures are just one part of a comprehensive security strategy. Your users – employees – are on the front lines. Regular training sessions help reinforce the importance of security. Beyond theoretical knowledge, interactive sessions, such as simulated phishing attacks, can provide practical experience, preparing them for real-life scenarios.</p>
 
Choosing the Right MFA Solution 
<p>The market is flooded with a range of phishing-resistant MFA products. Each boasts its set of features and benefits. While evaluating, look beyond just the security features. Consider the ease of integration into existing systems, how scalable the solution is, its user experience, and its cost-effectiveness. An ideal phishing resistance and solution would align with both your IT infrastructure and budgetary considerations.</p>
 
Phased Implementation 
<p>A phased approach is often more manageable and less disruptive. Begin with the most critical systems that, if compromised, could result in the most significant harm. Parallelly, prioritize high-risk user groups. As you iron out any teething issues and achieve success, expand the implementation to cover more systems and users.</p>
 
Regular Testing and Evaluation 
<p>Implementing a strong phishing resistant MFA isn’t the end. Cyber threats evolve, and your defenses should adapt accordingly. Regularly scheduled penetration tests can provide insights into potential vulnerabilities. Monitoring tools can offer real-time data on the MFA’s effectiveness, allowing for timely tweaks and refinements.</p>
 
Creating a Responsive Support System 
<p>Challenges and uncertainties often mark transition periods. A robust support system can ease these teething pains. Whether through helplines, chat support, or on-ground IT teams, ensure users can easily access assistance. A two-way communication channel can also provide valuable user feedback, refining the MFA system.</p>
 
Ensuring Backup and Recovery Options 
<p>Every system can face hiccups. From a user losing their hardware token to a biometric system failing to recognize a fingerprint, having backup systems in place is crucial. Clear protocols for such scenarios can prevent potential lockouts and ensure continuity of operations.<br>
In addition to these common concerns, addressing the need for offline access is essential, particularly when internet connectivity is unreliable or unavailable, such as during travel.<br>
Here are some strategies to manage these situations:</p>
 
 Offline Access Solutions: Implement offline access features in your phishing-resistant MFA system. This could involve using physical tokens or biometric methods that don’t rely on real-time verification from a central server. For instance, a hardware token generating one-time codes or a biometric system storing validation data locally can provide secure access even without an internet connection. 
 Travel-Friendly Authentication Methods: When users travel, especially across different time zones or areas with limited connectivity, they need reliable authentication methods. Consider providing additional travel-specific hardware tokens or setting up temporary access codes that remain valid for the travel period. 
 Backup Verification Methods: Establish backup verification methods when the primary MFA method fails. For instance, you could use a secondary mobile device as a fallback option or provide a limited number of use-once codes that can be securely stored and used only when necessary. 
 
 Types of Phishing Resistant MFA Tools 
<p>To truly understand the scope of phishing-resistant MFA, it’s crucial to explore the variety of tools available. Hardware tokens, for example, are physical devices that generate time-sensitive codes. While these tokens are secure, they can be lost or stolen.<br>
Biometric systems, on the other hand, offer authentication through facial recognition, fingerprint scans, or even voice patterns. There’s also behavioral-based authentication, which analyzes patterns in user behavior (like typing speed or mouse movements) to confirm identity and to secure their login credentials and credentials. Each tool has advantages and challenges, making it imperative for organizations to choose based on their specific needs.</p>
 
Integration with Other Security Measures 
<p>While formidable and phishing-resistant, MFA can be even more potent when integrated with other cybersecurity measures. For instance, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) adds a layer of encryption and security to data transmissions.<br>
Combining an authentication method MFA with endpoint protection ensures that even if a device is compromised, unauthorized users still need multiple authentication factors to access sensitive data. A multi-layered security approach that includes phishing-resistant authentication methods MFA can create a robust defense mechanism against cyber threats.</p>
 
Enhancing Phishing-Resistant MFA with BlockID 
<p>While phishing-resistant MFA stands strong, its potency is amplified when integrated with other cybersecurity measures. Our BlockID app, for instance, provides a seamless experience in secure digital identity verification, aligning perfectly with the principles of phishing-resistant MFA. When coupled with a Virtual Private Network (VPN), an added layer of encryption and security protects data transmissions.<br>
Further solidifying security, combining a tool like the BlockID app with endpoint protection ensures that even if a device falls into the wrong hands, unauthorized users still require multiple authentication factors to access sensitive data. This combination results in a multi-layered security approach that includes phishing-resistant methods, positioning organizations at the forefront of defense against cyber threats.</p>
 
Addressing Common Challenges 
<p>Change is often met with resistance. Employees accustomed to older systems might view phishing-resistant MFA as an unnecessary complication. Addressing these concerns, clarifying the change’s rationale, and offering training can ease the transition.<br>
On the technical side, the implementation might face hitches like any IT project. It’s crucial to have an IT team well-prepared to address these. Lastly, while security is paramount, user convenience shouldn’t be wholly sidelined. An overly cumbersome system might lead to non-compliance, defeating its very purpose.</p>
 
Benefits Beyond Security 
<p>While the primary purpose of phishing-resistant MFA is to bolster security, its benefits extend beyond just protection. Implementing advanced MFA can signal to customers and stakeholders that an organization is committed to safeguarding its data—a crucial factor in building trust.<br>
Moreover, in some industries, regulatory compliance necessitates specific security measures to prevent phishing,, including advanced phishing resistant MFA methods. Thus, by adopting phishing-resistant MFA, organizations can avoid potential fines from federal agencies and position themselves favorably in the market as trustworthy entities.</p>
 
BlockID’s Role in Strengthening Phishing-Resistant Security 
<p>In the ongoing fight against phishing and cyber threats, robust security like BlockID is crucial. BlockID advances beyond traditional authentication methods of what you know or have, to a more secure paradigm of who you are, thereby enhancing an organization’s phishing-resistant security posture.</p>

				  Remove the need to set up and manage your own mediator so you can focus on helping your customers benefit from verifiable data and identity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio Proven® provides customers with powerful, scalable communication features that allow them to cryptographically authenticate the parties in any interaction before data is shared.</p>
<p>This secure, bidirectional communication between people and organizations using mobile devices is made possible by a mediator. It’s like a post office for a decentralized ecosystem: every message goes to the mediator, which is then able to find individual end users to create a secure connection and deliver the message. Mediation drives decentralized communication — and in a privacy-preserving way too, as the “Post Office” can’t open the messages, even if it wanted to.</p>
<p>With a hosted mediator in Indicio Proven®, customers can choose to let Indicio run the Post Office, which makes deploying a verifiable data solution faster, scaling it easier, and managing it simpler.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that while we say “message,” we are not confined to simple texts or written messages. How you use this secure connection is largely limited by your imagination. Among the use cases Indicio has helped facilitate are offering proof of funds for financial transactions, sharing proof of membership for an organization or rewards program, and sharing proof of age for purchasing goods, without actually sharing birthdate or other personal information.</p>
<p>Historically, Indicio has helped customers set up their own mediator for management by their internal teams. Due to customer feedback, Indicio Proven® now provides this feature as a professionally-managed service. This makes Indicio Proven an even simpler and more powerful way to implement decentralized identity technology, enhancing scalability, ensuring uptime, and freeing users to focus on delivering transformative verifiable data solutions to their customers.</p>
<p>Whether your mediator is hosted and managed by your team or Indicio, the messages it delivers are private by design. Each message is encrypted to the end recipient, and is not visible to the mediator.</p>
<p>Who its for</p>
<p>This mediator service is for customers that just want to “set and forget” their decentralized identity solution. Indicio will handle the day-to-day management of any mediation your solution requires and ensure the mediator has the latest updates.</p>
<p>Why use Indicio’s mediator services</p>
<p>Professionally managed: Indicio has years of experience in the decentralized identity field and boasts a 99.97% uptime on our network. You won’t need to worry about the day-to-day specifics of mediation, but should any problems come to your attention you will have a direct line to a team that leads the development of the technology.</p>
<p>Built for scale: The new mediator service has been tested with up to fifty thousand simultaneous connections per customer, and our team can easily scale it to as many connections as you need.</p>
<p>Live message delivery: Often mediators will only allow for a momentary connection to an end user to deliver a message and then sever that connection. Indicio’s mediator service allows for users to stay connected to your service for a set amount of time, resulting in receiving messages faster and a better customer experience.</p>
<p>How to get started</p>
<p>Our team prides itself on setting our customers up for success. We have found a <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">quick consultation with our team</a> to align on goals for your solution to be the most effective way to learn more about Indicio Proven® and how you can best use the Hosted Mediator Service.</p>

<p>As enterprises embrace cloud native and everything as code, the journey from code to production has become a critical aspect of delivering value to customers. This process, often referred to as the “pathway to deploy,” encompasses a series of intricate steps and decisions that can significantly impact an organization’s ability to deliver software efficiently, reliably and at scale.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/blog/accelerate-release-lifecycle-with-pathway-to-deploy-part-1">The first post in this series</a> navigates the complexities and uncovers the strategies and target state mode for achieving a seamless and effective pathway to deploy.</p>



<p>This post expands on the topic and provides a maturity model and building blocks that help enterprises accelerate their software supply chain lifecycle in the ever-evolving landscape of enterprise cloud-native software development.</p>



 Pathway to deploy roadmap 



<p>To realize an accelerated pathway to deploy, there are several moving parts and stakeholders that must come together. We recommend a 4-stage roadmap for implementation, as shown in the figure below.</p>







 Stage 1: Development automation 



<p>Infrastructure automation (IaC) and pipeline automation are self-contained within the development team, which makes automation a great place to start. In this stage, the focus is building an enterprise catalog of continuous integration, deployment and testing (CI/CD/CT) and Ops patterns with necessary tooling integrations to automate core development and testing activities. Given enterprise complexity, the most difficult part of this stage is the automation of testing capabilities (wherein test data preparation and execution of test cases across multiple systems is mostly semi-automated). Overall Cloud Capability Centre (CCC), or the equivalent core team, plays a significant role in driving change with application and platform teams.</p>



 Stage 2: Institutionalize pattern-driven model 



<p>CCC (or its equivalent) works with the architecture board to establish a suite of repeatable patterns (including atomic patterns representing individual cloud services, as well as composite application patterns comprising of multiple cloud services). The architecture review process (along with other related review processes) is modified to institutionalize pattern-centric architecture representations with a backlog established for different groups (such as platform engineering and CCC) to build these patterns as code. This helps adoption and acceleration. Over time, the applications being represented appear as a set of patterns that standardizes development models across the board. In addition, teams such as business continuity, resiliency and security will leverage those patterns (for example, highly available multi-region architectures) to recognize and accelerate approval gates with a standardized approach. They key to this alignment is the co-creation of these patterns between participating organizations.</p>



 Stage 3: Self-service and cross-functional integration 



<p>Enterprises have many organizations that want to see that cloud applications follow their guidance and best practices. This stage focuses on integrating cross-functional teams (such as security, compliance and FinOps) through automation, tooling, codified patterns or self-service options. This builds on the earlier stages to emphasize meaningful participation between teams. The key aspects of this stage are to:</p>



 
 Build and align high-availability patterns with resiliency teams where reviews get accelerated, demonstrating adherence to these patterns. 



 Codify security and compliance requirements into the patterns and guardrail them on the platform as set of policies. 



 Address validation by integrating tooling, such as vulnerability scans, policy check tools (like cloud formation guard for AWS) and container security with the pipelines following shift-left principles. 



 Enlist enterprise records teams to study a set of data classification and retention patterns and enlist FinOps teams to assess for appropriate tagging and quota adherence. 



 Build AuthN/AuthZ integration patterns that abstract nuances and standardize authentication and authorization of applications, data and services. 



 Automate firewall via generation of resource files from IaC execution &amp; importing them to firewall systems as described <a href="https://aganguly.medium.com/hybrid-cloud-modernisation-connectivity-as-code-firewall-automation-7c7f80a61c13">here</a>. 



 Platform Engineering enterprise catalog offering multiple self-serve capabilities. 
 



 Stage 4: Automated pathway to deploy 



<p>This stage focuses on decentralization and decoupling of various enterprise groups while simultaneously integrating them through automation and DevSecOps. One example is the automation of change management processes, including automated release notes generation, where the system autonomously constructs comprehensive change review checklists by aggregating data from multiple interconnected systems. This results in trust, efficiency and accuracy in reviews. This holistic approach represents a significant leap in operational efficiency and risk mitigation for the enterprise.</p>



 Pathway to deploy: Building blocks of the cloud-native model 



<p>Let’s explore a few use cases that showcase pathway to deploy acceleration.</p>



 Use case 1: Persona-centric IaC codification 



<p>Persona- and patterns-based IaC codification can accelerate both development and review phases. The figure below represents multiple stakeholders in an enterprise who have different concerns and requirements for cloud native workloads.</p>







<p>It takes a lot of development time for product teams to manually code for each of these concerns, not to mention the time it takes for stakeholders to manually review each area. Codifying these in hardened discrete or composite patterns provides product teams the right Bootstrap code and acceleration, creating stakeholder trust and review efficiency.</p>



 Use case 2: Shift-left security and policies validation 



<p>Automate security, compliance and other policies for infrastructure as part of CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that deployed infrastructure will be aligned to enterprise policies even before it is deployed. There are multiple approaches provided by cloud providers and open-source tooling that can accomplish this (including <a href="https://www.checkov.io/">Checkov</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard">Cloud formation guard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/stelligent/cfn_nag">cfn-nag</a>). Typically, security teams codify policy validation rules, and product teams integrate policy validation within CI/CD/CT pipelines before the infrastructure is provisioned to cloud environment.</p>



 &nbsp;Use case 3: Automated compliance evidence collection for reviews 



<p>Cross-functional cloud platform, security and compliance teams build automation that enables evidence collection, accelerating security and compliance reviews. This would typically require leveraging Cloud APIs to query information from deployed cloud resources, as well as building compliance evidence and posture. Such capabilities could allow product teams to execute such automation in a self-service model or via DevOps pipelines and identify compliance posture, along with capturing review evidence automatically.&nbsp; The maturity level increases when evidence capture is executed automatically and the review is in a completely hands-free mode.</p>



 Use case 4: Integrated patterns and pipeline toolkit 



<p>Composite cloud-native patterns like AWS Active-Active Serverless APIs require several discrete patterns to come together. These patterns include:</p>



 
 Cloud services, such as Route53, API Gateway, Lambda, Dynamo DB, IAM, CodeDeploy, CodeBuild, CodePipeline and CodeCommit. 



 Nonfunctional Requirements, such as AuthN/AuthZ, multi-region active-active deployment, security at rest and in transit, tracing, logging, monitoring, dashboards, alerting, failover automation and health checks. 



 Integrated enterprise tooling, including Code Quality, SAST, DAST, Alerting, Test Management, tracking and planning. 
 



<p>A one-click solution would allow product teams to select the right pattern, which will create the necessary Bootstrap code that integrates several codified patterns as described in prior use cases.</p>



 Pathways to deploy: Delivery approach 



<p>For a delivery model to realize pathway to deploy, the CCC (or equivalent) must work with multiple organization groups as shown in the figure below.</p>







<p>Pathway to deploy delivery model would comprise of the following steps:</p>



 
 Define the entire path to deploy process through a set of application lifecycle phases, activities, deliverables and dependent groups involved. 



 Define and standup multiple squads focusing on different aspects on the pathway to deploy. 



 Plan fora flex model within the squads to bring in supporting groups as required. 



 Build a backlog for each of the Cloud Capability Center squads and initiate capability development. 



 Align to the 4-stage maturity model so enterprises can track maturity. 



 Establish product teams and relevant stakeholders as part of the backlog refinement and prioritization. 



 Ensure that automation adoption is continuously focused. The success of pathway to deploy depends on building the automation and getting it adopted. 



 Build central knowledge management and planning management around pathway to deploy. 



 Make it easier for product teams to incorporate these activities into their delivery plans (with for project tracking and agile collaboration tools such as Jira). 



 Build a measurement system for pathway to deploy phase gate SLAs and continuously track SLA improvement (as pathway to deploy capabilities mature over a period). 
 



<p>By considering why cloud transformation may not yield full value, and identifying release lifecycle acceleration as a key challenge, this narrows down the focus to pathway to deploy. Pathway to deploy can be a common vehicle that facilitates multiple groups to accelerate the entire software supply chain lifecycle beyond the development and testing lifecycle acceleration that exists today. A 4-stage roadmap has been defined where initial stages focus on DevSecOps and patterns adoption, and advanced stages mature towards product engineering culture. It is &nbsp;recommend that product teams collaborate with participating enterprise groups in a decentralized manner to leverage automation and self-service. The maturity model encourages organizations to incrementally scale by starting small, and our delivery approach brings predictable outcomes to this complex journey.&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>In today’s interconnected world, trust in the digital landscape is more crucial than ever. A secure and trustworthy online environment becomes paramount as we increasingly intertwine our lives with the internet, from personal interactions to complex financial transactions and healthcare decisions. Recognizing this critical need, Continuum Loop, in collaboration with CIRA, has authored a new report, “<a href="https://www.cira.ca/en/resources/documents/state-of-internet/a-trust-layer-for-the-internet-is-emerging-a-2023-report/">A Trust Layer for the Internet is Emerging.</a>”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This report, the result of the collaboration between <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrellodonnell/">Darrell O’Donnell</a> of Continuum Loop and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueslatour/">Jacques Latour</a> from CIRA, emerges as an essential resource for those innovators and early adopters leading the charge in digital innovation and strategy. It offers a comprehensive exploration of the challenges and solutions in building trust online, tailored to meet the needs of technical and business professionals in internet-centric organizations.</p>
<p>This pioneering document addresses the growing trust crisis in the digital realm, where the proliferation of fakes, frauds, and forgeries has significantly eroded public confidence. Our report highlights the path forward to restore and enhance trust in the internet, ensuring its role as a reliable and safe platform for future generations.</p>
 The Decline of Trust: A Wake-Up Call 
<p>It’s a concerning reality: trust in the internet is at an all-time low. In recent years, Canadians’ trust in the internet has plummeted from 71% to 57%, mirroring a global trend. The increase of fakes, frauds, and forgeries fuels this erosion of trust. This isn’t just a statistic; it has become a call to action. Organizations suffer when trust wanes, with some experiencing dramatic decreases in market capitalization after trust-related incidents.</p>
 Unveiling the Emerging Trust Layer 
<p>The report introduces an innovative concept: developing a ‘trust layer’ for the internet. This layer is a harmonious blend of technical trust (like encryption and signing) and human trust (like governance). It’s about creating a digital environment where parties can mutually authenticate each other, knowing confidently who they’re dealing with.</p>
 Trust Registries: Anchoring Digital Trust 
<p>A pivotal aspect of this trust layer is the role of trust registries. Trust registries provide authoritative answers within digital ecosystems, bridging the gap between technology and human trust. Furthermore, the concept of Registry of Registries (RoR) is explored to create an interconnected web of trust across various ecosystems.</p>
 From Wallets to Trust: A Paradigm Shift 
<p>Originally intended as an update to the 2019 “The Wallet Report,” the focus of this study shifted to the more critical issue of building trustworthy systems on the internet. It’s a response to the growing awareness that while security is essential, more is needed for establishing trust.</p>
 Navigating the Path to an Enhanced Trust Layer 
<p>The journey to build a trust layer on the internet, as outlined in the report, is challenging but vital. It requires a delicate balance of technical trust and human trust. The report underscores the importance of governance in maintaining trust and the critical role of trust registries in anchoring trust within digital ecosystems.</p>
 A Call to Action 
<p>The report concludes with a powerful message: we can reverse the decline in internet trust. By developing a trust layer, we can once again rely on the internet as a secure and trustworthy platform. It’s a shared responsibility to build and maintain this trust layer, not just for the benefit of digital ecosystems but for society as a whole.</p>
 Rebuilding Trust in Our Digital World 
<p>While the path ahead is challenging, the blueprint for a trustworthy internet is becoming clearer. Through the collaborative efforts of Continuum Loop and CIRA, we have charted a course towards an internet that balances technical trust with human trust, underpinned by the essential role of trust registries. These components are not just parts of a system but the pillars upon which we can construct an inherently reliable and secure digital realm.</p>
 Technical and Human Synergy: The Heart of the Emerging Trust Layer 
<p>The success of the emerging trust layer will not be measured solely by its technical strength but by the trust it fosters in our digital relationships. Developing and nurturing this trust layer is a collective responsibility with significant promise for revolutionizing digital ecosystems and enriching our society.</p>
<p>As we embark on this journey to reforge trust in the digital landscape, we do so with a clear understanding of the transformative potential of the trust layer and trust registries. This report is more than an analysis; it is a call to action for creating a future where trust is the cornerstone of our digital interactions. The time to act is now – to shape a functional and fundamentally trustworthy internet.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 The Internet’s Trust Deficit Needs to Be Repaid: Key trust-related decisions in the internet’s evolution were delayed or ignored, leaving the digital realm needing more essential capabilities to establish trust. 
 The Necessity of Trust Registries: Trust registries, including the innovative concept of a Registry of Registries (RoR), are crucial in creating a web of trust across ecosystems and anchoring the trust layer. 
 Ecosystem Diversity: Each digital ecosystem operates uniquely, and trust registries help unify diverse players and governance structures. 
 Leveraging Existing Systems: Existing systems hold the answers needed to establish trust; the challenge lies in accessing and integrating this information. 
 The Value of Trusted Interactions: Trusted interactions are increasingly valuable, and trust registries are pivotal in driving value up and costs down in the digital landscape.

 BE REALISTIC — DEMAND THE INCORRUPTIBLE!  Make the blockchain safe or lose&nbsp;it Vinay Gupta as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raguel_(angel)#:~:text=XXIII%2C%20Raguel%20is%20one%20of,across%20Jewish%20and%20Christian%20traditions.">Raguel</a><p>I have recounted the history and prehistory of crypto <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-road-to-rwa-f99cac31361d">elsewhere</a> — the path from PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) through e-gold to Bitcoin. Now I want to take a look at what happened next, what went wrong with the Ethereum vision of the future, and how we can turn things around to make the blockchain the powerhouse of the future that it was always meant to be. I need to talk about magic and rules. I’ve seen a fair bit of magic over the years, and I understand when it needs&nbsp;rules.</p><blockquote>I’ve seen a fair bit of magic over the years, and I understand when it needs&nbsp;rules</blockquote><p>Let’s start with a short recap; the first great crypto innovation was<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy"> PGP,</a> which tried to bring true privacy to online communications, then there was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1997/0908/6005172a.html">https </a>that gave us the ecommerce revolution, Amazon and all that. Then, the third innovation came with the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper">Bitcoin white paper</a> that ushered in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was commonly believed to be a response to e-gold being shut down by the American government; if we want to ask “who is Satoshi?”, then the answer is that somewhere within two handshakes of the e-gold organisations is almost certainly where you find the origin of the Satoshi group — I have my theories, other people have theirs. Anyway, Bitcoin trundles along for a while as an interesting geek thing where a few Bitcoin can get you a pizza, if you know the right nerds, but it’s not much use for anything yet; until Wikileaks. When Wikileaks gets seriously effective at embarrassing governments, banks and various other payment routes shut them out so no one can donate funds to them. Suddenly, the only functional method that can get cash to Wikileaks and can’t be shut down is Bitcoin; people take notice, its value skyrockets to the level where one will buy you a very decent car instead of a fraction of a pizza, and people start to get politically interested in&nbsp;it.</p><p>Now though, we need to think about what was really going on with Bitcoin. What people wanted from the blockchain — and what a lot of them got — was magic, and new&nbsp;rules:</p><p>Magic: “internet money machine go brrrrrr” and folks that were futuristic and lucky got very rich. A real vanguard movement.</p><p>Rules: 1 BTC is always worth 1 BTC. Uncensorable. Free.</p><p>This idea that new rules can make you rich and the money isn’t really coming from anywhere is, unfortunately, the devil’s bargain. Here’s why: printing money makes the other money worth&nbsp;less.</p><blockquote>Printing money makes the other money worth&nbsp;less</blockquote><p>Bitcoin is converting fiat money into Bitcoin, and it’s just increasing the money supply. It’s exactly the same as a central bank printing money. It’s just that bitcoin is printed and handed out to the miners, instead of having a government write enormous bailout cheques to banks under a cover like “quantitative easing”. Bitcoin slowly makes the dollar worth less just as something like quantitative easing (QE) ultimately does. All that QE money invented and dumped onto the market in 2008 to stave off financial collapse eventually fed through to the increase in inflation and so on today — it made the dollar worth less because there was more money circulating. Same happens with Bitcoin. Bitcoin may not be the same as dollars, but it is doing the same thing; ultimately, it is used to buy things so it has the same effect — more money circulating. Now bitcoiners will tell you that’s fine. And, within the scope of human beings exercising their freedom to compute it certainly is. Bitcoin is arguably a free speech issue. I’m good with that, but the money is coming from the dollar getting slightly weaker every time BTC moons. I don’t like this way of making money. I don’t mind people doing it, but let’s call it what it is: crypto-fiat. Bitcoin is a “decentral bank” of the internet. It’s crazy that it works, but it’s another central bank printing money at the end of the&nbsp;day.</p><blockquote>Let’s call it what it is: crypto-fiat. Bitcoin is a “decentral bank” of the&nbsp;internet</blockquote><p>Something else was&nbsp;needed.</p><p>So, people start asking <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/mastercoin-a-second-generation-protocol-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-1383603310">“Why doesn’t Bitcoin implement smart contracts?</a>”, which would make it more than just crypto-fiat, and that question of “Why doesn’t Bitcoin implement smart contracts?” is, to me, the great religious issue of the day. Because if Bitcoin had said “yes” to smart contracts, then there would not be a need for a <a href="https://blockchainlab.com/pdf/Ethereum_white_paper-a_next_generation_smart_contract_and_decentralized_application_platform-vitalik-buterin.pdf">second system.</a> All of the energy behind Bitcoin, all of the energy behind Ethereum, all of the energy behind everything else…It would be the single point of an enormous driven spear. We did not get that, because Bitcoin said “no” to progress, they said “no” to transformation, they said “no” to change. Bitcoin decided that they had evolved as far as they needed to, and that they were going to stay right there. As a result, we have an avant-garde that comes along to do the smart contracts thing, which is Ethereum and all of the things that came after Ethereum, while the old-school Bitcoiners stay with Bitcoin. Whether they turn out to be smart people that stuck to fundamentals, or Neanderthals who evolution ploughed under, is too soon to tell — give it another 20 years, maybe even another&nbsp;50.</p><blockquote>if Bitcoin had said “yes” to smart contracts…it would be the single point of an enormous driven&nbsp;spear.</blockquote><p>The great hope from Ethereum is that Ethereum is more than a central bank. Ether is not money per se: Ether is a tokenized right to future transactions on the World Computer. Watch this 2015 video from the Ethereum Foundation to understand the&nbsp;story.</p><p>Does software create wealth? YES! What we do with spreadsheets can be done by accountants on paper but it takes weeks rather than seconds to run a new financial model. A payment instrument does not create wealth, it just moves wealth around. That’s why ETH &gt; BTC for sure. What we’ve seen for the last 8 years, since Ethereum was launched, is a mad scramble to figure out what to do with the World Computer.</p><p>Generation after generation of cultish new ideas have been pitched as revolutions: ICOs, DeFi, NFTs were the largest waves. All of them, failed experiments. Folks will argue that these things have not failed but here’s a way to think about it: was more money put into these things than taken out? The answer is YES in all cases. Every penny made in DeFi was lost by somebody else, minus some friction which pays for creation of the tech. This is not wealth generating, any more than Bitcoin is wealth generating. Sophisticated mechanisms for moving money around do not CREATE wealth. The financial system does not create wealth other than by investing in the creation of goods and services that people actually need. And, right now, Ethereum is the financial system on bottom-up decentralised individually-superempowered turbo steroids. So, what happened?</p><blockquote>Sophisticated mechanisms for moving money around do not CREATE&nbsp;wealth</blockquote><p>Inside of Ethereum there developed three generations of political vision: these are what I would call the Nouveau Bitcoiners, the Radicalised Canadians, and the heartless Scammers. The Nouveau Bitcoiners are the people who think that Ether is going to be the global currency instead of Bitcoin, they think in terms of freedom to transact and are very much about the idea of a direct takeover from the nation state and a direct takeover from the dollar. It’s “Ethereum is just like Bitcoin, but with smart contracts”. Their vision is “The Ether price climbs and climbs and climbs, until every asset is denominated in Ether”. That is the generation-one political vision of Ethereum. Not many people think like that now, but there are a few of&nbsp;them.</p><blockquote>Inside of Ethereum there developed… the Nouveau Bitcoiners, the Radicalised Canadians, and the heartless Scammers</blockquote><p>The next generation are the Radicalised Canadians, and I would see Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as one of these. The vision here involves things like quadratic voting: you reduce the cost of building new social structures because you can use Ethereum smart contracts to do it. Those social structures control assets and the control of assets using these new social structures enables the transformation of the way society works. This means you can do much cheaper experiments in an evolving society because you use software to run the bureaucracy — you don’t need to build a new government department; you just need the right smart contract and you can do it now. This is expressed particularly well in a book called <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/iRqutFx">Radical Markets</a> by Eric Posner and Glen Weyl. This idea that we can incrementally improve the functioning of the world by putting more and more load on automated bureaucracy rather than attempting political transformation through the ballot box is the “build your way to your own utopia”&nbsp;model.</p><p>I would suggest that the apex of the “build your way to your own utopia” model is all the stuff on network states coming from <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/huUv3pN">Balaji Srinivasan</a>. I went to the network states conference in Amsterdam, and there’s a huge amount of enthusiasm about building what I would call weakly state-like entities (<a href="https://athousandnations.com/2009/04/21/free-guptastan/">WSLEs,</a> or “Weasels”) on the blockchain, You have a cryptocurrency, you have a community, you buy a bunch of land, and you put all of that stuff together into a bundle, and it creates a sort of miniature state-like thing. Of course, there are major potential pitfalls inherent in all this; e.g. depending on where you have your land, your network state DIY utopia can look a lot like reinventing colonialism for the digital age — a bunch of Americans setting up a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%B3spera#:~:text=Pr%C3%B3spera%20is%20a%20private%20city,%2C%20regulatory%2C%20and%20legal%20architecture."> “utopia” in Honduras</a> raises a lot more questions than, say, a bunch of Hondurans setting one up in the US. But a network state doesn’t necessarily need the land, it can have a <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-network-state-and-the-digital-hansa-bfccf8df0097">completely virtual existence</a>, there’s lots of enthusiasm about that, and I would say that is the final embodiment of the Radicalised Canadian vision: kind of libertarian, kind of utopian, but a lot more egalitarian than the hard line, currency-driven Bitcoin generation. The DAO people are a big part of that as well, lots of work on DAOs, lots of work on quadratic funding, Gitcoin… All of that is in this bucket that I would call the Radicalised Canadians.</p><p>Finally we have the third generation, the Scammers. A big problem in the space is that the Radicalised Canadians have been unable to fight off the Scammers. I remember when the Scammers arrived: our conferences went from being a bunch of nerds in various-kinds-of-band T-shirts, standing around in their big black boots and yapping to each other about consensus algorithms, to slick computer graphics and really impressive slide presentations fronted by people that had been trained to speak in the Tony Robbins school of sincerity. And when those folks arrived, what you wound up with was a problem; because when you had people coming to find out what Ethereum was, the slick, sincere-sounding guys were the ones they listened to because they knew how to capture attention. The people who understood what Ethereum was truly about, the Nouveau Bitcoiners and Radical Canaidans, were, generally speaking, poor presenters, and they were pushed aside by the people that understood how to sell scams. Those people didn’t really understand what it was they were selling, and they didn’t have to, they just needed to understand what people were buying. All they had to have was a plausible enough story to separate rubes from their money, and those people went through the space like dysentery through a refugee camp. I would suggest that they have destroyed 99% of the value in the Ethereum space over the last, say, 4–5&nbsp;years.</p><blockquote>Scammers went through Ethereum like dysentery through a refugee&nbsp;camp</blockquote><p>I want to repeat that: I would suggest that scammers have destroyed 99% of the value in the Ethereum space… You wonder why the coin is floating around $2,000 rather than $20,000? You wonder why there are only $120bn of stablecoins rather than half the global financial system being on chain? The answer is Ethereum has become synonymous with fraud. If you hear that your cousin has gotten super into crypto, do you think “My god, that’s going to be amazing!” or do you think they’re going to lose their house and their car and you’re going to have to bail them out pretty soon? The fear that we have, that being involved in the blockchain is now a bad thing, that is fear of the grifters. It’s fear that people who don’t really understand the technology are going to be sucked in by slick marketing for a deal that should be illegal, and probably is. That they’re going to get ripped off for everything they own if the Scammers can manage it, and we’ve become so tolerant of this that the culture has terms like “rug pull”. Rug pull means fraud and people should go to jail — rug pull! We have smart contracts that are perfectly capable of making it technically impossible for people to rug-pull, but the general Ethereum user population are so ignorant about what the technology is and how it can protect them that they don’t even insist that the contracts are structured in a way that means they cannot get rug-pulled.</p><blockquote>Ethereum has become synonymous with&nbsp;fraud</blockquote><p>It’s finance minus all RULES and deprived of all MORALITY. In Ethereum right now you are literally seeing what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929#:~:text=On%20September%2020%2C%201929%2C%20top,on%20the%20London%20Stock%20Exchange">Wall Street was like in 1929</a>, rug pulls and all. Finance without RULES and MORALITY is net negative. It’s the fast being predatory and eating the life savings of the slow, over and over and over&nbsp;again.</p><p>It’s violent.</p><p>“No Force, No Fraud” says the Libertarian Golden Rule, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">Non-Aggression Principle (NAP</a>).</p><p>Does Ethereum live up to that&nbsp;today?</p><p>No. Remember I’m the former Release Coordinator for the 2015 launch. I also wrote the definitive blog post&nbsp;, <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable Blockchains in Context</a>, for the Ethereum launch. I’ve been around. I’ve done cryptographic applications development (against and then for multiple governments) since 1997.&nbsp;. I’m not pleased at how Ethereum is turning&nbsp;out.</p><p>We can do better. We can do a lot&nbsp;better.</p><p>So how did we wind up with epidemic fraud on Ethereum, a technology which was meant to produce an incorruptible global record of who owned what so that we could build a fairer, better global&nbsp;economy?</p><p>It’s your fault: you all got greedy and lazy and believed crappy NFTs had value. They are <a href="https://cheezburger.com/16719877/funny-memes-tweets-that-roast-nfts-crypto">literally laughing at&nbsp;us.</a></p><p>Wilful ignorance of the law created the entire cycle of destruction around NFTs. If there had been a single decent intellectual property licence, commissioned by OpenSea and attached to everything by default then NFTs might not have hard crashed in value as they have. Proper use of law would have protected value which is, after all, the fundamental function of&nbsp;law.</p><blockquote>Wilful ignorance of the law created the entire cycle of destruction around&nbsp;NFTs</blockquote><p>Imagine how different it would have been if they could have said “here’s the OpenSea public licence and the Bored Ape licence, anything which is going to get done on the blockchain with images or art, you have that built in copyright licence by default. If you want a different licence, feel free to upload it, but you will have to have a licence…”</p><p>If they’d done that for intellectual property, then OpenSea would be the world hub for clearing intellectual property rights today, and it would probably still be doing hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of transactions a month, and it would have created enormously powerful global liquid markets for IP. You would be able to literally licence a Bored Ape to Disney to do a TV show, rather than the situation right now where nobody can really pin down <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/nfts-and-intellectual-property-what-do-you-actually-own/">what you buy when you buy an NFT</a>. That is the result of a lackadaisical attitude towards the deal; because if you don’t clearly define the terms, then what the hell is somebody&nbsp;buying?</p><p>We went out to build an incorruptible global economy, and what we got was overrun by scammers that subverted that vital global vision and delivered a wasteland of Ponzi schemes and delusional fake assets. The Eloi had a wonderful world full of sunlight and flowers, but the Morlocks still ate them. Ethereum needs a moral upgrade. Maybe instead of moral I should say political. “No force, no fraud” only works if we have a mechanism for punishing those who attempt or commit fraud. Financial products sold by Anonymous Aardvark twitter accounts do not have any meaningful ability to punish fraud. So we get fraud. A lot of really hardcore criminal shit is getting done in the financial markets running on Ethereum.</p><blockquote>Ethereum needs a moral&nbsp;upgrade</blockquote><p>It’s a massive market failure: in a Libertarian society in theory the “Free Market” is meant to self-regulate and create free market justice systems to make trade possible. What we have learned in this near-perfect experiment is that Libertarianism is bullshit.</p><p>Let me say that again: Libertarianism is bullshit, and we’ve proven&nbsp;it.</p><p>What we got on Ethereum was violent, destructive anarchy not a self-regulating borderless global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>It’s bad. To fix this we need to build governance structures on the blockchain which have the ability to impose rules and force good conduct on people. The violent anarchy we have created is so dangerous that ordinary people are getting mugged for everything they&nbsp;own</p><p>Is that acceptable?</p><p>Well, if it is acceptable, we wind up with Ethereum as a <a href="https://screenrant.com/eve-online-largest-pvp-battle-ever/">“Player-Versus-Player (PVP)</a> part of the Great Global Massive Multiplayer Online game (MMO) in which we all participate. All the serious players will only interact with Ethereum when they’re heavily armed, and it’ll be filled with predators feeding on each-other. This is a bad scene; “PVP Ethereum” — the violent, destructive anarchy that we have now — is not fit for running the global economy. It would be a disaster if we took a system this amoral and tried to run the world on&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>It would be a disaster if we took a system this amoral and tried to run the world on&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>Well, if you don’t believe me, look at what happened when someone did try to run the world on it. It is indicative of the age of most blockchain people — they are young — that Russia in the ’90s is ancient history to them, they don’t remember it; but we are old, and some of us used to be Russian; we remember. There, then, communism collapsed, and while the state struggled to catch up, a new kind of money, dollars, flooded in, and Russia became the poster boy for the kind of unfettered free market capitalism that gave Ayn Rand libertarians spontaneous orgasms. No state interference, just money and business. What happened? Oligarchs happened; without effective law to enforce contracts, you only paid the people who would kill you if you didn’t, and killed your creditors if the opportunity arose. As a result the most ruthless, the hardest, and those with access to serious muscle and hardware (basically ex-KGB) cleaned up while everyone else got thoroughly rinsed and ended up near destitute. This only ended basically when the biggest, most ruthless bastard of all, Putin, got the upper hand, ran the oligarchs out of town and co-opted their methods for himself, resulting in a gangster capitalist mafia dictatorship, which is not the outcome anyone else wanted. Libertarianism in practice turns out to be essentially property without rights, it boils down to “it’s mine because I’ve got the biggest gun”, and that’s it. For 90s Russia, read Ethereum; for the oligarchs read the Scammers. Fraud is a form of force, at the end of the day. When scammers deceive people they remove that person’s will and replace it with the scammer’s own&nbsp;will.</p><p>So we have a choice to make: does Ethereum have a productive real future, or does it end up as a nasty, destructive “PVP” wasteland in which predators feed on predators and scammers scam scammers driving out all the perfectly ordinary and legitimate users until there’s nobody but criminals left on the chain. This could become a cultural race to the bottom that transfers all of the public good value of the blockchain directly into the private good pockets of the&nbsp;thieves.</p><blockquote>This could become a cultural race to the&nbsp;bottom</blockquote><p>You think I’m joking. I’m not joking. The future of finance, and the future of the internet, cannot be to create a more dangerous, less fair, more predator-dominated version of the world and then tell people that it’s good for them. It’s not good for them. We’re creating a hell and calling it a&nbsp;heaven.</p><p>Now I did not come into this thing to facilitate the creation of a destructive hell realm and to super-empower predators and thieves. I came into this looking for an international aid transparency technology to help me build my <a href="http://myhopeforthe.world">climate refugee projects</a>.</p><blockquote>I did not come into this thing to facilitate the creation of a destructive hell&nbsp;realm</blockquote><p>We need to turn this thing around. We need to do it now because this Bull Run (if it materialises) looks like it will be the <a href="https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/defi/why-the-rwa-sector-accumulated-5-8-billion-in-3-months/">Real World Assets (RWA) bull run</a>. If people try the same games with RWA that they did with NFTs, if we get runaway fraud, people will start going to jail. The authorities will start prosecuting. If you sell somebody an NFT and tell them it’s “blue chip” and will hold its value you’re probably not committing fraud, it’s what the art world does all the time after all. But when it’s real estate? Cops understand it. If we get any significant amount of actual fraud in the RWA industry, people who have been sold bogus tokens will go and talk to the police. “I was sold this car online and they defrauded me” is a message a cop can understand. It’s not about magic internet $. And it’s not financial regulators looking at mis-sold financial instruments. It’s not the SEC pointing the finger and trying to grab turf from CFTC etc. No, it’s the fucking FBI investigating wire fraud. It’s local police forces dealing with straight up thefts. It’s simple criminal enforcement in many or most cases. Primitive, primal law. “You took my money. You sold me garbage.” We have examples of that dispute going back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-n%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ir">4000 years</a>. Believe me, the police know how to act on it by&nbsp;now.</p><blockquote>We need to turn this thing around. We need to do it&nbsp;now</blockquote><p>Real World Asset scams are going to face criminal prosecution very&nbsp;fast.</p><p>Wow, that’s going to hurt the rest of us. Are we going to have Ethereum be a “PVP” corner of the internet in which scam artists con the general public, and the authorities keep throwing people in jail for blockchain scams? Is THAT the future that we’ve co-created together?</p><p>We have to get our shit together to avoid&nbsp;it</p><p>I want to propose an idea: I think we really screwed up horribly when we decided that decentralisation is what the blockchain was&nbsp;about.</p><p>I think that was a fundamental error of judgement, and I think it is not too late to fix&nbsp;it.</p><p>What we wanted was systems that were incorruptible, and we thought decentralised meant incorruptible.</p><p>We were wrong: incorruptible trade is the goal, and decentralisation is just one&nbsp;tool.</p><p>We believed and still believe that if you gave the power to the people, then the power would be used wisely. But in fact, what we have discovered is that if you give the power to the people, then the small number of people who are really good at being predators take advantage of the goodwill or ignorance of the rest to cut in and take the power: the scammers, the grifters, they take the power… We worked hard to give the power to the people, and then the scammers and the grifters took it right back off them&nbsp;again.</p><p>It all goes back to the idea of utopias — the internet has always been a utopian idea, a cool, free space, away from regulation and government where people can be excellent to each other and make a new world of equality and self-fulfilment for nerds. Every ten years, another generation tries to create the latest iteration of that, then get burned. Unfortunately something that works purely on mutual trust falls foul of (at least) two fundamental problems. Firstly, assumptions; if the two people in a deal come to it with different unspoken assumptions, grief results. Secondly, the Scammers, if one of the people in the deal isn’t playing fair, more grief results. There needs to be some basic capability that allows for formal agreements that makes the terms of a deal absolutely clear, and will punish scams. Smart contracts only provide one part of what is necessary to make this work in reality: FTX was not a technology problem. Failure to provide scam proofing is what has caused trust to collapse and allowed scams to proliferate, allowed the system to be corrupted. The lack of effective law is what screwed Russia in the 90s, and it will screw Ethereum now. Violent anarchy serves nobody. The locusts move on eventually.</p><blockquote>Every ten years, another generation tries to create utopia, then get&nbsp;burned</blockquote><p>I think that we need to start thinking in terms of the blockchain being about creating incorruptible systems: you get exactly what you pay for, nobody gets in the way, and if they do, the crypto economics or the legals squash them like bugs. That was the original vision of Ethereum, that was what we promised to ourselves that we were going to create back in 2015. If you look at the early Ethereum Foundation communications, incorruptibility is the core theme. That video I embedded earlier, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXv">Ethereum: the World Computer</a>, really expresses this notion of an incorruptible system. An Ethereum where the scammers get crushed like bugs, that is the future, one where you know that if it happened on Ethereum it’s a square and you will get&nbsp;paid.</p><blockquote>We need an Ethereum where the scammers get crushed like&nbsp;bugs</blockquote><p>That is what I’m working towards creating with my company <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>. We have spent years and a ton of money creating a way to build legals into smart contracts in a way that is enforceable in 172 jurisdictions. The Mattereum system makes it possible to buy something on the blockchain and prove you own it in a court of law almost anywhere in the world. It removes misunderstandings and, yes, squashes scammers like bugs. We are mainly using it to ensure someone buying a real world asset like gold or real estate on the blockchain has an enforceable claim to the physical asset in the real world, but it can be used for IP licences for NFTs, almost anything sold on the blockchain. It’s a way of baking incorruptibility into the system to ensure every transaction is&nbsp;safe.</p><blockquote>The Mattereum system removes misunderstandings and squashes scammers like&nbsp;bugs</blockquote><p>So, Mattereum is doing magic with real estate, gold bars, and so on. The NFTs that people buy linked to their RWAs come with legal machinery that behaves properly, so they get what they paid for or get appropriate compensation. Magic. But that magic comes from rules. The Mattereum Asset Passport is a legally binding documentation stack which parcels out the risk associated with an RWA purchase and places the load on knowledgeable, solvent, deal-protecting underwriters. The magic is the rules. And we did not do this alone. The English judiciary (the judges) are very fond of the blockchain as a mechanism for storing legal evidence which can be used in court cases. They see the blockchain as an <a href="http://judiciary.uk/wp-content/upl%E2%80%A6">economic opportunity</a> for the British economy in&nbsp;fact.</p><blockquote>Many people do not realise that English law governs trading in €600 trillion of OTC derivatives annually, in €11.6 trillion in metals trading, in £250 billion in M&amp;A deals, and in £80 billion in insurance contracts every year — just to take a few examples. My hope is that English law will prove to be the law of choice for borderless blockchain technology as its take up grows exponentially in the months and years to&nbsp;come.</blockquote><blockquote>– Sir Geoffry Vos, Master of the&nbsp;Rolls</blockquote><p>Now, you say, “but Vinay, centralisation is the devil”. Well, turns out decentralisation is the devil&nbsp;too.</p><p>If everybody is responsible, then nobody is. Value is bleeding through decentralised systems like coffee through a paper filter. It’s the <a href="https://w.wiki/LdS">Tragedy of the Commons</a> basically.</p><p>Think about that. We could have Ethereum be the world’s most trusted trade environment instead of the destructive shitshow that we have these days. I want this thing to work. The world needs this thing to&nbsp;work.</p><p>We have a limited number of chances to make this thing work because — eventually — the world will simply give up on Ethereum as a fraud-ridden wasteland. That perception is already becoming a&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Every fraud on Ethereum profits the scammers and harms/damages the rest of the ecosystem. It’s the scammers or us: and that’s the real zero sum game&nbsp;here.</p><p>We have an absolute imperative to get the scammers out of the Ethereum ecosystem, we have to do this or the ecosystem is eventually going to&nbsp;die.</p><p>To do this the focus has to be on incorruptibility, not decentralisation because incorruptible systems can be used to identify the scammers and kick them off. “Is this thing that you’re doing incorruptible or not?” — “Well, no. It’s really decentralised, but…” — “We don’t care: bam, get off the blockchain, we’re not going to do this!”. It’s that simple — raise the bar. Demand incorruptibility.</p><p>If you’re going to put any money behind any project, then demand incorruptibility; if you’re working on a project, then demand incorruptibility. Take the power away from the administrators so it’s impossible to rug, use smart contracts to lock up all of the value, nail them to the legals — there are excellent law firms that are fully functional now to actually get you what you need for that quickly and at a reasonable price. We can make the blockchain live up to its potential, but if we fail to do it, then it’s going to wind up as another dead&nbsp;end.</p><blockquote>Take the power away from the administrators so it’s impossible to&nbsp;rug</blockquote><p>I’ve seen two waves of crypto innovation wind up in dead ends. The only thing that survived from crypto in the 1990s, even though we had fully functional digital currencies, was e-commerce, and e-commerce did not fundamentally make the world a better place — it made it more convenient, but it did not improve it. The first big wave of crypto innovation is all of the stuff that happened with secure communications — PGP and all that, secure email. Does anybody feel like their communications are genuinely secure? Nope. You don’t trust the software you’re using, you don’t trust the hardware. Most of that innovation was also lost. So if we’re going to make this round of crypto innovation stick, if we are going to make the blockchain work, if we’re going to get power of “These are my keys, nobody else can pretend to be me and nobody else can read my comms…” then we have to change our values. We have to go back to the original vision of Ethereum, we have to focus on the incorruptibility more than the decentralisation, and we have to absolutely stop tolerating the scams. If you see somebody on stage pitching something that you think is a scam, then you call it out, you do what you can to stop it. We need to be Judge Dredd bringing law to the Cursed&nbsp;Earth.</p><blockquote>If we’re going to make this round of crypto innovation stick… then we have to change our&nbsp;values</blockquote><p>Tolerating the scams means giving up on the blockchain because while scams are allowed to thrive unopposed they metastasise and consume all the available space. One reason people largely gave up on email is that for every email from family, there were 10 from Nigerian princes, alleged friends needing you to urgently send money (and possibly lawyers and guns) to get them out of a jam, cute strangers wanting to be your girlfriend, and so on. The same with “The Artist Formerly Known as Twitter”, people are leaving in droves because of Nazis, dropshippers and people shilling blockchain scams. No one is going to find it worthwhile to stay in a space where 90% of the activity is scammers eating people alive, even if it does have the potential to revolutionise the&nbsp;world.</p><blockquote>Tolerating the scams means giving up on the blockchain</blockquote><p>We should be revolutionising the world, we should be operating the world’s most honest trade environment — that’s the ETH brand promise. If we can deliver on the Brand Promise of Ethereum: “incorruptible transactions” we have friends all over the world. Everybody that wants to do honest business, to buy and sell in a transparent, honest and fair way, is our friend. You can’t get incorruptible trade with VISA cards and bank wires, so Mattereum is out here building the bridges necessary for incorruptible trade and our objectives are:</p><p>* Save&nbsp;Ethereum</p><p>* Use Ethereum to save the&nbsp;world</p><p>An incorruptible system is a safe system, and the fundamental thing people need is to be safe, on the blockchain, just as much as anywhere&nbsp;else.</p><p>We’re going to need your support to make this happen. I’m hoping to rapidly scale our operations fast in 2024 and bring near-incorruptible systems for real world asset transactions to all of&nbsp;you.</p> Be realistic!

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>In our Artificial Intelligence (AI) journey, much like the timeless question "Quo vadis, Domine?"-meaning "Where are you going, Lord?"-we find ourselves at a crossroads, questioning the direction of our technological trajectory. So as we traverse the AI landscape, we should ask ourselves, "Where is our AI going, and what are the implications for us?"</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, when the path forward may seem uncertain, well-structured legal frameworks provide a basic roadmap. These frameworks not only provide clarity on the permissible boundaries of AI development and application, but also serve as foresight tools that anticipate potential challenges and pitfalls. As I argued in a previous <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/balancing-innovation-and-regulation">blog</a>, law generates a dialectical process wherein the tech industry, responding to legal constraints, presents its antithesis by seeking new solutions, ultimately leading to a synthesis that reconciles legal requirements and fosters human agency.</p>
<p>Consequently, nations around the world are trying to figure out how to adapt to and capitalize on these evolving technologies. Unfortunately, while the impact of AI is global, many countries have yet to publish comprehensive AI regulations and policies. This gap presents both challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>On the one hand, embracing standardized regulations could foster global collaboration, addressing ethical concerns and privacy issues. On the other hand, the absence of clear guidelines may hinder the progress of global AI initiatives, potentially leading to misuse, fragmented approaches, and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Therefore, by exploring and comparing recently published AI regulations, individuals and organizations can proactively navigate the evolving landscape. This approach allows them to stay ahead of the curve, respond resiliently to change, and integrate practices and solutions that may not have been adopted in their home countries.</p>
 Implications of the EU’s AI Act 
<p>On December 8, 2023, after more than 36 hours of negotiations, a political agreement was reached on the EU's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act. The AI Act adopts a "risk-based approach" that prioritizes the regulation of the use of AI over the technology itself, with the aim of protecting European values and the rule of law. The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231206IPR15699/artificial-intelligence-act-deal-on-comprehensive-rules-for-trustworthy-ai">legislation</a> sets clear obligations based on the potential risks and impact of AI systems.</p>
<p>Key provisions include:</p>
 
 Prohibition of biometric categorization systems using sensitive characteristics (for example, political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, race) 
 Restriction on untargeted scraping of facial images for facial recognition databases 
 Ban on emotion recognition in workplaces and educational institutions 
 Prohibition of social scoring based on personal characteristics 
 Prohibition of AI exploiting vulnerabilities based on age, disability, or socioeconomic status 
 Use of biometric identification systems (RBI) in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes 
 Citizens' right to launch complaints and receive explanations about decisions based on high-risk AI systems 
 Transparency requirements for general-purpose AI systems, including technical documentation and compliance with EU copyright law 
 
<p>The AI Act focuses on risk assessments for AI systems, with obligations increasing based on the potential risk to individual rights or health. The agreement introduces transparency requirements for all general-purpose AI models and imposes tougher regulations on more powerful models. In essence, the EU AI Act strategically adapts its regulatory intensity based on the perceived risk levels associated with different AI systems.</p>
<p>By doing so, the legislation seeks to strike a balance between fostering innovation, ensuring transparency, and mitigating potential harms arising from advanced AI technologies. This nuanced approach reflects the EU's commitment to responsible AI governance and aligns with its broader initiatives to establish a trustworthy and ethical AI landscape.</p>
<p>The AI Act won't take effect until two years after final approval by European lawmakers, expected sometime in early 2024. Moreover, the AI Act will apply to the EU's nearly 450 million residents, but experts say its impact could be felt far beyond that because of the EU's leadership role in creating regulations and policies that serve as a global standard.</p>
<p>The law's global influence is expected to extend as a blueprint for other nations navigating AI regulations. However, by not fully banning live facial recognition, the EU's decision has drawn <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/12/eu-blocs-decision-to-not-ban-public-mass-surveillance-in-ai-act-sets-a-devastating-global-precedent/">criticism</a>, with Amnesty International deeming it a "hugely missed opportunity" and expressing concerns about potential global repercussions, particularly in the realm of human rights and civil liberties.</p>
 Decoding the American AI Regulatory Landscape 
<p>The U.S. AI regulatory landscape is characterized by a mix of existing federal and state laws, frameworks from various federal agencies, and a growing number of state-specific laws. It is also characterized by a decentralized approach, in contrast to the EU's top-down approach.</p>
<p>The legislative approach to AI is centered on an "incentive-based" strategy, with policymakers seeking to create conditions that will retain AI developers. The emphasis on incentives reflects a concerted effort to prevent the potential shift of AI development to competing nations, highlighting the delicate balance between promoting innovation and avoiding national security issues.</p>
<p>Despite the polarized and challenging political environment in the U.S. in recent years, both parties in Congress have consistently supported AI governance efforts. This bipartisan commitment reflects a shared recognition of the transformative potential and strategic importance of AI.</p>
<p>While the EU's AI law is in its final stages, the U.S. is unlikely to pass a comprehensive national AI law in the near future. Instead, a flurry of executive actions is expected. The outcome may not be a broad national AI law, but rather a nuanced, domain-specific regulatory landscape that navigates the complexities of AI governance.</p>
<p>For example, in October 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">order</a> on AI. The order mandates prominent AI developers to disclose safety test results and pertinent information to the government. Furthermore, government agencies will establish standards to guarantee the safety of AI tools before their public release, accompanied by guidelines for labeling AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Biden's directive extends the momentum generated by voluntary commitments from major tech companies, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which had pledged to ensure the safety of their products before launch. In addition, the U.S. government is expected to increase spending on AI and AI research, especially in the defense and intelligence sectors.</p>
<p>At KuppingerCole, we foresee that while private companies may implement their "responsible AI" initiatives, potential AI trade frictions with the EU may arise. Moreover, concerns linger about enforceability and binding measures, with critics highlighting potential disparities with the more stringent measures adopted by the EU in the recently adopted AI Act.</p>
 Balancing Acts: Concluding Thoughts 
<p>The dominance of major AI players in the US raises concerns about the delayed availability of powerful AI models in the EU, potentially impacting technological and economic development in the region. This dichotomy also underscores the global competition in AI, with China and Russia potentially adopting different, and less democratic-oriented, approaches. The question arises: can safety be adequately ensured through legal frameworks alone, especially when considering the divergent strategies employed by major players in the AI arena?</p>
<p>Exploring this critical angle prompts a deeper reflection on the effectiveness of legal frameworks in balancing safety concerns with the rapid development and deployment of advanced AI technologies, especially in the context of varying global approaches. The global AI debate involves geopolitical competition, national security, and economic competitiveness. Therefore, the answer to ensuring safety in AI may involve a multifaceted approach that goes beyond legal regulations, incorporating international collaboration, ethical standards, and shared best practices</p>
<p>Despite differing approaches to AI regulation, both the US and EU share the common goal of ensuring safe and democratic AI, fostering the potential for aligned transatlantic regulatory approaches. The EU-US Trade and Technology Council demonstrates early success in collaborating on trustworthy AI metrics and methodologies, emphasizing the need for further alignment and knowledge sharing. It is therefore essential that the EU and the U.S. align their approaches in key areas, given their combined influence on global AI governance.</p>

We will answer them below. But first, one a backgrounder to provide&nbsp;context.</p> Background: Focus of Ocean Predictoor / DF&nbsp;Team <p>The main goal of the Ocean / Predictoor / DF team right now is: make it easy &amp; obvious to earn $ as a trader, using Predictoor.</p>  Once it happens, there will be strong organic demand for the feeds, which in turn drives sales, which in turn drives predictoor income  This also means we’re spending less time on other potential things: detailed blogs, AMAs, webapp, analytics. Focus&nbsp;focus.  In short, $ success for traders will drive success everywhere else.   Questions &amp;&nbsp;Answers <p>Here are the Q’s, along with our A’s. Some answers won’t have full detail; that’s because we’re focusing on the “make it easy to make $”. Success there will drive the&nbsp;rest.</p><blockquote>How is a transaction counted?</blockquote><p>We submitted a list of smart contract addresses to dappradar.com. Whenever one of those has a tx against it, it’s&nbsp;counted.</p><p>The addresses we submitted are: the Ocean datatoken contracts for each of the 20 prediction feeds, plus a couple&nbsp;more.</p><blockquote>Are the Ocean predictoor ‘farming’ rewards part of the transactions if so how much do they account&nbsp;for?</blockquote><p>Payout of Predictoor Data Farming rewards is a small fraction of txs. However the $ incentive is likely a key driver for near-term traction.</p><p>If you’re a predictoor submitting prediction transactions, you can make $&nbsp;via:</p>  Organic sales  Sales from Predictoor Data Farming&nbsp;rewards  Others’ stake slashed when they are&nbsp;wrong.  <p>Of these:</p>  (3) evens out to about zero if your accuracy is about the same as others, and your <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7">stake doesn’t exceed your cut of expected&nbsp;sales</a>.  (2) is currently the biggest amount. We expect this in the early days, as it’s kickstarting the usage. (How to see: Compare “Autobot: Volumes” for all $ sales, to DF $ budget in Predictoor DF&nbsp;docs)  (1) will ultimately be the biggest amount by far, once it becomes easy &amp; obvious to earn $ as a&nbsp;trader.  <p><a href="https://autobotocean.com/volumes">“AutoBot: Volumes” page</a> shows volumes for each&nbsp;feed.</p><blockquote>How many unique addresses are paying for&nbsp;feeds?</blockquote><p>We haven’t computed analytics for that yet. You *could* query the subgraph for yourself, see link&nbsp;above.</p><blockquote>Are there return&nbsp;users?</blockquote><p>For predictoors: Yes. In fact, it seems to be a high % predictoors returning, ie low churn.&nbsp;See</p><p>For traders: We haven’t computed analytics for that yet. What will really make a difference is traders easily &amp; obviously earning $; hence our focus on&nbsp;that.</p><blockquote>Is the overall number of users increasing?</blockquote><p>Yes. See <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/ocean-predictoor">“DappRadar&nbsp;: Predictoor” page</a>, the “UAW” line on the plot. UAW = Unique Active&nbsp;Wallets.</p><p>&gt; How much revenue are these transactions giving to the Ocean Protocol?</p><p>Fees details: (from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/predictoor/pdr-parameters">Predictoor docs</a>)<br>- 0.1% community swap fee<br>- 20% to Ocean Protocol Foundation. (Will be used to further drive Predictoor, and to burn&nbsp;OCEAN.)</p><blockquote>What numbers would need to be met before another say 100 price feeds are added to predictoor (1, 15, 30 min feeds), more token pairs including Ocean (helping increase Ocean volume)&nbsp;etc.</blockquote><p>As mentioned above, we see that the biggest driver of traction will be traders making $. Our focus is to make that easy &amp; obvious. As part of our work, we are exploring other trading venues &amp; pairs. We’re also professionalizing our internal data engineering pipeline, and starting to build an analytics app inspired by my <a href="http://www.trent.st/">previous work</a> on Computer-Aided Design. All of this is already open-source; you can track our progress in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">GitHub</a>.</p><p>Once “making $” is established, then we will scale up accordingly.

That’s great news! It’s the sign of a growing ecosystem of predictoors and&nbsp;traders.</p><p>To really take this to the next level, the Ocean Predictoor / DF team is working to make it easy &amp; obvious to earn $ as a trader, using Predictoor.

<p>On November 8th, the European Council and Parliament reached a provisional agreement on the new framework for a European digital identity (eID).</p>
<p>Over a decade in the making, we Europeans are now finally taking a fundamental step so that all EU citizens can have a unique and secure digital identity. This is a key advancement for the European Union to be a global leader in the digital identity field, enabling all 27 member states to reap the benefits of digitalisation.</p>
<p>The new European digital identity wallets will enable all Europeans to access online services throughout Europe with their own national digital ID, without having to use private identification methods or unnecessarily sharing personal data. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles help to assure that only information that needs to be shared will be shared. Security and privacy are paramount to any electronic identity ecosystem, and I have previously highlighted some of the concerns and trade-offs in the first of this EUDI blog series; <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/" title="Introducing European Digital Identity (EUDI): The Future of Secure and Accessible Identity">Introducing European Digital Identity (EUDI): The Future of Secure and Accessible Identity</a>.</p>
 Understanding the EUDI Wallet Pilots 
<p>Running in parallel with the legislative track are the actual pilots of the EUDI wallets and end-user services. This is a great advantage from many perspectives, not least striving to avoid the fate of eIDAS v1, which suffered from the ‘chicken-and-egg’ problem from the start. It is surprising how the pilots have flown under the radar despite there being over 250 private corporations and public authorities participating in the four largest pilots alone, supported with €46 million investment from the EU Commission, as discussed in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3556">Provisional Political Agreement EU Commission article</a>.</p>
 EUDI Pilot Categories 
<p>The pilots can be broadly divided into three categories: User Authentication, e-Signing, and Website Authentication or Qualified Web Authentication Certificates (QWACs). As the last category is outside European control and looking increasingly unimplementable, I will focus initially on the User Authentication and E-Signing.</p>
<p>Beside the QWACs, a wide range of use cases are part of the EUDI pilot projects. These include:</p>
 
 Using the wallets to host user credentials for accessing government services 
 Activating SIM cards for mobile network services – in those countries which forbid anonymous SIM cards 
 Signing B2C and G2C contracts 
 Facilitating travel via digital driving licences and identity documents 
 Presenting educational credentials previously standardised under the Bologna agreement 
 
<p>All together, these use cases highlight the broad applicability of the EUDI. Basic user authentication is but a small part of its capabilities.</p>
<p>The European Commission has acknowledged that a digital identity can be used for much more than authentication to existing services. It frequently plays a part in the EUDI’s wide capabilities, as convenience features even at the highest level. For example, in the <a href="https://state-of-the-union.ec.europa.eu/state-union-2020_en">2020 State of the Union address</a>, the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, highlighted how users will be able to use the EUDI wallets to file tax returns, check into hotels, rent cars, and securely open bank accounts across borders. Looking further, a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/pdf/efip/Digital_identity_update.pdf">European Central Bank policy brief on the European Digital Identity Framework</a> suggests that the EUDI wallet will include support for the Digital Euro.</p>
 The Four Major EUDI Pilots 
<p>There are several multi-year pilot projects running, of which the four largest are introduced below. In the first phase, which is currently ongoing, the pilots are centred on individual identities and the most common B2C use cases. After the launch of the EUDI for private persons, it’s expected that it will (at last) be the turn of organisational identity.</p>
 <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EWC</a> – EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium 
<p>The EWC pilot is coordinated by Sweden with the involvement of 18 Member States and Ukraine. It is a major undertaking that involves 15 public entities and 40 private organisations. The pilot is centred around travel and tests the storage and display of digital travel credentials and instant payments. First becoming an alternative to, and later replacing, European passports is not a realistic goal at present. But since a national identity card is a valid travel document within the EU, accepting EUDI as a travel document within the Schengen zone (the 27 European countries that have removed the need for passports and many other types of border control at their mutual borders) would be a much more realistic development.</p>
<p>The Digital Euro will be a central component of the EUDI instant payment system, scheduled to launch in 2027+. The Digital Euro seeks to bring instant electronic payments to the masses. However, it will not be as big of a change in the Nordics as in other countries, due to electronic payments already being the default. The Euro represents not value but debt; most of the European money supply exists purely in the digital domain already.</p>
 <a href="https://www.digital-identity-wallet.eu/">POTENTIAL</a> – Pilots for European Digital Identity Wallet Consortium 
<p>The POTENTIAL Pilot is coordinated by Germany and France with the involvement of 17 Member States and Ukraine. It is the largest of the pilots and involves over 50 public entities and over 80 private organisations. The pilot will use the EUDI wallet for several use cases around user authentication including; accessing government services, opening a bank account, e-prescriptions and Digital Driving Licences.</p>
<p>The Digital Driving License is a good example of how having a widely available, strong digital identity opens up a whole range of possibilities for enriching the identity with additional attributes. In this case, using the Digital Driving License to operate motor vehicles within the EU. Every country already has a database of valid licenses granted by the national authorities, so enabling the end user to present this data alongside their digital identity replicates the function of a dedicated physical driver’s license card. This makes tasks like car rental a faster and less error-prone process. It also allows end users to prove both their identity and their vehicle operation licenses online, without the need to send photos of their documents alongside selfies holding those documents to the third party – a goldmine for any identity thief.</p>
 <a href="https://www.nobidconsortium.com/">NOBID</a> – Nordic-Baltic eID Wallet Consortium 
<p>Interestingly the NOBID Pilot is led by Norway, a non-EU country, with eight member states also involved. Overall, it involves 5 public entities and over 15 private organisations.</p>
<p>The pilot will focus on a single use case: the use of the EUDI wallet for the authorisation of payments for products and services by the end user. Unlike the EWC, it will concentrate on addressing the issuance of wallets, the provision of payment means by financial institutions, and the secure and convenient acceptance of payment in a retail (B2C) context.</p>
 <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/">DC4EU</a> – Digital Credentials for Europe Consortium 
<p>The DC4EU Pilot is led by Spain and involves nearly all other member states, as the pilot trials the use of the EUDI wallet in the educational sector and the social security domain. The pilot project aligns with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/ESSPASS">European Social Security Pass</a> and <a href="https://europa.eu/europass/en/node/2128">the European Learning Model</a>.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/consortium/">tens of universities</a> from around Europe together with government officials and research associations, the pilot is clearly focused on the higher education sector. Technically it is very different from the other pilots, as it trials the use of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home">European Blockchain Services Infrastructure</a> (EBSI) in the context of the EUDI wallet. Educational records could be especially suitable for a distributed database model, because educational degrees are revoked only under extraordinary circumstances and the range of educational institutions is very broad – from small private institutions to massive state-run universities and polytechnics. The project is scheduled to run until April 2025, and they also maintain a handy list of <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/outputs/">related acronyms</a> on the project site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EUDI pilots are well underway and will continue to late 2024 with some even heading into 2025. It is clear then that the original 2024 launch date for the EUDI is not tenable, at least when talking about a mass launch. But I do hope that by this time next year, there will be a limited release available in order to truly start exploring the capabilities and practical features of the EUDI ecosystem. The potential scale of the EUDI is immense but is certainly doable – as the credit card industry has proven, for example.</p>
<p>In addition, I cannot wait to see <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/organisation-identity/" title="organisation identity">organisation identity</a>, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/general/the-value-of-identity-context/" title="identity context ">identity context </a>and right to represent included in the EUDI Pilots as soon as possible, but perhaps this is one of the occasions where even in the modern world it’s worthwhile to measure twice and cut once.</p>

 We sit down with our Brazilian-born, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow, Francisco Martins to discuss what’s next for the Brazilian gambling market, and how gambling platforms can prepare for the new era of gambling regulation. 



 



 In December 2023, the Brazilian Senate finally passed its gambling regulations for sports betting and online casinos. What took so long?&nbsp; 



<p>Until this week, there had been no enforceable or documented Brazilian gambling regulations due to a blanket ban on gambling in the country since the 1940s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the ban, however, gambling was a prevalent pastime, and casinos were big businesses that pulled in celebrities worldwide. The ban, introduced in 1946, came from President Eurico Gaspar Dutra; a man heavily influenced by his wife, who was a devout Catholic, and thought poorly of games of chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continued pressure from the general populace saw some restrictions lifted in intervening years, such as:&nbsp;</p>



  Legalization of a non-commercial bingo in 1971.<br>  Legalization of horse racing and the betting associated with it in 1984.<br>  Creation of a state-owned lottery system in 1996.&nbsp;  



<p>Poker was exempt from the 1946 ban as it was deemed a game of skill. Alongside the above, social betting and fantasy betting are legal under Brazilian gambling laws; however, they are entirely unregulated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ban was met with strong resistance, and underground gambling soon became a thing. The game of choice to this day is Jogo do Bicho, a simple lottery-style game that began in 1892. Jogo do Bicho began as a fun game played outside a zoo but is now an unofficial yet popular numbers game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Brazilian gambling restrictions only ever applied to gambling operators headquartered in Brazil, the domestic ban essentially provided a window of opportunity operators headquartered abroad to target Brazilian customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Introducing this new regulatory framework has therefore been fraught with difficulties for new and existing operators across the globe. To help meet some of these challenges, a nonprofit organization called ABRADIE was created to ensure the Brazilian gambling and iGaming landscape remained safe and free from corruption.</p>



 What would you say was the main catalyst for change? 



<p>I think there were two main reasons for change: public opinion, and the realization that the Brazilian economy was missing out on major tax revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the first, as online gambling and iGaming grew in popularity, so too did public sentiment toward regulation revision. People began to regard the regulations as archaic, and openly challenged that online gambling should be exempt. In a way, it was, as online gambling and iGaming have been allowed in Brazil, provided the operators were headquartered outside the country. In 2018, the winds of change began to blow in Brazil’s way, and a plan was proposed to introduce new gaming legislation in Brazil. The proposed project allowed basic fixed odds sports betting, but with the caveat that actual legislation was a work in progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The income generated from online gambling in Brazil is predicted to be more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Gambling,US%243.23bn%20by%202027.">$1.5 billion in 2023</a> – an increase of over 200% from 2022. Understandably, that’s a lot of tax revenue that the Brazilian authorities are missing out on. Predictions now point toward a sustained period of rapid growth. The Brazilian economy is struggling (having dropped from the <a href="https://brazilian.report/liveblog/2022/03/04/world-biggest-economies/">world’s 7th largest to 13th in just over a decade</a>), and the revenue boost from opening the country up to the iGaming sector is too good to not take advantage of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also worth mentioning that besides the economic boost, the regulation will also have a positive effect on:&nbsp;</p>



  Safer gambling: Invariably, when regulations are deemed necessary, it is an indication of inherent risk in the industry, for example fraud and other criminal activities. Enforcing strict and well-documented regulations will make the Brazilian gaming space safer and more secure.  



  Attract investors: Establishing online gambling and sports betting regulations opens the Brazil market to new and diverse investors. Setting a framework for gambling regulations ensures a competitive and fair landscape, for new and old entrants, while preventing companies from running unethical practices and promotions to build their iGaming brands.  



 What are your thoughts on the new regulations? Do you think they are clear enough? 



<p>The regulations for sports betting and online casinos are a significant step toward Brazil’s modern online gambling landscape. Casinos will also remain illegal for the time being, but further changes are expected in the coming years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the ban on bonus bets is an interesting decision. Sign-up bonuses are often used by operators to entice customers to register for their platform, however they are also exploited by criminals. [Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse in our blog here</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new rules also prohibit companies without a license from advertising. The content of advertisements must follow new guidelines, and any company found to be in breach of guidelines will have it removed from the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I do think is smart are the new payment rules that have been designed to try and dismantle Brazil’s huge illegal gambling market. Only operators authorized by the Central Bank can offer payment services, and players are only able to send money to a bank account that is headquartered in Brazil.</p>



 So, what’s new? How can operators comply with the new Brazilian gambling regulations? 



<p>The first requirement is for an operator to be based in Brazil. Foreign operators will be barred from offering regulated gambling. This will ensure the Brazilian government is able to collect the taxable revenue (operators will be liable to pay 12% revenue tax.) Operators are also mandated to meet a range of integrity, responsibility and honesty requirements as proposed by the ABRADIE and IBJR and are therefore required to be a member of a sports integrity body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other requirements operators will be forced to comply with include having a minimum value of share capital and being able to pass several technical requirements.</p>



<p>Players will also be pleased to learn that there will be 15% tax on the amount that bettors win, which is a major reduction on the 30% tax that Brazilian Minister of Finance Fernando Haddad originally said he wanted.</p>



<p>Operators that wish to comply with the new sports betting regulations can do so by getting a Brazilian gambling license, which will set them back BR$30 million (US$6.1 million) for five years of validity. Learn more about the complexities of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/#:~:text=The%20only%20forms%20of%20permitted,to%20be%20active%20in%20Brazil.">Brazilian gambling license structure in our blog, here</a>.</p>



 What challenges do you foresee regarding the opening of the Brazilian market? 



<p>Introducing sports betting regulations in Brazil will not be without its challenges and risks. As the illegal and unregulated gambling industry is already thoroughly established, one of the primary issues that must be confronted is underground gambling and removing the risk of fraud or match-fixing. Brazilian sports have seen their share of scandals and controversies that would make anybody nervous about entering this newly opened market without a rigid and protective framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world of iGaming is driven by the financial aspect. The challenge will be to balance the economic benefits of online betting legislation with the social responsibility to keep everybody safe. Safety relates to being safe from fraud and other financial crime, but also to ensure they engage in responsible gambling. </p>



 How does Brazil’s gambling regulations compare to other markets? 



<p>The best way to understand how to thrive in a new market is to study the landscape of existing markets. The<a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/"> UK Gambling Commission</a> has created an established model that makes an excellent study for the Brazilian authorities. Malta is another location that has created a great regulatory model to tackle the challenges of being a smaller location with a heavy reliance on international business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each country in LATAM is adopting and updating its regulations at a different place. Argentina, Bolivia, and Nicaragua are three countries with various existing regulations and are actively working to expand them. Mexico is another that has the framework in place for rapid iGaming growth and would present good case studies, offering realistic region-proof market entry strategies that can be easily customized for the Brazilian landscape.</p>



 What role will technology play in the&nbsp;new era of online gambling in Brazil? 



<p>As further regulatory changes come into play, and new global markets continue to slowly but surely open, one key way that operators can prepare for the future is by incorporating robust identity verification technology. This enables operators to conduct thorough <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer checks</a> and process international and local documents and data, such as the Cadastro de Pessoa Física (Brazilian tax number).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Brazil, gaming operators in Brazil must now adopt identification procedures&nbsp;that verify players’&nbsp;identity. As such, the use of facial recognition technology in identifying the identities of bettors and the amount of  taxation to be paid will become standard practice. Operators must also be able to verify and validate the authenticity of ID, by comparing with available data from public and private databases. </p>



<p>Navigating the online world and covering the range of potential issues is mission-critical for anybody looking to create a new set of iGaming regulations. An online business is present in many countries and, therefore, must be aware of and compliant with the relevant regulations and legislations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with a solid system that can accommodate the different requirements of different regulatory bodies is essential. Anti-money-laundering compliant identity verification and fraud prevention are hot topics and even more prevalent when entering a new market that has been active but unregulated for several years.<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/)"> IDnow has the tools</a> that help make the transition into the Brazilian iGaming space as seamless as possible.</p>



 What’s next for Brazil’s gambling regime? 



<p>Revenue is already up by 200% from 2022 and is expected to double again by 2027. As the industry expands and technology advances, regulations must adapt to remain ahead of the curve, where possible, to maintain player and operator safety. As these laws change and people’s views toward online gambling evolve, so will the different definitions of what is covered. Many Brazilians would love to see casinos return.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By implementing a Brazilian gambling regulation process, the initial upturn for the economy will be immediate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The road ahead of the iGaming culture in Brazil is not without its challenges. Initiating change takes time and knowledge.&nbsp;The online gaming sphere is fraught with complexities, such as ensuring that a solid multi-jurisdictional identity verification platform is in place to protect anything entering the space. Solid identity-proofing systems are imperative for anybody looking to enter the emerging LATAM market, as each new jurisdiction will bring its own requirements. Having a dependable system programmed to deal with a region’s requirements means setting a solid foundation for safe and stable growth in that market.</p>

 Owning Your Digital Identity in the Age of Self-Sovereignty 



<p>Imagine a world where your digital self isn’t imprisoned within the walled gardens of tech giants and government databases. No more surrendering your data for a flicker of online convenience. Instead, picture a universe where you hold the keys to your identity, selectively unlocking doors with verifiable credentials, navigating the digital landscape with unparalleled privacy and security. This isn’t a utopian dream; it’s the dawn of decentralized digital identity (DDID) and self-sovereign identity (SSI), revolutions quietly reshaping the digital landscape.</p>



<p>DDID and SSI stand in stark contrast to the traditional identity model controlled by centralized authorities. In this outdated paradigm, our digital footprints are scattered across the web, vulnerable to breaches and subject to the whims of corporations and governments. DDID and SSI empower individuals to reclaim ownership of their identity data, building a fortress of privacy brick by blockchain brick.</p>



 Breaking Free from the Siloed Self: 



<p>At the heart of this revolution lies the concept of verifiable credentials: tamper-proof digital badges issued by trusted entities (think universities, banks, or healthcare providers) and stored securely on your own device or decentralized networks. No more handing over your entire identity to access a service; with SSI, you simply present the relevant credential, demonstrating your eligibility without revealing anything else.</p>



<p>Imagine applying for a loan without your entire financial history laid bare, or renting an apartment without relinquishing your social media life. SSI grants you granular control, empowering you to choose what you share and with whom.</p>



 The Global Band of Identity Solutions: 



<p>The DDID (Decentralized Digital Identity) and SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) symphony is playing on a global stage, with diverse protocols harmonizing their efforts:</p>



 
 Canada:&nbsp;SecureKey Technologies leads the charge, forging an SSI network powered by blockchain, where governments, corporations, and individuals collaborate to build a privacy-centric future. 



 USA:&nbsp;The Sovrin Foundation champions SSI adoption, while NIST sets the beat of digital identity management through standardized guidelines. 



 Europe:&nbsp;The SSI eIDAS Bridge project acts as a conductor, bridging the gap between traditional eIDAS infrastructure and the dynamic world of decentralized identities. 



 Latin America:&nbsp;Extrimian, powered by the nimble notes of zkSync, partners with QuarkID, a versatile instrument enabling users to manage their credentials on a secure, multi-chain platform. 



 Asia:&nbsp;Japan takes center stage with the “My Number Card” project, showcasing the power of SSI at the national level. 



 Australia and New Zealand:&nbsp;The DTA pilots SSI for government services, testing the melody in real-world scenarios. 
 



 Challenges of the Decentralized Identity System: 



<p>While the tech behind DDID and SSI is captivating, challenges remain. Standardizing the language of identity across different protocols is crucial to ensure harmony. Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape requires careful orchestration. And encouraging individuals to embrace this new paradigm demands education and trust-building.</p>



<p>Yet, the potential melody outweighs the dissonance. As awareness grows and technical advancements diminish the volume of challenges, DDID and SSI are poised to rewrite the identity score.</p>



 Extrimian and QuarkID: A Latin American Protocol 



<p>In Latin America, Extrimian and <a href="https://quarkid.org">QuarkID </a>showcase the power of collaboration. <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian </a>leverages <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync</a>‘s zero-knowledge proofs, playing a quiet yet powerful note in privacy preservation. QuarkID, a dynamic multi-chain protocol, offers a versatile platform for managing credentials, empowering individuals to take control of their digital selves.</p>



<p>Their partnership, like a captivating duet, brings the promise of SSI closer to reality in Argentina, demonstrating the global reach and transformative potential of this identity revolution.</p>



 The future of Self-Sovereignty: 



<p>The future of identity is decentralized, with individuals conducting the symphony of their digital lives. DDID and SSI offer a transformative score, where privacy and security harmonize with control and convenience. As Extrimian and QuarkID exemplify, innovative collaborations are fueling this revolution, ensuring that every individual can claim their rightful place as the protagonist of their digital narrative.</p>



<p>So, put down the baton of centralized control and pick up the instrument of self-sovereignty. The future of identity is yours to compose, one verifiable credential at a time.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving in the U.S. signals the start of the holiday shopping season, stretching all the way to Christmas. During this time, businesses offer various deals and incentives, triggering a surge in orders, deliveries, and returns of goods. Unfortunately, this season is also a prime opportunity for attackers seeking to capitalize on unsuspecting individuals, employing identity-based cyberattacks such as phishing to compromise users’ credentials and take control of their accounts.</p>
<p>In fact, the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA231115#:~:text=The%20FBI%20warns%20of%20criminals,in%20losses%20over%20%2473%20million.">FBI reported almost 12,000 victims reporting non-payment/non-delivery scams during the 2022 holiday shopping season, resulting in losses over $73 million</a>. This number doesn’t account for organizations that have experienced breaches due to employees falling victim to phishing while using corporate devices for online shopping. Additionally, it doesn’t acknowledge the number of victims who never report these incidents. While education on phishing scams and how to stay safe is a necessary step in helping protect users against account takeover (ATO) and other identity-based attacks, it is not a foolproof way to secure your users and their data.</p>
<p>Most organizations have implemented some form of multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is usually based on SMS/email one-time passcode (OTP) or mobile soft tokens to improve security for their users and customers. At the same time, attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, using tools such as phishing-as-a-service and generative AI. These technologies enable the creation of phishing emails and campaigns that look alarmingly authentic, often evading the most well-trained and vigilant security-aware individuals. In addition, MFA bypass attacks like SIM swap and MFA fatigue/prompt bombing render traditional MFA options vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations need to implement phishing-resistant and MFA bypass-resistant multi-factor authentication to protect their users and customers.</p>

<p>Most holiday phishing attacks exploit users’ distractions amid holiday festivities and shopping. This leads to financial losses and identity theft, causing long-term repercussions such as damage to credit scores, mortgages, and more.</p>
 
 Fake promotions – These are emails or advertisements that offer attractive discounts, leading victims to phishing sites that replicate genuine retail websites. Users unknowingly make purchases using their credit cards, only to never receive the items they paid for. 
 Delivery notifications – As online holiday shopping increases, cybercriminals exploit it by sending fake delivery notifications. These messages pressure victims to click on links to resolve supposed issues, such as delivery address or payment of additional fees, often leading to compromised credentials. 
 Fake charities – Preying on the goodwill of people during the holidays, attackers create deceptive websites impersonating charities to solicit donations. 
 Fake order receipts – Cybercriminals mimic well-known, reputable retailers by sending fake order receipts through email. These emails contain links supposedly allowing the recipient to cancel or modify their order, tricking them into visiting phishing sites where their credentials are compromised. 
 
<p>While most attacks are targeted toward consumers, organizations should also be alert. Employees often use corporate devices such as laptops and mobile phones for holiday shopping, potentially risking the compromise of business accounts and applications. In addition, many users reuse passwords across personal and corporate accounts, making them susceptible to credential stuffing attacks.</p>
<p>Phishing-Resistant Passwordless MFA</p>
<p>Certificate-based authentication (CBA) with Bluetooth proximity is the highest assurance phishing-resistant MFA option available in the market. It is the most recommended approach to securing access to organizational resources and data for users including employees, contractors, and B2B customers.</p>
<p>For most consumer use cases, passkeys are starting to gain adoption as the phishing-resistant MFA that utilizes a user’s smartphone to utilize cryptographic key pairs when authenticating users to applications or services. Passkeys are generally multi-device enabled with the private key stored across a user’s device ecosystem and in their platform’s cloud account (i.e. iCloud, etc.).</p>
<p>Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication (RBA)</p>
<p>While phishing-resistant passwordless MFA provides enhanced security and protection against ATO attacks, enforcing a risk-based approach can help add additional layers of security while balancing security with user experience, only introducing friction in the process when necessary. Risk inputs like travel velocity, behavioral biometrics, and other external risk feeds such as threat feeds, etc. can help evaluate the risk score of a user during an authentication event, allowing for access to be blocked or requiring the user to use a different 2FA based on risk score thresholds.</p>
<p>Identity Verification (IDV)</p>
<p>Another common entry point for attackers is during password/MFA reset, where they can gain access to a user’s account by triggering a reset and adding additional authenticators to the account. Using identity verification solutions can help combat these attacks. Requiring users to verify their identity with physical credentials such as a driver’s license, passport, etc. can add another layer of defense in securing users against ATO attacks. IDV as a step-up authentication can help protect high-value transactions or out-of-policy/out-of-compliance users.</p>
<p>Combining phishing-resistant MFA with RBA and IDV offers a layered approach with defense in depth against identity-based attacks.

 Making a Human Rights Based Approach to Personal Data&nbsp;Work <p>We (Mydex CIC) have just published a new Paper on how to practically implement <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">a human rights approach to personal data</a>. It’s important because implementing a human rights to personal data does two things: it involves implementing a human rights approach to the person that the data relates to and to the service that the data is being used to deliver. It’s key to actually making human rights happen on the ground, day-to-day rather than just talk about (which tends to happen quite&nbsp;often).</p><p>You might think that peoples’ rights in relation to their data is already covered, dealt with by legislation such as GDPR. To be sure, GDPR lays important foundations creating a number of rights such as the right to access, to data portability, to transparency in how, to object to processing and to be forgotten, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>But in many ways these are just formal rights which have very little impact on what happens day to day. We think a human rights approach to personal data goes much further than formal compliance to GDPR into the nitty gritty of how themes such as Control, Agency and Guardianship work (hence the title of the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">Paper</a>). Here are some of its key&nbsp;points.</p> Is user-centricity a good&nbsp;thing? <p>First off, almost always, slogans like ‘user centric service design’ are a sure-fire sign that a human rights approach to personal data is not being implemented. This is because of the way ‘user centric’ logic works. By definition, a ‘user’ is a person using a particular service. In focusing solely on the interface between the organisational and the individual, it actually ignores the context and circumstances of the individual’s life, quickly turning the attention back to itself. ‘User-centric’ thus becomes a way in which organisations keep examining themselves in their own mirrors: high-sounding rhetoric for their continued focus on their own needs in relation to their&nbsp;users.</p><p>A simple example: a user-centric approach to designing forms will focus on one particular organisation’s attempts to make filling in its particular forms easier, clearer and simpler. This is fine as it goes, but it’s not very far because most individuals needing services need to fill in lots of different forms, many of them completely different in their design, presentation and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Time and time again we have seen projects where ‘user-centric’ service design loses sight of the people it is supposed to serve: the human beings whose lives are much richer, more complicated and difficult than just their one single interface with one particular organisation and one particular service.</p><p>So, for example, a service that is person-centric rather than user-centric might ask ‘how to eliminate the need to fill in forms at all?’ (by, for example, enabling automated API-based processes of data sharing). Or, failing that, how to design forms so that they all look and feel the same no matter what organisation they come from, so that we as human beings don’t have to learn how to navigate our way through, each different form, every&nbsp;time?</p> Is ‘control’ a good&nbsp;thing? <p>‘Control’ over data is another word to be suspicious about. That’s because service providers usually interpret ‘control’ in a very narrow, organisation-centric way. ‘Control’ is interpreted as an individual being able to exercise a little more control over the data that that particular organisation collects about them. This is very different to an individual having genuine, full control over the data by, for example, being able to aggregate data from all the different organisations they deal with, in their own database (such as a personal data store), and to use and share this data as they wish, outside of the systems, restrictions and controls placed upon this data by the organisation concerned.</p><p>A truly human rights approach to data embraces the second, genuine, full interpretation of ‘control’; something that, after 16 years of development, we are now implementing in a number of projects, particularly in health and&nbsp;care.</p> Why agency is&nbsp;critical <p>‘Agency’ is another key concept when it comes to the practical implementation of a human rights approach to personal data. If you can’t actually access and use your data to actually do stuff in your life — to get stuff done — then your ‘rights’ are just formal, not real; and ‘control’ is close to meaningless.</p><p>The locus of such agency isn’t within the systems of this or that organisation; it is within the individual’s life, when they are trying to access, use and share data to better manage the issues that matter to them. This, we believe, is creating a completely different agenda.</p><p>What’s really needed to enhance and enable citizen agency is a personalised experience layer that enables individuals to interoperate with many different schemes and ecosystems via a familiar, consistent interface that becomes second nature to them. Like driving a&nbsp;car.</p><p>Practically speaking, this means each individual should have their own personalised cockpits or dashboards that display the data about their life, their transactions, their accumulated proof points and so on, in the ways that they find intuitive and easy to&nbsp;use.</p><p>Within this, agency means being able to use your data where and when you want, and to be able to share it easily with whomever you want safely and securely. Seen from this perspective, our society has hardly even begun adopting or implementing a human rights approach to personal data: we have a long way to&nbsp;go.</p> Agency and guardianship: two sides of the same&nbsp;coin <p>Finally, ‘guardianship’ is crucial to both real life control and agency. There are millions of people in the UK today, such as the old, frail or ill, who are not able to act fully and completely on their own behalf: who need help; someone to act for them in ways big and&nbsp;small.</p><p>Perhaps ironically, it is precisely in such situations of real or threatened loss of control and agency that, very often, they become all the more important to the person concerned. They want, as it were, to exercise control over what others are doing for them, when and&nbsp;how.</p><p>This is complex to manage and current ways of handling this complexity struggle with a chasm between highly formal, legal and bureaucratic powers of attorney and the myriad of informal ways that powers are delegated in real life: “Oh love, when you go to the shops, could you buy these items for me? Here’s my&nbsp;card!”</p><p>People need systems and infrastructure that let them handle this formal/informal spectrum quickly, simply and safely. Our Paper explains some of the mechanisms, such as Circles of Support, that we have developed to deal with these issues in a practical way.</p><p>This underlines a key point about most current debates on human rights. What’s needed above all is infrastructure, tools and capabilities that make it possible to embed and crystallise a human rights approach to data in a way that works at the level of daily, practical details. The focus needs to be on practical implementation, not just rhetoric.</p><p>To conclude, change is in the air. Our (Mydex’s) day-to-day work is showing that it is possible to build a personal data ecosystem that is interoperable, flexible, certifiable, scalable and that is also safe, secure and consensual, taking a human rights based approach that results in genuine personal, social and economic benefits. The opportunity is to make a human rights approach to personal data — and therefore to all data-driven services — something that actually does happen, every&nbsp;day.</p><p>P.S.

  <p>Today, I’m excited to share with you several new developments in the journey towards phishing-resistant authentication for all users!&nbsp; This isn’t just essential for compliance with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order&nbsp;14028 on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity</a> but is increasingly critical for the safety of all the orgs and users who bet on digital identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TL;DR? Here’s the cheat sheet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Microsoft Authenticator announces phishing-resistant passkey support. 
 Microsoft Authenticator is FIPS 140-3 compliant on all platforms. 
 More configuration options for PIV/CAC authentication. 
 FIDO2 support for iOS and MacOS applications. 
 Managed policies help you with “secure by design, secure by default.” 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details below!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Authenticator is becoming phishing-resistant! 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/identity-at-microsoft-ignite-securing-access-in-the-era-of-ai/ba-p/2747279">announced</a> at Ignite 2023, in the first half of 2024, Microsoft Entra ID users will soon be able to register and sign in with device-bound passkeys managed in the Microsoft Authenticator app. This is a cost-effective, phishing-resistant credential available to anyone with the Authenticator app! Passkeys provide you with the latest and greatest security enhancements that will come to the FIDO standard over the next many years – and Authenticator integration lets you take advantage of the security innovations and advanced features Authenticator provides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Passkey managed in the Microsoft Authenticator app</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further enhance Microsoft Authenticator and help customers meet compliance requirements, the Authenticator App on Android is now FIPS-140 compliant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning with version 6.2310.7174, Microsoft Authenticator for Android is&nbsp;compliant with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 140-3) for all Microsoft Entra authentications using phishing-resistant device-bound passkeys, push multifactor authentications (MFA), passwordless Phone Sign-In (PSI), and time-based one-time passcodes (TOTP).&nbsp;For organizations using Intune Company Portal, install version 5.0.6043.0 in addition to the latest version of the Authenticator for FIPS compliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS is already FIPS-140 compliant, as announced in December of 2022. Learn more about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-authenticator-app#fips-140-compliant-for-microsoft-entra-authentication">FIPS 140 complaint for the Microsoft Authenticator app.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improved configurability for organizations that uses PIV / CAC 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last year since we announced the General Availability of Certificate-based Authentication (CBA), we’ve seen an increase of over 850% in Entra ID CBA usage for US Government customers. CBA helps our customers in their Zero Trust journey, migrating from on-premises IdPs such as AD FS, while continuing to provide familiar end user experience using PIV / CAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We continue our investments in cloud-based CBA with recently added capabilities that allow you to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group. You can now select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multifactor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Additional phishing-resistant authentication options for mobile: FIDO2 support for iOS and macOS applications 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the summer of 2023, we announced support for <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/advancing-modern-strong-authentication/ba-p/3773135">FIDO2 authentication on iOS and macOS web browsers</a>. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of FIDO2 authentication on iOS and macOS . With this release, users who have Microsoft Authenticator installed on iOS or Microsoft Intune Company Portal installed on macOS can sign into Microsoft applications using a FIDO2 security key. This feature is available now on iOS and will be available early next year on macOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO2 authentication is also available in MSAL-enabled third-party apps on iOS and macOS that meet the requirements listed in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/support-fido2-authentication">Support passwordless authentication with FIDO2 keys in apps you develop</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Adopting secure defaults, aligned with “Secure by design, secure by default” approach outlined by CISA 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/">Secure Future Initiative</a>. As part of this initiative, we will start <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/?p=132044">Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies</a>. These initiatives align with the “Secure by design, Secure by default” approach called out by The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), to ensure consumers can trust the safety and integrity of the technology that they use every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that tackling cybersecurity challenges is a collective effort. We're dedicated to collaborating closely with government agencies, security experts, and the broader community to strengthen our collective defenses against cyber threats. Our aim is to provide government customers with the tools and knowledge they need to stay ahead of evolving risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recent releases and ongoing commitment to enhancing cybersecurity will support our broad set of customers, including the U.S. government customers who are working to meet the Executive Order. Together, we can build a more secure digital future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

We believe private storage infrastructure is the next growth area for&nbsp;web3.</p><p>Web2 offers abundant storage options, but web3’s unique needs demand specific solutions.</p><p>Existing decentralized storage models such as Filecoin, Sia, and Arweave are robust for public data, but fall short for private personal data. <a href="http://verida.network">Verida</a> fills this gap by addressing speed, authentication, encryption, and regulatory issues in private data&nbsp;storage.</p><p>This is a chance for node operators to gain exposure to emerging, high growth use cases such as compliant DeFi, RWAs, credentials, healthcare and enterprise data management.</p><p>We are working with a growing <a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem">ecosystem</a> of partners such as Polygon ID, Redbelly Network, zkPass, cheqd and others to make this&nbsp;happen.</p> The Verida Storage Node&nbsp;Network <p>The Verida protocol provides an open source <a href="https://github.com/verida/storage-node">Storage Node</a> server that provides encrypted, authenticated database storage for Verida accounts on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>The Storage Node network is global with a region-aware design. It empowers users to control their data storage location in accordance with their geographic preference and regulatory needs.</p><p>By default, the <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet </a>selects storage nodes in the user’s country or region, ensuring regulatory compliance. Users, however, have the freedom to change these nodes or even host their own, allowing for true data sovereignty.</p><p>The technology also enables the “right to be forgotten.” Users can delete their data from storage nodes or remove their identity and data entirely from the&nbsp;network.</p><p>This level of control over data storage and deletion is unprecedented and vital for the widespread adoption of this technology in mature, regulated industries. For instance, social media and health&nbsp;care.</p> The Storage Node Foundational Release <p>Storage nodes are currently operated across multiple global regions by the Verida Foundation.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Onboarding and offboarding employees includes managing which SaaS applications they need access to and which they need to be removed from. Many small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) do this with something lovingly (or not so lovingly) called The SpreadsheetTM.</p>
<p>A new employee joins the company? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee left the company? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee changed their name? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, when the annual access review comes along, everyone asks: How accurate is The Spreadsheet? And as your company grows, the more employees you have, the more applications you use, the more digitally connected you are — the more complicated The Spreadsheet gets.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet method had its day, but you can see how it might prevent SMBs from leveling up and even unintentionally add operational, technical, and security debt to take care of later. It is possible to automate granting and revoking access and permissions by using APIs for many applications. But there are some substantial barriers:</p>
<p>It’s nobody’s job (yet). Small companies are often strapped, and maybe you don’t have a dedicated headcount that can own the process of <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">updating employee application access</a>.</p>
<p>The app doesn’t have an API. With some applications, the only way to update permissions is in the app itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">expensive SSO tax</a> gets in the way. Using automation software like Okta, for example, forces you to implement technological protocols you just don’t need yet. It’s expensive and can be disruptive to users.&nbsp;</p>
 A better way to automate IT permissions 
<p>Because it’s so easy to implement, more modern application vendors have adopted “Sign in with Google,” and they don’t charge for it. This means that if you use Google Workspace, the need for SAML-based SSO (like Okta) is nearly obsolete. And get this — 70% of startups and SMBs already operate on Google Workspace to begin with!</p>
<p>YeshID helps Google Super Admins create a streamlined, repeatable, efficient, and compliant way to manage identities and applications. Using templates, you can automate creating a Google user and putting them in the proper organization and groups. This also triggers the creation of a task list of apps they need access to and automatically sends requests for provisioning to the proper admins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, we’re testing an even easier way to do this: If the application offers the ability to read the list of users on lower subscription tiers, we’ll actually keep the list up to date for you. And soon, we’ll have the ability to add the user for you too (if that capability exists in lower subscription tiers).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, we have integrations with Slack, Notion, and Hubspot. Once enabled, syncing users from those applications to YeshID can be done with a click of a button.&nbsp;</p>
 Give it a go 
<p>YeshID is in beta and looking for folks who sit in that sweet spot where you want to ditch The Spreadsheet but don’t want to go all in on Okta. If this is you, <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">learn more</a>! We’re already <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-new-era-of-secure-it-identity-management-yeshid-soc-ii-and-you/">SOC II compliant</a>, we’re in the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/yeshid_onboard/456377342688">Google Workspace Marketplace</a>, and you have a big ol’ DELETE button if you decide it’s not for you. </p>

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF68 is live today, Dec 14. It concludes on Dec 21. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF68   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF68 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  Read how to optimize Predictoor rewards&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">here</a>.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $27K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Dec 7, 2023: $0.511 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.0798 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.511 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $19,163&nbsp;USD  $0.0798 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,980&nbsp;USD  Total: $19,163 + $7,980 = $27,142.5 ≈ $27K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p></p>



 



<p></p>



 What is QuarkID? 



<p><a href="https://quarkid.org">QuarkID </a>is the Decentralized Digital Identity protocol anchored on <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync Era</a>, developed by <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian</a>, and driven by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires and other companies with extensive experience in decentralized technologies and data security. This initiative seeks to put the power of data in the hands of citizens.</p>



 Latin America’s leading Decentralized Identity protocol partners with zkSync to transform Digital Identity in the region, starting with the City of Buenos Aires. 



<p>In the ever-changing blockchain technology landscape, the quest for a billion users remains a constant goal. So what technology or use cases should we push to achieve greater adoption of blockchain technology?</p>



<p>And is that, considering the privacy and digital security needs due to the increase in cybercrime and identity theft that is occurring these days, an identity and private data verification system that puts the user at the center, is imperative.</p>



 What drives this development? 



<p>At the heart of the Web3 ethic is personal ownership and decentralization, principles that extend far beyond financial assets to encompass broader, more practical applications. Today, we are pleased to announce a groundbreaking initiative in this direction: citizen-owned digital identity. Buenos Aires, Argentina, is poised to lead the charge, gradually introducing Web3 identity solutions powered by zkSync Era’s privacy-centric properties.</p>



<p>In the effort to bring Web3 identity solutions to the global stage, it is imperative that privacy remains a paramount concern in technologies that enable personal data ownership. A decentralized world that neglects privacy considerations goes against the very essence of Web3.</p>



<p>We envision a future in which personal freedom and autonomous digital identity empower individuals to securely manage their data.</p>



 Empowering Buenos Aires Citizens with Decentralized and Self-Sovereign Digital Identity. 



<p>Under Argentina’s blockchain-based identification initiative, citizens will gain control over their personal documents, health data and, in the future, payment processing. To build the infrastructure for this transformative program, Buenos Aires has partnered with QuarkID, an open source digital identity protocol developed by Extrimian, Latin America’s leading decentralized identity company. QuarkID uses zkSync Era as its anchor protocol, powering the wallets through which individuals will claim their documents.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This marks a monumental leap toward a more secure and efficient future for government services in Latin America,” ; “QuarkID fosters closer ties between governments and citizens while introducing digital identity practices and security standards in Latin America.”, expressed <a href="https://ar.linkedin.com/in/guillevillanueva">Guillermo Villanueva, CEO of Extrimian</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The data stored in QuarkID wallets is autonomous, allowing citizens to control the delivery of their credentials when interacting with administrative services. zkSync Era serves as a settlement layer for QuarkID, ensuring that each participating citizen maintains ownership of their legitimate credentials.</p>



<p>While QuarkID makes its debut in Buenos Aires, its architecture is designed to scale globally. Complying with international standards such as W3C, Trust Over IP and Sovrin Foundation, QuarkID is interoperable with networks around the world.</p>



 Leveraging ZK Technology to Empower 650 Million People in Latin America 



<p>While blockchain-based digital identity promises a revolutionary change in data ownership, it often generates controversy as to the true decentralization of these processes. Recent events, such as the Kenyan government’s concerns about data privacy in a biometric cryptocurrency project, highlight these issues.</p>



<p>However, the transparency and security inherent in the cutting edge of Zero Knowledge (ZK) technology, combined with Ethereum, have the potential to dispel such concerns. This partnership unlocks privacy-preserving digital identity enforcement for entire nations.</p>



zkSync Era partnership with QuarkID



<p>Source: <a href="https://zksync.mirror.xyz/w4_Dyhbx1X2BEGpYNCn8rEAS_2uC1hV0qPQl_m5AChk">ZkSync Blog</a></p>



<p>With zkSync and Ethereum as the backbone of this initiative, personal data stored on-chain mitigates identity theft and personal information attacks commonly associated with centralized data storage technologies. zkSync ensures that digital property is trusted, trustless and secure, while prioritizing privacy.</p>



<p>The Argentine government and the City of Buenos Aires aim to establish its digital identity framework as a public good, enabling individuals to seamlessly transact information between government, businesses and their peers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhfernandez/?locale=es_ES">Diego Fernandez, Secretary of Innovation of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires</a>, emphasizes, “With this development, Buenos Aires becomes the first city in Latin America and one of the first in the world to integrate and promote this new technology and set the standard for how other countries in the region should use blockchain technology for the benefit of their people.”</p>



<p>Read this <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/09/28/buenos-aires-government-blockchain-birth-certificate-zero-knowledge-proofs/">Note to Diego Fernandez in Fortune Crypto</a> to learn more about this alliance and how it will be carried out.</p>



QuarkID decentralized digital trust protocol, and verification of private data



 QuarkID Roadmap 



<p>Beginning in October, residents of Buenos Aires will be able to download a QuarkID wallet to claim personal identification documents, including birth and marriage certificates. QuarkID will be available to all Argentine citizens and will eventually become mandatory nationwide. In November, documents such as proof of income and academic verifications will be available to obtain in QuarkID wallets. By the end of 2023, the government will establish QuarkID’s future roadmap and outline expansion milestones to initially provide its services to more than 3 million citizens.</p>



<p>Buenos Aires is leading this initiative, ushering in a new era of Internet through digital ownership. We hope that nations around the world will look to Argentina as an example of how Web3 identity can thrive at the government level.</p>

 What’s going on with Hollywood and AI or Artificial Intelligence? 



<p>Hollywood has a problem with artificial intelligence and the lack of humanity and individuality it breeds in the industry. The latest outcry from actors has underscored the importance of safeguarding authenticity in the film and television industry. In this context, the use of a decentralized Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) system can be important. This system helps to verify data and identities and to avoid scams and impersonations.</p>



<p>It is time to protect authenticity and identity in Hollywood, preserving the essence of human performance in the digital age. identities and, in the case of Hollywood, preserving the essence of human performance in the digital age.</p>



<p>A Self-Sovereign Identity system ensures reliable verification of data and identities, making a difference in the control of personal data. With Self-Sovereign Identity, we could avoid impersonalization and negative uses of Artificial Intelligence, such as scams and identity theft.</p>



<p>At Extrimian, we are working to promote more sovereign, decentralized and cybercrime-preventing models. Find out what we are doing at Extrimian to promote these models at Extrimian.io Products.</p>



 The Present Conflict and the Relevance of Authenticity: Hollywood and Artificial Intelligence 



<p>In Hollywood, actors who are authentic and convey genuine emotions are key to the success of movies and TV shows. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence has presented significant challenges in terms of impersonation and the generation of fraudulent content. The actor strike shows the concern about losing authenticity and being replaced by technology.</p>



 Data protection with SSI vs. AI 



 Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and the importance of authenticity. 



<p>How can this model solve the problems with breaching people’s identities?<br>SSI is a system that gives individuals full control over their digital identity and the data associated with it. Using SSI, actors and other individuals can create verifiable digital identities that support their authenticity in the entertainment industry. This system uses cryptography and blockchain to protect and validate information, preventing changes and forgeries.</p>



 Data security: Avoiding deception and forgery. 



<p>Using a decentralized, self-sovereign identity system in Hollywood could prevent scams and spoofing when validating identities. This system would enable the creation of verifiable digital certifications that would evidence the effective participation of participants in specific projects.</p>



<p>Such certifications could be employed by production studios and audiences to corroborate the veracity of content, fostering trust and preventing fraud.</p>



 Safeguarding authenticity in the Hollywood industry in the age of AI 



<p>In an age of technological advancements, it is important to address the entertainment industry’s challenges in terms of authenticity and truthfulness. What do you think is the effect of deepfakes and impersonations in the entertainment industry? In what ways do you think identity and data verification can help address these issues? What additional actions do you think should be put in place to safeguard the privacy and rights of actors?</p>



<p>What measures can we implement with respect to this? Self-Sovereign Identity as a tool for AI.<br>It is time to safeguard the authenticity of identities and, in the Hollywood context, maintain the essence of human performance in the digital age. The adoption of a Self-Sovereign Identity system can be crucial to ensure reliable verification of data and identities.</p>



<p>With SSI, we could prevent impersonation and harmful uses of AI, such as fraud and identity theft.</p>

  Under Singapore’s Payment Services Act, cryptocurrencies are recognized as digital payment tokens, requiring businesses to obtain a license to offer crypto services in the city-state.  In 2020, Singapore’s Monetary Authority introduced a licensing system for crypto exchanges and wallet providers to align with anti-money laundering (AML) and CTF (counter-terrorist financing) regulations.  The crypto Travel Rule threshold in Singapore is SGD 1,500, yet certain information must still be shared for transactions below this&nbsp;value.  <p>As crypto adoption continues to rise, Singapore is seeing growing traction, coming in at 2nd place in the Crypto Hubs 2023 list. The country plays a key role in crypto’s adoption in the Asia-Pacific region, which it strengthens through a focus on digital innovation, raising awareness of crypto usage, the absence of capital gains tax, the government’s close cooperation with industry stakeholders, and most importantly, favorable crypto regulation in Singapore.</p><p><a href="https://www.fortuneindia.com/macro/singapore-emerges-as-top-crypto-hub-switzerland-uae-follow-suit/114010">According to Henley &amp; Partners</a>, Singapore leads as the top crypto hub across the world with a score of 50.2 out of 60, a reflection of its well-established crypto infrastructure and reputation for privacy and security. This standing in the global arena naturally leads to an interest in the specifics of its legal framework, particularly how Singapore applies <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule#:~:text=A%20VASP%20is%20a%20cryptocurrency,lowered%20the%20threshold%20to%20zero.">the FATF Travel Rule</a> in its burgeoning crypto&nbsp;sector.</p><p>So, let’s take a closer look at Singapore’s crypto law and the application of the FATF travel rule in the&nbsp;country!</p> Overview of Crypto Regulations in Singapore <p>In 2020, the country’s central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), introduced a licensing system for crypto exchanges and wallet providers under the Payment Services Act (PSA). With this move, the agency ensured that crypto-related activities within the country adhere to <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations</a>.</p><p>Under this framework, cryptocurrencies are classified as digital payment tokens (DPTs), effectively making approved cryptocurrencies legal assets in Singapore and allowing them to be treated on par with other asset&nbsp;classes.</p><p>The act stipulates that any business offering crypto services must obtain a payment institution license, which means having a registered office in Singapore.</p><p>The country’s financial regulatory body also incorporated cryptocurrencies under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) in the same year. This move essentially categorized certain approved tokens as capital market products.</p><p>Singapore also mandates that cryptocurrency exchanges and other virtual asset service providers secure a capital market services (CMS) license for issuing digital tokens. With this requirement, the country is ensuring that these entities meet specific financial standards and maintain a clear demarcation between firms engaged in market-making activities and those focusing on developing blockchain-based innovations in the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-state-of-global-crypto-regulations">Click here to learn about the current state of global crypto regulations.</a></p> Specifics of the Singapore Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/notices/psn02-aml-cft-notice---digital-payment-token-service">MAS published PSN02</a>, also known as the Crypto Travel Rule Singapore, which came into force in January 2020 to address money laundering and terror financing risks. It is a part of Singapore’s broader cryptocurrency regulation framework, where MAS mandates that crypto service providers comply with the FATF’s Travel Rule to bolster the resilience of the country’s financial system.</p><p>Notably, these rules don’t apply when transactions are between crypto service providers and non-custodial or self-hosted wallets.</p><p>However, according to the stipulations of the Crypto Travel Rule Singapore, VASPs are obligated to collect and share originator and beneficiary information with the beneficiary crypto service providers for all transactions, regardless of the amount involved.</p><p>For transactions below or equal to SGD 1,500, the information required includes:</p>  The name of the value transfer originator  The value transfer originator’s account number or unique transaction reference number  The name of the value transfer beneficiary  The value transfer beneficiary’s account number or unique transaction reference number.  <p>And when the crypto transaction amount exceeds S$1,500, a wider scope of information must be collated and shared. This includes:</p>  Name of the transaction originator and their account number or unique transaction reference number  Originator’s address, date and place of birth, and a unique identification number, which can be a birth certificate number or passport number and an identity card number or the registration number in case it’s a&nbsp;business  Name of the beneficiary and their account number or unique transaction reference number  If it’s a legal entity, then its ultimate beneficiary owner (UBO) must be identified and verified.  <p>Under Crypto Travel Rule Singapore, financial institutions, too, are required to implement a robust risk management system that includes:</p>  Risk assessment and Risk mitigation  Customer due diligence (CDD)  Enhanced due diligence (EDD)  Sanctions list screening  Politically exposed persons (PEP) screening  Ongoing transaction monitoring  Reliance on third&nbsp;parties  Correspondent accounts and wire transfers  Audit, employee training, and internal&nbsp;policies  Record-keeping for at least five&nbsp;years  Compliance reporting, including suspicious transactions to&nbsp;MAS   Is Crypto Legal in Singapore? <p>Yes, crypto is legal in Singapore and open to innovation through the Payment Services Act (PSA), which was passed in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>This Act clarifies the legal status of crypto and governs a wide range of payment service companies, including account issuance, local and international money transfer services, e-money issuers, merchant acquisition, foreign exchange, and Digital Payment Token Services.</p><p>Companies dealing with crypto transmission, exchange, or storage are subject to the MAS regulatory control. Due to Singapore’s strict crypto AML/CFT laws, VASPs need to register for a trading license and adhere to AML/CFT&nbsp;rules.</p> Crypto Taxes in Singapore <p>Singapore is often regarded as a crypto tax haven for both individuals and businesses, primarily because it <a href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_cit_income-tax-treatment-of-digital-tokens_091020.pdf?sfvrsn=91dbe1f7_17">does not impose a capital gains tax</a> on cryptocurrency investments. This policy facilitates favorable conditions for long-term crypto investments.</p><p>However, the tax scenario differs for those who engage in professional crypto trading. In such cases, profits from trading are treated as income from business activity and are, therefore, subject to income tax. This taxation applies irrespective of whether the trading is short-term or long-term as long as it is conducted in a professional capacity.</p><p>In instances where crypto trading is subject to income tax, losses incurred can be deducted for tax purposes, offering some relief in the event of a downturn in the&nbsp;market.</p><p>For businesses that accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, the value received is treated as income and is subject to income&nbsp;tax.</p><p>It’s important to note that while transactions involving the purchase or sale of goods and services using cryptocurrencies are not subject to the standard 8% Goods and Services Tax (GST), the act of buying, selling, or converting cryptocurrencies is subject to GST on the fees involved in these transactions.</p><p>In terms of accounting for these transactions, Singapore typically employs methods such as FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), and Weighted Average, providing different approaches to calculating profits or losses for tax reporting.</p> Singapore Stablecoin Regulation <p>In Q3 of 2023, Singapore finalized the rules for stablecoins, which are payment tokens that maintain a constant value against one or more fiat currencies, to become one of the first jurisdictions globally to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>These rules aim to “facilitate the use of stablecoins as a credible digital medium of exchange and as a bridge between the fiat and digital asset ecosystems.”</p><p>As per Singapore stablecoin regulation, some key requirements to ensure value stability at all times&nbsp;include:</p>  Holding a minimum of 1 million Singapore dollars (SGD) in base&nbsp;capital  Stablecoin reserves must be held in low-risk and highly liquid&nbsp;assets  Reserves backing the stablecoin must be equal to or exceed the value of the stablecoin in circulation at all&nbsp;times  Stablecoin issuers must return the stablecoin’s par value to holders within five business days of a redemption request  Stablecoin issuers must provide “appropriate disclosures,” including value stabilizing mechanisms and reserve audits to&nbsp;users.  <p>These rules will apply to single‑currency stablecoins issued in the country and pegged to the local fiat currency, Singapore dollar (SGD), or any G10 currency, such as the USD. Stablecoins that fulfill these requirements will be recognized by the regulator as “MAS-regulated stablecoins,” distinguishing them from non-regulated tokens.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Singapore is one of the only countries in the world to provide a clear and robust legal framework for crypto assets. And when this regulatory clarity is combined with higher than average cryptocurrency ownership of <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/10584/cryptocurrency-in-singapore/#topicOverview">19%</a>, it makes Singapore a prime location for dealing with cryptocurrencies.</p><p>However, virtual asset service providers need to understand both the FATF Travel Rule and the broader crypto regulatory framework in Singapore in order to take full advantage of Singapore’s crypto adoption, tax benefits, and regulatory support for blockchain and fintech innovation and&nbsp;thrive.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What is the Payment Services Act in Singapore and How Does It Affect Cryptocurrencies? <p>The Payment Services Act, enacted in Singapore in 2019 (often referred to as the PSA Act Singapore or simply the Singapore Payment Act), modernizes the regulatory framework for digital payment services, directly impacting cryptocurrency-related businesses.</p> Q2: How Does Singapore’s Monetary Authority Regulate Crypto Exchanges and Wallet Providers? <p>In 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) mandated a licensing regime under the Payment Services Act specifically for crypto exchanges and wallet providers. This initiative, part of Singapore’s crypto exchange regulation, ensures these entities comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) standards. Consequently, only MAS-approved crypto exchanges and wallet services that adhere to these regulations are permitted to operate in Singapore.</p> Q3: What is the Crypto Travel Rule in Singapore, and What are its Thresholds? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule in Singapore is a regulatory measure for cryptocurrency transactions, in line with FATF Recommendation 16, which mandates the sharing of transaction information to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>When a transaction exceeds SGD 1,500, detailed information about both the sender and recipient must be disclosed. This requirement, part of the broader Singapore Travel Rule Crypto regulations, is also applicable for transactions below this threshold. However, the information required is not that detailed, unlike when the transactions exceed SGD&nbsp;1,500.</p> Q4: How are Cryptocurrencies Classified and Regulated Under Singapore’s Laws? <p>Cryptocurrencies in Singapore are classified as digital payment tokens under the Payment Services Act and are included under the Securities and Futures Act. This classification allows them to be legally treated as assets, requiring businesses to comply with various regulatory requirements, including obtaining relevant licenses.</p> Q5: What Specific Requirements are Imposed on Crypto Transactions in Singapore Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>The MAS mandates the collection and sharing of detailed originator and beneficiary information for all crypto transactions, with more comprehensive data required for transactions exceeding SGD 1,500. This includes personal identification and account&nbsp;details.</p> Q6: Is Cryptocurrency Legal in Singapore, and What are the Regulatory Requirements? <p>Yes, cryptocurrency is legal in Singapore. The Payment Services Act governs crypto transactions, with businesses needing to register for a trading license and adhere to stringent AML/CFT&nbsp;laws.</p> Q7: What is the Singapore Stablecoin Regulation? <p>Singapore stablecoin regulation is established rules for stablecoins in the city-state. Its goal is to ensure that stablecoins maintain consistent value stability. The key requirements for stablecoin issuers include a minimum base capital, liquid asset reserves, and clear disclosures to users, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>It’s been a busy few months at Ubisecure with a number of presentations at various events throughout Europe – some of which are available on-demand on our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/video-resources/" title="<span>Video Resources page</span>">Video Resources page</a>. It is great to be at the events, hearing from other industry experts, meeting new people, and not least getting direct feedback from live audiences as you present. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our core topics we’ve been presenting is getting great interest and engagement, and that is the notion of Identity Context.</p>
 What is Identity Context? 
<p>In business transactions, Identity Context helps to understand the parties involved in a transaction, including their roles, representative rights, responsibilities, and the nature of their engagement in a specific transaction.</p>
<p>Our work at Ubisecure is driven by our shared vision on the future of digital identity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combine a highly assured organisation identity with a strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve written in depth about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/true-b2b-iam/" title="highly assured organisation identity">highly assured organisation identity</a>, and how the value of strongly authenticated individual identity is well known. However, it is the act of combining those two identity classes that gives actual context to the potential interaction and defines the rights of the individual. It is this resultant combined identity that defines the Identity Context and enables the presentation of an aggregated/generated set of rights that are appropriate in that context.</p>
 The Value of Context 
<p>We all use the value of Identity Context implicitly, often without realising it, but in those circumstances, it is almost always ‘manually’ or at best with administrative control.</p>
<p>In direct interactions we often add context automatically – consider introducing yourself to a new teacher at your child’s school: ‘Hi I’m X, mother/father of Y’. Adding the parental relationship immediately adds context to the interaction and context to your presented identity. Alternatively, it’s almost certain that the first slide of any presentation you have given has established your Identity Context with the audience by including your name and your job title.</p>
<p>The context allows bounds to be known in the scope of the interaction. Additionally, that context will define rights that the individual can assert because they are acting in that context.</p>
 The Complexity of Context 
<p>Identity Context has value, and we use it already. So, how complex can it be? In short, very complex.</p>
<p>Context is, well, contextual. For a given individual they will operate in many differing contexts at differing times; they may even operate in multiple contexts at the same time. When operating in multiple contexts these can be independent or combined.</p>
<p>Add to this that the rate of change of contexts can be high; either as demanded by external changes, or as demanded by the process itself. A great example of this is privilege application management, where best security practice calls for least privilege by default and shortest possible time of increased privilege. The broader context might not change for several hours, but within that there will be fast-moving point in time contexts (with associated rights) that need to take effect in real time.</p>
<p>The idea of fast-moving context actually meshes very well with the current ‘buzz’ around Zero Trust. Zero Trust is often described as ‘authenticate always, authenticate often’ but in implementation ‘authenticate’ becomes ‘authorise’, noting that you must be known (authenticated) to be authorised.</p>
<p>Authorising often allows for rights to be modified as time and context change.</p>
 The Risks of Context 
<p>Context defines rights, and often responsibilities. In the previous two examples the context was self-declared. Self-declaration is ‘efficient’, but also sits as the root cause for most fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Referring back to our vision, discussed at the start of this blog, for a moment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combine a highly assured organisation identity with a strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>We talk about a highly assured organisation identity and a strongly authenticated individual identity – we actually get most value when that individual identity is highly assured as well. But there is a third item that needs to have an assurance level – the ‘combination’.</p>
<p>The combination is the linkage between the two identity types. In the examples above, we have Parent and Employee as the specific linkage.</p>
<p>The linkage can be self-declared, verbally – “I am the parent of” – which is a low assurance declaration and therefore, a low assurance combination. Alternatively, that linkage can be verified, for example through a birth certificate and passports.</p>
<p>The assurance level of the linkage directly affects the value of the Identity Context.</p>
<p>For a given eco-system, the assurance levels of identities and linkage will be defined by a Governance Framework. We see a great example of this in the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/vlei/">vLEI</a> eco-system (based on verifiable credentials), defined by the GLEIF and supported by Ubisecure. The assurance levels of the organisation, individual and the linkage between the two are prescribed along with process definitions that will, when executed, preserve that assurance level.</p>
 In summary… 
<p>Identity Context enables significant value – we have seen and talked about a Northern European Government case study (see below) that realised a 99% saving from establishing a highly assured Identity Context and then allowing that to be delegated.</p>
<p>Knowing ‘who you are’ is not sufficient, we need to know the rights you have for the given ‘interaction’.</p>

 Why you should Regularly Review your Cyber Security 
 
<p>Cyber security is never done – you need to constantly work to improve your organization’s cyber security readiness.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive-wahlefeld-cyber-threat-landscape">Cyber adversaries never sleep</a> and the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80854/cyber-risks-from-china-how-contract-negotiations-can-mitigate-it-risks">geopolitical tensions across the world</a> are raising the cyber security threat levels.</p>
 
 Technology is evolving 
 
<p>The technology landscape is evolving creating new opportunities as well as new threats.&nbsp; Lange Language Models (LLMs) have evolved beyond what was thought practical only a few years ago and conversational Artificial Intelligence engines are now a commodity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations are adopting these to provide improved efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and a better connection with their customers, partners, and suppliers.&nbsp; However, while LLMs provide <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-lichtenthaler-human-and-artificial-intelligence">great opportunities</a>, they also bring <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/artificial-intelligence-cre23">new cyber threats</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI involves a new kind of development pipeline and current system development methodologies and tools are not yet adapted to this.&nbsp; Can you be sure of the provenance of your training data? Can you trust the shared LLM?&nbsp; Can you be sure that the deployed inference engine has not been poisoned?</p>
<p>LLMs represent an entirely new form of cloud workload.&nbsp; Current Cloud Native Application Platforms (CNAPP) and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81219/cloud-security-posture-management">Cloud Security Posture Management&nbsp; (CSPM)</a> do not cover these.</p>
<p>However, LLMs provide powerful capabilities to enhance the identification of cyber risks, the detection of active threats and the response to and recovery from cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations cannot afford to neglect the new opportunities but must prepare for these new threats. &nbsp;They must also exploit these new capabilities to improve their cyber security.</p>
 
 Standards and Regulations are Developing 
 
<p>The standards and best practice frameworks for cyber security are changing to respond to the increasing level of cyber threats and to incorporate the latest industry insights into how to best respond to these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISO/IEC 27001 The widely used information <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/27001">security standard ISO/IEC 27001</a> was updated in 2022. &nbsp;This new standard includes completely new controls covering - Threat intelligence, Information security for use of Cloud services, ICT readiness for business continuity, Physical security monitoring, Configuration management, Information deletion, Data masking, Data leakage prevention, Monitoring activities, Web filtering and Secure coding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your organization complies with ISO 27001 you will be required to update your controls to meet the new standard when next certified.&nbsp; Are your IT service providers and cloud services certified to the new standard?</p>
<p>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) v2.0 &nbsp;- On <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2023/nist-releases-cybersecurity-framework-2-0-draft#:~:text=The%20CSF%202.0%20draft%20reflects,CSF%E2%80%94especially%20for%20creating%20profiles.">August 8, 2023</a>, NIST released a draft of the NIST CSF 2.0, making the most significant revision to the framework since its inception in 2014. The draft includes the CSF itself and a discussion draft of implementation examples. NIST intends to release the final version in early 2024 without issuing another version for public comments.</p>
<p>NIST’s CSF 2.0 version 2.0 introduces significant changes to the cybersecurity landscape to address evolving threats and make the framework more accessible to all types of organizations. The draft reflects community feedback and industry shifts, emphasizes the role of cybersecurity as a key enterprise risk, and expands its scope beyond critical infrastructure. The CSF now includes six core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, recover and the new “govern” function, which focuses on decision making in support of a cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<p>If your organization bases its approach to cyber security on this framework you need to plan for transition to the updated version.&nbsp; Are you ready for this transition?</p>
<p>EU NIS 2 - In the wake of increased cyber-attacks on national critical infrastructure, authorities around the world are imposing stricter requirements on organizations that their populations rely on for a wide range of essential services, which includes a wide and growing number of private companies that should be preparing now to meet their new obligations.</p>
<p>Notably the EU issued the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj">Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive in 2016</a>&nbsp;and the US saw the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028</a>&nbsp;on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity in 2021. But European authorities are now seeking to go even further with an update to the NIS Directive, known as NIS2, which is expected to go into force by the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, NIS2 has a much wider scope, going beyond the traditional critical national infrastructure providers to include a range of organizations that are essential for the normal functioning of society, which include both EU and non-EU organizations that will have to ensure their compliance in future.</p>
<p>Is your organization <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-the-digital-frontier-cre23">ready to comply with its obligations</a> under these new regulations.</p>
 
 Reviewing your cyber security 
 
<p>Business objectives, organizational best practices, and technologies are constantly evolving.&nbsp; It is essential to continuously review your organization’s performance in the light of these changes. To support these reviews, KuppingerCole provides Maturity Level Matrices that are specifically targeted to distinct areas of cyber security.</p>
<p>These are based on the five-point maturity scale formulated using the Carnegie Mellon Maturity Index (CMMI).&nbsp; Note that this is currently <a href="https://cmmiinstitute.com/products/cmmi/content-release">being enhanced</a> to &nbsp;include best practices for measuring capability and improving performance in the areas of people management, data management, and virtual work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assessing maturity based on this model is complex and to organizations to accomplish this task for cyber security <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80839/maturity-level-matrix-for-cyber-security">we publish two matrixes</a> that describe the key areas that must be considered when assessing cyber security maturity.&nbsp; There are two matrices one covering cyber security organizational and management maturity and the other technological maturity. These are summarized below.</p>

<p>Let’s face it, organizations face many barriers to offering privacy products.</p>



<p>For companies that offer consumers pieces of the privacy and security puzzle, innovating and expanding offerings to adjacent – and in-demand – capabilities is often too expensive, takes too long, and falls outside of the core strength of the company offering the solution.</p>



<p>There’s a wide range of solutions that consumers “should” be using, but rarely are they motivated enough to do the hard work necessary to research, select, purchase, implement, and use all those solutions. Consequently, they use what they have been forced to use because of a security incident or they use the tools that come with their mainstream technology purchases or broader offerings.</p>



<p>Organizations playing in the privacy and online safety arena could benefit enormously from expanding their product offerings to cover adjacent areas – creating an easily acquired and easily implemented “one-stop-shop” where consumers get all they need from a brand they already trust.<br><br>Take these examples:</p>



 
 Insurance companies that offer identity theft insurance could package it with the technological solutions customers need to avoid falling victim in the first place. 



 Technology companies that offer cybersecurity capabilities, such as antivirus and malware protection, could add adjacent privacy and security offerings to complete the picture for consumers. 



 Vendors of specific privacy and online security services, such as credit monitoring, could boost customer loyalty and accelerate customer acquisition by also offering services their customers know they need but haven’t yet found an easy way to adopt. 



 Trusted general providers of goods and services, such as big box retailers and popular associations, could conveniently also offer online security products and services under the one roof, significantly increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.<br> 
 



 
 <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/11/removing-the-barriers-to-monetizing-privacy/">Read White Paper</a> 
 



 The challenge is real 



<p><br>Most organizations are not equipped to re-direct development resources to new products that fall outside of their established sweet spot. While they certainly could hire, ramp-up, and build these types of solutions from scratch, the time to a viable and profitable product offering may be too much.</p>



<p>But what if there was a way to add attractive and necessary privacy and online safety capabilities to existing products – or even as new products – quickly, easily, and completely and without the burden of developing them in house?</p>



 The solution is Sudo Platform 



<p>Anonyome Labs’ Sudo Platform is an API-first, developer-focused ecosystem that delivers the tools companies need to quickly and completely deliver to their customers the capabilities they need to protect and control their personal information while navigating the digital world. It is a powerful, modular, and quick-to-implement collection of the most important digital privacy and cyber safety tools for either mobile or desktop, and covering:</p>



 
 safe and private browsing including ad and tracker blocking and site reputation services 



 password management, automation, and security 



 virtual private network services 



 safe online commerce through virtual cards 



 a platform for decentralized identity including identity wallets, verifiable credentials services, and all the infrastructure necessary to make it real today 



 compartmentalization across all services so customers can easily partition their online interactions into purpose-specific identities (for example, one each for shopping, socializing, medical, travel, and so on). 
 







<p>Organizations use the set of scalable hosted services at the heart of Sudo Platform to quickly integrate these tools into any of their products or offerings and give their customers seamless access to them.</p>



<p></p>



 Sudo Platform is feature-packed 



<p>Developer-focused documentation</p>



<p>Thorough direction for how to build each of the Sudo Platform capabilities into applications are included in the <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/">documentation site</a>.</p>



<p>API-first ecosystem</p>



<p>Sudo Platform APIs power next-generation customer apps with privacy, cyber safety, and decentralized identity capabilities, to empower organizations to quickly put privacy in their customers’ hands.</p>



<p>SDK source code</p>



<p>Mobile, web and desktop SDKs can be easily incorporated into an existing application or used as building blocks for new applications. Each SDK is built to run natively on all supported platforms, so they have the highest chance of compatibility with a vendor’s applications, independent of the frameworks and architecture they employ.</p>



<p>Available <a href="https://github.com/sudoplatform">SDKs via GitHub</a> include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sudos SDK&nbsp; 



 Telephony SDK&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Virtual Cards SDK&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Secure ID Verification SDK&nbsp; 



 Email SDK&nbsp; 



 Site Reputation SDK&nbsp; 



 VPN SDK&nbsp; 



 Password Manager SDK.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Sample apps</p>



<p>Using a sample app is the fastest way to see how the Sudo Platform services work and the value they deliver. Vendors can easily explore the technology and imagine the potential for their products, either as an enhancement or brand new offering.</p>



<p>Sample apps are intended to be lightweight reference apps that demonstrate to application developers basic SDK capabilities. <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asudoplatform+sample">Sample iOS, Android, and web apps available include</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Telephony Sample App&nbsp; 



 Email Sample App&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Secure ID Verification Sample App&nbsp; 



 Password Manager Sample App&nbsp; 



 Ad and Tracker Blocker Sample App&nbsp; 



 Site Reputation Sample App. 
 



<p>Brandable apps and UI kits</p>



<p>For the fastest route to market, Sudo Platform offers brandable (white label) apps and UI kits. These enable easy setup, configuration, and consumption of platform SDKs into unbranded applications which can an organization can quickly brand and deliver to market on mobile, web, and desktop platforms.</p>



<p>A UI kit gives access to libraries of advanced software modules with complex data and graphical flows that go beyond basic Sudo Platform service access, including:</p>



 
 complex business logic for data management and functional utilities that span one or more of the Sudo Platform services 



 UI kit, which includes widgets, screens and minor user flows that give recommended user experiences for a feature and can be integrated into your application. 
 



<p>Sudo Platform management console</p>



<p>The management console is where the organization manages administrative users and end users and gains critical insight into the analytics underlying a deployment and into ways to enhance the Sudo Platform experience. It gives insight into:</p>



 
 deployed Sudo Platform services 



 authentication 



 billing 



 entitlements. 
 



 Sudo Platform meets customers’ current and future needs

<p>For generations, teams have <a href="https://doodle.com/en/resources/blog/a-brief-history-of-meetings/?ref=blog.holochain.org">collaborated in physical rooms</a> using materials like whiteboards, sticky notes, and printed documents laid out on tables. While collaboration can be one of those “suitcase words” that is full of different meanings depending on the person you ask, it’s an enduring part of most of our work lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Dedicated spaces enabled the kinds of fluid interaction and embodied cognition which, in turn, drives complex projects forward.</p><p>With today's increasingly distributed digital work environments and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/01/why-labor-economists-say-the-remote-work-revolution-is-here-to-stay.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">work from home</a> setups, can elements of dynamic in-person teamwork successfully be recreated online?</p><p>As video meetings and productivity suites become default remote work tools, teams strive to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/revolutionizing-the-workspace/">recreate collaborative dynamics digitally</a>. However, experts argue purely digital collaboration has inherent limits.</p><p>This article explores: lessons from physical group flow, key aspects to replicate collaboration digitally, remaining gaps, and the potential of immersive and distributed platforms still on the horizon, like Holochain.&nbsp;</p> The Magic of Physical Spaces <p>For Hailey Cooperrider, game designer and co-founder of collaborative consultancy <a href="https://amble.studio/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Amble</a>, physical spaces enable a “magic” that digital platforms struggle to recreate.&nbsp;</p><p>She argues spatial dynamics like rooms allow more holistic group participation than 2D screens, stating, “I think being in a space with the whiteboard and having room to collaborate together isn’t just for the creative piece. It’s about dealing with complexity.”</p><p>Cooperrider also discusses how “literally, we think, with movement, with our hands, and with other parts of our bodies. And that cognition happens throughout the body.”&nbsp;</p><p>While this radiating, embodied cognition isn’t limited virtually, it certainly thrives in environments where teams can gather together physically.</p><p>When complex creativity and collaboration is required (such as in large groups), in-person spaces currently provide a fluidity that digital tools have difficulty replicating. Large meetings require quick back-and-forth communication among a large number of people — which is more time-consuming on the computer.&nbsp;</p> Bridging Physical &amp; Digital Workflows <p>When considering how to translate collaborative dynamics online, Cooperrider discusses the importance of preserving certain familiar artifacts digitally. For example, she notes that her team relies heavily on Trello's digital task boards to mimic physical sticky notes for project management.</p><p>“We love it, because it just smooths out what would normally be sticky notes, and allows us to bring our own meaning to the lists and the columns," she explains. Rather than prescribe complex new workflows, Trello provides flexibility for groups to organize work their own way.</p><p>Cooperrider also discusses how engineers often focus on operational challenges like reducing friction in workflows. However, she argues digital tools actually work best when preserving existing collaborative platforms and workflows that teams are already familiar with.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the Google Suite took traditional formats for documents, slides, and spreadsheets, and made them editable in real-time by multiple users online. Rather than adding complicated features to these tools, it kept them simple — and added the utility of collaboration.</p><p>Cooperrider concludes that "the most revolutionary, powerful, and most popular collaboration tool, it’s the Google Suite.”</p><p>While new technologies open new possibilities, they must also integrate the traditional techniques teams have relied on for years, in order to maximize adoption and usage. The future likely involves blending physical “magic” with virtual capabilities.</p> People-First Tools in a Hybrid Future <p>While digital collaboration tools have delivered immense progress, the next horizons explore decentralized and distributed models giving users more control, as with Holochain. Rather than enforce rigid conformity, the ideal future blends customizable peer-to-peer frameworks with thoughtfully designed physical spaces.</p><p>Tools must smooth, not obstruct, the rituals sustaining teams. And digital interactive spaces should spark the embodied cognition inherent to human collaboration. As remote and hybrid work expand, integrating the digital connectivity teams need with the in-person magic they crave is essential.</p><p>The frontier of collaboration technology puts people before platforms, deepening what is uniquely precious about gathering in rooms with resonant virtual capabilities. In the end, innovation emerges from groups in flow — whether particles across cables or shoulder-to-shoulder around whiteboards</p>

<p>In the wake of the hack at MOVEit and far too many other organizations this year, the secure, user-controlled, privacy-preserving benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT) make it a critical component of a modern identity and access management (IAM) architecture.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1248857/moveit-carnage-continues-with-over-2600-organizations-and-77m-people-impacted-so-far.html">one breach</a> alone has impacted 2,620 organizations—including Genworth, antivirus providers Avast and Norton, and the US Department of Energy—and 77.2 million people worldwide. The sheer volume of credentials and personal information compromised through downstream attacks is yet to be determined. But the incident and so many others like it drive home one of the biggest challenges of the digital age.</p>
<p>While centralized IAM consolidated the storage and management of identity data and enabled login credentials to be associated with user roles and permissions easily, it also created a single point of failure that cybercriminals continue to exploit to gain access to all the resources those credentials are authorized to access. Call us crazy, but at 1Kosmos, we believe a big part of preventing threat actors from stealing and weaponizing credentials and personally identifiable information (PII) is to avoid centrally storing them in the first place.</p>
 IAM Private &amp; Permissioned: Why DLT Is a BFD 
<p>In Parts <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">2</a> and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/ditching-the-feds-why-decentralized-digital-identity-is-key-to-effective-iam/">3</a> in this series, we look at how the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">1Kosmos architecture</a> provides a reliable and secure way to verify the identity of users and<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/"> biometrically authenticate</a> them via decentralized digital identity (DID) mechanisms in our BlockID solution—including a reusable <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">digital identity wallet</a>. The next pillar of our architectural advantage is distributed ledger technology for providing a private and permissioned blockchain that eliminates the centralized PII honeypot for good.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology has several security features that provide a proven way to manage and maintain digital property rights. Think user-controlled data, peer-to-peer, cryptographically secure sharing without an administrative intermediary, and an immutable digital “chain of custody” containing a detailed digital audit log of all user authentications. That makes it an ideal technology for managing and protecting users’ digital identity wallets, which can store a wide range of information—personal details, legal and educational credentials, financial accounts, digital health records, and more. The private and permissioned distributed ledger within BlockID delivers several key advantages, including the following.</p>
<p>Privacy by Design</p>
<p>Without a centralized administration authority, our private and permissioned blockchain technology gives individuals sole access and control of all personally identifiable information. This privacy-by-design approach enables end users to view and approve or reject the sharing of any and all information requested by online services or systems they seek to access. All PII is encrypted end-to-end, so it’s never exposed. Users approve or reject sharing requests directly with the applications and systems they connect to—without a third-party intermediary accessing their data. No external public key server, host messaging server, or other entity can access the keys or plaintext messages.</p>
<p>An Immutable Audit Trail</p>
<p>Like a public blockchain, our private and permissioned ledger retains a detailed, immutable audit trail of all events, enabling visibility to all logins, access attempts, information updates, and shared information related to a digital identity. This private ledger acts as a closed network where information from separate organizations or lines of business can be stored separately—each with its own private ledger. This extraordinary level of audit and visibility helps prevent unauthorized access and fraudulent transactions, providing a high level of assurance for the identity behind the device.</p>
<p>Industry Certification for Unrivaled Performance</p>
<p>We built the first (and only) architecture designed to support and exceed the industry’s strictest standards for security and convenience. Because BlockID follows the W3C specifications and is certified to <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a>, and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>, it uses public-private key cryptography to record and access all information. The private keys are stored in the secure enclave or TPM chip of the endpoint or the user’s device, which can be secured to the very highest digital standard of IAL2/AAL2 supported by NIST—ensuring credentials never leave the user’s device and are never stored on a server, eliminating the risk of credentials theft, replay attacks, or even user tracking. The next highest level of IAL3/AAL3 is generally reserved for human verification but can be achieved via agent-assisted authentication through 1Kosmos partners.</p>
<p>Security That Gives the PII Honeypot the Heave-Ho</p>
<p>In addition to the public-private key security used for encryption, signing, and making relationships with other parties afforded by the certifications above, 1Kosmos LiveID biometrics are certified to <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta DEA EPCS</a> specifications, providing assurance of liveness and achieving a false match rate of less than 0.1% at 95% confidence interval. Best of all, our private and permissioned ledger ensures there’s no central honeypot of user PII for hackers to target—further defeating the risk of ransomware and data breaches.</p>
<p>Support for a Wide Array of IAM Use Cases</p>
<p>With irrefutable proof of identity and an immutable, tamper-proof audit log of all updates and access attempts, our private and permissioned blockchain gives organizations the speed and agility they need to focus on building customer loyalty and capture market share from less tech-savvy rivals. In the conclusion of this series, we’ll look at how the 1Kosmos architecture enables reusable, verified credentials across a variety of IAM use cases—from “inferred” identity based on email address or device, to cross-referencing biometrics with government-issued forms of ID, to the very highest levels of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) mandates, and more.</p>

  <p>At Ignite 2022, we announced the general availability of Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA) as part of Microsoft’s commitment to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a>. Based on our experience working with government customers, PIV/CAC cards are the most common authentication method used within the federal government. While valuable for all customers, the ability to use X.509 certificate for authentication directly against Entra ID is particularly critical for federal government organizations using PIV/CAC cards and looking to easily comply with the Executive Order 14028 requirements as well as customers who want to migrate from a federated server like Active Directory Federated Server to Entra ID for CBA.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve added many new features and enhancements, which made CBA available on all platforms, including mobile, with support for certificates on devices as well as external security keys like YubiKeys. Customers now have more control and flexibility to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group and select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multi-factor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vimala Ranganathan, Product Manager on Microsoft Entra, will now talk about how these new features will help in your journey toward phishing-resistant MFA.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Weinert &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>--  &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello everyone,   &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m Vimala from the Microsoft Entra PM team, and I’m excited to walk you through all the new features and enhancements to CBA in detail. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA username bindings CBA added support for three remaining username bindings and is now at parity with on-premises Active Directory. The three bindings that are being added are: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 IssuerAndSerialNumber  &nbsp; 
 IssuerAndSubject  &nbsp; 
 Subject Only  &nbsp; 
 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The username binding policy allows admins to customize how Entra ID will match the certificate being presented by the user with their user account in Entra ID. By default, we map Principal Name in the subject Alternative Name (SAN) attribute of the certificate to UserPrincipalName in the user object. An admin can override the default and create a custom mapping. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Authentication policy rules help determine the strength of authentication as either single-factor or multi-factor.&nbsp;Unlike other authentication methods available in Entra ID, which are either always, CBA is capable of being either. We like to refer to this as CBA being a multi-factor capable authentication method, and the authentication policy rules allow the admin to configure protection levels to determine when Entra ID should consider a certificate to be single-factor or multi-factor. Multiple custom authentication binding rules can be created to assign default protection level for certificates based on the certificate attributes (Issuer or Policy OID or by combining the Issuer and OID).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Affinity Binding refers to certificate attributes used for validating a certificate for user authentication. As we introduced earlier, there are several ways a certificate can be bound or matched to a user object. Some methods rely on properties of a user’s certificate that are easily reusable. This reusability characteristic is the key indicator to whether a particular user binding method is High (strong) or Low (weak) affinity. For example, implementing a user binding based on SAN Principal Name would be low affinity, whereas a user binding policy based on Issuer+SerialNumber would be high affinity. Entra ID allows admins to set affinity binding at tenant level, as well as create custom rules to use high affinity or low affinity mapping for covering many potential scenarios our customers have in use today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA as second factor will now support CBA as one of the factors to get multifactor authentication (MFA) to access Entra resources. More info at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive#mfa-with-single-factor-certificate-based-authentication">MFA with CBA</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>First factor&nbsp;</p>


<p>Second factor&nbsp;</p>


<p>MFA&nbsp;</p>




<p>CBA with single-factor strength&nbsp;</p>


<p>Passwordless Phone Sign in (PSI)&nbsp;</p>


<p>Something you have + Something you have/know&nbsp;</p>




<p>CBA with single-factor strength&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>FIDO 2&nbsp;</p>

<p>CBA (single-factor or multi-factor strength)&nbsp;</p>


<p>Something you know + Something you have&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA as Most Recently Used (MRU) method is set once a user authenticates successfully using CBA, and the user's MRU authentication method is set to CBA. Next time, when the user enters their UPN and clicks&nbsp;Next, the user is taken to the CBA method directly and need not select&nbsp;‘Use the certificate or smart card.’ To reset the MRU method, the user needs to cancel the certificate picker, click&nbsp;‘Other ways to sign in,’ and select another method available to the user and authenticate successfully.

<p>Digital wallets have emerged as a preferred payment method in the Middle East and Africa, and customers are willing to leave their wallets at home rather than their phones. Offering digital payment solutions and pursuing a digital transformation is key for banks to stay competitive.</p>
<p>On November 7, 2023, we hosted a <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/593634?utm_source=Entrust&amp;utm_medium=brighttalk&amp;utm_campaign=593634">webinar</a> with Izabela Morriss, Vice President of Global Channel Sales &amp; Tech Partnerships at CR2, and Andy Cease, Director of Product Marketing Financial Issuance at Entrust. During this engaging thought leadership discussion, we gained valuable insights into the payment preferences of cardholders in the Middle East and Africa, as well as the challenges financial institutions face in offering a digital-first customer experience.</p>
<p>Here is what we heard from them:</p>
 
 Adoption of digital payments in the Middle East and Africa 
 
 
<p>Contactless payments are rapidly gaining popularity in the Middle East and Africa. People love the convenience and speed of making payments with contactless cards and digital wallets.</p>
<p>This drive for convenience is advancing the convergence of speed and simplicity, alongside elevated security measures. Contactless payments, appreciated for their convenience and speed, are quickly gaining popularity in the Middle East and Africa. Globally, demand is also increasing, but it’s particularly flourishing in this region.</p>
<p>In a 2022 McKinsey report, 60% of global respondents said they prefer to leverage mobile wallets for their digital payments. With an 80%-90% smartphone penetration, it’s no wonder customers in the Middle East are seeking out seamless digital payment experiences (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-future-of-payments-in-the-middle-east">McKinsey, The future of payments in the Middle East, 2022</a>). Offering digital payment options is a way for banks and credit unions to answer this demand, differentiate themselves, and be perceived as modern and innovative leaders. If they don’t, they’ll be left behind and viewed as archaic and out of touch.</p>
<p>With quick and secure transactions, customers can easily pay anytime, anywhere, without the need for cash or physical cards. Digital cards are especially relevant for in-store use, but near field communication (NFC) payment from the banking app is a way of answering the need for instant and contactless digital payments.</p>
<p>Izabela from CR2 explained that they see a strong demand for customer-centric digital payment solutions. In both the Middle East and Africa, customers are showing an increasing interest in different payment solutions. They want innovative options and are looking at what is being proposed outside of the region. Customers are seeking secure, convenient, seamless digital payment experiences that align with their diverse requirements, be it for e-commerce, mobile apps, or in-store transactions. This shift highlights the urgency for banks to evolve and cater to these changing needs.</p>
<p>We see the rise of financial inclusion in Africa, characterized by its young population, is at the forefront of the continent’s mobile money transformation. This rise is underscored by a high penetration of mobile devices. Eighty four percent of internet users in Kenya used their mobile phones for payments, mirroring a similar trend where 60% of internet users in Nigeria and across Africa did the same. In 2021, East Africa reported 296 million registered mobile money accounts (<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/27017/mobile-payment-in-africa/">2021 Statista Global Consumer Survey</a>).</p>
<p>These statistics highlight the profound impact mobile payments have on driving financial inclusion, particularly in Africa where there’s a need to reach the unbanked. This trend also presents a significant marketing opportunity for financial institutions. The push toward digital payments in the Middle East and Africa is largely driven by the intent to support financial inclusion. Facilitating banking services through digital channels allows even the unbanked and underserved populations to actively participate in the financial landscape, paving the way for empowered communities and fostering economic growth. In a world where 1.4 billion individuals remain unbanked (<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services">World Bank Global Findex 2021 database</a>), the need for a significant shift is necessary.</p>
<p>In Africa, Izabela observes a market dynamic driven by the goal of reaching the unbanked population. There’s a noticeable trend of transitioning directly from mobile phone operator/money transfer services to mobile wallets, bypassing traditional physical payment cards.</p>
<p>The digital-first transformation in the Middle East stems from a demand for convenience, security, and a desire for financial institutions to provide a seamless customer journey. Mobile banking enables them to do that.</p>
 
 
 Why financial institutions want to offer contactless payments and digital card issuance 
 
 
<p>The innovation of tokenization has made digital card issuance possible. Banks want to innovate, keep their customers, and enhance convenience for their customers, ensuring satisfaction at every turn. Security is top of mind for cardholders as well as banks.</p>
<p>Izabela explains that banks in regions such as Ethiopia or Nigeria are particularly sensitive to questions of sustainability. Using tokenization for digital card issuance allows them to reduce their plastic usage, aligning with their sustainability goals.</p>
<p>The economy in Africa is still very cash-driven: 90% of transactions are made with cash (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-future-of-payments-in-africa">McKinsey, The future of payments in Africa, 2022</a>). There is a huge opportunity for banks to shift from cash-based transactions and pave the way for digital transactions. Again, this will also allow them to promote financial inclusion and transparency. Many countries have not fully adopted the physical payment card, and they are expected to skip the issuance of physical cards and directly adopt digital cards. Banks must be ready for this change. Izabela expects that digital wallets will dominate the payment landscape within the next two years. Several African central banks, such as those in Rwanda and Nigeria, are driving a vision of a cashless economy.</p>
<p>Differences in demand can be observed across diverse age groups. However, banks recognize that to stay competitive, they must offer very targeted, personalized customer journeys that cater to the varying demands of all demographics. Offering more capabilities within the mobile banking app ensures that it is at the core of the bank-customer relationship.</p>
<p>Banks can expect increased usage of their card portfolio, earlier activations, and broader outreach to diverse demographics, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction. Additionally, cost-saving incentives serve as an important motivator compelling financial institutions to provide digital payment solutions.</p>
<p>Moreover, traditional banks are increasingly feeling the competitive pressure from emerging players like neobanks, which continue to obtain banking licenses, compelling traditional institutions to remain relevant.</p>
 
 
 Challenges for banks to implement this 
 
 
<p>Answering the very diverse demands of cardholders has been made possible by innovations in the payment space during the last few years.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, security is top of mind, both for financial institutions and cardholders. Tokenized cards offer the highest level of security when it comes to payments. Andy from Entrust explained that tokenization enables the consumer to take control again, as the tokens are device-bound or market-bound, offering cardholders a very convenient experience. Tokenization technology, championed by major schemes like Visa and Mastercard, is a necessary prerequisite for the issuance of digital cards. To give a quick explanation: Tokenization substitutes sensitive card data with unique tokens tied to specific devices and use cases. This ensures secure transactions while enabling banks to minimize the risk of fraud. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/tokenization-enabling-the-intersection-of-data-security-and-exceptional-user-experiences/">This article</a> explains the functioning and value of tokenization more in detail.</p>
<p>And of course, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/entrust-digital-card-solution">digital card issuance</a> allows financial institutions to offer a digital-first user and payment experience.</p>
<p>While banks in the Middle East and Africa now want to take active steps toward a digital transformation, they also realize that it is not as simple as it may seem. They want to be innovative, but do not know where to start. Most banks struggle to combine a seamless, digital-first, innovative payment experience with the highest level of security, while keeping integration and maintenance of such a solution lightweight.</p>
<p>Izabela notes that most banks are starting to have a good understanding of tokenization; current operational discussions are around identifying the correct next steps and implementing technology for the benefit of the cardholder. Addressing legacy technology and infrastructure presents a significant challenge for banks. How can they leverage their existing resources to enable a digital wallet effectively? What role does the card management system play? Which tokenization partner should they choose? How can the digital wallet be embedded within the existing banking application?</p>
 
 
 Technology alliance partnership between CR2 and Entrust 
 
 
<p>We know that the digital revolution is here, and that banks need to transform their service model to meet the expectations for convenient banking that offers anywhere, anytime access. This is especially true in the Middle East and Africa. To resolve those challenges together, CR2 and Entrust have forged a partnership. The technology alliance between CR2 and Entrust gives CR2 customers confidence in the security of their digital payments while also providing user-friendly, seamless digital-first experiences.</p>
<p>By partnering with Entrust, CR2 leverages Entrust’s tokenization for NFC payment solutions, providing a fully comprehensive digital payments offering. Together, CR2 and Entrust empower banks to deliver secure digital payment experiences to their cardholders. This partnership delivers a solution that caters to both current and emerging needs of banks and their customers.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar: Is this the right time to invest in Identity and Access Management? This week Jesse Kurtto from Ubisecure has joined us to answer this question and discuss the current economic situation. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar: Today’s guest is Jesse Kurtto. Jesse’s career has gradually arched from the Wild West world of finance, to his current position as a Data Protection Officer and Data Scientist at Ubisecure. Learning Program before learning to read Finnish and visiting 25 countries before 25. He is no stranger to exploring unchartered waters and discovering connections that others might miss. Surrounded by a delicate balance of the latest technology and dozens of carefully tended houseplants, his secret hobby is writing to his beloved snail mail friends across the world. Welcome Jesse.</p>
<p>Jesse: Thank you for the invite, Oscar. Nice to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great having you, Jesse, definitely. We’re going to have a super interesting conversation about the market in Digital Identity and Identity and Access Management.</p>
<p>First of all, we always want to hear more about our guests. So please tell us a bit about yourself and your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Jesse: All right. So, like many or even most of us in the digital identity field, I actually never really actively sought to be a specialist, IAM specialist, on purpose. And my personal background is actually nothing technology even, but in finance and investing more specifically. So, a chance encounter and I liked the people who interviewed me and decided to stay for a while, and that while has been over seven years now. And I’m still learning something new every day, checking out how we really the world of digital identity like and frankly haven’t ever regretted decision. No two days have really been the same and the field continues to evolve and develop quite a bit every year.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent and definitely hearing at Ubisecure, we definitely appreciate having this – well call it, like a blend of knowledge – the financial market, not lesser than what you bring with the security and digital identity knowledge, very practical knowledge you also had. So, it’s always super interesting having those conversation with you.</p>
<p>And for the first time here on the podcast, we are going to have that, a bit more financial touch on that – What is coming, especially in this well this year, and I think also the years to come. The previous year and the year to come I think, we are already end of 2023 in which – well the financial situation is not good we’re going to talk about. But of course, no matter how the economy is, the companies organisation has to protect their services, have to upgrade the services, maintain them, so they have to invest some money in that.</p>
<p>So, from the perspective of companies who today need to upgrade their digital capabilities, what would you say is the piece of the current macroeconomic situation that they should know well? So that was at least what they should know well, from what is happening now?</p>
<p>Jesse: Well, first of all, we all know the macroeconomic situation hasn’t really been dancing on the roses over the past few years. But first, we had a massive shock with the COVID pandemic starting from spring 2020. Then we got massive economic stimulus to recover from that slump. And right after we were starting to climb up, then the war in Ukraine saw that all kinds of new problems everywhere around the world seemed to emerge just within three or four months.</p>
<p>The energy uncertainty in Europe and the economy went down the drain, and macroeconomic in quite a difficult situation here in Europe. But we would actually want to have some kind of stimulus in order to recover. But at the same time, we are suffering from quite persistently high inflation, which makes any kind of stimulus package basically equal to pouring more gasoline to the flames.</p>
<p>So, the European bank is really between a rock and a hard place here. And I can only look over the Atlantic to the States and be very jealous how they are able to both fight inflation and with high interest rates, five and a half percent this talking and meanwhile still have a blisteringly red-hot labour market all but there.</p>
<p>So, my first point would be that not all markets are equal. And the second important point is that now is actually a really great time to invest in any digital capabilities, including digital identities. Because now, we are in the middle of a small recession in Europe and investing in recession has historically been the very best time to invest in growth.</p>
<p>And if we think for a while, it actually makes perfect sense. After all, the alternative is to invest in the middle of a growth season when everybody else wants to invest in growth as well. Pushing prices even higher and reducing the availability of experts to help with these transformation projects. But now it’s still for a while kind of a buyer’s market.</p>
<p>So best time to invest in future growth is now.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, time to invest is now.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay. So, let’s go into what – because there are many things that the company can invest now and many things that many companies might need. But if you were one of the – chief executive, like CISO, or someone who is top decision makers in companies and there has to be some budget for digital identity. Thinking of – first of all broadly. Broadly but in digital identity, what would be the most important products that today would be the top priority for buying now?</p>
<p>Jesse: Today I would say that the absolute top priority would be – to establish really low friction user journeys from the very beginning account registration to the actual purchase, including solid online self-service. And now this low friction user journey is no way exclusive with security or compliance, but it is actually reaping the benefits of digitalisation. Digitalisation is ongoing, it’s accelerating, it’s unstoppable.</p>
<p>So, the question is for every organisation – should they try to fight this change to the last or embrace it and be among the first to actually reap its benefits. It’s actually interesting because my background in finance, the many finance sector operators were among the first to embrace digital identities, but they kind of stopped it halfway there; “Okay, we can build self-service portals for our users, but for many, many procedures we still require hand signed paper documents being sent via physical mail.” And this is really only reaping a very small part of the benefits of digitalisation. So, there is plenty to go.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Interesting what you say in finance services. That’s correct. For reasons of security had to be always in the latest of technology for security. But some of the process has been, as you say, very old fashioned like the old school, many paper fax I think still use or cheques. So, these kind of.</p>
<p>Jesse: Oh yes, those ones to.</p>
<p>Oscar: Still alive.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And it truly hurts the user experience a lot. It even causes direct missed opportunities. Let’s say new bond is coming to a market and you wish to buy a piece of it and participate. But if it takes three or four days just to do all the paperwork, then the opportunity has simply passed.</p>
<p>Oscar: And indeed, the price changed completely. Okay, so you say that the top is to – the user journey has to be digitalised. So, what is the category of products that address that?</p>
<p>Jesse: Would say a real CIAM system would be the one to go here, and not try to build the user journey from, let’s say 4 to 6-point solutions and then somehow glue them together. I think the best solution would be an IAM solution that’s designed for a whole user journey from the scratch and not something homemade or batched together.</p>
<p>Because when business grows, as it will eventually grow, no recession will last forever. And to user numbers pick up and suddenly there’s a nightmare of issues of having 4 to 6 different vendors and trying to keep their products up and running with ever increasing user numbers. And that again, is doing digitalisation the wrong way, if I may say.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. CIAM being – so how, well the evolution of the more broadly speaking, Identity and Access Management. Maybe you can give us an overview of that evolution of the Identity and Access Management, what – how we started and what we have today.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yeah, that’s a very interesting topic. Through the IAM are from big enterprise internal needs at once to employee numbers just grow to a certain level, they can’t be managed with excel sheets or pen and paper before that. But these kind of internal IAM solutions scale and fit really badly for end customer facing journeys. Internal users can always be taught how to use some kind of system, even if it’s not immediately logical or it feels unwieldy.</p>
<p>But for the customers, it’s not realistic to expect that they would spend tens of minutes or even hours to learn how to use some kind of system to log in. And no, they would simply instead put down their laptops, pick up the phone and call your customer service. So, it will actually just cost you more money to have this kind of system.</p>
<p>And now, in the past ten years, there have been massive uptake of different CIAM systems. And lately, let’s say after the pandemic, it’s interesting to see that now the full circle is coming back towards internal users with remote working. Remote working, different kind of partnerships, there are more kind of internal and kind of external users than ever, and trying to keep these as fully separate groups is very challenging.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. So, what about the investment of a company in Identity and Access Management? So what does that imply if the company does not have even, let’s say, a first personal CIAM or open source, something that they started, if they if the company really doesn’t, which actually to me surprise me that, you discover companies don’t have it, don’t have it, almost anything like identity access management and they are looking for some solutions or they are or they know that they need it. Maybe the decision has not come.</p>
<p>So why would you say is important for the buyers to know about the product, the Identity and Access Management product?</p>
<p>Jesse: That’s an interesting detail what you said that there’s still about 20-25% of companies in Europe that do not have any kind of Identity and Access Management system in place. So, one could argue that every IAM’s companies’ worst competitor is doing nothing. But to the question at hand, I’d say scalability is one very important thing, and compliance. If one doesn’t have any kind of identity management system in place, then it’s extremely hard to tell where and by who are the user identities actually stored.</p>
<p>And of course, that is a massive no in the eyes of the GDPR and this kind of adventures just don’t usually end up well. So first job would be to map out how many identities there are in the first place, how it has evolved over the recent quarters and where they are located, how many systems actually are connected, including partners, including systems like let’s say payroll providers, insurance providers, and usually the number is quite surprising. It can often be more than ten individual systems.</p>
<p>And now managing all these identities from a single centralised place is frankly a godsend compared to trying to manage this and plus sprawling network identity some here, some there. And of course, it also brings centralised identity management, also brings massive security benefits. For example, if you wish to revoke the access for, let’s say some external consultants that have already finished their projects, you only have one place to do it or you can even automate it.</p>
<p>But if the identities are in ten systems, 15 systems, then it’s really easy to forget just one. And who knows, maybe five, ten years later, one of those passwords will get breached and now the attacker gets to your system for free.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, what is normally called silos, identity silos. Having so many data repositories and it’s -through the years it’s easy to forget at least couple of those are forgotten but they are still there somewhere in there in some machine, in some server. So, the data is there.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And of course, I’ve heard many times the counterargument that it’s not wise to put all eggs in one basket, but when it comes to information security, we as the defenders must secure every single system that we use. But the attacker only needs to find one weak system to exploit.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, exactly. They can just find the forgotten one, the one that nobody remembers that.</p>
<p>So, what the company – the buyers should ask for a technology vendor? So, for a CIAM vendor? So, what are the most important things that’s should be – has to be asked to the vendors?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would ask them to demonstrate the self-service capabilities first. What exactly the users can and cannot accept less without external help? Meaning customer service assistance. Because that sets quite stringent limits on the benefits of digitalisation. And of course, all the usual user journeys should be handled by the system automatically. So, I would guess that any IAM project touches deeply.</p>
<p>So, I would first describe the challenges we are facing. And then I’d ask vendor to explain, just in plain English, that – how does the solution work and how does it actually solve the challenge that we just presented? And after all, one should never invest in anything that one doesn’t understand.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to address early in any IAM project is to what is actually included in the price and what isn’t. In order to actually accurately measure the TCO and how it would evolve as internal and external user base grows. And for example, there are many vendors out that charge ten to even hundred times for internal users compared to external users, and that’s not usually put on a large print on the front page.</p>
<p>And finally, I would discuss any coming changes in legislation because I would be very interested to know whether any changes will be covered under the current proposal or will it occur additional project and additional costs in the future. Change is, after all, inevitable.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think that’s very important. We know in – in the European Union it’s coming the digital wallet that’s going to come in. Well, how many years do you predict at this moment?</p>
<p>Jesse: I’m optimistic and say late ‘24 launch for some countries. ‘25 mass adoption and hopefully organisational identities soon after.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and that’s something that I think very few people would argue that that will be – that will not have some considerable success because there’s a lot of time invested in people preparing all these new standards in this part of the evolution. What we have been seeing before with Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), the wallet itself is something that is already becoming very popular in the commercial side. So that will come in.</p>
<p>Similarly, in other geographies, there will be similar initiatives, there will be new regulations. So that, through all this, the vendor has to offer that, has to tell whether we offer or not. So that’s definitely a good, good aspect you mentioned.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And the commission has made clear goals here to avoid repeating the mistakes of the eIDAS 1.0, that was supposed to bring cross-border digital identities to Europe. Well, we all know that it was a commercial failure, but they have really learned from that, and I have great hopes for the EUDI. Both for personal identities and for organisational identities, and especially for the latter one.</p>
<p>I believe that the market is currently suffering from a kind of chicken and egg problem here, that everybody’s waiting for cross-border organisational identities and not building services because they aren’t here yet. So, we might see the floodgates open in the late 2020s.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. I also believe that as a lot will change in more or less like the, as you say in the next 12-24 months is going to change a lot, in a good way I believe. So definitely exciting to be at this moment. We’ve been talking a lot about Identity and Access Management, other aspects, other type of technology that are also in the minds of the executives who are going to upgrade their technologies. We hear a lot about passwords in the last year. Well, ‘cryptocurrencies’ is getting a bit more quiet. Today we hear a lot about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Would you recognise some technology that is actually underrated, that not many people are talking about? But these business buyers should be aware, because the impact will be even bigger than those buzzwords. So, what would you say?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would say that the coming EUDI and its principle of Self-Sovereign Identities is something that might cause quite big ripples in the identity landscape. The very basic idea that it’s the end user themselves who collect attributes and control to whom and when they release those attributes. That that is very different from the usual data repository centric view that – okay, we have this database, and we control everything here. Everything is set in stone.</p>
<p>But when the end users actually decide which attributes to release and which not. Then one can’t take for granted that, “Okay, we always have every single field in our database field. Every user record looks similar in a structural level.” That is no longer true and that might cause some changes.</p>
<p>As for technology, I have great hopes for machine learning and especially how it can help accomplish not zero trust, no. But zero friction user journeys. And I don’t mean a strong AI that is still decades into future, if ever. But simple things like; is the user using a different device to log in or the same device as before? And so on.</p>
<p>For example, I have a recently having a quick holiday in the US, and I was frankly quite shocked when I logged into some financial services – using a completely different device that I had never used, on completely opposite time of the day. I was even physically located on a different continent. And no MFA prompts, nothing. Just inputting my password, I was in.</p>
<p>And that’s a lot of missed risk management there, for both parties. For me as an end user and for the financial service provider. And I believe this is something that will change sooner or later. And of course, I would like, as an end user, for this to work for the opposite way as well. That if I’m logging in using the same device, about the same time of the day, from same city that I’ve done it for hundreds and hundreds of times – then perhaps I could be spared the MFA fatigue and just get in with my password managers embraced password.</p>
<p>Oscar: The technology doesn’t bother you when you are in the habitual way of interacting with, let’s say, the banks.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yeah, exactly. It should take always the context of the transaction into account. And frankly, what I would like to see many companies to do is; do a more thorough risk analysis at what they are actually trying to defend against. I can give a real-world example.</p>
<p>About a month ago, I drove to a gas station, put my car to charge, decided that I’ll have a coffee there. Opened the app and saw, hey, there’s an offer for a coffee and a doughnut €1 off. Great.</p>
<p>Okay, it seems that first, I needed to update the app to actually buy. Okay, well, I’ll do it.</p>
<p>Then they wanted to add the credit card directly to the app, alright. Got an MFA from that.</p>
<p>Then when I actually wanted to make the purchase, I got yet another prompt and confirmation, this time from my bank. That – ‘Hey, in order to buy this €3.50 product, would you please update our app again, and use it as an MFA to confirm this purchase’. For the third time.</p>
<p>And by that time, I already got notification that, ‘hey, your car has charged’, and my coffee was called by then and left it there.</p>
<p>So that was the opposite of Zero Friction. That was more of a zero trust like game. But the security solution that’s very fitting for, let’s say, authorising nuclear missile launch, is very different than the security that’s needed to confirm a €3 coffee purchased at the gas station.</p>
<p>And as discussed earlier, I believe this problem stems – that solution was built from very small parts and every individual vendor only looked after their own interest, only want to save their back in case of any kind of misuse. But nobody took a step backwards to actually see; What we are trying to defend against here? What is the attack vector here? That okay, somebody misuses this app and clones this coupon and gets two coffees and doughnuts for a €3 each. Okay, so how much is an attacker willing to put time and money into such attack? I guess nobody stop to think about it. And as a result, the whole user journey was just failure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, complete failure indeed. Very good way to bring back the very first thing you said, User Journey. Yeah, that’s a specific example how things can happen. Sounds like a marvellous opportunity, not to get a deal nice and then becomes complete failure.</p>
<p>Jesse, one final question I would like to ask you is – for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would dream that every executive would dedicate one day, one whole day to actually be an end user for a day and go through their company’s entire flow. All the way from account registration to actually purchasing to product or service that they’re selling. And if there’s time trying out things like forgotten password resets. And then the next day repeating the same procedure for the top competitor and even more importantly, their newest competitor, because that is where the threat of digitalisation is coming.</p>
<p>Oscar: Going to be very revealing.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes, and it’s important to go through the entire journey. If one, simply takes it piecemeal. And of course, every piece may look perfectly fine. Okay, this works like this. It has confirmations like this. Great. Next piece. Next piece, Next piece. All right. Everything looks fine. But then actually going through the process, one gets hit by four or five different confirmations, forced updates, all kinds of non-user-friendly things, and that won’t fly.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely a very good experiment, actionable idea. Absolutely. Well, thank you very much, Jesse for telling us all this about the – how the companies and why companies should invest in the digital identity and why today.</p>
<p>Let us know why people would like to get in touch with you or follow you or learn more about what we are doing. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Jesse: All right. Thank you. First, I would ask everybody to check out <a href="http://www.ubisecure.com/" title="ubisecure.com">ubisecure.com</a>, and see how we are approaching these problems on the market.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>With our first speakers release, we are letting loose four tech experts from the finance industry. Despite some of the industry-specific challenges, IAM and cybersecurity professionals from finance can offer valuable insights and lessons learned that can be translated to other sectors seeking to enhance their identity and access management practices.</p>
<p>The relevance of identity management in finance</p>
<p>Identity management is integral to financial services for various reasons. Robust systems enhance security by verifying and authenticating user identities, employing methods like multi-factor authentication and biometrics to prevent unauthorized access and reduce fraud. Compliance with regulatory requirements, such as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (anti-money laundering), is ensured through effective identity management.</p>
<p>Building customer trust is another crucial aspect, because secure identities foster confidence in engaging with digital financial services. Personalized offerings based on accurate customer data, operational efficiency, and streamlined transactions are facilitated by sound identity management practices. In the context of digital transformation, identity management is foundational for seamless and secure digital experiences, including online banking and mobile payments.</p>
<p>Risk management benefits from effective identity verification, helping to identify and mitigate potential risks. Furthermore, in the globalized financial landscape, proper identity management supports cross-border transactions by ensuring compliance with international regulations and standards, fostering trust in transactions across different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In summary, identity management in financial services is not just about verifying who someone is; it's a fundamental aspect of ensuring security, compliance, and efficiency in an increasingly digital and interconnected financial world.</p>

 COVID-19 Test data leak: Strengthening data security with decentralized identity and verifiable digital credentials <p>Without sensationalizing the recent breach that claims to have leaked the data of millions of citizens, this blog delves into what a perfect future can safeguard from such breaches.</p><p>In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, concerns over data breaches and identity theft have reached alarming levels, exemplified by the recently claimed leak of COVID-19 test information of approximately 81.5 crore Indian citizens online. This incident underscores the pressing need for robust solutions to safeguard sensitive and personally identifiable information.</p><blockquote>In this blog post, we will explore the technologies currently employed to protect centralized data, the methods hackers use to breach these technologies, and how decentralized identity or Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) offer a promising solution to prevent such data breaches.</blockquote><p>The Breach Unveiled:</p><p>The breach, orchestrated by an entity known as ‘pwn001,’ claims to have exposed sensitive data sourced from the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) database. As we get to know from the <a href="https://www.news18.com/india/indias-biggest-data-leak-so-far-covid-19-test-info-of-81-5cr-citizens-with-icmr-up-for-sale-exclusive-8637743.html">News 18 Report</a>, this leaked data included Aadhaar and passport numbers, names, phone numbers, and addresses, highlighting the magnitude of the incident.</p><p>Centralized Data — A Honey&nbsp;Pot?:</p><p>Central agencies such as the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) employ several cutting-edge technologies to protect citizen data. Encryption, multi-factor authentication, access control, and regular security assessments are among the strategies in place. However, all this data is centrally stored. Despite these measures, hackers continue to find ways to breach these defenses, particularly in safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII). Cybercriminals, armed with social engineering tactics and insider information, persistently exploit vulnerabilities in existing security systems. These challenges necessitate innovative solutions to ensure comprehensive data protection.</p><p>How Hackers Breach Current Security Measures:</p><p>In the ever-evolving digital landscape, hackers employ a variety of techniques to breach existing security protocols, posing a significant threat to sensitive data like citizen information. One common method involves Exploiting Vulnerabilities, where cybercriminals target weaknesses in software, networks, or user behavior. Systems left unpatched or outdated software become vulnerable entry points, granting unauthorized access to malicious actors. Another prevalent tactic is Social Engineering, which encompasses phishing attacks and manipulative strategies to deceive individuals into revealing confidential information, including login credentials. By exploiting human psychology and trust, hackers sidestep security measures, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data. Moreover, Insider Threats present an internal challenge, as employees or contractors with access to Aadhaar data may misuse their privileges intentionally, leading to detrimental data breaches from within organizational boundaries.</p><p>Safeguarding COVID Vaccination Data: A Decentralized Identity&nbsp;Approach</p><p>The vulnerabilities inherent in centralized databases that house COVID-19 vaccination information have become increasingly evident. To enhance the security of vaccination certificates and mitigate the risks associated with centralized systems, a decentralized identity solution is imperative. Notably, centralized databases like the one employed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) are susceptible to substantial data breaches, putting the privacy of millions at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Proposed Solution:</p><p>Implement a system wherein unique Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are assigned to individuals, securely anchored on a blockchain. Acting as an issuer, pathology entities provide Verifiable Credentials for COVID vaccinations to individual DIDs. These digital Verifiable Credentials are stored in decentralized identity wallets, containing specific vaccination details. Grant individuals control over their Verifiable Credentials, empowering them to selectively share information. Facilitate selective disclosure through Verifiable Presentations, enabling individuals to share pertinent details as required.</p><p>Leverage blockchain technology to anchor DIDs and store decentralized identity transactions, ensuring data immutability. Incorporate zero-knowledge proofs for privacy, allowing for proof of vaccination without unnecessary data exposure. Distribute data across a decentralized network to effectively mitigate the risk of large-scale breaches. This comprehensive approach aims to establish a robust and secure framework for managing COVID-19 vaccination information, safeguarding individual privacy and data integrity.</p><p>The Promise of Decentralized Identity and SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity):</p><p>Addressing these sophisticated threats requires a proactive approach. Since hackers innovate new ways to exploit vulnerabilities, it is the need of the hour for Data Controllers to also explore new ways and innovative solutions to safeguard such&nbsp;data.</p><p>Exploring innovative security solutions, such as Decentralized Identity and <a href="https://ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>, becomes crucial. These advanced technologies empower individuals, enhance control over personal data, and significantly mitigate the risks associated with vulnerabilities, social engineering, and insider threats. These technologies present a paradigm shift in the following ways:</p>  User-Centric Security: Decentralized Identity and SSI prioritize user empowerment, allowing individuals to take control of their own digital identities and personally identifiable information (PII). Users can manage their data, granting or revoking access as needed, thus enhancing privacy and consent management.  Immutable Blockchain Technology: Leveraging blockchain, these solutions ensure data integrity and immutability. By recording transactions in a tamper-proof ledger, the authenticity of user identities is preserved, mitigating the risk of unauthorized alterations and ensuring the credibility of stored information.  Eliminating Centralized Vulnerabilities: Unlike conventional systems reliant on centralized databases, Decentralized Identity and SSI distribute identity information across a decentralized network. This decentralization significantly reduces the appeal of data breaches for malicious actors. Hacking into a single centralized repository becomes virtually futile, enhancing overall security for stored personally identifiable information (PII). Further extending to this, Decentralized Identity or SSI uses state-of-the-art cryptography to encrypt the data at rest and data in flight, resulting in a significant reduction in data breaches.  <p>Conclusion:</p><p>The recent data breach incident highlights the urgent need for advanced solutions in safeguarding data privacy.

<p>In today’s digital age, online authentication has become increasingly challenging. Traditional passwords have proven to be inefficient and under constant cyber-attacks. However, today we have a new way to manage our authentication: self-sovereign identity (SSI). SSI is a model that enables authentication by empowering users by giving them full control over their digital identity.</p>



<p>In this article, we will explore how self-sovereign identity will redefine online authentication, providing a much more secure and efficient solution for protecting our data and privacy in an increasingly digital world.</p>



 The problem with traditional passwords and centralized databases 



<p>One of the main problems with traditional passwords lies in the fact that they are stored in centralized databases. This poses a significant risk because, if an attacker gains access to this database, they can easily obtain the passwords of multiple users.<br>Over the years, we have witnessed many, many cases where centralized databases have been hacked and millions of users’ passwords and private data stolen. </p>



<p>These cyber attacks have exposed the inherent vulnerability of this system. Even if users choose strong and unique passwords, if the central databases do not have adequate security measures in place, they may still be vulnerable to hacking.</p>



<p>In addition, these security measures to protect centralized databases are becoming more and more costly, as attack techniques are becoming more refined, more efficient and more difficult to prevent. If we add to this the explosion of artificial intelligence that we are experiencing, it will soon be almost unfeasible to prevent cyber attacks and fraud on the Internet.</p>



 Self-Sovereign Identity as a method of authentication 



<p>Self-sovereign identity is a revolutionary approach to online authentication that puts privacy and security at the center of its design. Instead of relying on centralized third parties, such as companies or government institutions, self-sovereign identity gives individuals full control over their digital identity. It uses decentralized technologies such as blockchain to provide a secure and trusted system.</p>



<p>In a self-sovereign identity system, users have the ability to create, own and manage their own digital identity. This involves the generation of unique cryptographic keys that are used to sign and verify transactions. These cryptographic keys are stored in a personal digital wallet, which is protected with a strong password or even biometrics.</p>



 Benefits of self-sovereign identity (SSI) 



<p>Self-sovereign identity offers a number of benefits compared to traditional passwords and other authentication systems. </p>



 Some of these benefits include: 



 
 Increased security: by decentralizing identity control, the possibility of cyber attacks is significantly reduced. Cryptographic keys and blockchain technology provide an additional level of security. 



 Enhanced privacy: With self-sovereign identity, users have the power to share only the information needed for each online interaction, without revealing more personal data than necessary. 



 Elimination of passwords: By using cryptographic keys, self-sovereign identity eliminates the need for traditional passwords, which not only reduces the possibility of theft and password-based attacks, but also vastly improves the user experience. 



 Increased convenience: Self-sovereign identity simplifies the authentication process by allowing users to access multiple online services with a single identity, eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords. 
 



 The future of authentication with SSI 



<p>Self-sovereign identity is a promising approach that is redefining the way we authenticate online. By giving individuals full control over their digital identity and eliminating the reliance on traditional passwords, self-sovereign identity offers a more secure, private and convenient solution. While there are still challenges to overcome, the potential of self-sovereign identity to transform online authentication is clear.</p>

 Why DeSci is the new big scientific approach of Web3 



 First at all: What is Decentralized Science: 



<p>Decentralized Science (DeSci)&nbsp;is a new approach to scientific research that utilizes decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks, to facilitate collaboration and data sharing among scientists. The goal of decentralized science is to create a more open and transparent scientific process that allows for the free exchange of ideas and data, and to ensure that the research is conducted in a fair and impartial manner.</p>



 Main benefits and advantages of DeSci: 



<p>One of the key benefits of decentralized science is that it allows for greater collaboration among scientists from different institutions and countries. Traditional scientific research often relies on centralized institutions, such as universities and research labs, which can create barriers to collaboration and data sharing. By using decentralized technologies, scientists can collaborate and share data in a more seamless and efficient manner, regardless of their location or affiliation.</p>



<p>Another advantage of decentralized science is that it can help to reduce the risk of scientific misconduct, such as data fabrication or plagiarism. With decentralized technologies, it is easier to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. This can help to increase the integrity and reliability of scientific research.</p>



<p>Decentralized science also has the potential to democratize the scientific process by making it more accessible to a wider range of researchers. For example, scientists in developing countries may not have access to the same resources and funding as those in developed countries. With decentralized technologies, these researchers can more easily collaborate with their counterparts around the world and contribute to the scientific community.</p>



DeSci – Decentralized Science



 More benefits and challeges for Decentralized Science implementation 



<p>There are already several projects that are utilizing decentralized technologies to facilitate scientific research. For example, the Open Science Chain is a blockchain-based platform that allows scientists to share data and collaborate on research projects. The platform also provides a decentralized repository for scientific data, which can be accessed by researchers around the world.</p>



<p>Despite the potential benefits of decentralized science, there are also some challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the issue of trust. With traditional scientific research, scientists rely on established institutions and peer review processes to ensure the reliability of research. With decentralized science, it may be more difficult to establish trust in the research process.</p>



<p>Another challenge is the issue of data security. Decentralized technologies, such as blockchain, can provide a high level of security, but there is still the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks. Scientists will need to take steps to ensure that their data is protected and secure when using decentralized technologies.</p>



 Some cases of DeSci in the real life: 



<p>There are several examples of decentralized science projects that are utilizing decentralized technologies to facilitate scientific research. Some examples include:</p>



 
 Open Science Chain: This is a blockchain-based platform that allows scientists to share data and collaborate on research projects. The platform also provides a decentralized repository for scientific data, which can be accessed by researchers around the world. 



 Science Token: This is a platform that uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized marketplace for scientific research. Scientists can use the platform to fund their research projects and to receive rewards for their contributions. 



 DataCoin: This is a decentralized platform that allows scientists to share data and collaborate on research projects. The platform uses blockchain technology to ensure the security and integrity of the data. 



 Researchpool: This is a decentralized platform that connects researchers with funding sources and allows them to share data and collaborate on research projects. The platform uses blockchain technology to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 



 Zencity: This is a decentralized platform that allows scientists to collaborate on research projects and to share data in a secure and transparent manner. The platform uses blockchain technology to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 
 



 DeSci future potential and importance: 



<p>Decentralized science has the potential to revolutionize the way that scientific research is conducted. DeSci utilizes decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks, to facilitate collaboration and data sharing among scientists. Some of the reasons why DeSci is important include:</p>



 
 Increased collaboration: DeSci allows for greater collaboration among scientists from different institutions and countries. This can lead to faster and more impactful research, as scientists can more easily share ideas and data. 



 Increased transparency: DeSci can create a more open and transparent scientific process by making it easier to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 



 Greater accessibility: DeSci can democratize the scientific process by making it more accessible to a wider range of researchers. For example, scientists in developing countries may not have access to the same resources and funding as those in developed countries. DeSci can help to level the playing field and allow these researchers to more easily collaborate with their counterparts around the world. 



 Reduced risk of scientific misconduct: DeSci can help to reduce the risk of scientific misconduct, such as data fabrication or plagiarism, by making it easier to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 
 



 Overall 



<p>DeSci has the potential to significantly improve the way that scientific research is conducted, leading to faster and more impactful research that benefits society as a whole.</p>



<p>However, there are also challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure the success of decentralized science.</p>

 Let’s talk about Optimistics &amp; ZK-Rollups 



 But first: What Rollup&nbsp;Mean: 



<p>If you are familiar and have been moving for a while in the environment of decentralized technologies, blockchain, crypto, and especially if you are involved in the Ethereum ecosystem and have heard about the recent Merge that the Blockchain did, it is very likely that you have heard about the concept of rollups. But almost certainly also, we said “Oh no, yet another term I have to learn…”. Well, here we are to help you understand it fast, easy and on time so you look like a genius at the meeting with your friends. Here we go:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A rollup is a type of scaling solution that works by executing transactions outside of Layer 1 but posting transaction data on Layer 1.</p>
</blockquote>



 But…Why Rollups? 



<p>First things first. We must understand that blockchains, like Ethereum, can be slow and expensive because the higher the demand, the higher the fee to pay. Having to spend several extra dollars in gas fee, for a single transaction. This in DeFi is a major drawback.</p>



<p>This is where the need for layer 2’s like rollups is born. So, we could say that, rollups process the transactions from layer 1, in another faster blockchain, layer 2. Well, in this system, after processing the information, the transaction data is carried back to layer 1 (mainnet), but at a fraction of the price. In short, this means that we save the waiting time and processing cost of the mainnet. Therefore, and very importantly, users can benefit from the speed and low cost of the rollup, but without giving up the security of the layer 1 blockchain.</p>



 Rollups and the Ethereum scalability solution 



<p>Rollups are one of several scaling systems, which are nothing more than methods to make a slow blockchain faster and cheaper. Other scaling systems are sidechains and stateful channels.</p>



<p>Most scaling products are specifically related to Ethereum, as it is the largest blockchain with smart contracts developed on it. In the recent Merge (successfully completed in September of this year), Ethereum’s main developers sought to improve the speed and costs of the blockchain with a series of updates. These updates will not necessarily diminish the importance of scaling solutions. On the contrary, scaling solutions are likely to complement Ethereum’s updates, so they are not going away.</p>



<p>Read also:&nbsp;<a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/ethereum-the-merge/">Ethereum: The Merge is coming</a></p>



 What&nbsp;types of rollups&nbsp;are there? 



<p>We could say that there are mainly two types of rollups, Optimistic and Zero Knowledge (ZK). Both, as we said, decrease transaction costs and waiting time. This works in such a way that, instead of waiting for the processing of each particular transaction in Ethereum (for example), several tens of transactions are recorded in layer 2, and then “rolled up” into a single transaction, which then returns as a packet to layer 1 or main blockchain. As you might guess, by returning like this, the cost of that transaction is divided among many users who have their transaction in that “rolled up” packet.</p>



 
 Optimistic Rollups:It is called Optimistic because it is optimistically assumed that all transactions contained in the rollup are valid. Therefore, in these types of rollups, users are given a certain number of days to challenge fraudulent transactions.Because they are all assumed to be correct, processing is faster because the network does not have to waste time confirming things. The disadvantage is that it takes about a week (the time given to dispute the transaction), to officially withdraw your funds from an Optimistic Rollups, as in the well-known Arbirtrum or Optimism. 



 ZK-rollups:ZK-rollups or Zero-Knowledge Rollups&nbsp;use&nbsp;Zero Knowledge Proof&nbsp;to cryptographically determine if a transaction is valid, using only a minimum of information about that transaction.<br>This is an off-chain protocol that operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is managed by on-chain Ethereum smart contracts.<br>As we have seen in other articles, Zero Knowledge Proof, or ZKP, is a privacy-preserving, fast and inexpensive method.<br>Compared to an optimistic rollup, which requires the funds to remain in the network until the dispute resolution or challenge period closes, ZK-rollups allow users to withdraw their funds without so much delay.<br>We can say then, that ZK rollups have an advantage in terms of speed and security over Optimistic rollups. But not everything is so easy, ZK-rollups are more complex in their application and type of technology. 
 



<p>For now, ZK-rollups are used for specific functions or applications. One of the major use cases of these rollups, and the most seen, is the exchange of non-fungible tokens or the transfer of cryptography between addresses.</p>



<p>Read also:&nbsp;<a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/zero-knowledge-proof-and-self-sovereign-identity/">Zero Knowledge Proof and Self Sovereign Identity</a></p>



<p>But there are many advances we see in this area, and many teams are looking to develop tools linked to ZK-rollups. For example Polygon, Scroll and Matter Labs are working on their&nbsp;zkEVMs, which is a ZK-rollup that works identically to Ethereum’s mainnet. The idea then, is that these rollups can support any kind of applications that users want to develop on that layer 2.</p>



 What are the&nbsp;dangers of rollups? 



<p>We have to take into account some security considerations. And is that, while they take many of the security features of Ethereum, not everything is equal.</p>



<p>First of all, we have to take into account that being tools that are in their initial stage, the networks in which they operate are usually still somewhat centralized as there is a development team that maintains partial control, being able to have certain decisions such as turning on and off the network as they deem necessary.</p>



<p>Smart contracts in a rollup is not as finicky as that of a program developed in Ethereum. It may contain bugs because although there are audits and reviews to improve these bugs, if we rely on an external program to manage the transactions that go through the rollup, we can expect certain risks.</p>



<p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that some rollups also still use centralized “sequencers” to successfully coordinate transactions on the layer 2 chain. While a sequencer cannot forge or alter transactions, it technically has the ability to censor or reorder them for profit. This does not mean that it will happen, but we should know that it is possible in some cases.</p>



 How to use&nbsp;rollups in Ethereum: 



<p>We could say that Optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups work in an almost identical way in their use.<br>What should happen, is that they can bridge your funds to layer 2, and complete the transactions you need to perform in the rollup (buy and sell cryptocurrencies/NFTs, interact with protocols, move funds between wallets, or any DeFi transaction).</p>



<p>Note that to get started, you must fund your crypto wallet (Metamask, Coinbase, Binance, etc.), with any Ethereum compatible token (ether (ETH) or ERC-20 tokens).<br>Next, you need to change your wallet to operate on layer 2, so you can bridge your tokens to move them from one network to another. Of course, there is an Ethereum transaction fee to pay to move your funds to a rollup.</p>



<p>Once you have completed the transactions, you can then transfer your funds back to Ethereum. This requires you to convert the rollup funds into ERC-20 tokens that are native to the Ethereum mainnet.</p>



 In conclusion: 



<p>Rollups in general are going, if they didn’t make it yet towards decentralization, in some way or another. It is believed that the rollup market will continue to grow due to its economic, time and security benefits for users.</p>

				  Governing generates an enormous amount of paperwork, so much so, the US employs an <a href="https://www.zippia.com/auditor-jobs/demographics/">estimated 228,000 auditors</a> to keep track of it. Here, we look at how governments can save millions on issuing documents, licenses and permits, while providing a much better experience for citizens.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>A key function of government is issuing permission, either so that citizens are allowed to do certain things — to build, drive, hunt, run a business, travel, or vote — or perform certain jobs according to certain standards, such as food handling. Governments issue a lot of these documents; for example, the US government issued <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/about-us/reports-and-statistics.html">24 million passports</a> in 2023, each of which&nbsp; took an average processing time of seven-to-ten weeks, and cost the person applying $130 dollars.</p>
<p>By issuing these same documents as verifiable digital credentials, governments can not only reduce the cost of creating the passport, and eliminate shipping costs and the waiting time for shipping, it can also simplify the process of renewing and replacing these documents.</p>
<p>The scale of cost reduction rapidly escalates as we move into state-level documents. In the US, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/191653/number-of-licensed-drivers-in-the-us-since-1988/#:~:text=Number%20of%20licensed%20drivers%20-%20United%20States%201990-2021&amp;text=Around%20233%20million%20people%20held,female%20licensees%20than%20male%20drivers">223 million people</a> held valid driver’s licenses in 2021, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/253615/number-of-hunting-licenses-and-permits-in-the-us/#:~:text=Hunting%20is%20generally%20regulated%20on,amounted%20to%20almost%2039%20million">38.7 million hunting licenses</a> were issued in 2023, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/687993/fishing-license-holders-by-us-state/">over 126 million fishing licenses</a> were issued in California alone in 2023. Each of these documents takes seven-to-ten days to process and ship. Even if the only thing verifiable credentials eliminated was the <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/prices.htm">66-cent cost of mailing the document</a>, they could have saved the government $147 million on driver’s licenses, $25 million on hunting licenses, and California $83 million on fishing licenses. And people would have received their verifiable credential versions instantly.</p>
<p>But verifiable digital credentials offer more benefits than saving on shipping while arriving faster. They can also save time and therefore money when it comes time to audit the holders of these credentials. For example, you need <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/restaurant-licenses-and-permits/">up to 16 permits and licenses to open a restaurant</a>, each of which can be misplaced or lost. Because verifiable credentials are stored securely on a mobile device, they are easy to keep track of and share when they need to be checked. Mobile verification software makes inspection easy, and the tamper-proof way data is stored means that everyone can be sure key documents haven’t been altered or faked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn’t just government inspectors who benefit from this feature. Anyone can easily verify the authenticity and data of someone else’s official documents. This eliminates what is now time-consuming and challenging research and sometimes a fee. For example, it costs <a href="https://washington.licenselookup.org/medical/">$50 and takes five-to-seven business days</a> to verify a Washington state medical license, while verifying a law license requires <a href="https://www.lawyerlegion.com/promote-your-law-practice/directories-by-state-bar#:~:text=Lawyer%20Licensing%20-%20American%20Bar%20Association,practice%20in%20a%20particular%20state">combing the state bar directory yourself.</a></p>
<p>If you would like to see an example of how governments are already adopting this technology with the Digital Travel Credential (DTC)&nbsp;you can read about how the government of Aruba has implemented it to <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">speed up border crossings</a> or watch a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcu76JEaqwI">here.</a></p>

Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a> is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit  TreeLDR  SpruceKit also provides access to Kepler and Rebase   Sign-In with Ethereum <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  Last month, Discourse bumped the version of FFI, which we had to match in our plugin (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/discourse-siwe-auth/pull/25?ref=blog.spruceid.com">discourse-siwe-auth#25</a>)   TreeLDR <p>TreeLDR is a schema definition language that aims to describe the structure and semantics of the defined schema comprehensibly. It lies at the intersection between&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">RDF</a>&nbsp;and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as&nbsp;<a href="https://json-schema.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  A <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/tree/v0.2?ref=blog.spruceid.com">new version of TreeLDR</a> is in the making. Last month, we worked on the following components of TreeLDR to make improvements:  We've refined and formalized the definition of <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/blob/v0.2/layouts/README.md?ref=blog.spruceid.com">TreeLDR's layouts</a>, simplifying their definition and how developers can interact with them.  We are working on the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/tree/v0.2/layouts/book?ref=blog.spruceid.com">layout book</a>, containing an overview and formal specification of TreeLDR's layouts.  We've extracted the RDF handling part of TreeLDR's layout compiler into a separate project, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/inferdf-rs?ref=blog.spruceid.com">InfeRDF</a>. This "RDF engine" is dedicated to the inference and interpretation of RDF datasets so TreeLDR can fully focus on its main feature: the layouts.    <p>This update introduces a lot of breaking changes for the better. We are still working on reintroducing previous TreeLDR features: the DSL and generators. The Rust code generator will be the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/162?ref=blog.spruceid.com">first reintroduced</a>.</p> DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms, including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  Support deserialization of single termsOfUse in Verifiable Credentials which is allowed by the specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/538?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#538</a>)   <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

The best of both worlds: digital and cryptographically verified — or analog, if that’s your&nbsp;fancy.<p>Global supply chains span millions of different interacting parties. This challenges the adoption of digitization; the industry is largely held back by lowest common denominators. Conscious tooling will allow digital front runners to maintain an advantage without disrupting their&nbsp;network.</p><p>Transmute is happy to announce a new platform feature, enabling users to “switch” between analog and digital interfaces. Transmute’s Verifiable Data Platform is now primed to bridge the gap between links of varying digital maturity along the supply&nbsp;chain.</p> Transitional Digitization <p>It is remarkable how much paper is passed around supply chains. Very often, emailing a PDF is considered “digital”, despite still depending on human consumption. The standard has arrived to change this: the globally recognized W3C internet standard for Verifiable Credentials enables a scalable approach to digitally signed, structured data.</p><p>Our <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/">Verifiable Data Platform</a> is laser-focused on this mission, enabling actors to digitize their processes and establish cryptography-based trust networks.</p><p>But the world will not suddenly flip a switch and go digital overnight. Differences in legislative environments, infrastructure and general digital maturity will make the transition period a long one — years, if not decades. This is the basis of our new platform feature: enabling modern digitization technologies to spread gradually. You can digitize; your network can follow when they are&nbsp;ready.</p> “Going Analog” Switching from digital to analog and back along the supply&nbsp;chain.<p>The diagram above illustrates a simple example of bridging a non-digital link of the supply&nbsp;chain:</p>  A Manufacturer digitally issues a trade document as a Verifiable Credential.  Down the chain, the origin country customs authority only allows for paper filings. So the VC is converted into a PDF, printed and filed manually.  The analog document continues downstream the supply chain to the Trade Finance bank. Digitally savvy, the bank scans the QR code, cryptographically verifies the data and injects the structured data into its operational systems.  For the remainder of the supply chain, the document is exchanged digitally, cryptographically tracing back to the issuing Manufacturer.  <p>This approach was introduced in the UN/CEFACT <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/WhitePaper_VerifiableCredentials-CrossBorderTrade_September2022.pdf">Verifiable Credentials for Cross Border Trade</a> White&nbsp;Paper:</p><blockquote>In a VC based solution to digitising origin claims, certificates and declarations would be issued as VCs but the digital version would also be accessible via a QR on the paper / PDF version so that the same certificate can support different verifier technical maturity. Some verifiers may simply scan the QR with their phone. Others may integrate with their systems and consume the full certificate data.</blockquote><p>The security principle here is that the QR encodes a capability URL: anyone holding the PDF or paper version is also granted access to the Verifiable Credential. A data sharing model well suited to supply chain use&nbsp;cases.</p> Verifiable Trade Documents <p>Below is an example of such an “analog”, printable trade document. You can access it digitally <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:818b95fa-85ef-455d-a8ba-35f8a9697850">here</a> — or go ahead and scan the QR code to verify its&nbsp;data!</p>Commercial Invoice PDF generated from a Verifiable Credential on the Transmute Verifiable Data Platform. Scanning the QR code links back to the digital, verifiable twin.<p>We are very proud at Transmute to take an active role in the practical transition towards scalable, verifiable supply chain digitization!</p><p>Are you ready to digitize, and still respect the pace of your business partners?

 How IDnow’s latest collaborative research project, MAMMOth, is making the connected world a safer and fairer place for everyone. 



 



<p>While the ability of AI to optimize efficiencies and improve processes is well documented, there are also genuine concerns regarding its susceptibility to human bias and how unfair data processing can lead to the perpetuation of discriminatory practices and social inequality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow leverages AI in its proprietary algorithms to automate three critical tasks:</p>



<p>1. Capturing and parsing identity documents.</p>



<p>2. Ensuring document compliance and authenticity.</p>



<p>3. Verifying the document holder’s identity, including a facial verification step.</p>



<p>Research conducted by IDnow has revealed demographic biases in facial verification algorithms, primarily linked to underrepresentation of certain ethnic groups. &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Although a manual analysis performed after an automated check can rectify erroneous verdicts, addressing bias in AI-powered services is a priority for IDnow as we want to ensure our clients and their customers have access to reliable and fair tools.</p>Lara Younes, Engineering Team Lead at&nbsp;IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>In a bid to break down the barriers of bias, IDnow has been collaborating with 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations and private companies, as part of the MAMMOth project, for about a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funded by the European Research Executive Agency, the goal of the three-year long project is to study existing biases and offer a toolkit for AI engineers, developers and data scientists so that they may better identify and mitigate biases in datasets and algorithm outputs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three use cases have been identified:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Assessment of loan applications.&nbsp;  



  Academic evaluation and visibility of academic work. In the academic world, the reputation of a researcher is often tied to the visibility of their scientific papers, and how frequently they are cited. Studies have shown that on certain search engines, women and authors coming from less prestigious countries/universities tend to be less represented.&nbsp;  



  Face verification applied to identity verification.&nbsp;  



<p>IDnow will predominantly be&nbsp;focusing on the face verification use case, with the aim of implementing methods to mitigate biases found in algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



 Hearing the voice of the under-represented.&nbsp; 



<p>In an effort to provide a tool that meets the needs of those affected by bias, the project has the support of social science researchers at UNIBO, and three associations working to promote the voice of under-represented groups: <a href="https://www.iasismed.eu/">IASIS</a>, <a href="https://donaactiva.org/">DAF</a>, and <a href="https://www.diversitygroup.lt/en/">DDG</a>. Their involvement in MAMMOth enables IDnow to understand the needs and expectations of under-represented groups. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Through a series of questionnaires and workshops, the above partners have collected input from underrepresented groups, especially women and ethnic minorities. Gathered information has revealed apprehensions about being discriminated against by identity verification algorithms, emphasizing the necessity of ensuring algorithm reliability before use. These groups also advocated for human oversight of algorithm decisions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Other concerns included possible data leakage, highlighting the need to address privacy-and-security-related issues when systems are developed. It’s also worth noting that some participants highlighted that human input could also be biased and that responsible AI use could reduce this risk.&nbsp;</p>



 AI for a responsible future.&nbsp; 



<p>At IDnow, we believe the importance of innovation lies in finding solutions to problems that do not yet exist but are sure to impact the future. That is why we have invested heavily in research and AI technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are proud to be a part of such an important collaborative research project. These studies underscore the need for trustworthy, unbiased facial verification algorithms. This is the challenge that IDnow and MAMMOth partners aim to overcome during the remaining two years of the project,” said Lara.&nbsp;</p>

 The next generation wants control over their data for a more transparent lending experience 



<p>Having grown up with the internet, smart phones, and social media, young Millennials and Gen-Z borrowers are particularly savvy about using their digital footprints for their own benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They embrace technology to streamline everyday tasks and they want to make informed decisions about transactions. As they increase their presence in the workforce, they are becoming the generations poised to drive the future of lending. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When Mastercard surveyed 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences, young people’s voices came through: They want a more transparent, simpler, digitally-enabled lending process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And open banking can make this a reality. Using secure APIs, advanced data analytics, and machine learning, open banking technology allows consumers to safely share their financial data, giving a more up-to-date and holistic view of their ability to repay a loan or afford a line of credit.</p>







<p>Most borrowers are already on board. According to our survey, 77% of those ages 45 to 60 and 68% of those over 60 are willing to grant access to their banking data to secure a credit or loan. Among respondents 18 to 29, the number shoots up to 84%.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly 60% of younger customers have already linked their accounts while applying for a loan. And, as digital natives, nine out of ten would prefer a loan option with a digital application or approval process.</p>







<p>The consumer base is changing, opening a window for the industry to evolve in step. Today’s borrowers are calling for a new, digital-first era of lending, giving applicants more control over the information used to determine their creditworthiness.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>By allowing consumers to share access to their financial data, open banking can provides a current view of their ability to repay a loan or afford a line of credit for more transparent lending decisions – and a more financially inclusive economy.</p>



 Younger borrowers are embracing digital lending

<p>Welcome to our latest edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap, where we explore recent crypto regulatory shifts from around the world. In this edition, we are analyzing the recent blockchain regulatory moves from Spain, Kenya, Ghana, and the United States. Join us as we examine these changes and their implications for the global digital asset&nbsp;market.</p> Crypto Legislation Continues Gaining&nbsp;Momentum <p>Europe: In Spain, Agencia Tributaria, the country’s tax administration agency, made it compulsory for Spanish residents to declare crypto-assets held on non-Spanish platforms. However, it will only apply to individuals who cross a certain threshold, a balance exceeding US$55,000 in crypto assets. The new regulations will be effective from January 1,&nbsp;2024.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1731732352047386661?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>Africa: Meanwhile, in a similar vein, last week, Kenya witnessed similar potential enforcement of regulations when the country’s National Assembly’s Finance and National Planning Committee approved the publication of the Capital Markets (Amendment) Bill, seeking to bring crypto trading under taxation.</p><p>The bill came as a proposal from a local Kenyan legislator, seeking taxation of crypto exchanges and digital wallets. If effective, the proposed amendment bill will allow the Kenya Revenue Authority to tax Kenyans who hold crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Efforts to regulate the digital assets space could also be seen in Ghana, where Daniel Ogbambey-Tetteh, the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission of the country, recently announced the commissioning of a task force to look after efforts towards regulating the space and minimizing potential harm to investors.</p><p>The Director-General announced investments in human capital development to meet the needs of the task force and related plans, along with a digitalization program. He also spoke of setting up a risk-based supervision framework to seamlessly migrate from the compliance-based supervision mode.</p><p>North America: Amidst worldwide talks of compliance, regulation, and supervision, the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce unanimously passed a blockchain bill titled “Deploying American Blockchain Act of 2023.” And while the Committee has already passed the draft bill 46 votes to 0, it is awaiting a full house&nbsp;vote.</p> Kenya’s Digital Currency Bill: A Detailed&nbsp;Look <p>A primary aspect of Kenya’s Digital Currency Bill is the requirement for digital currency licensees to register with the Capital Markets Authority. If approved, licensees will have to maintain detailed transaction records and pay taxes on capital gains from these transactions, promoting transparency and contributing to the national&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>Another significant measure that the proposed bill will enforce is requiring crypto holders to disclose comprehensive details for taxation purposes, such as the amount and types of cryptocurrencies owned, dates of acquisition and sale, transaction proceeds, and associated costs. While this does promote fiscal responsibility and prevent tax evasion, it also imposes an administrative burden on crypto holders and could be seen as an invasion of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Additionally, the bill proposes a capital gains tax on the increased market value of crypto during transactions, aligning with the existing practice where banks deduct a 20% excise duty on all transaction commissions and fees. This could potentially stabilize revenue from fluctuating market values but may also discourage investment in digital currencies due to increased taxation.</p><p>Overall, while the bill seeks to bring order and accountability to the burgeoning digital currency market in Kenya, it also introduces complexities and potential deterrents for crypto investors and users.

<p>If asked what job role is most associated with Identity and Access Management (IAM), what would you say?</p>
<p>Most of you might think a highly technical specialist, or an “IT person”. However, many CEOs, CFOs, Customer Service team leaders, HR analysts and other professionals across companies are involved in IAM decision making. But why is this? This blog will explore why it is important for companies to invest more time and effort in ensuring that Identity and Access Management is well understood across various job functions.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s understand what Identity and Access Management is.</p>
 What is IAM? 
<blockquote><p>“Identity and Access management is the people, processes and systems used to manage digital identities and their entitlements throughout their life-cycle.” ~ <a href="https://open-measure.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DIC/pages/1409143/Identity+and+Access+Management">Open Measure Dictionary</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Organisations use IAM software to manage and secure the identities of both internal and external users for their services and applications. There are &nbsp;two main styles of IAM systems, that are currently in use:</p>
 Traditional IAM or Internal IAM 
<p>Traditional IAM takes care of the internal identities, mainly employees but also can include other groups of individuals such as subcontractors and representatives from partners and suppliers. Think of an employee, from their user account creation, granting the right access to perform their job, until the account deletion when the person leaves the company.</p>
 Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) 
<p>CIAM forked from IAM when the number of Internet applications in every company’s data environment exploded in numbers. Such growth was clearly reflected in the number of screen icons in our devices. Companies of all kinds expect that their applications will be accessed by thousands or millions of consumers, citizens, remote workers, and other types of users. These “customers” could be B2C or B2B. Particularly with the innovations in the LEI world, B2B IAM is becoming a hot topic that will bring massive benefits to the B2B world.</p>
 Why IAM matters to everyone 
<p>Not long ago, when you started a new job or became a university student, someone from IT would provide you with access to necessary systems, and a username and password that needs to be changed after the first login. All identity and access management processes were semi-manual and done by the IT team. Today, we have modern identity standards, but often IAM is an area that only a small group of people in the organisation are involved in. With companies embarking on digital transformation, a larger percentage of the companies’ staff is now becoming involved in building new web and mobile services. But unless everyone has an adequate understanding of IAM, these projects are doomed to fail. Therefore, knowing IAM is not only for the IT folks as it was at the beginning of the millennium.</p>
 Who normally sees Identity and Access management on their desk? 
<p>Identity and Access Management is not an everyday task for many professionals beyond the IT team (or IAM team if it exists). However, when the time comes for strategic decisions, there are several people who will have a voice and decision power in how IAM is acquired, planned, deployed, maintained and expanded.</p>
<p>Especially for the biggest decisions involving risk and money, several sub-organisations and functions have the responsibility to build consensus with the IAM team in order to get their own business objectives met. The most critical of these stakeholders are:</p>
 
 Compliance Officers. There is no software that magically makes a company GDPR-compliant. Same with PCI DSS, CCPA and other regulations. Compliance officers use IAM among other tools and processes to fulfil their audits. Undoubtedly the compliance team will have clear requirements about what IAM must offer. 
 The Chief Information and Security Officer. With a large portion of employees working from their home offices, the risks of attacks to the companies’ systems have drastically increased. The Chief Information and Security Officer is well aware that IAM has taken a leading role in the organisation’s security. 
 Customer Service. Since the concept of self-service account management appeared, CIAM has made a tremendous impact on customer service, and there are multiple ways that CIAM can help. Even in a utopian passwordless world, users will need account recovery and might end up panickily calling customer service. And customer service will ask CIAM to help. Find out more about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/about/resources/ciam-customer-experience-marketing/" title="leveraging CIAM for more effective customer service and marketing here">leveraging CIAM for more effective customer service and marketing here</a>. 
 Business Development / Umbrella Organisations. New student portals, patient portals, citizen portals, new mobile apps, improved authentication methods for existing applications…; for every new or existing web service, every day a new service is being created or improved, and IAM needs to be in place. That’s why business units must understand IAM very well in order to reach their set goals. 
 Human Resources. Today any HR information system (e.g., SAP SuccessFactors, Workday) is in one way or another connected with the IAM systems, both Traditional IAM and CIAM. There again, several persons in the HR team will have a lot to say about what IAM should do and shouldn’t do. 
 The CFO. We know it well, that IAM is a necessary but also hefty investment for organisations. The Chief Financial Officer will carefully evaluate the financial impact and will ask both the IAM vendor and the aforementioned stakeholders for a clear Return On Investment (ROI). 
 
<p>Most of these people unfortunately only truly care about IAM when an issue arises for them.</p>
 Let’s educate everyone on IAM 
<p>Seeing how relevant IAM is across the functions, shouldn’t we start a crusade to educate more people about it?</p>
<blockquote><p>“30% of the time for an IAM team should be dedicated to education and knowledge transfer to people who are outside of the IAM team, and the rest of the organisation.” ~ <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/iam-uk-public-sector-richard-slater-amido/" title="Richard Slater on Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.">Richard Slater on Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With my personal experience, spending time on educating around IAM is realistic and crucial. There are commonplace and unconventional ways to make this happen: presentations, pre-recorded demos, mini workshops, discussions on hot topics. The executive who leads IAM in the organisation has to become a persuasive agent and make sure that these activities happen, and that more people will be converted into IAM ambassadors. Everyone in the company will benefit from it. After all, times have changed, and there is no digital transformation without CIAM.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and Credential Locking, or proof of humanity locking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and credential locking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 Conclusions&nbsp; 
 
 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches, or 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers credential locking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and Credential Locking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>Credential Locking, or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, Credential Locking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a Credential&nbsp;that can be locked with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By locking KEY on their Credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's Credential Locking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By locking their credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have locked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, locking credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens&nbsp;as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Credential Locking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By locking their credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD Credential Locking  
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's credential locking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information to ensure the security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD Credential Locking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By locking their credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

   by Mike Neuenschwander  In my research for this blog post, I wondered where the proverb about glass houses and throwing stones originated. I'm unsure whether there will ever be a definitive answer, but this one appealed to my education as an English major: 
 The proverb appeared in Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde, written in 1385. Later, George Herbert modified it this way: “Whose house is of glass

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>In my research for this blog post, I wondered where the proverb about glass houses and throwing stones originated. I'm unsure whether there will ever be a definitive answer, but <a href="https://www.almanac.com/fact/where-did-the-saying-people-who-live">this one</a> appealed to my education as an English major:</p>
<p>The proverb appeared in Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde, written in 1385. Later, George Herbert modified it this way: “Whose house is of glass, must not throw stones at another.” And in 1736, Benjamin Franklin wrote, “Don’t throw stones at your neighbors, if your own windows are glass.”</p>
<p>Then I decided I’d give DALL-E a go at it. I like that it turned out so dramatically:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This image captures quite well the point I’d like to make about breach revelations—piling on the schadenfreude provides little solace when you become the target. And let’s face it, we are all targets now.</p>
 For whom the bell tolls 
<p>When the closing bell rang at the NASDAQ on November 29, 2023, Okta shares (NASDAQ:OKTA) had been devalued by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/29/okta-hackers-stole-data-on-all-customer-support-users-company-says.html">nearly 7%</a> and received <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/okta-hit-with-6-downgrades-following-q3-earnings-4-big-analyst-cuts-3246837">six downgrades</a> from previous estimates, despite the company’s better-than-expected <a href="https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results">earnings report</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20231130546/oktas-stock-falls-amid-wave-of-downgrades-now-is-not-the-time-for-profit-push">TD Cowen analyst report</a>, OKTA's financial performance is reflecting “the impact of recent high-profile breaches involving the company’s solutions.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>In reaction, part practical, part penance, Okta stated it would <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/security/okta-s-90-day-delay-on-product-releases-is-a-critical-step-analyst">halt product releases</a> for 90 days (presumably, the time it takes to get one’s security glasshouse in order). Such news may seem like a holiday gift to Okta’s competitors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But, continuing to draw on my English major, John Donne had this <a href="https://allpoetry.com/No-man-is-an-island">great poem</a> a while back about a bell tolling and then Hemingway went on to develop the concept into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls">novel</a>. This sentiment rings true today, as we step collectively into an era of hyper-exposure to cyber-attacks: everybody’s going to take their turn. From Donne’s poem:</p>
<p>Any man's death diminishes me,<br>Because I am involved in mankind.<br>And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>It tolls for thee.</p>
<p>Speaking of humanity, it turns out the initial account that was compromised was a non-human—or service—account. These types of accounts can be unruly, and they don’t use multi-factor authentication. In a <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@dangoodin/111348246005935166">discussion</a> on infosec.exhange (with Adam Shostack and friends, no less!) commentors offer various summaries on what had just occurred and who was to shame. This one, I think, summarizes it up best:</p>
<p>Yes, let’s all agree, the one-word technical summary is accurate. But—to paraphrase a security professional I discussed the matter with—as large as the providers are these days, you can never be certain you’ll have your bases covered everyone takes a turn, even open-source providers.</p>
<p>And—talk about the mother of all identity providers—the DNA research company 23andMe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/04/23andme-confirms-hackers-stole-ancestry-data-on-6-9-million-users/">reported a breach</a> in October, as well—and likewise continues to realize new depths of the severity of the attack. And again, lest we forget, this cautionary tale is at least as old as 2011, when KuppingerCole Analysts reported similar findings from the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/rsa-securid-it-will-never-be-the-same-again">RSA SecurID breach</a>.</p>
 Cyberculture and the culture of silence 
<p>So, what is the proper response to getting our security <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-retired-players-agree-to-concussion-lawsuit-settlement-0ap1000000235501">bell rung</a> (as the NFL calls it)? Well, first and foremost, it’s important to talk about it openly. That’s not an easy topic for discussion with investors, customers, and competitors looking on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BeyondTrust, which <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">reported</a> the breach on October 2nd 2023, was likely the first customer to speak up about it, because the attackers had finally showed up at the company’s door (front door in this case). Still, Okta took more than two weeks to admit to the breach. Oddly, even now, BeyondTrust’s detailed timeline of the breach provides a lot more specifics than you can find on Okta’s security blog.</p>
<p>There’s a reason the mantra of physical security states, “if you see something, say something”—the social alert draws in a community to restore safety. For example, BeyondTrust reveals that the attacker requested a HAR file archive (HTML backup) for the ostensible purpose of troubleshooting the website. Obtaining the file, the hacker then reused a session cookie from that HAR file to attempt a replay attack on a web service, which BeyondTrust easily blocked. Undeterred, the attacker then switched to using API calls instead. According to BeyondTrust:</p>
<p>API actions cannot be protected by policies in the same way as actual admin console access. Using the API, they [the attackers] <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">created a backdoor user account</a> using a naming convention like existing service accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is great intel on how the threat actor conducts business and everyone should be put on notice. Still, valuable time was spent in a moment or two of silence. Why?</p>
<p>The culture of silence needs to go. We need to swap notes. Safety is a collaborative effort, because we can’t know in advance where the next threat will originate or where it will propagate.</p>
 Going to production requires oversight 
<p>The interesting thing about this breach is that it started with a service account and then moved to human accounts. One way this happens is by not hardening the system sufficiently when moving from development to production environments. The Okta Developer portal makes it easy for developers to get moving on projects but will need a thorough security review when deploying applications.</p>
<p>Also, the LDAP interface is typically enabled by default even when not in use, heightening the risk level. Access control policies for sensitive apps and admin accounts are often not adequately designed to limit risk exposure to breaches.</p>
<p>Okta is now critical infrastructure and needs a run book that ensures security is maintained. One of the shocking findings in the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/CSRB_Lapsus%24_508c.pdf">report on Lapsus$</a> breaches “organizations did not always consider third parties and BPOs in their risk management programs.” Communication with third parties is necessary preparation for moving to production, as well.</p>
 How to learn from—rather that gloat over—others’ mishaps 
<p>Proposals for avoiding and dealing with breaches were plentiful at our recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">Cyberevolution</a> conference. For example, we <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5434/1">heard from</a> Michiel Stoop of Philips, who spoke on “How to Minimize the Blast Radius of an Attack?” In this case, the approach was to minimize access from privileged accounts.</p>
<p>Jorge Monteiro of Ethiack pointed out that it’s actually a good idea to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5439/2">attack yourself first</a>, in his presentation titled “Autonomous Ethical Hacking for Accurate and Continuous Security Testing.”</p>
<p>Emergency preparedness is often overlooked in cybersecurity, with the majority of the attention going to prevention and detection. But, if we already agree that we are all simply waiting our turn to be attacked, it seems only obvious that we prepare plans for that inevitable moment.</p>
<p>One proposal we covered at Cyberevolution is the practice of developing and training on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5468/3">tabletop exercises</a>, which was covered in a panel titled, “Arresting Disaster: Driving Incident Response in Cyber-Regulated Europe in an Age of AI Threats,” which included participants from ArmorText and the law firm of Crowell &amp; Moring.&nbsp;It’s important to recognize that even your messaging platforms like Teams, Slack, or Zoom become compromised in a breach and so your team will need an out of band “break glass” communication that also meets legal requirements of various governments.</p>
<p>Independent of the measures taken to reduce risk and mitigate cyber disasters, the common thread through all these measures is to communicate openly and quickly with the cyber security community. We’ll all fare much better against attackers as we open channels for honest, detailed, and actionable information.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>With employee identity risk and fraud on the rise — to the point that the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI has issued a public warning</a> — it’s crucial to ensure that employees are who they say they are. Is the person you interviewed the same person you actually hired? Is the person logging in a legitimate employee? Is the person requesting a credential reset in fact the owner of those credentials? Robust identity proofing helps you answer those questions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Understanding Identity Proofing and Why It’s Needed  
<p>What is identity proofing? Identity proofing is the process of verifying and validating the identity of individuals accessing digital systems. It ensures that the identity exists and that the person claiming the identity is the real owner. Employee identity proofing is a fundamental aspect of safeguarding sensitive information, intellectual property and overall organizational integrity. It addresses one of the major security weaknesses in most IAM systems — the fact that authentication only validates that the credentials being used to access systems are valid. It cannot ensure that the person using those credentials is the legitimate holder, and further that the legitimate holder is actually who they claim to be.</p> 
 Workplace Identity Fraud Escalating  
<p>The rise of remote work and the increase in attacks on identity processes underscore the critical need for reliable methods of verifying and validating employee identities. Using credentials obtained by brute force attacks, phishing, AitM attacks, social engineering and other methods,&nbsp; cybercriminals can readily gain unauthorized access to systems and networks. Sometimes the attacks aren’t particularly sophisticated, but exploit gaps in verification processes to perpetrate identity fraud.</p> 
<p>Consider the case of the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">attack on MGM resorts</a>. Armed with publicly available details, attackers impersonated an employee and convinced the IT help desk to provide them with credential access to the corporate IAM service. From there they could wreak havoc, stealing sensitive data and deploying ransomware that shut down operations for over a week.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>MGM Resorts attack flow</p> 
<p>By implementing stringent identity proofing protocols, organizations can ensure regulatory compliance and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities.</p> 
 Key Components of Identity Proofing for the Workforce  
<p>Worker identity proofing should include multiple verification methods to increase the security of the proofing process. The methods used will depend on the situation and context. Ideally all components are connected both to each other and to your other identity security tools and systems.</p> 
 Document Verification  
<p>Document verification determines whether a document — such as a passport, driver’s license or other official document — is authentic or not. This can be done either in person or digitally. Your document verification process should include technology that is able to detect forgeries or alterations.</p> 
 Location Detection  
<p>Location detection is an important aspect of online identity proofing. Is the employee in the geolocation you expect them to be? If not, this may require further investigation. It’s important, however, that your location detection adheres to global regulations.</p> 
 Facial Recognition With Liveness Detection  
<p>Facial recognition uses facial biometrics to determine if a person matches the identity they are claiming. Usually the person will take a selfie as part of the identity proofing process. Liveness detection is a critical feature when using facial verification in order to detect spoofing tactics such as a photo, video playback or even a mask.</p> 
 Live Video Verification  
<p>Live video verification adds an additional layer of security to the identity proofing process. It takes place face-to-face over a video conference, between the employee and their supervisor or an authorized agent and includes questions and actions designed to confirm liveness and detect signs of spoofing or coercion.</p> 
 Chat Verification  
<p>In some cases, such as a lower risk scenario, chat verification may be sufficient. It also may be used as part of a more comprehensive identity proofing flow. Effective chat verification combines AI and human interaction.</p> 
 Attestation  
<p>Attestation by a responsible party of the identity proofing results is a critical part of the process. This creates an official trail for audit and compliance purposes. Your identity proofing software should retain the attested results, not the employee’s sensitive data.</p> 
<p>The integration of these diverse methods creates a comprehensive identity proofing ecosystem, enhancing cybersecurity measures and safeguarding organizations from unauthorized access and data breaches.</p> 
 NIST Identity Proofing Guidelines&nbsp;  
<p>Identity proofing holds a critical role in IAM. Under the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Digital Identity Guidelines, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63a.pdf">NIST SP 800-63-A</a> covers enrollment and identity proofing. It outlines a general identity proofing flow and describes three different security levels based on the strength of the type of evidence gathered as well as the verification processes used.</p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> Level 1 (IAL1): This level does not require the user to be linked to a known, established real-life identity. It uses self-asserted attributes — in other words, no identity proofing.</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2): IAL2 introduces the requirement for strong proof connecting the user to a valid, real-world identity. It supports a wide range of identity proofing methods, allowing for either remote or in-person validation. This includes government-issued documentation as well as biometrics;&nbsp; proofing cannot rely on knowledge-based techniques.</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3): IAL3 is the strictest identity proofing level, requiring user presence and biometric verification.</p> 
 Best Practices for Effective Workforce Identity Proofing  
<p>Many companies verify a worker’s identity at the time of hire and stop there. Make sure your identity proofing strategy addresses all key workplace scenarios and times of increased risk of fraud. Below are some of the most critical moments to address.</p> 
 Employee Onboarding  
<p>Before giving any new hire access to corporate systems and data, HR teams need to ensure that the person they are onboarding has a credible identity and is the legitimate owner of the identity they are claiming. They also need to verify that the new employee is in fact the person that was interviewed for the role. This means elements of identity proofing need to come into play before a candidate steps a real or virtual foot into the office. It’s also crucial to securely tie the new employee’s verified identity to IAM systems using non-phishable methods.</p> 
 Credential Resets  
<p>In many organizations, identity proofing stops at HR’s door. The newly minted employee is provisioned with a digital identity and from that point on verification involves validation of that digital identity — there is no process for ensuring it ties back to the real world holder of that identity. This leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks that target the credential reset process. For example, an attacker with the right information can claim to be an employee with a new phone that needs to enroll in MFA on their new device.</p> 
 Changing Roles  
<p>A change in roles often provides an employee with access to systems previously out of reach. Before granting those elevated privileges, organizations should make sure that the role change is legitimate and the user is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p> 
 Elevated Detected Risk  
<p>When identity monitoring systems detect potential risks, re-proofing may be indicated depending on the risk level and threat type. For example, if a user attempts to log in from a device that is not in proximity to their computer or engages in other suspicious activity, they could be automatically prompted to provide proof that they are the valid credential holder.</p>

<p>A: Identity proofing plays a crucial role in preventing unauthorized access when combined with other identity security elements. Integrating identity proofing with phishing-resistant passwordless authentication and continuous identity risk monitoring,&nbsp; to create a complete identity security solution, makes it significantly more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access to systems, accounts, or sensitive information.</p>

   Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a system architecture guiding tech choices, not a software or service. It prioritizes the individual, allowing them to control their own information. Blockchain technology, as a decentralized database with data spread across nodes, seems a fit for SSI as it ensures accuracy and security. However, it has limitations like being computationally expensive and complex.

<p>For many in the identity industry, hearing “self-sovereign identity” (SSI) automatically makes you think “blockchain.” And, if you’re like me, as soon as you hear blockchain, you think it’s too darn early to play the blockchain drinking game and move on. In the early days of SSI, most of the discussion was, in fact, about identity on a blockchain. That association did a disservice to the concept of SSI. SSI is no more dependent on using blockchain technologies than a passport is dependent on a particular type of paper.&nbsp;</p>



 What is SSI? 



<p>SSI is an architecture that guides technological decisions. It is not a piece of software to install or a service you can purchase. In an SSI model, the individual is the single most important entity in a transaction. That individual controls what happens with their information. For people to trust the individual’s information, there needs to be some measure of both technical and societal trust in the veracity of that information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the puzzle the technology has to solve. How do you create a digital identity with information that has been verified (or possibly asserted) by a third party (like the government), that allows an individual to control what information is shared, does NOT allow the third party to know about the transaction, and yet can be verified as accurate by whoever is receiving the data from the individual?</p>



 What is a Blockchain? 



<p>Several features associated with blockchain technology suggest it is a good fit to solve that problem. At its most basic, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a>&nbsp;is a distributed database with data spread across any number of nodes in a network. Enough math is involved to guarantee that the information in those nodes can only be altered with a clear record of who modified it and when.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the right technology, such as a digital identity wallet, an individual can share this cryptographically secure information with any other interested party. Suppose that information was initially issued by a known, trusted entity, and the data cannot be changed (only added to in a visible way). In that case, no one needs to check back with that issuer to see if the information is accurate. The issuer will, in fact, have no idea that this information was shared at all. The individual is in control, and privacy is preserved. Win!</p>



<p>You might find this article interesting if you’d like to read more about how SSI and blockchain can transform society.</p>



 Other Options for SSI 



<p>We have some obvious wins here by using blockchain technology to support SSI. Why isn’t it the One True Way? Because blockchain has some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/04/14/the-5-biggest-problems-with-blockchain-technology-everyone-must-know-about/?sh=5c35504c55d2">significant limitations</a>. For one thing, it is computationally expensive (which means slow and power-hungry). It is also far more complicated than is actually required for most use cases (if you haven’t seen Figure 6 in this&nbsp;<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8202.pdf">NIST publication</a>, it sums this argument up nicely).</p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a fundamental part of the SSI model. There is an entire&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">registry</a>&nbsp;of possible methods to use and support DIDs. Some are blockchain-based, but others rely on the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;specifications. There are options; it is better to understand your current infrastructure, what problem you’re trying to solve, and decide what technology you need to support. Don’t try to make your problem fit the tool, especially when other tools are available.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>SSI’s core principle is about enabling individuals to own and control their digital identities. This architecture can be implemented through various technologies, not limited to blockchain. Blockchain offers a way to decentralize and secure these identities, but it’s not the only method to achieve the principles of SSI.</p>



<p>And if you play the blockchain drinking game, too, I hope you read this late in your day and have a designated driver to get you home.</p>

 A Just Transition Plan for London Borough of&nbsp;Newham Chigwell Road in East London. Photograph: Jack Dredd/Rex/Shutterstock via the&nbsp;Guardian<p>The London Borough of Newham is one of over 300 of the UK’s total 382 local authorities to have declared a climate emergency since 2019. Following these declarations, many local authorities have adopted the Climate Action Plan as a format for translating recognition of risk into action and transformation. From June to October 2023, our team from Dark Matter Labs and colleagues at Arup collaborated with the London Borough of Newham to consider how a new generation of Climate Action Plans might increase the scale and pace of impact, in the face of the climate emergency.</p><p>Newham’s Just Transition Plan, the first outcome of our collaboration, explores innovative approaches to the document’s foundational principles, format, and scope. This article will present the Just Transition Plan as a model for future innovation around local authority climate action, and share what we found in working closely with those seeking to drive systemic change in&nbsp;Newham.</p> Centring justice in Newham’s climate transition <p>Newham, in East London, faces a unique intersection of climate and socioeconomic risks for a UK local authority area. Newham residents currently have the highest rate of death attributable to air pollution in London, and is among the six London boroughs most exposed to flood and overheating risks as temperatures rise. From March to May of 2020, Newham’s Covid-19 mortality rate was more than double England’s average. Today, about one quarter of Newham residents are paid below the London living wage, and one in two children live in poverty, with under-16s making up more than 20% of the population. More than half of residents were born outside of the UK (as of the 2021 census), and Newham is the UK’s most ethnically diverse borough. Newham also has the highest number of households in temporary and non-secure housing in the UK; average rent represents about 65% of wages, compared to the UK average of around 30%. These risks and vulnerabilities situate Newham’s 350,000 residents at the forefront of present and future needs across climate mitigation and adaptation. On the other hand is the sense of opportunity in the borough, on the basis of the youth and diversity of its population. The expansive thinking and leadership within Newham Council enabled a tangible understanding of how the climate emergency is already affecting residents.</p><p>Since 2021, London as a whole and Newham in particular have witnessed increasing evidence of the entanglement of climate risks. Everyday but profound stressors like growing heating bills, and extreme weather such as the July 2021 floods and 2022 heat waves, which resulted in over 3,000 deaths across the UK, have made plain the urgency of systemic action. When we began this work in June 2023, the prospect of another dangerously hot summer was hanging over our work. In each of these scenarios, the intersectionality of the lived experience of climate change was unmissable: people of colour in the UK are four times as likely to live in areas at high risk of extreme heat. The council’s existing Climate Action Plan, as with many others, focuses on a list of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This, however, does not address the reality of Newham residents’ present critical needs and their likely, iminent intensification. A plan for a Just Transition would need to target intersectionality to increase equity in the borough through every single recommendation, while also reducing emissions.</p> Recalibrating our focus in the local authority context <p>With our colleagues in Newham Council, Dark Matter Labs and Arup adopted a cross-disciplinary lens driven by a particular focus on governance and urban climate risks. Early interviews with officers in the council, local leaders and experts from within our organisations outlined one of the defining tensions of this piece of work: local authorities have high and well-informed ambitions, but are working within an extremely challenging context, with limited resources. This dynamic makes system-scale innovation, sustained investment in transition causes, and transformative leadership by councils profoundly difficult. Recent research from <a href="https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications/promotional-materials/section/youve-made-a-climate-action-plan-what-next-guidance-for-local-governments">Arup</a> outlines an alternative framing: while less than 5% of a borough’s emissions are typically directly attributable to council activities, it can influence as much as 70% of emissions through procurement, policy, jobs, place-shaping, partnerships and community engagement. Local authorities must act, but also influence and convene to affect emissions reduction, and so too the other elements of a Just Transition. In designing the plan, we highlighted ways Newham Council could further grow their influence and work with the borough’s committed community members and other stakeholders.</p><p>A few other shifts in focus were crucial to our efforts. Concepts such as emissions scopes are a poor fit for the scale and interconnectivity of urban boroughs, and can result in a blame game of emissions sources. A reliance on difficult-to-attain emissions data can undermine the ability of local authorities to pinpoint effective levers and enact meaningful climate action. We worked with Newham Council to understand their emissions holistically while they are compiling a nuanced borough-wide picture.</p><p>Estimates suggest that less than 10% of global climate investments go toward adaptation (source: <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2021/">Climate Policy Initiative</a>), but the case for adaptive measures is stronger than ever. We know that actions which integrate mitigation and adaptation create value, reduce risk and future costs, encourage future investment, and improve quality of living. In Newham, increasing the capacity for adaptation could be incorporated into the more expansive idea of future-readiness: where institutions, infrastructure and individuals are prepared for the volatile futures expected from a world that has warmed on average by 2°C or more. We similarly identified the need for longer-term, recurring, blended and strategic investment to enable whole-place transformation and reduce financial risk for the&nbsp;Council.</p><p>Ultimately, the plan needed to affirm and support Newham’s officers and politicians. We worked with the Council’s Climate Action Working Group and consulted findings from citizens’ meetings to ensure the plan helped to articulate and advocate for their everyday experience and existing programmes, rather than just another thing to do. As a result, we targeted the idea of a next-generation document committing to climate action in Newham: one which was ambitious and informed, reflective of the urgency of this moment, and oriented toward the potential of collective action.</p>Shifts that might define next-generation climate action by local authorities<p>The 3–6–5&nbsp;plan</p><p>Our plan was structured into three parts, each framed by a set of questions:</p> 3 Principles <p>How can a local authority address the entangled targets of a Just Transition: to increase equity, to build future-readiness, and to meaningfully reduce emissions?</p> 6 Futures <p>What specific risks does Newham face, and what levers will enable these to be addressed in order to bring about a Just Transition? What defines the positive place futures we want to bring to fruition?</p> 5 Enablers <p>How can this be accomplished? What action would enable the council and the borough to reach climate targets, support the work that’s already taking place, and maintain momentum in the Transition? How would we need to work differently and collaboratively to make this&nbsp;happen?</p><p>These three components give structure to our more detailed recommendations for Newham, each functioning differently within the context of the plan. While the principles emerged early in our research and guided the formation of the rest of the plan, the futures and enablers were the result of sustained engagement with council data and expertise.</p><p>The 6 Futures, which direct council departments toward visions of the transition in play, takes on some challenging areas, such as Newham’s property and social housing portfolio, which is associated with a majority of emissions in the council’s direct control. Equally important in this section was building on areas where Newham is already a leader, such as in its pioneering work around school meals, and the recent commissioning of micro-forests across the borough. Finally we were very aware that climate action plans can easily turn into lists of hundreds of actions. We sought to focus on the main actions where there would be significant impact across the principles if focused resources were brought to&nbsp;bear.</p><p>Our approach to the Just Transition was to recognise that much of the space for proposition was around capacity, resources, and governance within and between the council, civic society, businesses and institutions that had an interest in the borough. The 5 Enablers give shape to possible forms of governance and finance innovation for Newham, with a view toward capturing the maximum potential of the borough’s leaders across sectors and communities.</p><p>What’s next?</p><p>Since the plan’s launch by the Council on 5 December, it is available to examine more closely <a href="https://www.newham.gov.uk/council/just-transition-plan">here</a>. In <a href="https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications/promotional-materials/section/youve-made-a-climate-action-plan-what-next-guidance-for-local-governments">“You’ve Made a Climate Action Plan, what next?”</a>, our colleagues at Arup pose the crucial question in the document’s title. For Newham, our collaboration to date represents tracks laid for the longer-term processes and effort which will be required to sustain momentum for the Just Transition. We look forward to continuing our collaboration, and developing future work to support the borough’s important work to increase equity, grow future-readiness, and reduce emissions.</p><p>Work by Emma Pfeiffer &amp; Dan Hill, in partnership with The London Borough of Newham&nbsp;Council</p>

 How open banking paints a more nuanced picture of borrowers  



<p>Even in the best economic circumstances, loans are often a necessity, especially for critical purchases like homes and cars.  &nbsp;</p>



<p> For some insight into the lending landscape, Mastercard surveyed 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The upshot: 89% have been adversely affected by economic pressures, and nearly half are struggling to get the loans and credit they need. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional credit scores do not always reflect an applicant’s ability to make payments. Individuals with thin or no credit history can struggle to qualify for credit. Young adults on their own for the first time, gig workers who deal mostly in cash, new Americans and retirees with a single credit card and no loans can struggle to qualify for leases, credit cards and mobile phone contracts. </p>



<p>To most consumers, change is overdue — 87% believe the decisioning process should make it easier for responsible borrowers to prove their ability to repay. </p>







<p>Open banking could help provide that missing piece. By choosing to share their bank account data, applicants can paint a more complete picture of who they are. Real-time insights into their accounts — such as a thin credit borrower’s biweekly deposits, cash flow or consistent payments for bills like utilities — offer an up to date, more comprehensive view of their financial health. &nbsp;</p>







<p>This shift in consumer mindset opens new horizons for lenders, allowing them to champion more inclusive processes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking has the potential to accommodate millions of thin-credit applicants who have previously had difficulties accessing the benefits of the financial system. Consumers have spoken. They want the next evolution of lending to prioritize transparency, accessibility and empowerment for consumers worldwide to build a more inclusive digital economy where everyone thrives. &nbsp;</p>



 Digital lending is on the rise 



<p>The data revealed in Mastercard’s Lend Report shows global consumer support for a more transparent, digital-first approach to lending. Read more about the future of lending in Mastercard’s Lend Report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finicity.com/future-of-lending-report/">here</a>.</p>

<p>While Identity and Access Management (IAM) long ago gave IT teams tighter controls against unauthorized access to digital services, it hasn’t exactly been bulletproof.</p>
<p>Yes, IAM consolidated the management and storage of user data and enabled login credentials to be associated with user roles and permissions easily. But it also created a single point of failure that hackers have proven painfully adept at exploiting to gain access to all the resources a user is authorized to access.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/journey-through-identity-models-centralized-federated-decentralized">Federated</a> identity management was supposed to fix that by involving a third party in the management of IAM. Instead, it retained all the dangers of centralized identity while extending the potential blast radius of compromised credentials to vast, interconnected networks. Meanwhile, the global cybercrime economy now tops $7.8 trillion a year. The good news: Decentralized digital identity (DID) management has emerged as a superior approach to managing user identity — if you have the right architecture to support it.</p>
 IAM More Than Just a Password or a Pretty Face 
<p>In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">Part One</a> of this series, we shared the contours of the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">1Kosmos architecture</a>, which employs automated, digitally verified identity to confirm user claims and credentials with up to 99.6% accuracy. In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">Part Two</a>, we showcased how we go above and beyond mere logins by binding identity to a biometric stored within a digital wallet. Yet, as solid as these architectural pillars are, we know that decentralized identity models offer a way to keep these and other personal identifiers and information far more secure than traditional user stores — centralized, federated, or otherwise.</p>
<p>To that end, let’s look at why we designed our architecture to support <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">a reusable identity wallet</a> that enables users to securely gain access to corporate systems using identity details that remain under their own control instead of being stored centrally on servers where they can be altered, misapplied, become inaccurate over time—or be swiped, ransomed, or leveraged to commit fraud.</p>
 Decentralized Identity: What’s In Your Wallet? 
<p>In our view, decentralized digital identity isn’t just important to modern IAM. It’s essential because: 1) it replaces platform-specific user stores that are hard to integrate because of proprietary technologies embedded deeply within those very same platforms, and 2) it replaces incomplete user personal identifiable information (PII) scattered across multiple business applications to one version of the truth managed directly by the user.</p>
<p>By leveraging advances in smartphones, cryptography, and blockchain technologies, our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID solution</a> leverages the 1Kosmos architecture to establish high-assurance trust online in a way that balances security, privacy, and convenience. This enables organizations to confidently accelerate user onboarding and activation of digital services, protect digital accounts from unauthorized access (AKA account takeover), prevent transaction fraud, improve the user experience, and more. Specific features include:</p>
<p>A Reusable Identity Wallet</p>
<p>End users gain secure access not just to corporate accounts and systems but also to digital analogs of verified government-issued ID cards, driver licenses, passports, social security cards, and more—anytime, anywhere, from any device. Users also control what personal information they share with digital services in a manner consistent with emerging <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> frameworks.</p>
<p>Portability and Interoperability</p>
<p>1Kosmos offers the only solution certified to the highest FIDO, NIST, UKDAITF standards for interoperability and security and provides an SDK along with off-the-shelf APIs to simplify data sharing and integration.</p>
<p>Verifiable Claims &amp; Credentials</p>
<p>A way to digitally present in real time claims for a virtually limitless number and variety of machine-verified credentials and safely store them so they’re ready to reuse on-demand with user consent.</p>
<p>These features produce enormous benefits for organizations and end users, including the following.</p>
 Rapid Remote User Onboarding 
<p>The 1Kosmos digital identity wallet organizes and stores information gathered, triangulated, and validated during the identity-proofing stage of self-service user onboarding. This includes attributes from multiple, proof-able sources—and enables a wide variety of applications that require identity verification without requiring physical, in-person presence. Think worker and contractor onboarding, applications for government services and documents, and compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) mandates.</p>
 Security Backed by Public Key Cryptography 
<p>Our digital identity wallet consists of a decentralized identifier along with the cryptographic public-private key pair. Personal information about the user and their credentials are stored within the wallet and require the user’s private key and biometrics to read data from it. Because the private key never leaves the Secure Enclave within the device and the biometric can be authenticated with the highest digital standards available, this approach vastly exceeds the security achievable through passwords, traditional forms of multifactor authentication, and unverified device-level biometrics. In turn, this reduces cyber threats related to credentials stolen through phishing attacks, data breaches, and more.</p>
 User Convenience With Just the Right Friction 
<p>When data from the digital wallet needs to be presented—during login or in the event of step-up authentication—the wallet holder must present their biometric and consent to share that data. When approved, the private key is presented as a credential to unlock the wallet and share the data. The private key never leaves the device and hence the risk of compromise is dramatically minimized. Best of all: There are no passwords to remember or clumsy OTPs to enter.</p>
 Verifiable Credentials for a Zero-Trust World 
<p>Verifiable credentials are a standardized means of issuing and presenting claims about one’s identity—driver’s license, passport, college qualifications, gym membership, etc. Other types of information, such as educational certificates and vaccination records, for example, can also be added to the wallet to make the user’s identity-proofing process indisputable in any number of use cases. The identity wallet can make assertions about identity or credentials that are cryptographically verifiable by the receiving party—without the actual data being revealed. The major cryptographic element used by decentralized identities is known as a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/security-glossary/zero-knowledge-proof/">zero knowledge proof (ZKP)</a>. Zero Knowledge proof measures an information request while protecting user privacy.</p>
 Blockchain: This Is Just The Beginning 
<p>In Part Four, we’ll click further into how the 1Kosmos architecture leverages distributed ledger technologies (DLT) to eliminate the centralized PII honeypot while increasing business ability and speed.</p>

Residents in North East London who are part of the <a href="http://www.power.film">POWER</a> — a ‘show &amp; do’ project to kick start a “grassroots Green New Deal”. Photo credit — Hilary Powell and Dan&nbsp;Edelstyn We need to rethink our approach to retrofit. <p>If you know anything about <a href="https://www.cse.org.uk/news/what-is-retrofit/">retrofit</a>, you’ve probably heard this line plenty of times. The UK has one of the oldest and leakiest housing stocks in western Europe, and we need to retrofit 27 million homes by 2050 — approximately 1.5 homes per minute for the next 27&nbsp;years.</p><p>This is necessary not only to reach our legally binding Net Zero targets but to ensure healthy, comfortable and affordable homes in a rapidly changing&nbsp;climate.</p><p>You may also know that progress on retrofit is stalling. Each winter millions of UK residents experience the physical and mental health effects of living in damp, mouldy and expensive homes. Overheating is increasingly becoming an&nbsp;issue.</p><p>There’s a lot of discussion about the multiple barriers to retrofit and why it’s often left in the ‘too hard to do’ pile: it’s expensive, disruptive and even if we can afford it, many of us simply don’t have enough trust in a good outcome to start the journey. It’s also clear that existing government-funded retrofit programmes have under-delivered and under-spent.</p><p>Yet our research with HEAL and London Councils found that people up and down the country aren’t waiting for government action. Building on the existing fabric of community groups, cooperatives, community land trusts, neighbourhood regeneration initiatives and other social infrastructures, people are organising themselves to make their and their neighbours’ homes healthier and more climate resilient.</p><p>Communities are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RetrofitBalsallHeath/">sharing information</a>, <a href="https://civicsquare.cc/">organising entire streets and neighbourhoods to retrofit together</a>, <a href="https://edinburghtoollibrary.org.uk/charitable-programmes/tooligan-initiatives/etl-retrofixers/">offering simple DIY retrofit measures for free</a>, <a href="https://www.power.film/about">turning their homes into power stations</a> and <a href="https://locohome.coop/">forming local cooperatives</a> that bring together householders, building professionals and tradespeople to generate retrofit demand and deliver high quality home improvements.</p> Putting residents and communities at the heart of&nbsp;retrofit <p>We believe that neighbourhoods can drive forward a nationwide movement to accelerate the uptake and delivery of retrofit and make our homes, communities and social infrastructure more fit for the future. Empowering people to retrofit together and transform their neighbourhood will provide significant other benefits, including good quality local jobs, better health and wellbeing, stronger local economies and community wealth and resilience.</p><p>A community-powered retrofit approach proposes four fundamental shifts in the way retrofit programmes are designed and delivered:</p><p>Individual customers → collective mobilisation</p><p>Design approaches that bring people&nbsp;together</p><p>Extractive finance and grants → local economic&nbsp;value</p><p>Invest in our local economies and communities</p><p>Standardised process → user centred&nbsp;journey</p><p>Design the retrofit offer around the resident experience, not around a Net Zero policy objective</p><p>Focus on ‘measures’ delivered → focus on&nbsp;outcomes</p><p>Contract for actual objectives — healthier and more comfortable homes and reduced carbon emissions</p><p>The focus of community powered retrofit is to mobilise local residents, communities, and stakeholders to be an integral part of designing and delivering retrofit programmes. At present most retrofit programmes view so called ‘community engagement’ as a cost line to be minimised. However there are significant benefits to investing in a place-based, community-powered approach:</p>  Significantly increased participation and power of collective action  Unlocking latent capacity, developing local skills and supply&nbsp;chains  Achieving replicability and economies of scale through co-location, bulk purchasing or typological approaches and potentially reduced disruption  Developing locally relevant responses that maximise co-benefits  Greater continuity and less dependence on (often inconsistent or shifting) policy  <p>Retrofit Balsall Heath is a partnership of local groups in the inner city neighbourhood in Birmingham. It has been incredibly successful in signing up households to participate in the City Council-led programme of ‘Local Area Development Scheme’ grant-funded retrofit works. The approach has involved mobilising a coalition of local community and faith organisations to galvanise support on a street-by-street basis and seeking to support the process throughout where feasible. Although the constraints of the programme design and funding has created issues, the approach has demonstrated that there is demand from residents for improvements to their homes. Traditional approaches using letter/leaflet drops typically achieve very low response rates and don’t build the trust that is needed for residents to stay the&nbsp;course.</p>A ‘street cake’ made by a resident of Link Rd. in Birmingham as part of a co-creation week around neighbourhood climate transitions hosted by CIVIC&nbsp;SQUARE<p>We propose five key building blocks to growing a community-powered retrofit movement. Each of these can — and should — be adapted to the unique context of each community and neighbourhood and its housing characteristics, history, ownership and local&nbsp;wishes.</p>  Movement building<br>Community members and leaders come together to set the vision and communicate the foundation for neighbourhood transformation and a shared mission for better homes and futures. This builds knowledge and trust, develops neighbourhood-level infrastructure for communication, engagement and action and encourages collective action. In <a href="https://oldhamenergyfutures.carbon.coop/">Oldham</a>, Carbon Coop worked with local people to establish a citizen-led approach to transform their neighbourhood and energy system. Groups also need to learn from each other. We’ve been working with many others in establishing the <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-2023-7aec7fbb992f4a4a97ca7d969a48b216">Retrofit Reimagined Festival</a> as a vehicle to build this movement.  Training and upskilling<br>Every community initiative integrates a plan for professional development of community members and upskilling of existing tradespeople to contribute to delivery of neighbourhood retrofit. This demonstrates that retrofit can support the local economy and provide good jobs, helps people to start on the journey to becoming skilled professionals and amplifies existing and latent talent among community members. Civic Square has initiated a <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Neighbourhood-Trade-School-111b0cf89ad34e35aa7f64da612a03e1">local trade school</a> in Birmingham to develop both the ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ skills needed to support neighbourhood transitions. <a href="https://wecanmake.org/">We Can Make</a> has established a local factory to construct building components and a parallel skills programme. <a href="https://b4box.co.uk/">B4Box </a>is an integrated training provider retrofitting homes in areas affected by fuel poverty, training local people particularly those who face challenges in finding&nbsp;work.  Whole life design and journey planning<br>Residents, builders, planners, architects, building surveyors, placemaking and energy system professionals work together to design individual and collective neighbourhood transformations toward holistic long-term goals rather than quick fixes. There are many technology platforms to support this such as <a href="https://furbnow.com/">Furbnow</a>. For centralised grant-based programmes, successful delivery should be based on outcomes rather than on&nbsp;inputs.  Making finance work for places<br>Community groups can advocate for community wealth building approaches and explore options for local finance, including community energy, solar and other forms of cooperatives, collaborations with credit unions and fair and low-cost financing such as municipal bonds. There are successful <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/power-station">crowdfunding </a>and <a href="https://www.ethex.org.uk/invest/people-powered-retrofit">share&nbsp;offers</a>.  Local transition entities or coalitions<br>Retrofit programmes will take many years to deliver, and existing or new community-based entities should be established to support the area-based approach. These should be governed inclusively to provide access to all parts of the community and help to retain local control and economic benefits. Carbon Coop, Energy Communities Tipperary Coop and Cosy Homes Oxfordshire are demonstrating approaches in this space. Many community-owned energy cooperatives provide retrofit support to their areas, for example SELCE, West Oxford Community Renewables and Low Carbon West Oxford amongst&nbsp;others.  <p>There is no one-size-fits all approach to community-powered retrofit. However there are some concrete actions that can be taken&nbsp;now.</p>  Residents and existing community groups can establish forums to share knowledge and skills, approach their local authority and explore existing funding such as the <a href="https://energyredress.org.uk/">Energy Redress Scheme</a>. There are already over 400 community energy groups in the UK, many of which are involved in retrofit activities.  Local government and philanthropic funders should look to initiate or strengthen street or neighbourhood-scale projects&nbsp;by:    Identifying current community activity in retrofit or parallel domains (e.g. greening and gardening projects)  Working with local organisations and areas with known strong social networks to design, trial or build up existing street-scale schemes  Committing additional resource to support existing communities to build capacity and develop resilience for sustained action  Partnering with a broad range of cross-LA departments and agencies to develop skills, organisational and technical capacity  <p>3. All layers of government can enhance existing programmes by:</p>  Building trust and capacity in community partners and supporting new initiatives so that they are ready for future investment  Developing a spatial focus aligned to community partners  Including community partners in the bidding process from the&nbsp;outset  Understanding where CPR principles could integrate with grant programmes and in-house borough retrofit programmes  Partnering with trusted community-based intermediaries to expand the reach of existing programmes increasing uptake  Encouraging collaboration and co-design to ensure longevity of scheme measures and interventions available  Retrofit Balsall Heat — Neighbours attending a Housing protest march campaigning for retrofitting and better housing standards Working collectively is the only way to&nbsp;work <p>Retrofit is challenging. Acceptance of change accelerates when people see and experience change together, learn from each other and see the benefits that the change is bringing. By building momentum from the ground up across our cities, towns, villages and communities, we are planting the seeds for demand, building trust and shaping an approach to retrofit that will not only improve our homes and reduce carbon emissions but build social resilience and reframe the narrative around the climate transition as a pathway to a better&nbsp;future.</p><p>We are hoping that the next phase of Community Powered Retrofit will work with existing community groups to develop a replicable model and resource to enable and empower community retrofit groups around the country. We are looking for funders and existing groups to help bring this to life. Will you join&nbsp;us?</p><p>For further information on our work on retrofit see our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/">Medium channel</a>. <a href="https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/node/40773">Here </a>is a link to this report.

Rewards counting started 12:01am Nov 30, 2023 and ended 12:01am Dec 7. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>“<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa">Predictoor Data Farming</a>” is a new Ocean incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via 37.5K OCEAN + 100K ROSE (≈$27K USD) in weekly extra sales to Predictoor data feeds [1]. This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF67 is live today, Dec 7. It concludes on Dec 14. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF67  Section 5: Challenge DF&nbsp;Ends   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF67 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.

What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Challenge DF&nbsp;Ends <p>DF66 was the final round for Challenge DF.</p><p>Starting now in DF67, the 1000 OCEAN/week is redistributed equally to Volume DF and Predictoor DF.</p><p>The Active DF budget is 37.5K / 37.5K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor DF respectively.</p><p>For more information, please read the announcement <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#d8d5">here</a>.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $27K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Dec 7, 2023: $0.511 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.0798 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.511 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $19,163&nbsp;USD  $0.0798 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,980&nbsp;USD  Total: $19,163 + $7,980 = $27,142.5 ≈ $27K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Since the first Townhall in March this year, we have achieved milestones and have been at the forefront of innovation to implement various features on the mainnet. In this Townhall, we will discuss where Aergo is at the moment, and update you on the changes and progress made over the past&nbsp;months.</p><p><a href="https://voting.aergo.io/gov_voting/c051c6fe0a0de95c95a71eee3f3be4d041fb77593126652fbdde0d7310e8b7d3">1. #AIP-16</a></p>  Proposed by one of the community members, #AIP-16 aims to implement a redenomination plan (changing its denomination at a ratio of 10:1). The voting process began on the 1st of December, 2023, and ended on the 3rd of December. In total, 3,062,404 AERGOs participated with 11.497% voting in favor and 88.5%&nbsp;against.  <p>Even though the proposal did not garner enough votes to be implemented, the Aergo team always welcomes ideas and insights from the community as the goal of the Aergo Agora is to build a decentralized decision-making framework.</p><p>2. User Engagement and Voting Experience Enhancement</p><p>To foster better user engagement and make the vote more accessible, the Aergo team will improve the overall decentralized decision-making experience by (1)introducing an in-app native staking and voting feature on Aergo Connect, (2)improving the voting mechanism and user interface to make voting more intuitive and to increase participation.</p><p>By implementing these measures, the Aergo team aims to create an engaging, user-friendly, and secure environment for decentralized decision-making, ensuring that the community plays an active role in shaping the future of the platform.</p><p>More details will be released on the official channels.</p><p>3. Public Ecosystem Expansion Initiative</p><p>Starting with the forthcoming 2.5.0 release, Aergo will shift gears to expand its focus on interoperability with public blockchain ecosystems with incremental support for Web3.js, Metamask Snaps, and of course, the Ethereum Virtual&nbsp;Machine.</p><p>All of the features will allow developers to build decentralized applications that can interact with the various blockchain networks while benefiting from Aergo’s hybrid blockchain architecture.</p><blockquote>Dapp developers are an integral part of a blockchain ecosystem. The importance of the language to compose smart contracts cannot be overstated as it is THE factor determining the success of developer onboarding. By allowing developers to build smart contracts in any language that can be compiled into WebAssembly bytecode via our own WebAssembly (WASM) Virtual Machine (VM), we will broaden the range of developers who can join the ecosystem.</blockquote><p>In summary, Aergo will support multiple programming languages for smart contract development to enhance the inclusivity, flexibility, and overall developer experience within the Aergo ecosystem.

<p>In a world inhabited by a multiplicity of truths, how may we develop mechanisms to orient positively therein?&nbsp;</p><p>This article explores knowledge graphs as a tool for sensemaking and epistemic pluralism. Data is not neutral. It is contextual — collected under particular conditions, by particular people. And when we gather data together and attempt to make sense of it, we add meaning to it to produce an insight. Insights can then be repackaged as new data points within a layered graph. Rather than seeing these insights and data points as neutral fact, we explore the way that knowledge is a diverse field, with overlapping interpretations. By building tools that let us see these divergences and track their origins, we believe that we can better enable community and society level sensemaking.</p> Making Sense of Contextual Data <p>Raw data points alone are meaningless without interpretation. They exist as inert quantifications exerting only the direct geometries of their measurements and have no further relation to reality. The quantity of lead particulates in public water systems alone is insufficient to derive meaningful action. First, we must also understand that lead particulates are dangerous to humans when consumed and that humans are dependent on public water systems to survive.&nbsp;</p><p>Insights — defined for this post as artefacts of knowledge — are always in relationship to an ontology; they exist within a framework for sensemaking reality. Thus data points and their descendant insights can be divergent across ontological frameworks. The challenge then — for us as a collective species interdependent with the natural world — is to develop a system within which we can make decisions that benefit us as a whole and enable us to cohere towards some common goal, despite our differing opinions, interpretations, agendas, and means of engaging reality. What is more, we must be able to transcend a mono-ontology to truly understand the complexities in the hearts and minds of the entities that inhabit Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>It is the composition of measurements into published, opinionated claims that thread the fabric of a ‘knowledge topology’ upon a distributed library of available data.</p> Gesturing Towards Pluralistic Knowledge&nbsp; <p>Recognizing the pivotal role of cogent insights in informed decision-making, it becomes imperative to establish a system that can both acknowledge and effectively evaluate a diverse array of perspectives, especially when they range from congruent to starkly divergent. This necessity stems from an understanding that our collective perception of the world is inherently pluralistic, encompassing a spectrum of contexts and ontological frameworks where multiple rich contexts and ontologies need to be able to coexist and organise towards a future that is inclusive, yet coherent, interdependent, self-aware, and common enough such that we can avoid undesirable internecine interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>It is here that a set of tooling in support of a healthy, composable and pluralistic Data Commons is described, or more accurately, a set of tooling to enable data commoning! This tooling extends the distributed data storage, query, and analysis modules described in part one of this blog series.&nbsp;</p> Adapting our collective lens for knowledge <p>The authors do not intend to describe a specific implementation. Rather, this post serves as an investigation into praxes of pluralism and knowledge integration. The exact form of these praxes codified into a product are not the focus of this enquiry, and rather we wish to draw attention to the dynamics this tool may embody.&nbsp;</p><p>While modern science boasts remarkable capabilities in accurately measuring various aspects of our world, this informational chapter of the Anthropocene has repeatedly shown that absolute truth is elusive. This observation does not undermine the pursuit of objectivity in our understanding of reality. Instead, it highlights that the perspectives that shape our collective cultural narrative are diverse and often lead to substantial variations in our conceptual models of reality. This diversity underscores the importance of acknowledging and designing an effective lens for the plurality of views when engaging in our collective quest for knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Consider the following diagrams, where two polar (and very generic) ontologies are described. The authors do not intend to provide an argument for either ontology, but rather give them by way of example. The first is a theistic epistemology, the second is an atheistic epistemology. The nodes in both diagrams are shared data points. The highlighted edges represent the structural relationships between the nodes for each epistemology. The semi-opaque edges represent an opposing ontology and have been rendered for the purpose of demonstrating the pluralism that is the thesis of this post.&nbsp;	</p>Figure 1: A subgraph of the global knowledge graph where the highlighted edges defined by the community determine the structure of their theistic ontology.Figure 2: A subgraph of the global knowledge graph where the highlighted edges defined by the community determine the structure of their atheistic ontology.<p>In the above two diagrams, four configurable ‘insights’ are represented by very simplified nouns. Further, the use of simplified concepts such as God, Humans, Big Bang and All Life are intended to represent more complex composable insights and have been selected for their capacity to demonstrate how the epistemological topology of a community can vary despite using the same nodes. Specifically, it is the relationships between the nodes — their relative structure — that determines their framing and ultimately their meaning within a system of knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of the above illustrations is to demonstrate that even with some shared understanding of a set of data points (where both ontologies acknowledge the existence of “humans”), it is the relationship of these data points to other data points that define their ontological framing.</p> Epistemic Pluralism and Peer-Based Graph Structures <p>Software can act as a bridge connecting us to — and mediating our interactions with — the physical world. It can also oversimplify and potentially degrade our experience of reality. This dichotomy underlines the importance of our mission: to design technological solutions that enrich, rather than diminish, our engagement with the world. Our aim is to ensure that these technological interventions augment our understanding of reality, maintaining its depth and complexity in a way that unlocks the rich and existing knowledge mappings that percolate in our brains, epigenetics, culture, and shared interpersonal space.&nbsp;</p><p>With the above framing in mind, we can begin to gesture towards a pluralistic knowledge graph of insights; a multiplicity of complex claims with directed links (references) to the datasets upon which the claims are based.&nbsp;</p><p>Enabling pluralism within a tool for knowledge is non-trivial. The challenge is to determine and promote synthesis and coherence across an agent-centric knowledge mapping tool.&nbsp;</p><p>The reader is encouraged to imagine a graph-builder of sorts, where participants provide insights via some medium as nodes in a graph. These publications will bear some epistemic relationship to other publications. They may be direct responses, endorsements, or rebuttals but they may also have less explicit relationships such as semantic similarity or geopolitical proximity. It is this metadata, the edges of the graph or in other words its relational structure, that represent the social relations through which we have collectively archived and evolved our various cultures for millennia.&nbsp;</p> Designing for Protocols &gt; Platforms&nbsp; <p>This blog post does not delve into the specific design or user experience (UX) of the proposed tool. Instead, our focus is to conceptualize its potential functionalities, particularly when implemented as a protocol for safely sharing data and insights across software ecosystems. We envision it as a flexible module or wrapper, designed for integration by other developers, rather than as a standalone platform. This approach considers an inter-platform collaborative model. A key aspect of this model is the 'safe answers' concept as examined in part one of this blog series, which negates the need for centralized server access to raw data. Instead, it enables communities to retain custodianship over their data, allowing external organizations to send localized algorithms to peer networks. These algorithms can then query data, with granular control over the opacity of the data being used for computation. This means that the return of the algorithm can optionally expose the raw data it is using, or provide some ‘insight’ pertaining to the data. For example, a security camera may expose to a querying party the amount of people who walked past the camera, and not the identity/profile of the individuals walking past. This method fosters a decentralized and secure approach to data analysis and sharing.&nbsp;</p> Finding Integration in Pluralism <p>While there is something just and encouraging about an ecosystem aimed at mapping the pluralistic epistemics that percolate throughout the world, there are also risks therein. What is important is that we avoid a set of disintegrated ‘knowledge’ feedback loops, echo chambers, where those embroiled in misguided or harmful informational clusters are never exposed to counter-arguments or differing schools of thought. It is important that we identify mechanisms through which to measure how coherently any given network’s graph of knowledge integrates with the other graphs in the ecosystem. To achieve this, we endeavour to draw from Integrated Information Theory (IIT).&nbsp;</p><p>IIT, initially formulated to describe consciousness, posits that a system possesses consciousness to the degree it possesses 'Phi' (Φ) — a measure of its intrinsic cause-effect power. It is a system's ability to integrate and differentiate information. Adapting this to our knowledge graph setting, we can interpret 'Phi' as a measure of the extent to which knowledge from one epistemological network is both differentiated from and integrated with another. The higher the Φ, the more integrated (and thus potentially coherent) the knowledge graph is with the broader knowledge ecosystem.</p><p>In practice, Φ along with more traditional graph analysis techniques may be used to reveal areas where connectivity can be enhanced, subsequently tuning search and discovery algorithms. This is crucial in a world increasingly fragmented by differing worldviews, as it enables us to identify points of convergence and divergence across knowledge systems. By analogizing Φ in IIT to the integration of knowledge across different epistemic frameworks, we establish a quantitative measure and orienting function to shift the knowledge network toward greater coherence.</p><p>Just as IIT posits that conscious experience arises from the integration of differentiated information within the brain, we posit that a coherent and functional knowledge ecosystem could emerge from the integration of differentiated insights across various epistemological networks. We suggest that a healthy knowledge graph, like a biological mind, is not just a repository of information, but a dynamic, integrated network capable of evolving and adapting to its environment.&nbsp;</p> Embracing the Dynamics of Knowledge Integration <p>The journey through the realms of data, insights, and knowledge graphs has elucidated the intricate and dynamic nature of knowledge itself. We believe that the concept of a pluralistic data commons, as explored in this article, is not just a theoretical framework but a necessary evolution in our approach to understanding and navigating the complex tapestry of global information. The notion of knowledge as a static, singular entity is a relic of the past. Today, we are called upon to recognize the fluidity and multiplicity of knowledge, shaped by diverse perspectives and evolving contexts.</p><p>This blog post describes praxes for knowledge mapping in a manner that aims to embrace epistemic pluralism, and resists the idea that we as a species can arrive at a positive orientation through a homogenised narrative. Rather, we believe that it is in the intersection of a diversity of narratives that we may come to a model of integrated knowledge. These praxes are important when considering the applications that may sit above the distributed storage layer we described in our first blog post. It is insufficient to merely ‘capture’ data. Data requires contextualisation and application, and it is in these later steps that the capacities and implications of the data becomes apparent. Here we must ensure that our endeavours to synthesise and unpack data are done in an inclusive and life-centric manner, and thus it is important that the communities using the distributed storage tool have the means to find the degree of integration in the knowledge artefacts derived from a given set of data.&nbsp;</p><p>The notion of measuring the integration of knowledge, borrowing from Integrated Information Theory, offers a promising path forward. It allows us to quantify and visualize the interplay of different knowledge systems, identifying points of convergence and divergence. This, in turn, can guide efforts to enhance connectivity and coherence within the global knowledge ecosystem. Such an approach recognizes that the health of our collective understanding is not just in the accumulation of data or insights, but in the integration and harmonious interplay of diverse epistemologies.</p><p>Ultimately, the success of this endeavor will depend on our collective willingness to engage with and evolve differing viewpoints, to challenge our own assumptions, and to remain open to the evolving nature of truth. The creation of these knowledge ecosystems is not just a technical endeavour but a cultural and intellectual one, requiring ongoing dialogue, collaboration, and a shared commitment to exploring the multifaceted nature of reality. As we forge ahead, let us embrace this complexity, not as a hindrance, but as a rich tapestry of human experience and wisdom, from which we can all learn and grow.</p>

 The travel and mobility industries have been anything but stationary over the last year. As we move toward 2024, let us look back at 2023 to reflect on changes and predictions that will drive these industries into the future.&nbsp; 



 



<p>Mobility and travel are industries on the move, literally. Individuals from all walks of life have an almost daily need to get from point A to point B. Our needs, our finances,&nbsp;our environments and even our <a href="https://brilliantio.com/how-does-culture-affect-travel-and-tourism/">culture dictate how we move</a> in our lives, and as times change so we must follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People are traveling more frequently than ever, the only difference is how they are traveling. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/features/mckinsey-center-for-future-mobility/our-insights/european-mobility-finance-a-25-billion-euro-growth-opportunity">McKinsey is seeing developments</a> in full-service leasing, new-car subscriptions and financing for used cars as potential core mobility-finance markets by 2030. Furthermore, micromobility will continue to grow and contribute 5% of total revenue in 2030 compared to 1% in 2023. An additional niche area which will see some growth beyond 2030 is electric vehicle charging infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As consumers are delighted about the variety of mobility trends on the horizon, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-mobility-evolves">respondents from a McKinsey survey</a> found that almost one-third plan to up their use of micromobility over the next decade and 46% have already switched to more sustainable modes of travel with an interest in shared autonomous vehicles. But whatever the mode of transport, safety is key, and the increased need for identity verification has become clear along with the desire of growing digital services.&nbsp;</p>



 Wheels of regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The travel and mobility industries have seen some exciting developments and steps forward this year, thanks largely to the increased adoption and implementation of identity verification solutions across the entire user journey. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, 2023 could also be characterized by a series of significant stops-and-starts. The most pivotal event in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility industry</a> occurred in September when, following an overwhelming vote to ban e-scooters in Paris, the French capital was cleared of the vehicles overnight. The main reason for the ban was safety concerns, following a streak of accidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This set the wheel in motion for the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/age-verification-electric-scooters/">strengthening of micromobility regulation</a> in different cities around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Right now, the market can be <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/electric-kickscooters-have-come-of-age-regulators-have-taken-notice">split into four types of cities</a> ranging from unregulated, where e-scooters can be implemented without any limitation or regulation, to complete bans, where e-scooters are not allowed, such as in Paris” stated Edouard Baussier, Global Mobility and Travel Sales Director at IDnow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two regulatory archetypes, in-between no regulation and complete ban, carry certain stipulations such as an age verification process, speed limits, restricted numbers of operators and areas in which to park.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ramifications of the Paris ban are likely to be felt for the next few years as each country and city decides its stance on micromobility. Opponents to the ban argue that it was a step back for sustainable transport, and that there are benefits to embracing a clear micromobility strategy that includes faster, more convenient, eco-friendly forms of transport that can help reduce urban congestion, and offer transport options to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other changes likely to affect mobility in 2024 include ongoing digital transformation efforts, across every step of the user journey highlighting this need for progress.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Processes remain old school in car rental agencies who are now facing strong competition from fully digital car rental companies, so digitalization will play a major part in the development of the car rental space.</p>Edouard Baussier, Global Mobility and Travel Sales Director at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Consolidation will also play a role in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/mobility-report/">future of mobility</a>. “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-as-service-digital-identity-partnership/">Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) will become key</a>, as it will provide a new way to plan a full trip [whether bus, train, e-scooter, e-moped, bike, car or taxi] from one platform and one user experience.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Traveling digital.&nbsp; 



<p>When reflecting on 2023, it didn’t come as much of a surprise to Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Travel &amp; Mobility at IDnow that, much like mobility, digitalization within the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel industry</a> played such an important role.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Covid acted as a wakeup call that there was an urgent need for digital services in the travel and mobility sectors, and that the travel industry, in general, had been very lax in dealing with these topics for decades.</p>Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Travel &amp; Mobility at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Michael explains that the major challenge facing the sector is that there is “a shortage of skilled workers and increasing customer expectations on the one hand, and low margins, rising inflation and conservative strategies on the other. Digitalization should be driven forward more rapidly, but most travel and hospitality companies still behave hesitantly and adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ approach.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the digital skepticism of some travel and hospitality companies, Michael has no doubt that digitalization in every area of the tourism value chain, and user journey, will continue to be the driving force for hotels, airlines and other travel businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-digital-identity-improves-passenger-journey/">Seamless travel, digital check-in processes and digital identities</a> are hot topics that will simplify travel experience in the short and long-term. It is an ongoing process and courageous companies that prioritize digital projects and implement them ASAP will be able to gain a market advantage and be more successful in the future. Plus, IDnow will be there to support them.”&nbsp;</p>

 A side of hospitality.&nbsp; 



<p>Along with mobility and travel comes their partner, hospitality. Where would travel be without hospitality to lend a hand? Due to the increase in travel, hotels and rental companies are back to business but with a few more challenges on their plate. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Many hospitality businesses have seen a surge in fraudulent attacks in recent years. Coming in a variety of different forms, the most significant include loyalty card programs which fraudsters have developed a liking for and is <a href="https://www.cybersource.com/en-us/blog/2020/loyalty-fraud-how-real-is-the-threat.html">projected to reach a market value at over $11 billion by 2025</a>, as well as the ever-present credit card fraud which the airline industry is also heavily impacted&nbsp;by&nbsp;with <a href="https://chargebacks911.com/travel-forecast-2023/">IATA totaling the loss for airlines at $1 billion a year</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraud is everywhere, no matter the industry. Unfortunately, hospitality is feeling the effects due to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-protect-owners-guests-holiday-rental-scams/">lack of protection and high turnover rate compared to other industries</a>. And it isn’t just a loss in revenue but also reputation. Luckily, thanks to identity verification, chargeback and credit card fraud can be minimized, improving security of both the hotel and the guest <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/optimizing-the-online-travel-booking-experience/">from reservation</a> to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/leveraging-digital-check-ins-hotel-operations/">check-in</a> to payment. &nbsp;</p>



 



 

 



 To the reusable future.&nbsp; 



<p>As the travel and mobility industries take stock of 2023 and look to the coming year, digitalization will play an ever-increasing role, especially through the use of reusable digital identities. While they can be applied in almost every industry, reusable digital identities are already taking off&nbsp;within the travel sector where airlines and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have already showcased their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/iata-first-integrated-journey-digital-identity/">Proof of Concept – End to End Digital Identity initiative</a> near the end of 2023 in collaboration with IDnow. With such developments arising in travel, digital identities (travel credentials, boarding passes, visas, etc.) will be stored in digital wallets, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a>, ready-to-use within seconds making the future of travel much more pleasant and stress-free. The possibilities of tomorrow are only a [digital] wallet away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contributions by: Sam Gbafa (Product Prototyping), Wayne Chang (Strategy), Parke Hunter (Content &amp; Editorial)</p><p>Picture this scenario: You're a politician running for state office. It's been a long campaign, and the polls are very close — a virtual tie. It's the night before election day when most of the ballots come in.</p><p>You get a call in the middle of the night, and it's the head of your campaign. There seems to be a fake story about you spreading like wildfire that has come out of nowhere. What's worse is that there’s also a video of you confirming and apologizing for the fake allegations spreading alongside, coming from a verified account with a name spelled in a way that looks visually identical to yours! Your campaign manager has already started damage control. You know that this will be disproven, as the allegations are obviously false. But the election is tomorrow– is there enough time? If only people could see that that apology video is fake and didn't come from your campaign. Your campaign manager asks: how should we move forward?</p><p>Enter a world with content authenticity…</p><p>In a world driven by content authenticity, there is a verifiable way to prove any content's author. In the campaign example, you would have set up a system where you registered digital credentials, including your mobile driver’s license, .gov email, and a state credential that includes your current title to create a verifiable online digital identity.&nbsp;</p><p>Every message, video, and post by the campaign has a small reference with it that can be retrieved and verified by platforms, allowing them to give you a special verification symbol with all of your content. Anyone can check this verification and pull down the original content you posted. Social media platforms would instantly make it clear that the apology video didn't come from your campaign. This fake story is still out there, but its power is diminished.</p> An Introduction to Content Authenticity <p>Throughout time, the ways in which we’ve encountered news and information in the media have shifted dramatically. With the proliferation of AI, social media platforms, and influencers, it’s become a challenge to weed out the truth from misinformation. Not being able to verify the legitimacy of content is problematic, especially when it comes to political news or government information, as portrayed in the example above.</p><p>Multiple organizations are currently working on tech approaches to solve this problem by adding a layer of trust and verification to the content we consume. This layer of trust and verification added to content is called content authenticity. At our core, SpruceID’s mission is to let users control their identity and personal data across the web in a way that facilitates trusted interactions. As a result, contributing to the future of content authenticity, powered by trusted digital identity, is important to us.</p> The Rise of Digital Content, Platforms and Publishers <p>From relying on a few major news providers to the rise of citizen “journalism” on social media platforms—the internet has made it easier than ever for anyone to have a global reach. With this new power, it becomes more challenging for information consumers to differentiate what is real from what is fake.</p><p>To combat this, platforms have traditionally used verification of notable figures. Tools like the Twitter Blue Checkmark or the Verified Badge on Instagram give users a clear way to know who to trust. However, there have proven to be issues with this approach, including platform risk (as seen with Twitter’s recent changes to verification), bias and discrimination (such as a political campaign being unable to make verifiable statements due to their political opinion), and legitimization of harmful entities if someone can game the verification system to post with authority. These platforms also have the power to allow verified posts to look different and appear more frequently. By modifying their platform, they can increase or decrease trust in “verified” content with their audience.</p><p>Currently, these platforms have to design and build their own verification systems, and they are not interoperable with one another. There isn’t a clear way to say that the identity of “The New York Times” on Facebook is the same as that on Twitter (besides the recognition of that entity’s name). These platforms have, in part, understood their responsibility to inform people of what can and cannot be trusted. They have done so with different approaches, including <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/about/introduction?ref=blog.spruceid.com">community notes</a> on Twitter and fact-checking on Facebook.</p> Approaching Solutions&nbsp; <p>Today, we’ve begun to see political figures address the danger of deepfakes and the need for a solution to AI-generated content. On October 30th, 2023, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_JLkU5xF2Y&amp;t=3s&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">President Joe Biden spoke out</a> about signing an executive order on artificial intelligence, which is the first of its kind for the U.S. Government. He stated:</p><p>“With AI, fraudsters can take a 3-second recording of your voice can generate an impersonation good enough to fool you; it’s mindblowing…I said, ‘when the hell did I say that?’”</p><p>With an open <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">executive order</a> calling for technology to solve this problem of verifying who is saying what, this currently remains a pressing issue. We believe that one way to approach this issue is by introducing a way to verify who posted what content by tying said content to the poster’s verifiable identity using digital credentials.</p> SpruceID Proof of Concept <p>In order to demonstrate a potential solution for content authenticity, we created a proof-of-concept using our SpruceKit open-source libraries. We recently presented this proof-of-concept in Washington D.C. at <a href="https://dcfintechweek.org/agenda-2023-2/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">D.C. Fintech Week</a> to show what a solution could hypothetically look like. Here, we’ll break down the technology in our proof-of-concept and describe how these tools can be used to verify content and build trust across all platforms.</p> Key SpruceKit Components for Content Authenticity <p>This proof of concept uses the following technologies we’ve developed as part of SpruceKit, our open-source libraries. We will reference these tools in our walkthrough below:</p><p>SpruceID Libraries used in this demo:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Rebase</a> is a tool that allows you to run a credential issuer. Rebase lets you run a witness that can programmatically examine multiple proofs from someone requesting a credential, verify those proofs, and then issue a credential.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Kepler</a> is a data storage system where you permission who has access to this data with your Ethereum keys. You sign in with your Ethereum keys, and that signature permits the app you are using to access and store data.</p><p>Other technologies used:</p><p><a href="https://attest.sh/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ethereum Attestation Service</a> is an infrastructure for making attestations on or off of a blockchain about anything. We use it as a place to make attestations.</p><p><a href="https://base.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Base</a> is the blockchain we are using for this demo. It allows for low-cost attestations (100s of attestations per dollar). Someone must pay this fee for a transaction to be posted as a public blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://web3.storage/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">web3.storage</a> are tools we use to store and retrieve data verifiably. IPFS summarizes the file into a Content ID, which can then be used to retrieve that file. It does this in a way so that it’s verifiable that the file you upload is the file you retrieve. We use web3.storage as an easy way to interact with the IPFS network.</p> Content Authenticity in Action <p>In this walkthrough, we’ll break down how to both create and verify Content Authenticity claims in order to make a statement or claim and then “stamp” that claim (with a high assurance credential such as a mobile driver’s license or a .gov email) so that your audience can be confident that it was you who made it.</p> 1) Account Setup and Adding Credentials <p>When you land on the Content Authenticity page, you can either create a Content Authenticity claim or verify one. First, let’s create a claim.</p> <p>To create a Content Authenticity claim, you will first need to sign in. We use Sign-in with Ethereum to connect to Kepler in order to store and retrieve data associated with our account. This data includes the credentials we have and any files we have uploaded.</p> <p>If this is your first time interacting with your account, you’ll need to create a data vault with Kepler (our data storage system). This second signature request creates a place where your data is stored.</p> <p>If you have no credentials, you can easily create them. Our Rebase issuer powers the process of creating credentials. To create a credential, select “issue first credential,” and you’ll be taken to the following page.</p> <p>From here, we'll choose the Email credential.</p> <p>In the process of adding a credential, you prove two things: </p><p>1) you are in control of the keys you want to associate with the email </p><p>2) You control the email you want to associate with the keys. </p><p>If both of these are verified by the witness, then it will issue you a credential. Going through the steps here proves these things to the witness. In step 1, you say what email you’ll be using. Step 2 prompts you to sign a message with the email and Ethereum public key in it. This message and signature are cryptographically verifiable, and the witness checks that. Lastly, you are sent an email with a unique challenge to the email provided. If you have control of this email account, you can respond to the challenge correctly. Providing this proves access to the email. Once proven, the witness will issue you a credential that says your email is the same as your Ethereum public key. This credential is an important pillar in our content authenticity solution, as it anchors the cryptographic signer to other identities.</p> <p>Once they are added, any credentials you have, such as your Twitter handle, email address, etc. will be displayed under the Credential section below.</p><p>In this example, the issuer is the Spruce Rebase Demo Witness, but there can be many other credential issuers, including your organization, your government, or a club you are a part of. These credential issuers may have other requirements besides the simple proofs to issue an email credential. Our demo trusts credentials issued by the Spruce Rebase Demo Witness, but ultimately, a user may have different trust models, such as trusting an issuing key that belongs to the New York Times or the California DMV.</p> 2) Upload Your Content <p>Upload a file to IPFS and get its content identifier to accompany your claim. This identifier is both a cryptographic hash of the content and a way to retrieve the content from the IPFS network. Anything uploaded is public and irreversible.</p> <p>Select the file, and then you can make claims about that content.</p>  3) Make a Claim About Your Content <p>Once you have your credentials and have uploaded the content you want to make a claim about, you can use this tool to make those claims!</p> <p>First, select the credentials you want to use in order to make a claim. I’ll select my GitHub and email accounts.</p> <p>Then, you select the file you want to make a claim about.</p> <p>This flow supports <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Content Credentials</a>, an effort by the <a href="https://c2pa.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity</a> to develop technical standards for certifying media content's source and history (or provenance). Some <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/leica-launches-worlds-first-camera-with-content-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">hardware</a> and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/content-credentials.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">software</a> support content credentials, which prove the source and modifications to an image. You can export those and add them as part of this optional step. Depending on the use case, having that cryptographic verification of where an image came from is just as necessary as who is posting it.</p> <p>The uploader can add additional claims you want to make regarding the image. This example demonstrates making a claim about the SpruceID logo.</p> <p>Review and submit the transaction to the blockchain. This page lets you preview the data and submit it to the blockchain. You can go back and fix any errors. Once it’s submitted, it can never be undone. It will be public and permanent.</p><p></p> 4) Verifying a Claim <p>You'll be sent to the verification page once a content authenticity claim has been posted. This page is the public page that others see when examining this content. </p> <p>This page verifies the data and includes cryptographic checks about the credentials, the issuer of those credentials, and the identity of the poster of the claim to ensure they all add up. It also retrieves and displays the content so you can see the content about which a claim was made.</p> Watch a Demo <p>This demo walks you through the same steps above to recap how one would create and verify content authenticity claims.</p> What’s next for Content Authenticity? <p>From the increasing need for solving content trust and verification to our hypothetical example of how this problem could be addressed today, it’s difficult to say exactly how the world will tackle this complex problem. SpruceID has the knowledge and expertise to help tie provable high-assurance identity attributes (such as a mobile driver’s license) into content that is put out to the public in order to elevate the level of trust in the person or entity making the statement. Empowering users to control their identity and personal data across the web is woven into our DNA. We’re excited to share this proof-of-concept to help shape a future with trusted identity and interactions online.</p> <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/digital-identity-now-and-future/digital-identity-today?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More about Digital Identity</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p></p><p></p>

 Change announcements 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in November 2023, we <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">announced</a> the auto-rollout of Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies to automatically protect tenants based on risk signals, licensing, and usage. This is to remind you that Microsoft will begin automatically protecting customers with Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies. These are policies that Microsoft creates and enables in customer tenants. The following policies will be rolled out to all eligible tenants:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Policy&nbsp;</p>


<p>Who it’s for&nbsp;</p>


<p>What it does&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for admin portals&nbsp;</p>


<p>All customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy covers privileged admin roles and requires multifactor authentication when an admin signs into a Microsoft admin portal.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users&nbsp;</p>


<p>Existing per-user multifactor authentication customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy applies to users with per-user multifactor authentication and requires multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It helps organizations transition to Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for high-risk sign-ins&nbsp;</p>


<p>Microsoft Entra ID Premium Plan 2 customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy covers all users and requires multifactor authentication and reauthentication during high-risk sign-ins.&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll begin a gradual rollout of these policies to all eligible tenants and notify in advance. Once the policies are visible in your tenant, you’ll have 90 days to review and customize or disable them before we turn them on. For those 90 days, the policies will be in report-only mode, which means Conditional Access will log the policy results without enforcing them. For more information refer to the blog, “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Automatic Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra streamline identity protection</a>.”  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update on Azure AD Graph Retirement&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June of 2023, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> that described the completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure AD Graph API service. This service is now in the retirement cycle and retirement (shut down) will be done with incremental steps. We’re committed to supporting our customers through this retirement and migration to Microsoft Graph, and we’re committed to increased transparency and communication as we work through this change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Retirement: Stage One &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first stage of Azure AD Graph retirement will begin later in 2024. We’ll share a specific date in a subsequent update, with a minimum of three months of advance notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we enter this first stage, applications that are created after a specific date will encounter an error for requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (<a href="https://graph.windows.net/">https://graph.windows.net</a>). We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph at this point, and we’ll provide an optional configuration to allow applications created after this point to resume use of Azure AD Graph APIs for an extended period. If you develop or distribute software that requires applications to be created as part of the installation or setup, and these applications will need to access Azure AD Graph APIs, you must begin planning to avoid interruption. This optional configuration can be set on an application after it is created, and the configuration change will be done through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http">AuthenticationBehaviors</a> interface.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll provide more detailed guidance on the timeline for this plan and on configuring the optional configuration in our next update.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I find Applications in my tenant using Azure AD Graph APIs? &nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re working to deliver a new experience to help our customers identify applications in their tenant that are using Azure AD Graph APIs. This will be enabled through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/howto-use-recommendations">Microsoft Entra Recommendations</a> experience. We’re expecting to enable this experience in the first months of 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes to audit logs behavior for custom security attributes&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning in October 2023, changes were made to custom security attribute audit logs for general availability that might impact your daily operations. If you’ve been using custom security attribute audit logs during the preview, here are the actions you must take before February 2024 to ensure your audit log operations aren't disrupted:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Use new audit logs location.&nbsp; 
 Assign Attribute Log roles to view audit logs. &nbsp; 
 Create new diagnostic settings to export audit logs.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/custom-security-attributes-manage#changes-to-audit-logs-behavior">Changes to audit logs behavior</a>.  &nbsp;<br> </p>
<p>Changing sign-in audience for new applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will change the default value of 'signInAudience' property in app registration from 'AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount' to 'AzureADMyOrg'. Our analysis shows that most new applications do not ever support users outside the application tenant. This will improve latency and security of apps. For more information on application sign-in audience, refer to the documentation <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0#signinaudience-values">application resource type - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling app instance lock by default&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will have “App instance lock” enabled by default. The capability called App instance lock for workload identities was launched in September 2023. This feature allows app developers to protect their multi-tenant apps from attackers tampering with critical properties. Applications created using Entra ID portal already have the setting enabled by default, and going forward, it will be enabled for other app creation surface areas such as MS Graph, PowerShell, and SDKs. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-configure-app-instance-property-locks">How to configure app instance property lock in your applications | Microsoft Learn</a>.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Account is replacing legacy profile page&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-new-feature-and-change-announcements/ba-p/3796396">announced</a> the legacy profile page will be replaced with a new, modernized experience. This is a reminder that My Account (<a href="https://www.myaccount.microsoft.com/">https://www.myaccount.microsoft.com</a>) will replace the existing Profile page (<a href="https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/profile">https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/profile</a>) by January 2024. My Account enables customers to manage account details, language and privacy settings, security information, and more. My Account has been around for several years and has all the functionality of the legacy profile page. This deprecation is moving customers to a better and more modern experience. No actions are required by the customers, as customers will be automatically directed to the new My Account experience. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, we talked about <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/navigating-the-oauth-maze-in-smb-identity-management/">the risks that come with granting OAuth tokens without restraint</a> across your organization and mentioned two ways to manage this process:</p>
 
 You can periodically check your Google admin console to see what permissions are authorized and manually revoke access where needed.&nbsp; 
 Or you can also easily track this information with YeshID.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Our intuitive dashboards present a comprehensive overview of access to your Google Workspace, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions granted to third-party applications. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And today, we’re making it even easier to gather those insights and take immediate action with new data visualization capabilities in YeshID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s explore how data visualization can play a pivotal role in mitigating risks like data exposure and unintentional oversharing of permissions. We’ll introduce you to our new visualization tool along the way.&nbsp;</p>
 Our risk representation of OAuth scopes&nbsp; 
<p>Humans are really good at pattern recognition, and seeing things drawn or color-coded can help us quickly grasp a concept. In this case, we can use data visualization to provide a granular representation of OAuth scopes (the permissions granted to applications), breaking them down into easily digestible components and allowing you to pinpoint areas of high risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This clarity enables informed decision-making when it comes to understanding exposure from connected applications and adjusting permissions to align with organizational security policies. YeshID’s data visualization breaks OAuth scopes into a digestible color-coded graph so you can easily pinpoint areas of risk. We use <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/production-readiness/sensitive-scope-verification">Google’s sensitive/restricted scope classification system</a> to categorize granted scopes on a green, yellow, red basis. Find an anomaly? We also make it easy to revoke or block access.</p>
 Not just a pretty picture 
<p>Once you have an idea of what looks suspicious, YeshID makes it easy to act with options to revoke, block, or manage applications.</p>
 
 Revoking a third-party application’s access essentially invalidates the access that your users have granted to an application. However, this is temporary and your user could grant permissions again. We allow you to mark it as ‘Forbidden,’ and we will highlight it if access has been regranted. 
 Blocking an OAuth token goes a step further by preventing the associated application from requesting access to the user’s Google Workspace data altogether — a cumbersome process <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en">when done through the Admin Console</a>. 
 
<p>Here it is in action.</p>
<p></p>
 Try YeshID now 
<p>Data visualization within YeshID transforms the complexity of app access management into a visual narrative that’s easier to grasp at a glance. By harnessing the power of visualizations, you can navigate the challenges of OAuth tokens, enhance security measures, and foster a culture of awareness and responsibility among users. <a href="https://yeshid.com/visualization/">Learn more</a>.</p>

  FATF Travel Rule in UAE applies to virtual asset transfers above AED&nbsp;3,500.  VASPs must report sender and recipient details, including names and addresses, for each Travel Rule crypto transaction.  UAE’s AML framework requires strict KYC checks, risk management, and regular monitoring.  <p>In the fast-evolving landscape of global finance, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has emerged as a magnet hub, attracting worldwide interest and capital. Particularly in the realm of Web3, where it’s not just participating but leading the charge. The UAE is setting benchmarks with regulatory frameworks for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), DAOs, metaverses, and other entities pivotal to crypto innovation.</p><p>As the adoption of virtual assets escalates in the UAE, the country moves towards more stringent compliance, in line with local regulations and FATF (Financial Action Task Force) Travel Rule and other recommendations.</p><p>To understand the intricacies of the UAE crypto regulatory environment, we start with <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">the FATF Travel Rule</a> and further explore the nuances of KYC and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML compliance</a> in the&nbsp;UAE.</p> The Travel Rule in the&nbsp;UAE <p>Crafted by the FATF — an international body shaping policies to safeguard the financial system from illicit activities — the Travel Rule aims to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. It requires VASPs and financial institutions to collect and report detailed information for virtual asset transfers. The threshold amount at which the FATF Travel Rule kicks in the UAE is AED&nbsp;3,500.</p><p>Key data points for compliance include:</p>  Sender’s and recipient’s names, addresses, and account or wallet&nbsp;details.  Transaction amounts.  <p>The responsibility lies with the originating VASP to share this information with the beneficiary VASP at the start of the transfer. Thus ensuring each virtual asset movement is accompanied by comprehensive originator and beneficiary data.</p> AML Compliance in the UAE: A Broad Perspective <p>To combat financial crimes, the UAE has rolled out a suite of anti money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations supported by detailed guidelines from various supervisory authorities. These encompass banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, VASPs, and Designated Non-financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs) like real estate agents, auditors, and precious metal&nbsp;dealers.</p><p>Essential elements of the UAE’s AML policies&nbsp;include:</p>  Stringent KYC&nbsp;checks.  Risk screening solutions.  Diligent record-keeping and reporting.  Robust compliance governance.  Appointment of an AML compliance officer.   The Central Bank of the UAE at the&nbsp;Helm <p>The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) serves as the primary financial regulator, overseeing AML compliance. In 2020, it established the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism Supervision Department (AMLD), dedicated to AML and CFT matters and previously managed by the Banking Supervision Department.</p><p>The AMLD’s mission is threefold:</p>  Inspect licensed&nbsp;firms.  Ensure compliance with the country’s AML regulations.  Identify emerging AML/CFT&nbsp;threats.  Collaborating with the UAE cabinet and international bodies to play a vital role in developing AML/CFT legislation and issuing compliance guidance.   FATF AML Compliance in the&nbsp;UAE <p>Following its placement on the FATF’s grey list for strategic deficiencies in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts, the UAE has amplified its compliance initiatives. And now, after making marked progress, the UAE is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cc8f3d4f-ccb0-4bca-93e3-bc2955de446d">on course to exit the grey list</a>, as it has no “non-compliant” ratings with FATF recommendations.</p> KYC Requirements and Processes <p>In the UAE’s AML framework, having a proper <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">KYC process</a> is crucial. Businesses implement KYC procedures to authenticate parties, including potential customers and representatives, safeguarding against illicit financial activities. KYC involves thorough customer profiling, identity verification, and continuous transaction monitoring.</p> Complying With the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The UAE is at the forefront of modernizing its AML/CFT regulatory framework, incorporating digital identification and enhanced detection capabilities. Reflecting this commitment, in January 2023, <a href="https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/government-news/cbuae-issues-new-guidance-on-anti-money-laundering-and-combatting-the-financing-of-terrorism-twamugg0">the CBUAE issued new guidance</a> on using digital identification systems in AML/CFT compliance solutions. This guidance advocates the integration of digital tools for customer onboarding and verification and the use of digital data to identify suspicious activities.</p><p>In line with these regulatory enhancements, VASPs in the UAE are required to implement the FATF Travel Rule through a risk-based AML/CFT solution like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Shyft Veriscope</a>. Besides this, VASPs must also adhere to rigorous risk management and due diligence processes.</p> Risk Management and Due Diligence <p>Risk management involves implementing measures for customer identification, risk assessment, and suspicious activity monitoring and reporting, whereas due diligence is a critical process for identifying and mitigating money laundering risks posed by customers.</p> Training and Awareness <p>Ensuring compliance staff is adequately trained to handle Travel Rule transactions is essential, especially with the increasing sophistication of money laundering techniques. The AML compliance officer plays a key role, overseeing a collective effort to train and ensure all employees are equipped to identify and prevent illicit activities.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Through these efforts, the UAE is establishing itself as a trusted crypto hub, playing a significant role in shaping the future infrastructure of the crypto world. This is not only enhancing the country’s global financial standing but also aligns with its vision of leading in digital economy advancements.</p><p>Overall, by aiming to set a global benchmark in crypto industry standards, the UAE is demonstrating its commitment to creating a secure, efficient, and innovative environment for crypto transactions and developments.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>“Social media really, really helps to connect. There are so many places I’ve gone to and they already know me,” Kisakye&nbsp;says.</p><p>Kisakye is a 30-year-old budding musician in Kampala. She juggles a full-time office job with performing at restaurants and bars on the weekends and weekday evenings. She posts videos of her singing on Instagram and YouTube to promote her talent and get gigs. Kisakye’s positive experience of social media’s impact on gaining visibility and earning an income with creative work are echoed by many youths&nbsp;today.</p><p>As Kisakye’s experience highlights, digitalization is transforming the culture and creative industries. Digital platforms, like Instagram, offer young artists new ways to produce their work and reach a broader range of audiences and consumers within and beyond&nbsp;Uganda.</p><p>A shift to online markets gives creatives <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/104121621556036559/pdf/Cities-Culture-Creativity-Leveraging-Culture-and-Creativity-for-Sustainable-Urban-Development-and-Inclusive-Growth.pdf">greater independence</a> from traditional intermediaries and middlemen (such as publishers or galleries), making the sector a more viable income source for talented youth. Alice, a young creative who trained as a lawyer but today runs a digital content company, shared how she started by publishing blogs&nbsp;online:</p><p>“I started with a blog on WordPress. Just writing simply for the sake of writing because I enjoyed it. Later, I started to really think about what I could do with the space and community I had created not just to provide information and entertainment but also be able to make a living for&nbsp;myself.”</p><p>As digitalization presents new avenues for income generation, young creatives like Kisaskye and Alice have more agency and confidence to chart new paths. Kisakye plans to leave her office job in the future and says social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube will be a central part of her career as a musician.</p><p>But before she quits her job, Kisakye says she needs skills that will support her music career. She wants to learn how to sing better, how to produce music, and how to use digital platforms to reach even bigger audiences. She needs more knowledge about copyright issues and protections. Kisakye is already trying to learn new skills&nbsp;online:</p><p>“I went to YouTube before I did a show and there was this lady telling us how to sing, how to create more space for your vocals. I did it and realized that I had more space to really let my voice move. And, then I realized, ‘oh my gosh, there’s so much I could&nbsp;learn.’”</p><p>Alice, who has considerable experience as a content creator, wants to learn better financial management practices:</p><p>“I think the management of finances is definitely a hard part because now you are working for yourself and you need to know how to move your money and grow it. Building long-term strategies, specifically financially, is a tool we could all&nbsp;use.”</p><p>Together, the skills Alice and Kisakye refer to are what <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou Digital </a>refers to as <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/skillsforadigitalage/">skills for a digital age,</a> a diverse set of skills that go beyond digital skills (using digital platforms, coding, or e-commerce selling) and include others like financial management, business management, project management, and communication skills. These are some of the technical, digital, and soft skills needed to thrive on digital platforms.</p><p>Kisakye, Alice, and 35 other Ugandan creatives shared their experiences as part of Caribou Digital’s research on how young people in the culture and creative industries are navigating and adapting to digitalization-driven changes, with a focus on skills, in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation. They are poets, illustrators, cartoonists, performance artists, writers, podcasters, visual artists, filmmakers, fashion designers, and gamers, all between ages 18 and 35 and based in&nbsp;Kampala.</p><p>Caribou Digital conducted this research in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation under their Young Africa Works initiative, which aims to enable 30 million young Africans, 70% of whom will be women, to access dignified and fulfilling work by 2030. The Foundation views the creative industry in Africa as one of the pathways to employment for young people, particularly if they have the right&nbsp;skills.</p><p>The research includes four&nbsp;outputs:</p>  <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Skilling-Ugandas-young-creatives-for-a-digital-age-A-way-forward.pdf">Overall Executive summary: Skilling Uganda’s young creatives for a digital age: A way&nbsp;forward</a>  <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Skills-for-a-digital-age-for-Ugandas-young-creatives.pdf">Findings: Skills for a digital age for Uganda’s young creatives</a>  <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Skilling-Ugandas-young-creatives-for-a-digital-age-Recommendations.pdf">Skilling Uganda’s young creatives for a digital age: Recommendations</a>  <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ugandas-culture-and-creative-industries-in-a-digital-age-A-landscape-review.pdf">Uganda’s culture and creative industries in a digital age: A landscape review</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/ugandas-young-creatives-a-case-for-more-skills-for-a-digital-age-da0f331f2b25">Uganda’s young creatives: A case for more skills for a digital age.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>For anyone <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/how-can-you-protect-your-gpt/500642">paying attention</a> to the OpenAI DevDay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk">announcements</a> a few weeks ago, Gizmodo’s recent article “<a href="https://gizmodo.com/security-vulnerabilities-openai-chatgpt-custom-gpt-1851057912">Be Careful What You Tell OpenAI’s GPTs</a>” shouldn’t come as news. (To refresh everyone’s memory, “GPTs” were announced as OpenAI’s platform for building custom agents that can be shared as apps with other users.) It was clear from the demos and presentations that the GPT Store will expose to the public your prompts, the “Knowledge” files you upload, the APIs used for “Actions,” and any metadata your GPT employs. YouTube videos like <a href="https://youtu.be/gEf0BPkqQSM">this one</a> even demonstrate in detail how shockingly easy it is to acquire this information with a few simple hacks.</p>
<p>Apart from the obvious security concerns, it also invalidates any commercial value promised by the GPT Store because there can essentially be no proprietary intellectual property—the GPT Store will simply become one giant copy machine.</p>
<p>But then, maybe we don’t need the GPT Store to be so much an innovation center as a relationship store (as in “storage” in this case). This is something I proposed at our recent cyberevolution conference in my presentation, “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5437/3">Thanks to AI, the Future of Security is Collaborative</a>.” It’s a concept that bears repeating in this context.</p>
 The App Store was Never Actually About You, Anyway 
<p>Apple is lauded profusely for its human-centric design. But I posit that it merely seems user-friendly—it’s actually a developer-centric design with enough glitz to retain the attention of us normals. As Exhibit A, I offer the home screen of the iPhone. Let’s say you want to send your friend Sam a message; the first problem you’re confronted with is which messaging app to use. In your mind, you have to work through a matrix, which looks something like this:</p>



App
When to use
Why use it now?


Apple Messages
Blue contacts (aka “not green”)
Easy access and group chats


WhatsApp

Skype
General purpose
If nothing else seems appropriate at the time



<p>Table 1: A rubric for deciding which messaging app to use right now (e-mail apps excluded)</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, I prompted Stability.ai’s DreamStudio to generate a phone with only messaging apps on the home screen (no need to reverse-engineer the prompt, I provide it for you). The “message” of the image is of course to satirize the consternation this screen evokes in the human who faces so many nuanced options simply to message a friend. I think DreamStudio got this one exactly right because the text under the weird icons isn’t even intelligible 😀.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, who actually benefits from the App Store approach? It’s clearly not the user. Unsurprisingly, App stores are for the sellers and the apps represent a relationship between you and the developer. If you want to chat with a friend, you’ll first need to figure out which of your developer friends you want to broker that message.</p>
 Not Apps, not GPTs—GPme 
<p>I got an e-mail from OpenAI on December 1st, reiterating the company’s desire to empower “builders” with more tools and announcing the launch of the GPT store “early next year.” (Note: e-mail seems a rather old-fashioned way to communicate information about GPTs; but it’s ubiquitous, so I guess that’s the kind of calculation they made in the marketing department.) In case you didn’t get the message, here it is:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Short and to the point—not even any mention of Sam Altman. Perfect. But the e-mail reinforces the point that OpenAI is courting “builders” (erstwhile developers) rather than the natural inhabitants of AI space: personas.</p>
<p>Whether the economic incentives of OpenAI will prove sustainable for builders remains to be seen; but the platform can already support persona-to-persona relationships on the internet. Let me explain.</p>
<p>In my cyberevolution presentation, I introduced a new species, one that lives natively on the internet: Homo ex machina. I asked ChatGPT for a definition and got a surprisingly well-thought-out response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Homo ex machina" is a Latin phrase that could be translated into English as "Man from the machine." This phrase seems to be a play on the term "deus ex machina," which means "god from the machine" and refers to a plot device where a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected intervention. "Homo ex machina" could imply a human being emerging from or created by a machine, possibly referring to the concept of artificial intelligence or cybernetic organisms in a philosophical or literary context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my view, GPTs shouldn’t be viewed as a kitchen appliance like Talkie Toaster or a sentient being like I, Robot, which are separate from natural persons; rather, they should make natural persons more like an internet-native version of Iron Man. DALL-E seemed to get it right away—on the first prompt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DALL-E prompt: A human with a superhero suit on that bestows god-like powers</p>
<p>A GPme (working title) is a personal power up that combines your humanity with superpowers. Your apparent intelligence will be near genius level; your knowledge will be encyclopedic; your linguistic skills will extend to fluency in dozens of languages; your creativity will be unbounded. You may even become a decent driver.</p>
 How GPme Storage would Foster Trustful Relationships 
<p>What we really want those icons on our home screens to represent is the totality of our relationships—our relationships to other people, other GPme’s, groups, businesses, governments, and even our enemies. Behind each of those social emoticons lies an avatar representing our personal interests in that relationship. The GPme would retain all the history, all the promises, all the aspirations as well as an accounting of the contributions made and the current status of the relationship. In this way, relationships will become more symmetrical, fair, and trustful.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A GPme for All Seasons</p>
 GPme’s also change the game for decentralized identity 
<p>For the decentralized identity crowd out there (including all the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a> folks), take notice: by using GPTs (or similar agents such as Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio">CoPilots</a>) as a relationship aggregator rather than an app store, we have the beginnings of a new type of decentralized identity. It’s not a wallet, it’s not a self-sovereign identity (SSI), and it’s not a decentralized identifier (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>). Instead, we have a (for lack of digital term) fully fleshed out GPT relationship store, which provides a way for individuals to maintain the totality of their relationships with the assistance of powerful AIs. And beyond providing mere channels for connectivity (as messaging apps do), these GPT relationships could function as a trust base.</p>
<p>This in turn would form a network of decentralized trust anchors consisting of persona-to-persona relationships. In this context, the identity data and metadata wouldn’t need to be directly tied to the natural persons who own or operate these personas, enhancing privacy tremendously.</p>
<p>Returning to SSI, ledgers have an important role to play in GPT relationship stores. Whereas apps are at risk from information exposure, revealing information about your GPT relationships turns out to be very helpful from a trust perspective. In fact, information about your GPT relationships should be public, and verifiable, like on a ledger. This approach enables reputation and cost signaling, which are proven to foster interparty trust (see <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-future-of-security-is-collaborative-cre23">my cyberevolution slides</a> for references as well as my recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti">Advisory Note</a> on distributed identity).</p>
<p>In summary, using swarms of GPme’s, natural persons can empower GPT actors to both protect them in a hostile, foreboding internet while engaging in meaningful and productive relationships.</p>

 We interview experts from the world of financial services, crypto and gambling to discover some of the year’s major regulatory and technological surprises, and the trends awaiting the identity verification sector in 2024. 



 



<p>We click, we scroll, we awkwardly stare at the camera, and we do that ‘press, but don’t actually press, just lightly rest it upon the side button thing’ every single day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we approach 2024, it’s no exaggeration to say we spend most of our lives online; personally, and professionally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, we’re probably not too many years away from our digital selves becoming more trusted and, in a way, able to do more than our soft, fleshy human forms. Able to register, transact and be recognized quicker and more effectively online than in person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every industry has gone digital. Fact. It’s not even a controversial and outlandishly sci-fi statement to make anymore. We buy, we sell, we save, we transact, we subscribe and gamble – all online, often without physically interacting with another person, whether in person or online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if we’re spending more time online, then it’s important to be able to prove our identity – that we are who we say we are, and that the people we’re interacting with are who they claim to be. This is where industry regulations, rules and established processes like identity verification data and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> come into play. Laws ensure online users behave in a legally binding and appropriate way.</p>



 Accountability vs anonymity. 



<p>But, what about an internet user’s right to remain anonymous and even more importantly, their right to privacy? &nbsp;</p>



<p>The desire for anonymity may not necessarily be rooted in the wish to engage in illegal activities away from prying eyes, but more as a genuine concern for how their personal identifiable information and other important data could be hacked and tracked or even used for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How to balance accountability with anonymity has been a conundrum since the internet was first invented and is a recurring bone of contention whenever new regulation or frameworks are created. The ongoing, fractious exchanges on the details of the proposed Electronic Identification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS 2.0) have been testament to that. More on that later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite tech titans’ claims to the contrary, there is no simple one-size fits all answer to the question of how to offer both anonymity and privacy. If there was, organizations would never be fined for internal failings like AML and KYC deficiencies; users would never fall victim to fraud; and the internet would be a wonderland, free from financial crime, scams and hate speech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A potential answer lies in the balancing act between the needs of the corporation and the needs of the consumer, in the open and ongoing dialogue between regulatory decisionmakers and industry insiders for the common purpose of a secure and attractive marketplace, and in the clever deployment of technology that can optimize processes while ensuring a superior digital customer experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this blog, we speak to our Spotlight Interview alumni, as well as IDnow’s own experts to discover the sector developments that have surprised them in 2023, and what trends they predict will have the most impact in 2024.</p>

<p></p>
 
 



 Is that the real you, or is that just your identity? 



<p>The global digital identity solution market is projected to grow from <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/digital-identity-solutions-market-247527694.html">$34.5 billion in 2023</a> to a staggering $83.2 billion by 2028. The main reasons for the growth are the increasing usage of online services (across an ever-expanding range of sectors and use cases); the introduction of more cost-effective AI/ML-powered services; and the rise in SME adoption of identity management solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that the digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Indeed, there were <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">61 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2023</a>, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of 2024. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are simply staggering.</p>



 Is traditional banking dead? 



<p>Unsurprisingly, considering how important identity checks are in heavily regulated industries like financial services, the banking sector performed the lion’s share of identity verification checks in 2023 (37 billion), which is more than half of the global identification market. The days of visiting branches to verify your identity to open a bank account, or make a transaction payment are nearing the end, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb3f99a2-bd4c-4ba1-8cb9-432ecfbf73ab">closures of approximately one in eight bank branches</a> in the UK in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>In 2023, we’ve seen a lot of interest in FinTechs, including neobanks. The digital-only trend has certainly not gone unnoticed by traditional banks, which are now looking into what technologies and what partners can do to help them improve aspects such as user experience.&nbsp;</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto and FinTech at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>The use of technology to optimize operational efficiencies, enhance customer experience and ultimately reduce fraud has become pivotal, regardless of the sector, but especially in financial services. Financial services are often at the forefront of technological innovation and leading the charge toward safer and more secure environments for transacting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Little wonder then that the global growth in volume of identity verification checks has been <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">driven largely by banks adopting stronger biometric identity</a> verification methods in a bid to combat fraud, in particular account takeover and card-not-present fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It will come as no surprise that financial services continue to be the industry most exposed to fraudsters,” said Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow. “Fraudsters and the technology at their disposal are becoming increasingly more sophisticated.”</p>



 The never-ending cat and mouse game of fraud prevention. 



<p>The amount of money lost to fraud is staggering. In the UK alone, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">approximately £3 billion is lost every single year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting on 2023, Lovro said that there were three things that surprised him:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“First was the rapid rise of social engineering, from phone calls to SMS, emails, phishing, everything has increased. The second surprise for me is that physical document fraud has almost completely disappeared – it’s not zero, but it’s a very steep curve down. Unfortunately, the quality of fraudulent documents has improved dramatically, with hologram production at such a high level now that they’re more difficult to detect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third development that surprised Lovro in 2023 was how innovative many fraudsters have become regarding the use of synthetic fraud, synthetic identities and deepfakes.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I thought it would take another few years before we got to this stage. Up until very recently, synthetic fraud was very rudimentary, but it is getting much better and more sophisticated.</p>Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>As identity verification methods like liveness checks are known to prevent spoofing and other types of fraud, organizations that have not been using biometric verification methods in 2023 should be doing so in 2024 to protect their business, their customers, and their reputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the use of the latest forms of identity verification technology can certainly help organizations learn more about their customers, and thereby prevent fraud in the process, there are certain types of social engineering fraud, like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams</a> that take advantage of human emotional frailty, so are harder to safeguard against.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ex-police officer and self-professed fraud nerd, Paul Stratton agrees that the increase in social engineering is a worrying trend that will unfortunately continue into 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Romance and ‘repeat victimization’ fraud (e.g.: a romance fraud victim is steered into investment fraud) will continue to prosper. Breaking the cycle of manipulation and coercion is almost impossible when that person believes it is all legitimate… This is when banks and financial institutions must step in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-jinisha-bhatt/"> Jinisha Bhatt, AML and crypto fraud investigator</a>, who also dedicates a lot of her time researching and helping to prevent human trafficking, it’s also important to factor in the link between social engineering fraud, and human trafficking violations.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Today, highly organized scam compounds run rampant in countries like Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar and force ‘workers’ to groom, manipulate and defraud victims of romance and investment scams worldwide.</p>Jinisha Bhatt, AML and crypto fraud investigator.</blockquote>



<p>“The larger the pool of financial fraud victims, the higher the demand for scam factory workers. This is a machine that continues to feed itself at an insurmountable cost to human beings on each end of the cycle. While we focus our efforts on preventing pig butchering scams, we must also continue to enhance international cooperation among law enforcement and strengthen measures to impose human rights-related sanctions against entities and individuals who profit from this crime.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever the reason banks or any organization chooses to overhaul their customer onboarding process and internal controls, an identity verification platform that can address the aforementioned three driving forces: optimize operational efficiencies, enhance customer experience, reduce fraud – will further accelerate the mass adoption of digital identity verification services.</p>



<p>As consumers become more wary about sharing their PII data due to privacy concerns or the risk of data breaches and the rise of identity theft, synthetic identity fraud or account takeover there is a need for organizations to switch their focus from frictionless user journeys to optimized user journeys with ‘good friction’ that not only deters fraudsters but also increases consumer confidence and trust in the organizations onboarding process. It is a balance between convenience and security for consumer confidence that needs to be carefully managed.</p>



 Play time’s over: The year that crypto was forced to grow up. 



<p>As a sector that by its very existence questions the limitations of established systems and structures, it is understandable that many crypto firms experiment with new ways of doing business, with some even making the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">risky decision to forgo traditional KYC checks</a> altogether. While 2023 proved an important and somewhat stabilizing year for the evolution of the industry, with both the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets regulatory framework</a>,( MiCA) and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed regulatory regime,</a> taking significant steps toward completion, it was also a somewhat unsettled year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think what surprised me most about 2023 was the sheer level of turbulence. In fact, there is still ongoing litigation with many major crypto names. Reassuringly however, this hasn’t halted innovation, which is what crypto is all about. We saw the likes of Worldcoin launch, which is a new take on identity and proof of personhood, so it’s these kinds of developments that show that crypto is making significant strides in the right direction,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24d153b0-0c28-4946-acbe-2e93329bca52">convict the founder of FTX of money laundering</a> and fraud sent shockwaves through the industry and should act as a warning shot that the upstart industry of crypto needs to play by the established rules of financial services, especially regarding Anti-Money Laundering directives, and KYC processes. Is play time over for crypto? If not, then the days of transacting in complete anonymity, without restrictions, and of celebrities promoting unregulated platforms, certainly are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the digital identity verification industry, and to an extent, the wider technological community is sure to admire the innovative steps taken by crypto to think outside the box in 2023, regulatory bodies are losing patience. And with 2024 likely to be the year that the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer of Funds Regulation</a>,&nbsp; MiCA, and the UK’s equivalent will be implemented, that patience is sure to be tested more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some argue that existing and upcoming crypto requirements are too harsh, prohibitively so, especially the UK’s financial promotions regime for crypto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of crypto firms currently perceive <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-promotions-uk-crypto/">financial promotions</a> as a massive burden and barrier of entry to the UK market. I hope the restrictions are softened somewhat in 2024, otherwise what we may find is a reduction in number of crypto firms in the UK market, which may, in turn push crypto users to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/">either grey market platforms or to offshore operators</a>, which would surely put a dent in the UK’s plans to become an international crypto hub,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, though, Jason remains optimistic about the state of crypto in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re on the cusp of new individuals and new flows entering the crypto space, which will be a very beneficial development and hopefully lead to a more positive crypto environment in 2024. Also, in March of next year, we will see the bitcoin halving, which is an exciting time for the crypto market, because the rate of supply of newly mined bitcoin is halved.”</p>



 



 

 



 



 Regulatory reflection: Betting on an online future. 



<p>Creating regulatory frameworks that not only protect the consumer, but also provide an attractive environment for operators is essentially the role of regulation, and regulatory bodies from around the world have certainly been busy this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the above crypto frameworks to the reassessment of existing gambling regulations in as disparate markets as the UK and Curaçao, 2023 has reminded every industry, especially gambling, of the importance, and opportunity of regularly updated regulation. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“One of the major surprises in the gambling industry for 2023 was that Brazil is now firmly on track to regulate both sports betting and online casinos, it’s the right thing to do because regulating the full portfolio of products will be critical to the success of the Brazilian market, including the ability of the authorities to clamp down on the grey market of operators that choose not to apply for a license,” said Martin Lycka, SVP American Regulatory Affairs and Responsible Gambling at Entain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Elsewhere in LatAm, Peru and Chile have been exploring regulation in 2023, and I do think that North American markets and regulators will also be keeping a close eye on proceedings too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our own gambling expert, Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk agreed with Martin regarding the sunny outlook for the LatAm online gambling market and expressed his pleasant surprise at the pace of gambling regulation in Brazil.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting on 2023, Roger did admit that not all surprises were of the positive variety.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>One of the major surprises for me was learning of the increasing numbers of German players that were migrating to the grey market, due in part to the high tax rates subjected to regulated platforms, and other player restrictions.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Director of Global Gambling at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>Such restrictions include 5 second spin durations, €1 stake limit, and €1000 max deposit per month across all licensed operators. In a bid to cut costs, operators who are compliant and licensed in Germany may decide to either pull out of the market, reduce their sponsorship budget (which will negatively impact grassroots sports), or focus on other markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a lose-lose, and not a great situation for the German economy, but I remain positive that German regulators will take the time to assess the situation and perhaps reevaluate its tax strategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discover more about the battle currently being waged on black market gambling in Germany in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exploring-black-market-gambling-in-germany/">blog, ‘Exploring black market gambling in Germany.’</a></p>



<p>Roger also believes that while the UK market is doing the right thing by <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">running a series of consultations</a> on revisions to its online gambling regulation, like proposed <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">financial risk checks</a>, he did worry about the impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, much like the player exodus in Germany, I fear that 2024 may see UK players start to gravitate to the grey market unless upcoming regulatory changes are attractive to both the market and players.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can regulation ever have a negative impact upon a market’s growth? For Martin, it’s a delicate balancing act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It might be stating the obvious, but if regulations are introduced and it’s required to be implemented, then it’s for good reason in the long run and is money worth spent. But there is a fine line to tread between overly onerous regulation that may not be adding any value, and regulation that is efficient.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the gambling industry can teach us anything, it’s that the pace at which the digital world moves means the need for agile, and regularly updated frameworks and guidelines is paramount to ensure industry players operate in a fair and transparent environment.</p>

 Balancing act: The role of regulation. 



<p>Whatever the industry, there is perhaps no regulation or requirement as important in the digital identification space as KYC. This is why KYC, in some form or another, is mandatory in most industries, including financial services, crypto, gambling, among others. Despite its origins dating way back to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpis-F6rGCAxX8X0EAHTPAAoQQFnoECBAQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dowjones.com%2Fprofessional%2Frisk%2Fglossary%2Fknow-your-customer%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DKYC%2520regulations%2520originated%2520from%2520years%2Cand%25202008%2520global%2520financial%2520crisis.&amp;usg=AOvVaw2o_D_jE3NQ3Ig7i62H2uso&amp;opi=89978449">1970, with the passing of the Bank Secrecy Act</a>, KYC regulations and requirements are regularly updated, with most notable and significant revisions occurring following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the 2008 global financial crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Changes to the KYC process can also occur whenever changes to associated regulations like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> are made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jinisha has been pleasantly surprised by some of this year’s developments regarding AML and is eagerly awaiting the domino effect of clearer and more consistent legislation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“After hundreds of iterations to AML regimes and endless conversations on beneficial ownership registries, it seems that the global financial crime sector is ready to mobilize support for effective ‘transparency’. As per <a href="https://transparencycanada.ca/news/billc42updatesnovember2-2023">Transparency International</a>, 132 countries have made commitments to beneficial ownership registries. Many G7 and G20 countries have adopted the ‘Open Ownership’s Beneficial Ownership Data Standard’ to ensure their national registries are interoperable with the rest of the world’s. These standards will eventually help us uncover connections between opaque shell corporations, sanctions evaders, and PEPs across the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the concept of AML and KYC has remained the same over the years, the importance and how they are used has changed dramatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Banks are beginning to understand that KYC checks can be seamlessly integrated into the client onboarding process, eliminating the need for customers to feel burdened by them,” said Vivek Mishra, Operations Manager at WNS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital identification solutions are also increasingly being used to enable customers to authenticate their identity online without submitting any physical proof. The focus on the customer experience is a good thing, since it indicates that banks are beginning to prioritize their clients at last. Additionally, it implies that KYC checks are getting more successful and efficient, which is excellent news for banks and their clients,” said Vivek.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increasingly multi-purpose use of KYC, the current and second iteration of eIDAS, and national AML laws are just three regulations and requirements that have greatly improved safeguards in digital transactions for regulated market sectors in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rayissa Armata, Director of Global&nbsp;Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow, said that although many positive steps were taken this year, she stressed the importance of careful route-planning and ongoing collaboration with relevant stakeholders to ensure that the European Union gets important regulation like eIDAS 2.0 right.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>There is still more that needs to be done and the challenge is to support an aligned framework that remains reliable, innovative and secure. IDnow fully supports the call for building a more harmonized framework that addresses interoperability, innovation, and most importantly – security.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director of Global&nbsp;Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>Rayissa added that future frameworks should therefore factor in the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Identification that can be reused across borders and sectors (public and private)<br>  Establishing standards for developments in technology with appropriate levels of security<br>  Continued collaboration between the public and private sectors&nbsp;  



<p>For Viky Manaila, President of Cloud Signature Consortium, the next few years will prove crucial for the global digital identity landscape.</p>



<p>“eIDAS 2.0 regulation and its evolution during the trilogue surprised everybody in the identity ecosystem, with positive and less positive amendments. As it comes close to the final destination, the next period will be critical for defining the implementing acts, the standards in support of the new services and certification scheme with cross-border interoperability in mind.”</p>

 2023: The year when digital identity became must-have. 



<p>This year’s growth in popularity of identity verification solutions can partly be attributed to the adoption of additional new use cases, for example in facilitating remote recruitment. In fact, 2023 could be categorized as the year that organizations began to unlock, or at least peek through the peephole into the future of how digital identity verification could potentially be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some EU states have made significant developments in their own digital identity systems, such as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/ukraines-digital-identity-app-growing-and-becoming-an-inspiration-for-other-countries">Ukraine’s digital identity app, Diia,</a> which is used for storing biometric passports, tax IDs and driver licenses, to access private and public services, others are taking a much more considered approach to modernizing their identity landscape. For example, the UK has <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fca-digital-ids/">introduced the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> – a set of rules and standards for identity verification service providers to follow in order to offer certain use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although each country will naturally have its own idea of how it wants its citizens to use their digital identities, the future success of digital identity and the digital wallet will invariably be linked to its interoperability, across sectors (public and private), and across regions. For that to happen, however, a standard and generally agreed-upon course forward needs to be set, which of course requires intensive discussions from all interested parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) published a technical report analysing selective disclosure and zero knowledge proofs for the EUDI Wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sebastian Elfors, Senior Architect at IDnow, who co-authored the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119400_119499/119476/01.01.01_60/tr_119476v010101p.pdf">ETSI paper</a>, said: “The report has received tremendous interest from the industry, with constructive feedback from the self-sovereign identity community and experts in W3C, GSMA, and several other standardization organizations. The EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) and ETSI and CEN remain on standby to provide the relevant standards and certification schemes for the EUDI Wallet and Qualified Trust Service Providers under eIDAS 2.0.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remaining cautiously optimistic on the future of digital identity, Viky said: “The new commercial models for services around identity proofing, and verifiable credentials on top of the Wallets have the potential to unleash the missing part of digital transformation. If these services are customer-centric designed, they will take off. Otherwise, they will become just another type of digital platform asking for all sorts of personal information.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although 2023 has seen the ongoing development of pivotal regulations like eIDAS 2.0, alongside the introduction of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/world-coin-crypto-iris/">new ways of identifying customers, such as iris scans</a>, the pace of development in the digital identity space hasn’t suited everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m surprised by how many times I still have to enter passwords given that Apple, Google and Microsoft are all implementing the passkeys standard. Only yesterday it took me three guesses to remember my telco password and I had to do a password reset on one of my American bank accounts. Please make it stop!</p>David Birch, global advisor and thought leader in financial services.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>However, David did admit that the upcoming ISO mobile driving licence, which both Google and Apple have added to their wallets is sure to accelerate adoption and put Wallets fairly and squarely in the public discourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consumers will rapidly become comfortable with this mode of presenting standardized credentials in both face to face and remote environments,” added David.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although it’s difficult to predict the future of digital identity verification with any kind of certainty, it is highly likely that it will continue to be used for ever-increasing and multi-purpose use cases, and that any changes that do occur will be precipitated by a combination of technological advancement, regulatory input, fraud trends, and, of course, consumer preference.</p>



 Risks vs rewards: AI and the modern workplace.&nbsp; 



<p>There’s a reason why <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-67271252">Collins Dictionary named AI</a> the word of the year in 2023. Artificial intelligence was on the lips of every organization (and unfortunately every fraudster) this year, and with good reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The potential of generative AI, in particular, has many organizations salivating over their budget sheets due to AI’s ability to automate, augment and accelerate working processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a safe bet, therefore, that industries will continue to experiment with AI-powered processes in 2024. In fact, many industries are already reaping the benefits of AI to increase automation, reduce costs and offer more accurate and streamlined identity verification methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vivek certainly recognizes the value in doing so: “I anticipate that as banks and other financial institutions strive to increase their efficiency and security in 2024, AI-powered KYC and banking solutions will become even more widely adopted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it’s important to not delegate all tasks to AI. Yes, AI and technology in general, can be used as a competitive advantage, but success in 2024 and beyond will almost certainly come from the clever combination of humans and technology, and recognizing the relative merits of both. In identity verification, this may mean AI is reserved for simpler data-scouring tasks, freeing up resources and enabling staff to concentrate on more difficult jobs, like performing manual identity verification checks on high assurance use cases, or delivering more personalized, superior customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, AI has also been weaponized by fraudsters. While in the past, cybercriminals needed a certain base level of technical skills to produce fake documents or websites, AI-augmented fraudsters can utilize generative AI to create authentic-looking documents, videos, images and audio. A trend that will continue in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I expect to see an increase in the use of AI for fraudulent purposes, which makes the innovative use of AI to combat it, and fingerprint scanning and biometric analysis all the more important, alongside human input,” added Lovro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is your organization prepared for the future?</p>



 Inclusivity and accessibility: Making the connected world a safer, fairer place. 



<p>As our digital identities become more established and entrenched in regulations and legal frameworks, it’s important to remember the importance of collaboration on the common goal of making a safer, more secure online world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, IDnow made significant strides toward making the connected world a safer place, becoming the only European identity verification provider to be awarded two certifications for the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/pvid-certification-idcheck-io-and-videoident/">French remote identity verification standard known as PVID</a> (prestataire de verification d’identité à distance) at ‘substantial’ level. We also became certified by the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/diatf-certified-framework-identity-verirification-provider/">UK’s Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework.</a> </p>



<p>IDnow prides itself as being at the very forefront of innovation in identity verification, and believes that with a layered, holistic approach to identity, businesses can elevate trust and empower experience across the customer journey – no matter the region, industry, or required regulatory compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Research and Developments teams have been hard at work throughout 2023; contributing on projects as far ranging as a toolkit to identify and mitigate biases in AI algorithms to the verification of optical variable device (holograms). Our Product team has also been working tirelessly to update, improve and optimize our digital identity verification services, making them the most complete IDV solutions on the market. Such updates include IDnow’s&nbsp;360 Signals, which detects attempts of repeat fraud, by collecting risk signals from biometrics, documents, devices and other data sources to detect single and serial fraud attempts in real time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have some exciting upcoming developments, including paper photocopy detection, automatic bank account ownership verification and plans to implement WCAG Level AA to ensure our services can be used by people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inclusiveness and accessibility will continue to be an important topic in 2024 and beyond, and <a href="https://www.bundesfachstelle-barrierefreiheit.de/DE/Fachwissen/Produkte-und-Dienstleistungen/Barrierefreiheitsstaerkungsgesetz/barrierefreiheitsstaerkungsgesetz_node.html">organizations will soon be legally required</a> to provide a certain level of accessabilty in their solutions or face legal reprecusssions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many factors that lead to inequality in identity verification. Age, disability, neurodiversity, lack of docs for proof or identity or lack of photo are all problems that identity verification providers must improve to provide access to digital services for all. Bridging these gaps requires inclusive design, technological adaptations, and policies addressing diverse accessibility needs, to ensure equitable digital service access for all. IDnow’s video verification enables organizations to improve inclusivity, accessibility, safety, and convenience for all their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have valued and trusted relationships with various international police and counter fraud organizations, including INTERPOL, and the French Scientific Police (the forensics arm of the police) with whom we exchange knowledge and share best practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is these relationships and these industry insights that allow us to move quickly and keep abreast of industry trends and developments to offer a comprehensive&nbsp;multi-jurisdictionally compliant identity verification solution. For example, in preparation for the opening of the Brazilian online gambling market, we integrated <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/automated-cpf-database-checks-brazilian-gambling/">CPF database checks</a>. Our market-leading identity verification services enable our clients from a variety of sectors to benefit from our proprietary fraud prevention technology and regulatory expertise to provide peace of mind that wherever they operate, and in whatever industry, they can do so compliantly.</p>



 



 

 



 



 The sky is the limit? 



<p>Another major milestone for IDnow in 2023 included the launch of ShopIdent in gas stations throughout Germany. The on-site identification solution enables customers to activate pre-paid SIM cards, open bank accounts, or verify driver’s licenses directly from their local gas station.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, perhaps the most exciting project that we were involved with in 2023 was assisting the International Air Transport Association (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/iata-first-integrated-journey-digital-identity/">IATA) in creating the first ever integrated digital identity travel experience</a>, streamlining the process from flight shopping to arrival. In the Proof-of-Concept trial, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a> was used to store and present digital travel credentials, such as boarding passes and digital visas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We look forward to 2024 with optimism and excitement for what the future holds. While the future of digital identity verification may be uncertain, one thing’s for sure, the sky is no longer the limit.</p>

<p>I am very excited to announce that 1Kosmos is an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/integrating-amazon-cognito-with-1kosmos-blockid-for-enhanced-security-and-user-experience/">official AWS Cognito Passwordless MFA partner.</a></p>
<p>Amazon Cognito places the utmost importance on online account security. To bolster the protection of account holders, starting in 2024, Amazon Cognito made it a goal to expand its multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements, ultimately partnering with 1Kosmos to help the Amazon Cognito team reach its customer security initiatives.</p>
 A Better MFA 
<p>It’s no secret that MFA significantly augments the security of web and mobile applications by necessitating additional identification methods beyond just a password. By implementing various forms of MFA organizations can effectively mitigate the risks associated with user account takeovers, phishing attacks, and password breaches.</p>
<p>To take things a step further, users can elevate their account security through biometric authentication features like TouchID (fingerprint), FaceID and LiveID (a 1Kosmos architectural advantage). Additionally, it offers one-time passwords (OTP) through SMS and email, time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) via a linked mobile authenticator, and push notifications. This flexibility empowers Amazon customers to select the MFA methods that best align with the requirements of their application ecosystem.</p>
 User Experience is Important 
<p>The team at Amazon Cognito places delivering a seamless user experience high on its list of requirements, and that is why partnering with 1Kosmos was a perfect fit. The 1Kosmos MFA capabilities provide a diverse array of authentication choices to accommodate a broad spectrum of users and devices, all with a similar user experience. The 1Kosmos BlockID and Amazon Cognito partnership strikes the right balance between security and usability when developing customer-facing applications.</p>
 Easy Access to Passwordless 
<p>1Kosmos is a trusted AWS Partner and AWS Marketplace Seller offering BlockID and passwordless MFA solutions to elevate online account security. The platform boasts FIDO2 and NIST 800-63-3 certifications, further affirming its reliability. Amazon Cognito customers can easily deploy and directly acquire BlockID through the AWS Marketplace, enabling the implementation of a phishing-resistant passwordless MFA solution.</p>
 Identity Verification 
<p>An optional capability of the 1Kosmos platform, 1Kosmos BlockID provides organizations an automated and cryptographically secure way to verify a virtually unlimited array of identity details including government issued ID, education qualifications, healthcare data, financial account details, and other third-party machine-readable personal information while respecting an individual’s privacy. This provides progressively higher levels of identity assurance for authentication and digitally transforms a broad range of business processes such as worker or contractor onboarding, new customer account origination, and provisioning of digital services.</p>
 Combination of Verification and Authentication 
<p>This capability of the BlockID cloud service has been meticulously crafted to combat identity impersonation, thwart account takeovers, and prevent fraudulent activities, all while offering a user-friendly and frictionless login experience.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID leverages identity-based verification to transparently authenticate users, effectively shielding against account compromises and fraudulent activities. The result of implementing BlockID identity verification with the integration of Amazon Cognito enables organizations to have a higher level of assurance for the users they have under management.</p>
 Privacy by Design 
<p>The 1Kosmos decentralized private blockchain technology empowers individuals with exclusive access and full control over their personally identifiable information, ensuring a privacy-centric design. This approach allows end users to review and authorize or decline the sharing of their data with online services they want to utilize. All personally identifiable information (PII) undergoes end-to-end encryption, guaranteeing that it remains shielded from exposure. Users can directly grant or deny sharing requests to the applications they connect with, without any involvement of third-party intermediaries, such as external public key servers or messaging hosts, ensuring that their data, keys, and plain text messages remain inaccessible to these entities.</p>
 More About 1Kosmos 
<p>Our platform encrypts and securely stores biometrics and ID data within a private, permissioned blockchain, safeguarding user data against potential breaches. BlockID is not only certified to NIST Identity Assurance Level 2 but also compliant with Level 3, showcasing a steadfast commitment to upholding and advancing identity assurance and regulatory compliance.</p>

<p>Effective collaboration is essential for organizations to innovate, make decisions, and drive progress. Over the past few decades, digital technologies have dramatically expanded how we are able to collaborate remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>The introduction of tools like email, instant messaging, wikis, and video conferencing enabled new ways for distributed teams to communicate and work together.</p><p>More recently, all-in-one SaaS collaboration suites from vendors like Slack, Microsoft, and Google have been widely adopted by companies looking to centralize their key business applications.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as remote and hybrid work environments become more prevalent, teams are finding that centralized legacy models for digital collaboration have limitations. This is driving the exploration of distributed and decentralized frameworks that offer greater <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/walkaway-or-why-forking-matters/">control, transparency, and flexibility</a>.</p> The Rise of Centralized Collaboration Suites <p>In the early 2000s, the rise of software as a service (SaaS) paved the way for full-fledged collaboration suites delivered through the cloud. Vendors like Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce began providing bundled productivity and communication applications all under one platform.</p><p>According to Ian Tien, CEO of Mattermost, “When I started, I was at Microsoft, right? And collaboration was easy. It was all through the intranet on a centralized server.”&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last decade, this market has continued rapidly expanding. Tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Workspace have become essential platforms that consolidate messaging, video meetings, file sharing, knowledge management, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>While early digital tools enabled discrete modes of teamwork, these centralized suites aim to be comprehensive one-stop shops.&nbsp;</p><p>In the interview, Tien notes that customers are looking to “integrate [tools] with all your different infrastructure, your compliance, and your tools.” For many organizations, adopting an integrated SaaS platform became the obvious path forward as remote and hybrid work began accelerating.</p><p>However, concerns and limitations around relying solely on centralized providers have started to emerge.</p> The Emergence of Distributed Collaboration <p>While centralized systems have become popular, some organizations are exploring alternative distributed frameworks for collaboration. According to Ian Tien, CEO of Mattermost, "The biggest one is, and I'm sure you see it all over the place is this: How do I take these new sorts of LLM AI models and use them to accelerate my work?"&nbsp;</p><p>Tien also states that "the core of it is that when you take the information, let's say, and just like your workplace communications, right, it's not that valuable."&nbsp;</p><p>However, he notes that aggregated data from collaboration tools can provide insights companies may want to keep private. Holochain and other distributed projects aim to give users more <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/what-is-digital-identity/">autonomy and control</a> over their information.</p><p>LLMs combined with generative AI harness enormous amounts of data. While the systems can’t understand data like a human can, they can still create generalizations based on the extremely large datasets.&nbsp;</p><p>If Slack were to implement an LLM model with generative AI, it’s unclear whether your data would be used in conjunction with other company’s data.&nbsp;</p><p>With distributed models, validation happens at the app level between users rather than via centralized consensus. This enables customized security policies tailored to specific collaboration use cases.</p><p>As remote and hybrid work expand, teams want the flexibility to collaborate effectively while maintaining autonomy over their systems and data. Distributed models provide an alternative approach with transparent peer-to-peer connections.</p> What the Future Holds <p>While centralized suites solved many early collaboration challenges, new needs are emerging around flexibility, transparency, and control. Ian Tien summarizes this well:</p><blockquote>"The future of digital collaboration will require increased transparency around data provenance and usage. How can we enable explainability around why systems make certain determinations? What audit trails exist to show the origins and lineage of data used for collaboration?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>“Users want more clarity not just on what algorithms decide but the underlying data and logic driving those decisions. As collaboration platforms leverage more AI and machine learning, robustly documenting data provenance will only grow in importance. Companies want to ensure they can control and account for how data gets managed in collaborative processes."</blockquote><p>Distributed collaboration frameworks like Holochain offer an alternative paradigm with direct peer-to-peer connections instead of intermediary servers. This agent-centric approach gives users autonomy while still enabling effective teamwork across organizations.</p><p>There are still challenges to making distributed collaboration <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/becoming-viable-seeds-to-saplings/">seamless and scalable</a> for the mainstream.&nbsp;</p><p>But with the right blend of usability, security, and customizable control, these emergent technologies could empower teams with a new generation of tools for digital teamwork. The ideal future likely incorporates both centralized and decentralized elements across hybrid technology stacks.</p>

				  Indicio Proven™&nbsp; now provides a privacy-preserving way to record, share, and verify educational achievements.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, Dec 5, 2023, <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the world’s leading world’s leading provider of digital trust solutions, today announced the addition of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-badges/">Open Badges</a> 3.0 digital credential format to Indicio Proven™, Indicio’s flagship product for creating and communicating verifiable data.</p>
<p>Open Badges is a powerful digital format for recording educational achievements, skills, and other accomplishments. Increasingly popular as a standard, Open Badges are shared on social media and stored and managed on third-party platforms.</p>
<p>The addition of Open Badges into Indicio Proven, the leading software for enterprise adoption of verifiable credentials, makes it possible for the badge to be directly held and controlled by the person who earned the achievement in a wallet on their mobile device instead of being forced to access their records through a third-party provider or platform.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven makes holding, sharing, and verifying an Open Badges credential truly portable. Now, anyone using the same open-source issuing software can create an Open Badges credential, anyone with the app can receive and share an Open Badges credential, and anyone with the verification software can verify the source and the integrity of the data in the Open Badges credential.</p>
<p>By removing the need for a centralized Open Badges Platform, users have control over their privacy, they can consent to share Open Badge data in secure, privacy-preserving ways, and they — and not the platform — fully own their Open Badges credentials. Indicio will be the first to use the new Open Badge verifiable credentials, issuing them&nbsp; to those who complete training and workshops in the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-academy/">Indicio Academy</a> training and workshops.</p>
<p>“Combining the Open Badges format with a verifiable credential releases its full power,” said Heather Dahl, CEO and co-founder of Indicio. “Similar to the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-digital-travel-credential-is-what-the-travel-industry-has-been-waiting-for/">Digital Travel Credential we developed on ICAO standards</a>, we’re creating simple ways for our customers to build seamless processes with verifiable data. The Open Badges format is a great way to share and verify detailed academic records and information about skill sets. But now we’ve freed Open Badges to be even greater — to take advantage of interoperable, open-source technology, to be used in faster, more private, and more secure ways, and, of course, to be a record of achievement that can be owned and verified forever.”</p>
<p>Technical details</p>
<p>Indicio’s unique approach combines open-source verifiable credentials based on the W3C Verifiable Credential Data and 1EdTech Open Badges 3.0 (OBv3) standards with open source technologies from Hyperledger Foundation. This enables people to hold the records of their educational achievements in a digital wallet under their own control in perpetuity. These JSON-LD based credentials can be used to easily share verifiable information on social media, when applying to a job online, or with any verifier using open source verifiable credential technology to read the badge.</p>
<p>Open Badges can be issued using Indicio Proven for a wide range of participatory, educational, and learning scenarios and can be verified by ACA-Py and AFJ based agents. Badge types include:</p>

<p>As another year draws to a close, it’s time to start thinking about what trends and challenges may face us in 2024. Next year promises to be a pivotal moment in the evolution of identity management and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). As we grapple with the challenges posed by sophisticated phishing attacks, deepfakes, and the ever-expanding influence of AI, the need for innovative solutions has never been more critical. This blog post explores the emerging trends that will shape the identity landscape, from identity inclusion and access movements to the intersection of AI and security.</p>
<p>Inclusion and Access: Bridging the Digital Divide</p>
<p>The fusion of our physical and digital lives requires a fundamental shift in how we approach identity. As we move toward a future where digital identity underpins social and economic mobility, the importance of inclusivity cannot be overstated. In 2024, there will be a heightened focus on ensuring secure and convenient identity verification, both online and in-person.</p>
<p>Regulatory Surge in the Cyber Risk Landscape</p>
<p>With the Biden administration’s landmark Executive Order setting new standards for AI safety and security, 2024 is poised to see a regulatory surge. Chief information security officers (CISOs) will need to prepare for continued AI regulation, new post-quantum guidance, and anticipated legislation around Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines. As guidance from governments increases, businesses must adapt their cybersecurity strategies to navigate a patchwork of regulations and ensure the security of customer data.</p>
<p>AI-Powered Phishing and the Banking Dilemma</p>
<p>The age-old threat of phishing takes on a new dimension in 2024 as AI-enabled phishing becomes more sophisticated and widespread. The financial industry faces a dual challenge with AI. While AI presents opportunities to enhance customer experience and reduce costs, it also intensifies the arms race with hackers. The scalability and effectiveness of AI-driven attacks means that financial institutions must continuously innovate their security and risk management strategies to ensure continued security to their most important assets: PII data and monetary instruments.</p>
<p>Post-Quantum Cryptography: A Looming Challenge</p>
<p>While post-quantum cryptography may not be a top priority for many CISOs today, its existential threat cannot be ignored. In 2024, businesses, especially in the banking sector, must upgrade their cryptography to post-quantum standards. The long data retention mandates in banking make it imperative to prepare for “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” quantum attacks (in which encrypted data that is stolen now could then be accessed once a suitably powerful quantum computer is available), even if quantum computers are not yet a reality. Failure to do so could have repercussions for decades to come.</p>
<p>Open Banking and the Cybersecurity Wild West</p>
<p>Open banking regulation is set to accelerate in the U.S., posing challenges and opportunities for financial institutions. While consumers seek convenience, banks must navigate the potential threat to direct customer relationships. The cybersecurity landscape will undergo growing pains as open APIs introduce new access points and players. Collaboration with regulators and fintechs, combined with advancements in identity verification, is crucial to ensuring the privacy and transparency of financial ecosystems.</p>
<p>Simplifying Tech Complexity for Enhanced Security</p>
<p>Banks face a growing challenge in managing the complexity of their tech stacks, particularly in the realm of identity verification. Fragmentation increases the risk of attacks, making it essential for institutions to consolidate vendors and streamline their ecosystems. Vendor consolidation not only adds an extra layer of protection against bad actors but also facilitates a more seamless experience for consumers.</p>
<p>Biometrics: Striking the Balance Between Security and Convenience</p>
<p>Advancements in biometrics offer a transformative solution to balancing security and convenience in the digital realm. Banks will increasingly use biometric technology, smartphones, and document recognition to enhance security measures. By adopting innovative solutions, institutions can create a system that deters fraud without frustrating users, providing a secure and user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>As we embark on the journey through 2024, the intersection of identity, AI, and cybersecurity will define the technological landscape. From changes in how we view identity to the regulatory surge in AI and the ongoing challenges of phishing and post-quantum cryptography, businesses and individuals alike must stay vigilant and adapt to these transformative trends. It’s a year of innovation, adaptation, and collaboration as we navigate the complexities of the digital age.</p>

 Introducing Multi-Party Approval for On-chain Agreements 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in November of 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Welcome to the November edition of the Product Newsletter, where we highlight the product team’s latest upgrades each month.</p>
<p>This month we are discussing the implementation of the multi-party approval feature, an enhancement of the already existing Conditional Transfer Feature.</p>
 We Upgraded The Conditional Transfer Feature 
<p>In our ongoing efforts to streamline and secure the movement of tokenized securities, we recognized a crucial need for our clients:&nbsp;a system that requires approvals from multiple parties before a transfer can proceed.</p>
<p>Our previous&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/security-tokens-conditional-transfer/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8COCRyIXJFk84a0AvtQsPi2B4w9GRwb6NUlUQ5AlZWZTu4ZrU5yaThZsOrBbLwo_YWYfAZ">conditional transfer feature</a>&nbsp;only allows issuers or agents to have one&nbsp;single-party approval. By adding the&nbsp;multi-party approval&nbsp;feature we create a flexible transfer approval process, catering to the diverse needs of our clients.</p>
 The Multi-Party Approval Transfer 
<p>Multi-party approval transfer elevates the transfer validation process by requiring multiple approvals.&nbsp;Issuers gain the flexibility to&nbsp;create custom approval workflows, tailoring the process to fit their specific transactional needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, as&nbsp;multi-party approvals are set up at the smart contract level, approvers have the freedom to choose their preferred wallet solution in order to approve or disapprove transactions, be it multisig wallets, self-hosted wallets, or hard drive wallets.</p>
<p>It’s designed to provide a&nbsp;unified, on-chain agreement signing process, which further streamlines operations, ensuring transparent and immutable recording of approvals on the blockchain. This feature aims to not only&nbsp;streamline the complex token transfer process&nbsp;but also&nbsp;enhance counterparty interactions&nbsp;in asset management.</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 How it Works: 
 
 Setting Up:&nbsp;Issuers, their agent, or equivalent set the rules for each multi-party approval transfer, including who needs to approve it and in any specified order.<br>
Types of approvers:<p></p>
 
 
 
 Recipient of the transfer 
 Custodians of the seller and the buyer 
 Any other approver the issuer or compliance agent wants to appoint 
 
 
 
 
 Initiating Transfer:&nbsp;When an investor requests a transfer, it’s held in a ‘pending’ state, awaiting approvals. 
 Multi-party Review:&nbsp;Issuers and appointed parties review and&nbsp;approve or disapprove&nbsp;the request. 
 Completion:&nbsp;Once all approvals are in place, the transfer is automatically executed, ensuring both security and efficiency. 
 
<p>Please contact us if you are interested in learning more or trying out this feature.</p>

   Background&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many customers face challenges in managing their Conditional Access (CA) policies. Over time, they accumulate more and more policies that are created ad-hoc to solve specific business scenarios, resulting in a loss of overview and increased troubleshooting efforts. Microsoft has provided <a href="https://aka.ms/ca-zt">guidance</a> on how to structure your Conditional Access policies in a way that follows the Zero Trust principles, using a persona-based approach.&nbsp;The guidance includes a set of Conditional Access policies that can serve as a starting point. These CA policies can be automated from a CI/CD pipeline using various tools. One such tool is Microsoft365DSC, an open-source tool developed by members of the Microsoft Graph Product Group, who are still actively involved in its maintenance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft365DSC can automate the configuration of various Microsoft 365 workloads, including Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access policies. The diagram below illustrates the role of Microsoft365DSC as a tool for automating Microsoft 365, complementing the automation of Azure that’s typically achieved using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and/or Bicep templates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has already been documented how you can use Microsoft365DSC to automate and maintain your Conditional Access policies. Two such sources are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://microsoft365dsc.com/user-guide/get-started/integrating-with-azure-devops/">Integrating with Azure DevOps</a>&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/ConditionalAccessGovernanceAndPrinciplesforZeroTrust%20October%202023.pdf">Github Conditional Access for Zero Trust Resources</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These solutions work, but they need to either use a self-hosted agent with a managed identity in Azure DevOps or use a shared secret, and neither of the two solutions are optimal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim at being able to do the automation from Azure DevOps using a Microsoft-managed agent for the CI/CD pipeline and no shared secrets. The introduction of Workload Identity Federation with Azure DevOps can help us do exactly that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting Started&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution we’re aiming at is depicted in the figure below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea is to have our CI/CD pipeline files hosted in the Azure DevOps repository and make values in an Azure Key Vault available in the pipeline based on configuring Workload Identity Federation between the Azure DevOps project and Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steps to do this are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Configure a service connection the Azure DevOps project settings as shown below</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recommended choice can be selected; however, it would automatically create a service principal in Entra ID with permission to the whole Azure subscription that you specify in the settings. To adhere to the principle of least privileged, we suggest using the manual configuration, which means that you manually create the service principal and only assign it permission to the Key Vault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Create an Entra ID App Registration using Federated credentials as shown below:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Add application permissions to the service principal for it to be able to create and update Conditional Access policies. Permissions may include: Policy.Read.All, Policy. ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess, Application,Read.All.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Create a Key Vault in a distinct resource group in an Azure subscription. This subscription should be specifically designed to manage sensitive identity-related workloads. Ideally, it should be located under the “Platform” management group within the “Identity” subscription, provided are adhering to the Enterprise Scale landing zone architecture as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/">documented here</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Create two certificates in the Key Vault, one certificate that will be used to sign Microsoft365 configurations and one that will be used to authenticate Microsoft365DSC tools to Entra ID. See below.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. In the Key Vault access control, assign M365DSCWorkloadIdentity the “Key Vault Secret User” role for it to be able to read secrets that you create.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you should have the basic prerequisites in place for you to create or change your CI/CD pipeline to take advantage of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline definition 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest using a multi-stage pipeline defined in an YML file in your repo, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/caautomationpipeline.yml">specified in this example YML file</a>. When utilizing Microsoft365DSC, the Conditional Access policies that we aim to configure or enforce within our Entra ID tenant should be clearly defined in our repository. Also, as a prerequisite, you need to configure the groups that you refer to in the Conditional Access policies definition either manually in the portal or using automation described in the referenced GitHub resource.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This information should be contained within a file, which could potentially be named ‘ConfigureCAPolicy.ps1’. The content for this file can be generated through various methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Create your Conditional Access policies in the Entra ID portal and use export-m365DSCConfiguration as documented here: <a href="https://microsoft365dsc.com/user-guide/get-started/snapshot-of-existing-tenant/">Taking a Snapshot of Existing Tenant - Microsoft365DSC - Your Cloud Configuration</a>.&nbsp; 
 Create it manually using any editor.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/ConfigureCApolicy.ps1">Here’s a sample of a Conditional Access policy</a>. You will notice that the file must define that we want to authenticate using the certificate. You can get a full list of the Conditional Access policies in Microsoft365DSC format based on the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/tree/main/ConditionalAccessSamplePolicies/Microsoft365DSCCAPolicies">persona-based approach configured for Zero Trust here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Build Stage 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pipeline for building the solution is divided into two scripts. First, we import the certificates from the Key Vault into the Windows based CI/CD pipeline agent and compile a Microsoft365DSC configuration file into a MOF file that is to be pushed to our Entra ID tenant in the deploy stage. The reason for having this is two scripts is just for ease of debugging. You may choose to combine them into <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/prep.ps1">one script as shown here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/build.ps1">second script here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Deploy stage&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now have our artifacts stored in Azure DevOps and would like to deploy them to our Entra ID tenant. This is done in the deploy stage where the deploy.ps1 is called. The content if <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/deploy.ps1">deploy.ps1 is located here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Final comments&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the information provided, you should now have a clear understanding of how to automate your Conditional Access policies within Entra ID and manage changes using Azure DevOps, all without the need to store shared secrets within Azure DevOps. We strongly recommend that you experiment with this process and utilize the resources mentioned in the article for more detailed information about the configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we primarily focus on implementing this process through Azure DevOps, it's important to note that GitHub Actions also supports Workload Identity Federation. This provides an alternative solution if you prefer GitHub over Azure DevOps.&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today’s interconnected digital landscape, where applications seamlessly integrate to enhance productivity, is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, information is more accessible than ever, requiring switching between apps and services, ostensibly increasing productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the importance of robust identity management cannot be overstated, and if you’re not careful you can lose track of who, what, and where you’ve authorized permissions — and with companies under 2,000 employees <a href="https://youtu.be/s149kAiuCns?t=44">averaging more than 73 SaaS app integrations in 2020</a>, it’s clearly a growing problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s crucial to recognize the potential risks associated with <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth (Open Authorization)</a> grants and how they impact your organization’s data security. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the intricacies of OAuth and shed light on the vulnerabilities that may lurk beneath the surface.</p>
 Broad OAuth access can mean identity sprawl 
<p>Many applications today build on top of each other, using the data from one to power the other. A common example is Google. Google is not one thing; it’s Gmail, Drive, Calendar, etc. And for each of these services, Google has a fine-grained API that engineers can use (usually read-only or read-write) to integrate with their products. OAuth is the standard authorization technology across services and is part of what makes an “interconnected” internet experience possible. For example, YeshID Onboard leverages OAuth APIs from Google, Slack, Zoom, and other platforms <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">to streamline identity management</a> for your organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the devil is in the details when it comes to OAuth scopes, which are the permissions granted to applications. An alarming aspect is the breadth of these scopes. Some vendors offer OAuth APIs in an all-or-nothing approach, which hampers the ability to employ least-privilege access principles. This contrasts with providers like Google Workspace, known for their granular scopes, allowing for more specific permissions like manipulating mailbox settings, accessing sensitive files, and even user impersonation. However, granularity does not inherently mean restraint; vendors may still request more permissions than necessary, increasing potential risks.</p>
<p>Complicating matters, the risk of data exposure and account takeover is substantial if an OAuth-integrated application is compromised. This situation is akin to any custodian acting on our behalf; the extent of the compromise is proportional to the level of trust and access we’ve granted. So understanding the granularity and necessity of OAuth scopes is crucial in safeguarding your organization’s sensitive information. It’s imperative to assess not just what permissions are possible, but also what permissions are truly necessary for the task at hand</p>
 OAuth can introduce unintentional vulnerabilities 
<p>One of the major risks lies in users granting OAuth access without fully comprehending the implications, which can lead to unintended vulnerabilities. Consider the scenario of a vulnerability in a <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism</a> that allowed unauthorized access using Google credentials. Users, in their quest for convenience, might inadvertently expose sensitive company data by granting access without due diligence.</p>
<p>The accidental use of work credentials in personal applications further exacerbates the problem. This unintentional mingling of professional and personal spheres can result in a breach of company data, underscoring the need for user education on OAuth access and permissions. Here’s an example of what you might wind up with.</p>
 Navigating OAuth security concerns 
<p>Enhancing the security of your accounts can be achieved by clearly understanding the difference between “session length” and “grant validity period.” In OAuth, permissions granted to applications often allow extended, but not indefinite, access to company data, raising potential security concerns. This issue becomes particularly critical when applications with extensive permissions retain this access for prolonged periods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mitigate risks like unauthorized access, data exposure, and account takeover, it’s essential for leaders to proactively manage and monitor these OAuth grants. Regular reviews and audits of the grant validity periods are key practices in ensuring these permissions are necessary and relevant, and in maintaining the overall security and integrity of your organization’s data. <br>
<br>
Here’s a look at the OAuth request lifecycle to illustrate the issue:</p>
<p></p>
<p>One way to do this is by <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en#zippy=%2Cgmail-high-risk-oauth-scopes%2Cdrive-high-risk-oauth-scopes">using your Google Workspace console</a> and navigating the following path: Security &gt; Access and Data &gt; API Controls &gt; Manage third party app access &gt; View list. There, you can view apps with access, revoke access if needed, and just get a general view of what’s going on in your app environment. Check out the video below, where I walk you through it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, you can also easily track this information with YeshID. Our intuitive dashboards present a comprehensive overview of app licenses, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions across different applications. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.</p>
<p>As leaders in the SMB space, it’s imperative to understand the intricacies of OAuth and its potential risks. By educating users, understanding OAuth scopes, and implementing security measures, SMBs can fortify their identity management practices, ensuring a robust defense against the evolving landscape of digital threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID is your partner in this effort, showcasing the identity sprawl within your organization and aiding in the vigilant management of OAuth access.

				 <p>In the inaugural episode of the <a href="https://untrustables.io/">(un)Trustables Podcast</a>, we delve into the fascinating landscape of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity (NDI) project. This groundbreaking initiative introduces Bhutan’s “edge wallet,” a highly secure mobile wallet designed to safeguard what Bhutan refers to as ‘foundational digital identity,’ the first verified credential issued to citizens.<br><a href="https://untrustables.simplecast.com/episodes/ep001-bhutan-has-launched-a-national-digital-identity-program">Listen to the full episode</a></p>
 The Birth of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity 
<p>Our conversation with Jacques Von Benecke, Chief Technology Officer at Druk Holding &amp; Investments, reveals the genesis of Bhutan’s NDI project. This audacious endeavour embodies the vision of Bhutan’s monarchy, aligning perfectly with the principles outlined in the SSI book by Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed. The aim is clear: to create a citizen-centric digital identity system that empowers individuals and streamlines their interactions with the government and private sector.</p>
 Building Blocks of a Bhutanese Digital Identity 
<p>Bhutan’s digital identity framework is a marvel of innovation. It includes unique identifiers, permanent and current addresses, and other critical data points that form the bedrock of citizens’ digital identities. Beyond foundational identity, the NDI opens the door to many use cases, spanning government services and commercial applications.</p>
 Empowering Bhutanese Citizens with Digital Convenience 
<p>The NDI project isn’t just about innovation; it’s about transforming the lives of Bhutanese citizens. It eliminates time-consuming journeys to government offices, saving citizens valuable time and resources. Even in remote areas, the NDI project enhances accessibility, simplifying processes with mobile solutions.</p>
 Drummond Reed’s Perspective on Bhutan’s SSI Journey 
<p>Renowned digital identity expert Drummond Reed shares his initial astonishment at the audacity of Bhutan’s plan to implement a self-sovereign identity (SSI) solution at the national level. He reflects on Bhutan’s forward-thinking approach and alignment with the SSI book’s principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We did research and then we read the SSI book which Drummond and Alex wrote, and we just felt so strongly that it’s exactly the vision of His Majesty, our King. We said, why don’t we just build the book? That was kind of our starting place. Since then, we embodied the principles. We really thought about what the idea of the book is and how it should benefit people. We wanted it to be very citizen-centric. – Jacques Von Benecke, Chief Technology Officer at Druk Holding &amp; Investments</p>
</blockquote>
 Crafting Legislation and Governance for Digital Trust 
<p>Translating the SSI book’s vision into tangible legislation was a crucial step. Jacques explains how this process, guided by Drummond Reed and informed by extensive consultation with experts, culminated in the unanimous passing of an Act in Bhutan’s parliament. This legislation ensures a citizen-centric approach to digital identity.</p>
 Building an Ecosystem for Digital Trust 
<p>Drummond underscores the importance of creating a comprehensive digital trust ecosystem involving various stakeholders. Bhutan’s NDI project serves as a blueprint for other nations seeking to embark on similar digital identity journeys, emphasizing the collaborative nature of such transformative endeavours.</p>
 Addressing Device Accessibility 
<p>Inclusivity is a priority for Bhutan’s NDI project. Jacques outlines Bhutan’s strategies to ensure device accessibility for all citizens, including a fund to provide devices to families without them. For those in remote areas without mobile coverage, a unique biometric verifiable credential bridges the digital divide, enabling access when they visit friends and family with smart devices.</p>
 Digital Horizons Unveiled 
<p>Bhutan’s NDI project is a testament to the transformative power of digital identity. It offers citizens convenience, efficiency, and accessibility while laying the foundation for a more connected and digitally empowered society.</p>
<p>As we conclude Episode 1 of the (un)Trustables Podcast, we invite you to stay tuned for future episodes where we continue to explore digital trust and transformation worldwide.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Earlier this year, Wenjing and I delved into the fascinating intersection of Digital Trust and Generative AI in an SSI Orbit podcast episode (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/digital-trust-in-the-age-of-generative-ai/">here</a>), which serves as an excellent primer on the subject for those unfamiliar with it. Since that episode, the landscape of generative AI solutions has undergone significant transformations, prompting us to record a follow-up discussion.</p>
<p>In this Part 2 episode, we were joined by Sankarshan, who co-chairs the ‘AI and Metaverse Task Force’ at the Trust over IP Foundation, alongside Wenjing. His insights added a valuable dimension to our conversation, particularly as we tackled prevalent misconceptions in the field of AI.</p>
<p>One key misconception we discussed is the belief that AI systems are purely statistical and random. We emphasized that, in reality, the world itself is inherently statistical, and AI systems are designed to mirror human decision-making processes, which are also based on statistical reasoning.</p>
<p>Another topic we explored is the common overestimation of AI’s logical reasoning capabilities and the underestimation of the constraints within AI systems. This discussion led us into the realm of AI governance. We debated the suitability of non-profit models for managing emerging technologies like AI, considering their capital-intensive nature and ongoing maturation. Examples like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/our-guide-to-openai-sam-altman-and-what-the-heck-happened-34da070b">OpenAI </a>and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-operating-costs/">Signal</a> were brought up to illustrate these points.</p>
<p>We aimed to focus part of the discussion on identifying practical solutions and low-hanging fruits for building digital trust tools. These tools are crucial for consumers to discern truth in an era increasingly dominated by generative AI-driven content. Additionally, we delved into strategies to mitigate and prevent the risks of AI abuse, especially as AI systems become more integrated with our daily lives.</p>
<p>A topic that resonated with me was the importance of provenance and authentication in AI systems, especially in content creation. We underscored the need for more robust tools to authenticate AI-generated content. However, we also acknowledged the limitations of current tools in ensuring provenance and their inability to address all security risks comprehensively.</p>
<p>Our discussion also touched upon the influence of human nature on AI development and governance. We pondered whether the current ideal-driven structures would evolve towards more traditional capitalist models, accompanied by regulation. This led to a broader conversation about the purpose of technology, which usually gets categorized as ‘a benefit to mankind’ by its creators. Yet, the complexity of implementing this ideal becomes apparent when considering who should govern these technologies and how they should be regulated.</p>
<p>This podcast episode not only sheds light on the complexities of digital trust in the age of AI but also opens up avenues for further exploration and discussion. As we move towards 2024, these conversations are more relevant than ever, guiding us towards a future where technology is both a tool for advancement and a subject of thoughtful governance.</p>
 
 
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Wenjing, Sankarshan and myself in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 OpenAI Drama – Discussion about the recent OpenAI drama, including Sam Altman’s firing and rehiring, and Microsoft’s involvement. 
 AI Governance and AI Misconceptions – Why we should focus on AI governance rather than getting caught up in daily news and doom scenarios. Discussion about misconceptions in AI, specifically statistical and computational misconceptions. Exploring practical solutions for digital trust in AI. 
 Provenance and Authentication in AI – The importance of provenance in AI applications, such as robotics or content creation. Challenges in authentication and the need for stronger solutions. The applicability of these solutions across various domains. 
 Content Authenticity – Defining content authenticity and its governance. The distinction between machine-generated and human-verified content. 
 Digital Trust and Content Authenticity – Discussing digital trust in the context of AI. Separating protocols from end-user platforms. The role of content authenticity in digital trust. Examples of current approaches to content authenticity on the internet. 
 Truth and Trust Registries – Human pursuit of truth and the influence of context and consumption. The role of trust registries in providing inputs for trust decisions. The need for widespread inputs to aid in making trust decisions.

Aussie Innovators Join Forces to Tokenize $100T+ Assets with End to End Solution for Tokenization<p>In an exciting new partnership, <a href="https://www.redbelly.network/">Redbelly Network</a> and <a href="http://verida.io">Verida</a>, two prominent Australian web3 infrastructure projects, have joined forces to tackle the challenge of tokenizing and managing high-value real-world assets within regulated markets. Amid the plethora of choices in the web3 technology landscape, Verida and Redbelly aim to stand out by providing integrated end-to-end solutions that prioritize ease of use, and regulatory compliance, while offering control and security for&nbsp;users.</p> The Complexity of Real World Asset Tokenization <p>Real-world assets (RWAs) encompass a broad spectrum of tangible and intangible assets, including but not limited to real estate, commodities, intellectual property, and financial instruments. These assets, which are collectively valued at <a href="https://www.redbelly.network/blog/solving-a-trillion-dollar-problem-with-a-ground-breaking-australian-solution">over $100 trillion</a>, have long faced challenges in terms of liquidity, divisibility, and accessibility. Traditional methods of managing and transferring these assets often involve extensive paperwork, intermediaries, and protracted settlement times. The lack of standardized and efficient systems for tokenizing RWAs has hindered their liquidity and the ability to efficiently leverage their&nbsp;value.</p> Redbelly: Bridging Real-World Regulation with Web3 Efficiency <p><a href="http://redbelly.network">Redbelly Network</a>, a layer 1 blockchain born from the <a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/csiro-and-the-university-of-sydneys-red-belly-blockchain-breaks-new-ground-for-speed-20180913-h15byh">University of Sydney and CSIRO</a>, stands as the world’s first formally verified blockchain protocol. As a regulatory-compliant solution, Layer 1 identity verification is integrated into the network infrastructure to ensure verified digital wallets and accountability across all operations on the network. Redbelly Network’s <a href="https://www.redbelly.network/compliant-asset-tokenisation">Compliant Asset Tokenization</a> solution serves as a bridge between the regulated economy and the web3 economy, ensuring accountability, scalability, and&nbsp;security</p>Redbelly Network’s <a href="https://www.redbelly.network/compliant-asset-tokenisation">Compliant Asset Tokenization</a> Solution Verida: Empowering Users with Data Self-Sovereignty <p><a href="http://verida.io">Verida</a>, an Australian-founded technology business, empowers users with data self-sovereignty, allowing customers to take control of their personal data.

We are incredibly excited about what we can achieve with the team at Redbelly, as our combined solution can rapidly unlock many use cases, driving down costs and increasing efficiency across all real-world assets, while keeping the user in control.”</blockquote><p>As both projects approach their mainnet launch, this partnership has the potential to transform the landscape of tokenized real-world assets in Australia and beyond, exemplifying the power of blockchain technology in solving real-world challenges and advancing the global web3&nbsp;economy.</p> About Redbelly <p>Redbelly Network’s Compliant Asset Tokenization solution serves as a bridge between the regulated economy and the web3 economy, ensuring accountability, scalability, and security.

<p>As part of ongoing support, we are releasing two service patches against SSO 9.2 and SSO 9.3. Found within both of these patches are several corrections against SAML authentication-related issues. The SAML authentication issue has existed for a number of years, but was uncovered with improvements to SSO cacheing performed in SSO 9.2. Specifically, the Microsoft service SignIn with SAML, has permitted non-uniqued entityIDs to exist. Our improvement to caching uncovered this potential minor configuration issue, which is fully corrected in the patches.</p>

<p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) is stepping up its game in the crypto space. With its <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Consultations/2024/Consultation%20on%20Guidelines%20on%20preventing%20the%20abuse%20of%20funds%20and%20certain%20crypto-assets%20transfers%20for%20ML-TF%20%28Travel%20rule%20Guidelines%29/1063898/Consultation%20paper%20on%20draft%20travel%20rule%20Guidelines%20under%20Regulation%20%28EU%29%202023_1113.pdf">new Regulation (EU) 2023/1113</a>, open for feedback until February 26, 2024, the EBA is extending its regulatory reach, which initially kicked off in 2015, to include certain crypto-assets. This move is all about getting a better handle on tracing crypto transactions and reducing risks like money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>Here’s what’s on the&nbsp;table:</p><p>Filling in the Blanks: The guidelines zoom in on spotting and fixing missing or incomplete info in crypto transactions.</p><p>Tailored Procedures: They’re setting up ways to deal with transfers that are missing key&nbsp;details.</p><p>Risk-Based Approach: This is a big one. The guidelines give Payment Service Providers (PSPs), their intermediaries, and Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) some room to align their compliance efforts with their operational scale and risk exposure.</p><p>In this article, we dive into these guidelines, explore how they might impact various players in the crypto scene, and see how they stack up against broader EU regulations and global standards.</p> Breaking Down the New&nbsp;Rules <p>The EBA isn’t just throwing rules at the wall to see what sticks. They’ve thought this through, addressing complex tech issues&nbsp;like:</p>  Figuring out if a card or device is just for buying goods and services.  Handling tech limitations in the transfer&nbsp;process.  Dealing with different tech protocols and their compatibility (or lack thereof).  Pinpointing the exact info needed for a crypto transfer.  Managing self-hosted wallets.  Laying out duties for different PSPs in direct debit transfers.   Impact Analysis: What Does This Mean for&nbsp;Crypto? <p>If the proposed guidelines become official, the workload for Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) is set to increase dramatically.</p><p>To illustrate, under the new regulations, CASPs will have to dive deeper into data collection. This includes classifying customer transactions by the types of goods or services, identifying the nature of the transaction — whether it’s for personal or business purposes, and scrutinizing transaction patterns to figure out the reasons behind payments and receipts.</p><p>The complexity doesn’t end there. CASPs must navigate the diverse protocols in the crypto and blockchain arena — some are open-network, some are closed-network, and others don’t favor any particular network. Not all of these protocols work well together, so CASPs will find themselves juggling multiple protocols to facilitate smooth transactions with each party involved. This juggling act is crucial to meet the EBA’s Travel Rule requirements, which aim to prevent data integration snags and compliance slip-ups.</p><p>Moreover, CASPs are expected to up their game in ensuring seamless and compatible information transfer in line with the heightened data requirements. They’ll need to accurately convey extensive details, including names, addresses, countries, personal document numbers, customer IDs, and even birth dates and places of the parties in the transaction.</p><p>The scenario gets even more intricate with self-hosted wallets. Previously, CASPs only needed to record wallet addresses and verify ownership for transactions above 1,000 Euros. Now, they have to individually track each transfer, whether it’s to or from a self-hosted wallet, identify the parties involved, prove ownership, and implement necessary safeguards.</p><p>Overall, CASPs are looking at a significant ramp-up in responsibilities. This necessitates more advanced technological solutions and a more thorough approach to gathering and transmitting information. They’ll have to be extra vigilant in their operations, as every aspect will demand closer attention. These enhanced obligations could lead to higher compliance costs and potential delays, especially initially due to the complexity and newness of these requirements.</p> Impact on Crypto Transactions Between an EU and non-EU Crypto&nbsp;Firm <p>Under the potential new rules, non-EU parties involved in transactions with EU-based counterparts would face broader data disclosure requirements.</p><p>This involves providing basic location information like the country name, postal codes, cities, states, provinces, and even down to the level of municipalities, street names, building numbers, and&nbsp;names.</p><p>In instances where the provided name, account number, address, and other official documents don’t clearly identify the parties involved, an extra layer of information would be necessary. This means that Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) would also need to gather and disclose personal details like the date and place of birth of the individuals participating in the transaction.</p><p>So, any non-EU crypto firms doing business with EU counterparts will need to be ready to share a lot more&nbsp;data.</p> Final Thoughts <p>As we’re in the consultation phase, it’s a waiting game to see if these guidelines strike the right balance between tight security and fostering innovation in blockchain technology. For now, it’s a matter of watching and waiting as the situation unfolds.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Keeping up with the latest security challenges can feel like you are running a race that has endless hurdles. From rapid advancements in technology – rendering old hardware obsolete – to increasingly stringent requirements and regulations, the time and costs can quickly become enormous.</p>
<p>Many of these challenges are related to the migration of compute, storage, and backup services to cloud services. Picture this, you have moved your databases to the cloud. But are you in control of your encryption keys? Do you know who has a copy or could access a copy?</p>
<p>Today’s solutions offer your organization a choice of how to most effectively secure your encryption keys. You can select a solution that allows your organization to secure your keys in an on-premise HSM or one that allows your organization to protect your keys via a secure connection to a cloud-based HSM with an HSM-as-a-Service (HSMaaS) offering such as Entrust’s nShield-as-a-Service solution.</p>
<p>Entrust recently partnered with TechValidate to conduct a survey to understand how companies view and are implementing HSMaaS solutions.</p>
<p>From On-Premise to the Cloud</p>
<p>For years, the best practice was to use an HSM deployed on-premise. Concerns about security of software based key storage, separation of keys, and sovereignty requirements made it the only viable option. Over time, as-a-service HSM offerings appeared in the market offering lower costs, and a level of security comparable to on-premise HSMs, with more flexibility and quicker implementation.</p>
<p>The Survey Says</p>
<p>Today’s organizations are looking to save time and money. The survey showed that 57% of organizations said a key reason for considering subscribing to an HSMaaS offering is to reduce IT management costs. Further, 69% of respondents said that their organizations would realize reduced spend on physical infrastructure. The next closest benefit noted was improved efficiency with 46% of the respondents selecting that benefit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The focus on saving time and reducing expenses has also been a significant driver of cloud adoption. With the rise of cloud service providers, as-a-service-HSM offerings evolved even further. Leading cloud service providers offer their own unique approach to securing your encryption keys. While these offerings provide convenience and cost-effective solutions, they do not always meet internal security requirements set by some organizations adding further to the complexity involved when deciding how to store your encryption keys.</p>
<p>In addition to saving time and money, HSMaaS solutions like Entrust nShield-as-a-Service provide the same level of support for a wide range of applications. This is something that was also reflected in the survey results. Respondents indicated that once onboarded, they would leverage an HSMaaS solution for a variety of functions.</p>
<p>The top functions ranked were public key infrastructure (PKI), which was mentioned by 60% of respondents followed by key management which was selected by 57% of respondents. Data encryption/decryption and digital signatures were also mentioned by nearly half of the respondents (49%). These results reinforce the similarities in functionality between on-premise HSM and HSMaaS offerings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Important Cloud Key Management Considerations</p>
<p>Saving time and money are necessary criteria when considering implementing an HSMaaS solution. However, they are not the only considerations you should have when deciding what as-a-service HSM offering to use when storing your encryption keys. It is important to also consider:</p>
 
 Security – Make sure you understand how the HSMaaS offering works. Are you sharing the cloud-based HSM with other users or is it for your exclusive use? This is often referred to as single-tenancy vs multi-tenancy. You must ensure that you chose the right solution to match your risk profile and requirements. 
 Sovereignty of keys. Can the HSMaaS provider guarantee what country or region your keys will physically stored in? Will you be compliant with the regulations affecting your organization? 
 Integrations and the compatibility of the key management software with other vendors. Does it integrate with the other products and services used by your organization? 
 Ease of comprehensive key management for the entire organization. Does the solution give you the ability to rotate, generate, discard, and easily access information required during an audit? 
 
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>When evaluating these considerations and HSMaaS solutions, partnering with a company that understands your holistic security and encryption needs will simplify this process. While cost is always a driving factor, ensuring you are in control of your keys is the most important. Ensuring where your keys are stored for key sovereignty requirements, the available integrations and the key management capabilities need to be carefully reviewed. The right keys need to be stored in the right places, using a solution that will protect your business and significantly enhance your organization’s security.</p>

<p>With credential stuffing attacks on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/">23andMe</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/no-okta-senior-management-not-an-errant-employee-caused-you-to-get-hacked/">Okta</a> just the latest breaches to make headlines in recent weeks, the push for biometrics-based authentication is gaining momentum for Identity and Access Management (IAM).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem: Biometrics aren’t all created equal. Yes, device-based biometrics such as Touch ID, Face ID, and Windows Hello can help reduce the threat of password-based account takeover (ATO). But they can still leave IT guessing about the identity behind the device. While hardware tokens and Apple, Microsoft and Google’s decision to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/google-makes-passkeys-the-default-sign-in-method-for-all-users/">passkeys the default</a> for logins are also helpful, they really only confirm possession of a device or biometric and assume (but don’t validate) identity. Thankfully, it doesn’t have to be this way—if you have the right IAM architecture.</p>
 IAM More Than Just a Device: Enabling F-Word Free Authentication&nbsp; 
<p>Whether it’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/public-schools-in-denver-colorado-hit-with-breach-fingerprint-scans-grabbed">fingerprints</a> or <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/heres-the-newest-camera-hack-fraudsters-are-using-to-beat-facial-recognition">facial recognition</a>, that which is stored can be stolen or spoofed by cybercriminals to infiltrate corporate systems. Hell, even without a hack, traditional forms of biometric authentication only confirm the person accessing an account is the same person who initially enrolled to do so—but not whether that person is really who they claim to be. This matters when enrollment fraud leads to more than <a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/javelins-identity-fraud-study-highlights-the-changing-nature-of-fraud/">$3.2 billion</a> in losses annually. For me, “fraud” is an f-word that typically leads to others we could all do without. That’s where 1Kosmos comes in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Identity-Backed Biometrics &amp; Modern IAM Architectures 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we saw the urgency of finding a way to easily and accurately verify and authenticate identity in a way that can’t be vouched for by mere password, one-time passcode, or a static (and spoofable) biometric. That’s why we set out to modernize IAM by combining strong identity verification and authentication within a unified architecture. One that offers unrivaled identity assurance behind each device used to access online services, along with a seamless account enrollment and authentication experience. In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">Part One</a> of this series, we provided an overview of this architecture and the pillars it’s built upon. In this post, let’s double-click on a core pillar: <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">biometric-based user authentication.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">1Kosmos architecture</a> employs automated, digitally verified identity to confirm user claims and credentials with 99.6% accuracy, stores them under user control, and binds them to an identity wallet and biometric with liveness detection. This gives IT the security and control they need while providing users with a seamless login experience. The benefits are threefold:&nbsp;</p>
<p>High Assurance</p>
<p>Biometrics verified through liveness testing deliver the highest digital identity assurance possible and enable fast, frictionless multi-factor authentication. When matched to a verified identity, they eliminate fraudulent identities hiding behind valid credentials.</p>
<p>User Convenience</p>
<p>Physical attributes used for biometric authentication are not vulnerable to damage and unexpected alterations. They provide quick, user-friendly authentication with or without passwords.</p>
<p>Flexible Use Cases</p>
<p>Whether the use case demands a fingerprint, voice match, a live biometric or other identifier, the 1Kosmos architecture provides affordable authenticators that adjust to varied and evolving business needs.</p>
 Building Bulletproof Biometric Authentication 
<p>We didn’t just follow the most effective approach to identity-backed biometric authentication. We defined it. 1Kosmos offers the only IAM architecture built with four crucial elements of identity-backed biometric authentication:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certification to FIDO2, NIST 800-63-3 and UKDIATF Standards</p>
<p>Our BlockID platform is certified to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO</a>, <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-registry/trust-status-list/#full-services">NIST</a> and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/kitcp-06-01-certificate-1kosmos/">UKDIATF</a> standards, having undergone rigorous testing to verify quality coding and ensure the use of common devices to authenticate users. When combined with a verified identity, you’re talking about unmatched security and convenience. BlockID supports USB keys, keycard authentication, fingerprint readers, and hardware tokens and provides a robust framework to implement or augment passwordless authentication without being forced into using a single provider. With identity-backed biometrics, you also benefit from stronger security using physical traits. Think fingerprint scan with a USB security key or FIDO-compliant facial recognition, for instance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>iBeta Certified Biometrics</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, biometrics can improve security by replacing or augmenting the use of passwords, but they can also be subject to theft or spoofing. iBeta is an independent, NIST-accredited biometrics testing lab that has developed certification programs to verify biometric applications to recognized standards to prevent these things from happening. When enrolling with our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID</a> solution, the user can perform an advanced form of biometrics called a liveness test that prevents false facial verification using a photo, video, mask, or other substitute for an authorized user’s face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biometric Encryption</p>
<p><a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/12/what-is-biometric-encryption/">Biometric encryption</a> leverages a biometric template and public-private key pair to encrypt and decrypt personally identifiable information for authenticating a user and sharing data with an online service. This approach relies on the uniqueness of biometrics to ensure that hackers can’t reverse-engineer a password or key. Without the biometric and matching private key, all data in the digital wallet isn’t accessible, usable, or even legible. There’s no central storage of user biometrics, ensuring these biometrics remain private. Biometric authentication is easy to use and requires little, if any, user training.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flexible Levels of Identity Assurance</p>
<p>With BlockID, you determine the type of biometric appropriate for a given application and the level of identity assurance appropriate to the business risk. For <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/customer-onboarding-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/know-your-business-compliance-guide/">Know Your Business</a> (KYB) standards, Identity Assurance Level 2 can be achieved using <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/live-id/">LiveID</a> and identity verification using government-issued credentials, such as a driver’s license or passport. A liveness test confirms a user’s facial match to the enrolled biometric and verified documents in real-time.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Lesser forms of identity assurance can be achieved using information from banking, telco, or corporate databases or through “inferred” identity based on access to an email address or logged-in device, as appropriate for the intended use. For additional use cases, 1Kosmos can also verify a user’s social security number (SSN) against the SSA, a driver’s license against the American Association of Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), a passport against ICAO or the US Department of State, or verify a user is indeed a physician by validating their NPIN (National Physician Information Number).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As documentation and accounts are enrolled, the location and phone number are verified against the issuing authority. The user’s LiveID scan is then validated against the picture extracted from the documentation. Once complete, their biometrics are captured, and the data is encrypted with the user’s private key and stored within a private and permissioned blockchain.</p>
<p>An Unbeatable Advantage&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Part Three, we’ll drill down on another core pillar of the 1Kosmos architecture: decentralized digital identity and how it provides users with secure anytime, anywhere access to ID cards, driver licenses, social security details, and more through a reusable identity wallet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
